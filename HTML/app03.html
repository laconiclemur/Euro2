<p class="noindent">You will need very little in the way of special equipment to make Spanish dishes at home. There are, however, a few indispensable items. Here are the essentials.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>MORTAR AND PESTLE:</strong></span> Nothing releases the flavors of aromatic ingredients—garlic, spices, herbs, nuts—better than an old-fashioned mortar and pestle. Spanish cooks use their <em>morteros</em> constantly: for pulverizing saffron or nuts, for emulsifying sauces, such as <em>allioli</em> and <em>romesco,</em> for making <em>picadas</em> and <em>majados</em> (pounded mixtures added to dishes at the last minute to enliven their flavor). The ceramic yellow and green Spanish mortars with wooden pestles are pretty to look at, but I prefer a sturdier mortar and a heavier pestle. Marble is my favorite; granite and stoneware are also good options. Mortars are carried by most good kitchenware stores as well as many ethnic groceries.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>MINI FOOD PROCESSOR:</strong></span> For pounding a quantity of ingredients too large for a mortar but too small for a regular food processor, a mini food processor is indispensable. These are also useful for mincing such ingredients as parsley and garlic. Cuisinart is a good brand.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>CAZUELA:</strong></span> Brown earthenware <em>cazuelas,</em> glazed on the inside, have been used in Spanish cooking for centuries and remain a most popular kitchen item. <em>Cazuelas</em> are available at stores specializing in Spanish products (see “<a class="nounder" href="app04.html#app04">Sources</a>,”) and at some kitchenware shops. They come in many different sizes; if you only buy one, I recommend a round one that’s 12 to 13 inches in diameter. Before using a <em>cazuela</em> for the first time, soak it in cold water overnight, then dry it thoroughly. When a <em>cazuela</em> is properly treated it can be used both in the oven and on a stove top, and it is very attractive for presenting at table. To prevent cracking, don’t put a <em>cazuela</em> over a high flame; heat it gradually and avoid sudden changes in temperature.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>PAELLA PANS:</strong></span> A paella is not really a paella unless it’s made in a paella pan. Available at many cookware shops, paella pans come in a variety of sizes. The most useful is about 16 inches in diameter. Thin carbon-steel pans are best. To prevent rusting, dry the paella pan <em>thoroughly</em> after washing it and always rub it lightly with olive oil. If the pan does rust, just rub the rust off with steel wool. (For more about paella pans, see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_336">page 336</a>.)</p>
