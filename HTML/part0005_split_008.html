			<p class="rec-intro">Saffron milk-cap mushrooms can be found in pine forests in autumn. They’re not good to eat raw as they have a bitter taste, but this disappears when they are cooked. Check them over for any grit and pine needles, then trim them with a knife. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 free-range chicken supremes, with wing tips and skin</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">80g butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">450g saffron milk-cap mushrooms</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 shallots, peeled and finely sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">75ml good-quality dark rum</p>

			<p class="body">Season the chicken supremes. Heat a little oil and half the butter in a thick-based pan and cook the chicken, skin-side down, over a medium to high heat until the skin is golden. Lower the heat and turn the chicken over to cook on the other side. </p>
			<p class="body">Plunge the mushrooms into salted, boiling water for 1 minute, then drain in a colander and pat dry with a cloth. Cut them into small pieces.</p>
			<p class="body">When the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and trim the wing tips. Discard the fat from the pan, then add the remaining butter and cook the mushrooms and shallots until golden brown. Pour in the rum, boil for 1 minute, then add the crème fraiche and check the seasoning. Boil for 2 minutes, then serve immediately with the chicken breasts.</p>
			<p class="body">A word of warning – never eat wild mushrooms that you have gathered without being absolutely sure what they are and that they are edible. </p>
