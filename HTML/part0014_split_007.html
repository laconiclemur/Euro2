  <h3 class="h3a">Spiced chocolate treat</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This nutty and spicy dense chocolate sweet treat originates from the province of Ferrara in Emilia-Romagna. The name <em class="calibre4">pampapato</em> means ‘bread of the pope’ because it was traditionally made in monasteries and convents and is shaped like the cap worn by the pope. Very simple to make, it is slow-baked at a low temperature. It is best made a couple of days before consuming. It is quite rich, so cut into thin slices when serving. Actually, it makes a nice energy snack when you’re on the go and in need of a boost.</p>
