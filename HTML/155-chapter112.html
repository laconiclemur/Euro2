<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">My sister-in-law, Rosa María, and her husband, Ramón, have the old summer house that his grandfather built in the Pre-Pyrenees mountains back in the early 1900s and christened Torre del Bosc. <em>Torre</em> is a way of referring to a country house in Catalan, but the word also means “tower,” perhaps a more fitting description of its towering stories and sharply peaked slate roof that reaches up 72 feet/22 m.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     There are a dozen rooms, including a cavernous kitchen lined with the original okra- and azure-hued ceramic wall tiles. The original woodstove is still there, too, with a makeshift pair of butane-driven burners sitting on top of it. With these, Rosa María regularly cooks for two dozen of us when the family gathers for Easter, someone’s birthday, or a special anniversary. This dish is one of my favorites of her many stews that she prepares when my wife and kids and I go to spend a long weekend there.</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 WHOLE CLEANED RABBIT, ABOUT 2½&gt; POUNDS/1.2 KG, LIVER RESERVED</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>4 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>3 GARLIC CLOVES, PEELED</li>
<li>1 ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>2 RIPE TOMATOES, PEELED, SEEDED, AND FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>2 CARROTS, CUT INTO ¼-INCH-/½&gt;-CM-THICK ROUNDS</li>
<li>1 BAY LEAF</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML DRY WHITE WINE</li>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML CHICKEN STOCK <a href="238-chapter174.html#page_336">(PAGE 336)</a> OR WATER</li>
<li>8 TOASTED ALMONDS WITHOUT SKINS</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON MINCED FRESH FLAT-LEAF PARSLEY</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Cut the rabbit into eight or nine pieces, following the directions on <a href="254-chapter190.html#page_342">page 342</a> (or have your butcher do it). Trim any excess fat. Season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela or heavy casserole, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the rabbit along with its liver. Cook until the liver is cooked through and the other pieces are browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic to the cazuela and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove and reserve. Prepare a sofrito with the onion and tomatoes, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. Return the rabbit (except the liver) to the pan. Turn the rabbit over to coat well with sofrito. Add the carrots and bay leaf, cover with the wine and stock, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, and stir from time to time, gently cooking by just letting bubbles slowly break the surface, for 1 hour or until the rabbit is tender. Stir in water if needed to keep the sauce moist.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Meanwhile, prepare a picada with the reserved garlic, the liver, the almonds, parsley, and 2 tablespoons of simmering liquid from the cazuela, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Stir the picada into the cazuela and cook for a final 10 minutes. Serve from the cazuela.</p>
