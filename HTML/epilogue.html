<p class="noindent"><span class="big">I</span>t is barely fifty degrees outside, but in the kitchen Emma Leftick is sweating. As she wraps shallow bowls of béarnaise custard in plastic, she glances repeatedly at the clock overhead. A cook asks for her help, and she stops what she is doing to flip quickly through a binder and locate a recipe for him. Soon she is poking nervously at the custards again. Once service begins, however, she is calm and controlled. As orders start to come in, she acknowledges each one, then turns to begin deftly putting together the delicate plates. She picks up a pair of surgical tweezers to place a few fragile leaves around a thin swath of raw salmon, then turns to reach up and brown thick slices of brioche under the salamander. It’s a familiar gesture for her, the upward reach followed by a quick rise on her toes to see if the product is warming properly; she did it nightly for months on end, heating strawberries stuffed with wasabi, taking the chill off the artichoke roses. But this time when an order comes, she no longer answers, <span class="txit">“Oído.”</span> Instead, when her chef, Corey Lee, calls, “Two salmon, two monk,” she answers in kind. “Two salmon, two monk.”</p>
<p class="indent">While she was at elBulli, Emma was one of the least contented stagiaires. Before arriving, she had worked at the French Laundry, a restaurant that she loved and that had left her with the same dedication to exactitude for which Thomas Keller is known for. “If you can’t find the time to do it right, when will you find the time to do it again?” she once <a id="page_264"/>wrote on her Facebook page, and the sentiment summed up her general attitude toward cooking. Asked what most impressed them about elBulli, the other stagiaires would invariably say, “The organization.” But Emma disagreed. “Nothing is ever where it’s supposed to be,” she said one day back in July. “It’s called mise en place for a reason.” The comparative laxness wasn’t the only thing that bothered her. Emma also disliked Ferran’s relationship with his chefs and the fact that the stagiaires weren’t necessarily exposed to everything going on in the kitchen; unlike at the Laundry, which draws up a curriculum for its apprentices, station assignments at elBulli were random, and a stagiaire might spend six months at the restaurant without ever learning, say, to spherify. Emma herself had never rotated through <span class="txit">cuarto frio</span> (that would have been awkward in any case, since she was dating its chef de partie), which meant that she never had the chance to work with some of the restaurant’s most daring techniques. As late as October she complained, “I came here without any experience in molecular gastronomy, and I still feel like I don’t have any.” She was bored half the time and annoyed at not being given more responsibility. Sometimes she wondered why she had come.</p>
<p class="indent">To keep her mind occupied while she peeled pistachios or dipped rose petals at elBulli, Emma used to daydream about San Francisco: she would picture herself walking down the street, on her way to work in the new restaurant that Lee (her former chef de cuisine at the French Laundry) would be opening. Now that she is doing just that and Lee’s Benu is the hottest debut of the 2010 season, she is mostly happy—both with her work (she runs <span class="txit">garde-manger</span>) and her new boss, with whom she has a close, if still deferential, relationship. But in the process of leaving Spain, getting a visa to work in the United States, breaking up with her boyfriend, Aitor, and helping to open the new restaurant, something has changed: Emma no longer looks at her time at elBulli with the same sense of frustration as before. “Just being in such a different environment and a legendary restaurant will always stay with me,” she says. “The food really is mind-blowing, and there really is no other place like elBulli. I came back with so much more than what I arrived with.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_265"/>Although Emma would confess that she felt a lot of stress during Benu’s opening night (she was responsible for twelve dishes, and the béchamel custards weren’t coming out right), she moved efficiently through the gleaming new kitchen, making none of the superfluous motions that betray a novice. Watching her, it was hard not to think that she was more assured, more skilled even, than just a year ago. Like almost everyone who spends time there, Emma had been changed by elBulli.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Once an ambitious young cook would go to France for his <span class="txit">stages</span> and then return home to begin laboring as a line cook in someone else’s restaurant. But now that France is no longer the sole locus of serious cuisine, the whole world has opened up, and a chef in training may well choose to keep moving. These days, the young cooks of the world are a truly international class, traveling from country to country, restaurant to restaurant, in search of the newest technique, the most exciting kitchen, the best education, or, more practically, the highest-paying job. They meet, form friendships over work, then separate, only to run into each other again later in another kitchen in another place.</p>
<p class="indent">A year after they first came together in the glaring sunlight of Roses’ boardwalk, elBulli’s 2009 stagiaires have scattered back around the globe. Jorge Puerta, still bearing the scars of his hot oil burn, spent the first few months after the season ended helping his fellow stagiaire Txema Llamosas convert his parents’ traditional restaurant in the Basque Country into something more modern (complete with airs and liquid nitrogen on the menu). He then left to work at a resort in St. Barts before returning home to Caracas, where, together with his brother, he opened a gastrobar called Caviar. Txema, meanwhile, had bought a new space where he hoped to branch out on his own within a couple of years. Mizuho Nakamura, who had surprised everyone when she came in third at the ICEX competition, was back in Japan working at the highly acclaimed Ryugin in Tokyo but was also busy drawing up plans to open a Japanese tearoom—“I want it to be REAL Japanese,” <a id="page_266"/>she wrote, “though with plated desserts”—in Barcelona or New York. After he left elBulli, Frederico Ribeiro went to work for William Hickox, whom he had met earlier when the two <span class="txit">staged</span> together at Martín Berasategui in San Sebastián. Hickox had recently opened a Scottish gastropub called Highlands in New York’s West Village, and Frederico soon worked his way up to executive sous chef. Less than a year later, he would help oversee the opening of Hickox’s second restaurant, Mary Queen of Scots, before leaving to take a job at the esteemed Per Se. Diego Corrado—the one Ferran referred to as “Messi”—was in Mexico City, advising a restaurant group. Sunny Jin was offered a position in New York but couldn’t convince his wife to move there on a sous chef’s salary; instead they went to Newberg, Oregon, where he became executive chef at Jory, a restaurant in the Allison Inn that was soon earning great reviews. César Bermúdez, the pastry cook, spent several months working at a hotel in Lugano, Switzerland, then a year at a resort in Monaco. In October 2011, he was making plans to move to Los Angeles, where he had just secured a job at the SLS Hotel, home to José Andrés’s restaurant Bazaar. Luca Balboni had returned to his family and girlfriend in Modena, Italy, and was running a catering company. When he wasn’t consulting for restaurants in his native Galicia, Spain, Mike Álvarez was traveling around South America, learning about new products. And Perfecto, who had dropped out of his <span class="txit">stage</span> so early in the season to help Julian Serrano open his restaurant in Las Vegas? Perfecto quickly learned that he hated Vegas and moved to San Francisco instead, where he found work as chef de cuisine at the well-established restaurant Campton Place. But he didn’t stay long; within a few months, he was working at Eric Ripert’s four-star restaurant Le Bernardin, in New York. There too, he soon grew tired of the conditions—in that case, he says, it was the cold that bothered him—and, at the suggestion of a friend, put in a call to the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Los Angeles. “I called them up and said, ‘If you want a good chef, someone who can make the restaurant run well, you should hire me,’” Perfecto recalls. He spent several months there as executive chef, and even got to prepare breakfast for Barack Obama when the president visited. But by 2011 he <a id="page_267"/>had left that job too, after being recruited by Los Angeles restaurateur Michael Cardenas for a new project.</p>
<p class="indent">Three of the 2009 stagiaires stayed at elBulli, returning for the 2010 season as chefs de partie; they would still be working there when the restaurant closed for good on July 30, 2011. Antonio Romero, who used to daydream at the center table about his nights out on the town, took over the meat station; Jacobo Astray, after spending the off-season working at Albert Adria’s tapas bar Inopia, returned to oversee <span class="txit">cuarto frio.</span> And Roger Alcaraz, who struggled so hard in 2009 to master the demands and stress of being chef de partie when he was promoted to it as a stagiaire, was now running Starters II with the confidence of a veteran. The three of them were supposed to have been joined by two other repeaters. But Javi Izquierdo, who had made such a point of saying he didn’t like elBulli’s food, had apparently decided he didn’t like preparing it either. And Gaël Vuilloud, who earlier in the year had been so excited to be returning to the restaurant where he had had to cut his <span class="txit">stage</span> short, had also changed his mind. In his case, his enthusiasm for working at elBulli was tempered when he learned that those hired for the 2010 season would also be expected to stay on for 2011, now that the two seasons would be running back-to-back. “It’s one thing to be away from my job and my girlfriend for six months,” he said. “But twelve? And for twelve hundred euros a month? I don’t see how anyone who isn’t from the area can do it.”</p>
<p class="indent">A similar concern with finances led Kim and Dan to briefly consider taking jobs in Las Vegas. Prior to their <span class="txit">stage,</span> they had spent six months on the ICEX program, earning nothing while they slowly ate through their savings. “We need to make some money,” Kim said as the season came to an end. “And that’s a good place for it.” But however much they could justify the move as an opportunity to work in some creative places (they were especially interested in the casual place that Pierre Gagnaire was opening), they still felt sheepish about considering Vegas, as if they were selling out the training they had just completed. In the end, they got lucky and avoided the possibility: each got a job in Napa Valley, Kim as sous chef at Meadowood and Dan as pastry sous chef at the French Laundry. For Kim, the new position was both daunting—she quickly <a id="page_268"/>had to learn to break down a pig, for example—and exciting, not least because Meadowood would earn its third Michelin star in October 2010. She especially liked the fact that the restaurant grew most of its own produce. “To go out first thing in the morning, when there’s still mist on the fields and pick the vegetables you’re going to be cooking with that day—there’s nothing better than that,” she said. They were both working five days a week, but most of the time their days off didn’t coincide, so they saw each other only briefly in the morning before Kim left to start her shift or late at night when they both arrived home. Sometimes they had to rely on Facebook to communicate with each other.</p>
<p class="indent">As much as she had resisted leaving Europe, Andrea found herself surprisingly happy in Singapore. She became a line cook at the Michelin-starred Iggy’s, the same place where her husband, Andrés, was working as pastry chef. She liked her bosses there and had enough responsibility and independence to feel that she was growing in the job. She had also begun to understand Andrés’s love of Asia, and together they were considering staying there for an extended period of time. But in August 2010, their relationship took an abrupt turn for the worse, and soon Andrea was on a plane home to Colombia, where she would try to figure out her next step. “You think I felt lost when elBulli was about to end?” she wrote. “That was a joke compared to this. But one thing is for certain. <small>I WILL BE COOKING.”</small> Sure enough, she was. By October, she had secured a position as line cook at noma, though visa issues prevented her from taking it immediately. While she waited, she moved back to Chicago, where she changed her mind about pastry and took a job as dessert chef at a new gourmet takeout spot called Real Kitchen.</p>
<p class="indent">For his part, Luke was still in Korea, waiting for the visa to come through that would allow him to return to Spain and take up the job that Andoni Luis Aduriz had promised him at Mugaritz. As for Katie, she received an abrupt education in the vagaries of starting a restaurant from scratch. When she began her <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli in June 2009, she had confidently predicted that the new place she would run with her parents, Ted and Liz, and her boyfriend, Felix, would be up and running by the spring of 2010. In fact, although her parents lived in New York <a id="page_269"/>and Felix in Los Angeles, they had all chosen to move to Asheville, North Carolina, in part because they believed the city’s relative smallness and laid-back charm would diminish the hassles involved in buying property and starting a new business. But deals on the first two potential locations fell through, and it was only in June 2010 that they were able to close on a property: a former shop, perfectly located on Asheville’s main street. They would have to put in a kitchen, and between problems with designers and the difficulties involved in meeting building standards, they still hadn’t begun construction in August. Without money to support themselves, Katie and Felix were living with her parents, and although the house was beautiful and fairly ample, the close proximity, Felix admitted, “had caused some tensions.” Samples of dishware lay stacked in the basement, and with no kitchen in the restaurant yet, Katie had to do all the recipe development at home. But they had found a talented Spanish sous chef who was looking for a way to move to the United States and were hopeful that they could find their place in the Asheville market. Katie had abandoned her earlier idea of cooking avant-garde cuisine and instead decided to specialize in straightforward Spanish food. They had also settled on a name for their new locale: Cúrate, which they thought worked nicely in both English (curate) and Spanish (heal yourself). Katie hoped they would be open by the end of the year. It would take a bit longer than even that protracted date, but by March 2011, Cúrate was up and running. Within months, the restaurant was packed, and Katie’s cooking, as well as Félix’s hospitality, was earning raves. The couple managed to find their own house to rent but were so busy that they hadn’t had time to plan their wedding.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the stagiaires, then, had already received the most immediate benefit of a stint at elBulli—they had gone on to good jobs, and their reputations would continue to reap the benefit of their association with the restaurant for as long as they remained in the field. Katie put it best: “I feel like, having been through elBulli, I’m on the fast track now.”</p>
<p class="indent">But what else? Did they get what they had come for? Even before a year had passed since the end of their <span class="txit">stages,</span> many of the former apprentices were able to reflect on the less tangible impacts those months at elBulli <a id="page_270"/>had had. For the few who had arrived with little experience, the <span class="txit">stage</span> had been their first trial by fire. Asked what the experience meant to him, Sergi Palacín, the young cook with the nipple ring, proudly recalls what Oriol said to him on his last day: You came here as a boy, but you left as a chef. “And that,” says Sergi, “pretty much defines my time in Roses.”</p>
<p class="indent">Others learned what they did not want to do. Cesare Marazzi, one of the three stagiaires who had left elBulli just weeks into his <span class="txit">stage,</span> had taken a position as chef de cuisine in a small inn in the Italian Alps, where foragers brought him wild mushrooms they had collected that morning in the woods and shepherds brought their homemade cheeses. “When I tell people about dishes like the Easter Egg that I made at elBulli and how I had to use a syringe to fill a balloon with coconut milk and blow it up, then spin it in liquid nitrogen,” he recalls, “they look at me like I was crazy. But I learned that a kitchen as frenetic as that is not for me and that I want to work in a more relaxed way.” Nico, who had gone on to <span class="txit">stage</span> first at the Alicia Foundation and then at Paco Roncero’s Terraza del Casino in Madrid, was still ruffled by the way he had been treated. But he was trying to make peace with it. “That the experience only lasts six months, and after that you can’t continue to be bitter,” he says. “In the future, I want the option to keep working in a place.”</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the stagiaires garnered positive lessons they expected to use in the future. Those were less about individual dishes—for all of elBulli’s fame as a place of spectacular techniques, few of the stagiaires felt changed by the methods they had acquired—than about overarching structures and approaches to food. “Organization,” responded at least a dozen of the apprentices when asked what they would take with them. Despite the difficulties many of them had had in forging themselves into a machine, most had come to see a certain beauty in elBulli’s form of production. Daniel, who, among all the stagiaires, had secured one of the more prestigious jobs as pastry sous chef at the French Laundry, was especially thoughtful. “The organization of European restaurants is different than restaurants in America,” he said. “Here we breed the individual, there they breed the team. Believe it or not, I actually miss elBulli.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_271"/>Others were left with a new sense of their own abilities. Andrea, once so cautious in the kitchen, was astonished to find herself inventing new dishes—dishes good enough to make it onto Iggy’s menu. “Three or four of them,” she says with wonder in her voice. “They’re on the menu now. If before elBulli you had told me I would be creative in that way, I never would have believed you.” Meanwhile Luke, though still enamored of great chefs, had come to think of his discipleship as a discrete period of time—one it might be time to leave behind. “I think I’m ready for a real job, not a <span class="txit">stage,</span>” he says. “A real job with pay.”</p>
<p class="indent">Katie still didn’t have full confidence in her abilities. Asked where she’d like to be in fifteen years, she answers, “I’d like to be comfortable calling myself a chef.” But she has come a long way. “I learned about endurance, I learned to work with other people, and I learned what makes a great dish,” she says. “I’ll never forget Mateu telling me not to get too complicated—include only one element in a dish that’s surprising, and leave the rest alone.“ She pauses and gestures toward the empty storefront that will, one day soon, house her first restaurant. “I know I wouldn’t be here without my experience at elBulli. It made me feel like I can do anything.”</p>
<p class="indent">Font of approval and disciplined object of a quest; source of nurture and a staging ground for artistry; a place to prove oneself and make oneself stand out—food became all this, to differing degrees, for the stagiaires of the 2009 season. And there was one other thing that nearly all took with them: gratitude for elBulli’s family meals. “Those were the best staff meals of anyplace I’ve staged,” says Nico, who has staged in quite a few. Emma agrees. “Those noodles? The food was so good!” she gushes. “If I learned one thing, it’s the difference a good family meal can make.” She wasn’t telling Ferran anything he didn’t already know. In the fall of 2011 he published recipes from that meticulous blue binder in a book called <span class="txit">The Family Meal</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">The stagiaires weren’t the only ones changed by the 2009 season. Ferran may have known even before the season opened that he would <a id="page_272"/>be reinventing elBulli, but it wasn’t until he was halfway through the season that the reinvention began to take concrete shape. Indeed, when he finally announced at Madrid Fusion that he would be closing the restaurant and reopening it two years later as a foundation, it quickly became clear that many of the crucial details had yet to be hammered out. He initially referred to the future enterprise as an “academy,” which had many media outlets running stories about how he was going to open a cooking school. But what Ferran had in mind was closer to a think tank. “This is about creativity more than cooking,” he said. “We’re not going to be teaching anyone how to break down a cod.”</p>
<p class="indent">The main question on everyone’s mind remained unresolved: would there be anything to eat? Ferran was adamant that elBulli would no longer be a restaurant, but he was just as clear that it would still feed people. What he and Juli hadn’t figured out yet was how. They briefly entertained the idea of only opening for charity events, before Ferran remembered that he really wanted some form of feedback for the research that was under way. He thought of opening for a couple months each year and offering limited dinners that would allow invitees to sample the fruits of the fellows’ research, but that, he thought, might seem too much like the present elBulli. He thought about inviting just a single table each night but worried that that would be too elitist. He thought of inviting the press to impromptu tastings and of opening for breakfast. For a while, he was certain that the foundation would serve roughly sixty meals a year in the formal style of, well, a restaurant, but that too seems to have come up for revision. These days, Ferran will say only that they won’t decide for sure until 2013.</p>
<p class="indent">Many other pieces of the plan have fallen into place, however. The foundation will award fellowships annually to twenty or so young cooks so that they can spend a year working with elBulli’s permanent staff (most of whom have been invited to stay on), investigating new techniques and developing new flavors. Discussions led by prominent visiting chefs and leaders in the worlds of art and design will complement their research. Each year, the foundation will release a book and video that catalogue that year’s discoveries, and every night, it <a id="page_273"/>will post the results of that day’s experiments online. To accommodate these new endeavors, elBulli will expand its physical structure. Although the sleek kitchen and homely dining room will remain untouched, spectacular new buildings in vaguely organic shapes will house an archive, brainstorming rooms, offices, and meeting space. Designed by avant-garde architect Enric Ruiz-Geli, the structure will also be environmentally sound and produce zero carbon emissions. All this with a very specific goal in mind: “Our dream,” says Ferran, “is that each year, we’ll turn out one or two chefs who will be extremely important for the future of cuisine.”</p>
<p class="indent">Once he and Juli decided on a closing date for the restaurant—they would run the two remaining seasons back-to-back, so that the final service fell on July 30, 2011—Ferran began to percolate with ideas. The foundation will have its own garden and a museum. It will press its own oil. The experimental kitchen will be open to any chef who wants to use it; if Grant Achatz and Andoni Aduriz want to come, they are invited to take any ideas they discover there and apply them at home. They will start a social network too and launch a kind of world creativity team that will travel the globe, spreading ideas. And they will keep coming up with more ideas, Ferran announced in October 2011, by traveling around to elite schools (the first tour consisted of the business schools at ESADE in Barcelona, the London School of Economics, Berkeley, Harvard, and Columbia) and challenging students and professors to imagine them. “I don’t have money to give away,” says Ferran. “But I can give away what I do have, which is my creativity.”</p>
<p class="indent">That creativity is not confined to the foundation. Ferran and his brother Albert opened a new tapas bar in Barcelona, called Tickets, that combined the delicious food and conviviality of Inopia with the creativity of elBulli and a circuslike theatricality (the host wears a ringmaster’s coat). The Harvard course ran for a second year, and there is talk of turning it into a permanent collaboration. Governments and corporations alike are approaching Ferran with offers of sponsorships and requests for projects he would like to launch. There are also simpler goals: to spend more time with his family, to be able to travel for pleasure with his wife, <a id="page_274"/>Isabel. “You know what else I’m going to do with the time off?” he says one day. “I’m going to learn English.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is one other change as well. For all the care it takes in documenting its creations, elBulli has never kept very close track of the individuals who have come through its kitchen. Certainly the staff knows and maintains regular contact with the Spanish cooks who worked for years as employees, just as they certainly know which cooks have gone on to make big names for themselves. But the rest? The hundreds, if not thousands, of former apprentices who might today be running their own restaurants or toiling in someone else’s in Boston or Bangkok or Brussels? Asked for a list of stagiaires from even five years ago, Marc was at a loss—he simply didn’t compile that kind of information. But now there are signs that Ferran is beginning to think differently. In the summer of 2010, elBulli posted a notice on its website, asking former stagiaires to send the restaurant details of their careers to date for a database it plans to compile.</p>
<p class="indent">As the restaurant neared its final service, Ferran began to adjust his understanding of his contribution to culinary history. Until then he always thought it lay in the techniques he had invented and even more in the philosophy—that freedom—that guided him. But maybe, he started to see, his true legacy lay with the people he trained who had, in turn, helped make elBulli so very exceptional. Perhaps it lay with is stagiaires.</p>
<p class="indent">On elBulli’s last day, a handful of former stagiaires came to commemorate the restaurant’s passing. René Redzepi, Massimo Bottura, Grant Achatz, José Andrés, Andoni Aduriz: they were older now, and famous in their own right. But that night they donned the same blue aprons as before and set to work turning out elBulli’s last dishes. And once all the diners had departed, they, the starstruck young cooks who had just finished their <span class="txit">stages</span>, and Ferran himself danced with joyful abandon beneath Cala Montjoi’s night sky.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">On opening night of the 2010 season, I went back to elBulli. By then the closing date had already been set, and the new group of stagiaires had been <a id="page_275"/>invited to work the two back-to-back seasons. Some had declined the offer, but most had not, and so the young men and women working tensely at the center table that night comprised elBulli’s last real batch of stagiaires. As I stood there watching, I was struck by an overwhelming sense of déjà vu: clearly, I had been here before. There was Eugeni, snapping at one stagiaire for overloading a tray he was carrying to the <span class="txit">plonge,</span> and there was Eduard, instructing another in the finer points of sweeping. At the center table, the ingredients and faces had changed, but the actions remained the same, right down to the collective flinch that went down the line when, at exactly 7:30 <small>P.M.</small>, Ferran said, “<span class="txit">Señores,</span> let’s begin.”</p>
<p class="indent">But there was one noticeable difference. The stagiaires were as nervous as ever, fumbling into one another as they awkwardly tried, on this first night, to figure out where they should be. But the permanent crew, from Ferran on down, were noticeably calmer. Ferran shouted at the kitchen to quiet down a few times, but otherwise he was in a jovial mood. Oriol and Eduard were also relaxed, even managing to smile at each other even when a stagiaire did a particularly stupid thing. As I watched the customers come into the kitchen, table by table, and watched Ferran greet them warmly (the first table of the night was American; once again, the last was Ansón and his family), I was reminded of a night a few months earlier when I was in London, attending the awards ceremony of the S.Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants. As the announcer reached the final two places on the list, a gasp went through the room: for the first time in four years, elBulli had fallen to second place, beat out of the top slot by noma. As René Redzepi and his crew joyfully took the stage to receive the award, a food journalist seated next to me asked me how I thought Ferran had taken the news. “I think there’s some nostalgia there,” I answered. “But mostly, I think he’s delighted.” It was true. I had seen Ferran earlier in the day, soon after he’d learned the results, and instead of disappointed, he’d seemed absolutely ebullient. I commented on his surprising response to his wife, Isabel. “Don’t you see?” she asked. “He’s been set free.”</p>
<p class="indent">Ezra Pound, he of the “Make it new!” dictum, also wrote, “The artist is always beginning.” In the twenty-five years that he has been at elBulli, <a id="page_276"/>Ferran has had innumerable beginnings. There are the actual ones: the ones that the arrival of each year’s new batch of apprentice cooks mark. There are historical ones: the time they stopped serving two meals a day, the time they invented foam. And then there is the beginning that Ferran himself represents, the one that guarantees his place in the history of cuisine and that, not incidentally, explains why so many young cooks want to learn from him, and why so many who have had that opportunity go on to share his passion. The beginning that says: food can be whatever you imagine it to be.</p>
<p class="indent">A friend once said to me that a truly great restaurant is always about something more than what it serves. ElBulli is about change.</p>
