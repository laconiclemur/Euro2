<p class="noinden7"><i>Thin, crisp, and traditionally a welcome Christmas cookie.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg149_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">9 oz. (¼ kg.) syrup, Golden Lyle</p>
<p class="noindent6"> 1/8 tsp. nutmeg, freshly grated</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 1/3 cups (3 ¼ dl) sugar </p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. anise </p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ cup (½ dl) butter, melted</p>
<p class="noindent6"> ½ tsp. baking soda </p>
<p class="noindent6">2/3 cup (1 ½ dl) whipping cream </p>
<p class="noindent6">1 qt. (liter)  flour, approx. </p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. pepper </p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. ginger</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg149_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent5">Decoration: </p>
<p class="noindent6">Almonds, scalded </p>
<p class="noindent6">Egg white</p>
<p class="noindent2">Warm the syrup, sugar, and butter in a heavy sauce pan. Cool and add most of the cream, leaving out 2 tablespoons. Blend spices with half of the  flour and add to the mixture. Stir the baking soda into the 2 tablespoons of cream and add with the remaining  flour to the cookies. You do not want the dough to be too dry; it is therefore advisable to leave out a little  flour that may be added if needed. Work the dough well and leave refrigerated until the next day. On a lightly  floured surface, roll out very thin, a portion at the time, and cut into diamond shapes with a fluted pastry wheel. Gently press half of a scalded almond in the center and brush with egg white. Bake at 355–365°F (180–185°C) for 5–6 minutes. Watch carefully as they will burn easily.</p>

<p class="noinden7"><i>An old, traditional, superb tasting cookie, better known on the farms than in the cities. Yet now it has become quite popular all around.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg149_03.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Stabel means “pile” or “stack.” They are served by placing two cookies a few inches apart, with the <a id="page_150"/>next two crossing, ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) from the ends of the first two. Continue stacking until you reach the desired height.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients: </p>
<p class="noindent6">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 1/3 cups (1 ¼ dl) sugar </p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. whipping cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 1/8 cups (250 g.) butter, softened </p>
<p class="noindent6">3 ½–3 7/8 cups (500 g.)  flour, approx. </p>

<p class="noindent6">4 egg whites, beaten</p>
<p class="noindent2">Beat the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the whipping cream. Mix the grated lemon peel with  flour and add to the mixture alternately with the soft butter. Mix fully. Let the dough rest 1 hour. On a lightly- floured surface roll out a thin dough (many say the thickness of a blade of straw), and cut out lengths 6×1 inch (15×3 cm). Grease or cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper and bake the cookies in the middle of the oven at 355°F (180°C) for 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Almond meringue:</b> Grind the almonds twice, the second time with the confectioners’ sugar. Add the lemon peel and egg whites and mix well. Add the almond meringue in a stripe down the center of the cookie. The meringue swells so do not put it all the way to the edge. Return to the oven to dry at 160°F (70°C), leaving the oven door ajar. The cookies are finished when the meringue is set yet still white.</p>

Combine the egg yolks with the vanilla extract if used, and fold into the beaten egg white. Blend with the  flour mixture then work with your fingers until well mixed.Do not overwork the dough; this will cause the cookies to lose some of their crispness. Shape the dough into 1-inch (2 ½-cm) balls. Place on a well-greased cookie sheet, and press down with a fork in a crisscross pattern. Brush with the remaining slightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with chopped almonds and pearl sugar; press the garnish lightly into the cookies so they do not fall off.

<p class="noindent2">They keep for six months in a freezer or airtight container. You do need a rosette iron, now available in most stores that carry kitchen utensils. Look for the ones that have two rosette molds; it will cut your baking time in half.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 eggs </p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ½ cups (3 ½ dl) flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. sugar</p>

<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">Safflower oil</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. cardamom</p>
<p class="noindent2">Beat the eggs lightly. Add the sugar, salt, and cardamom to the  flour and mix well. Add to the eggs alternately with milk and mix thoroughly. The batter should be like thick cream. It may be made the night before and refrigerated. Or allow the batter to stand 30 minutes to alleviate air bubbles. Use an electric controlled pan. Heat the oil to 365°F (185°C) before dipping the iron in the oil for 10 seconds (making sure the pan is deep enough to allow the mold to be completely submerged). Drain slightly on paper towels. Keep the temperature between 350–375°F (175–190°C). Dip the hot iron into the batter, being careful not to get the batter on top of the rim; it will make it impossible to remove the rosette. Submerge in the heated oil thoroughly, covering the mold, and cook until lightly browned. If the rosette does not leave the iron when cooked, release it with a fork. Drain well before storing. Serve plain or sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar.</p>

<p class="noinden7"><i>Linser bring back memories of many special family get-togethers at Nesodden. If you do not have heart shaped linse pans, muffin pans may be substituted. </i></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ cup (170 g.) butter</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 ½ tbsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent5">Custard Cream:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) milk or coffee cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 vanilla bean, cut lengthwise</p>
<p class="noindent6">4 egg yolks</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ cup (½ dl) sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. cornstarch</p>
<p class="noindent2"><b>Custard Cream:</b> In a heavy pan make the custard by bringing the milk and the vanilla bean to a boil and let simmer 10 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean. Beat the eggs and sugar until of <i>eggedosis</i> consistency (light and fluffy). While stirring, add spoonfuls of the boiling milk to the egg mixture. Place it all, with the cornstarch, back into the pan over moderate heat, stirring constantly until thickened. It must not boil. Cool in cold water.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><b>Pastry:</b> Blend the butter into the  flour with a pastry blender, or with your finger tips, until it resembles small peas. Add sugar and egg yolks and work together quickly into a soft dough. Form into a ball and chill. Roll out  of the pastry and line a greased <i>linse</i> pans, preferably heart-shaped. Divide the filling equally among the lined pans. Roll out the remaining pastry and lay over the filling, using unbeaten egg white on the edges as a binding agent and pressing gently around the edges. Place on a cookie sheet and bake at 400°F (205°C) for approx. 15 minutes or until golden. Cool a few minutes before carefully removing from the pans, as they are quite fragile. These tartlets are usually frosted with sugar glaze or sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar.</p>

<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Waffles (Vafler)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Norwegians love waffles! They bake the waffles in heart-shaped cast iron waffle irons. You can use an electric iron, but some of us, spellbound by the traditional heart-shaped irons, believe, foolishly maybe, that Norwegian waffles, to taste their best, must be baked in the heart-shaped irons.</i></p>
<p class="image1">
<img alt="image" src="../images/pg158_03.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Cakes and waffles baked in cast iron forms are among the oldest kind of Norwegian cakes. Some of the cake irons have been found with runic writings on them. The oldest waffle irons made one heart-shaped or square waffle. Later, three hearts in the same iron were popular. The heart-shaped waffle iron in use today traditionally has five hearts.</p>
<p class="indent">Waffles may be enjoyed in the morning, at lunch time, or in the evening. They are great when unexpected guests come to your door because, generally, we all have the simple ingredients on hand. And it is a comfort to know that something so flavorful does not cost much.</p>
<p class="indent">There are innumerable recipes for waffles in Norway—inexpensive and healthy low-fat ones, ones made with barley  flour, and those without butter and cream. Crisp delectable ones are high in calories but nevertheless irresistible. Try delicious waffles made with yeast as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Some waffles you can serve with a variety of sandwich meats; others, you can make into cream cakes or serve them with ice cream and berries. Or maybe you still prefer the more traditional way: buttered and sprinkled with sugar, or topped with a thick slice of sweet Norwegian goat cheese or a spoonful of your favorite berry jam.</p>
<p class="indent">In earlier times <i>hverdagsvafler</i>, everyday waffles, were made with barley  flour (now available at natural food stores). For guests, the more refined  flour was used with the addition of sour cream. The most commonly-used waffle had a rather firm texture containing no egg, yeast, or baking powder, but <a id="page_159"/>boasted of better keeping qualities. The fancier waffle had fresh milk, cream, sour cream, butter, and sugar added, which made a thicker and superior textured product. Try several of these waffle recipes, and maybe, just maybe, you too will become an avid fan of the Norwegian waffles.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Cake Waffles (Sprø vafler)</span></p>
<p class="noindent7"><i>These delicious waffles have no wheat  flour. They are at their very best when eaten warm. Marvelous topped with ice cream, sour cream, or whipped cream and topped with fruit spreads. </i></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">4 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 ¾ cups (500 g.) potato starch flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 1/8 cups (250 g.) sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 tsp. baking powder</p>
<p class="noindent6">1	1/8 cups (250 g.) butter, melted</p>
<p class="noindent2">Beat the eggs and sugar till light and fluffy. Melt butter, cool slightly, and add to the egg mixture. Mix the potato starch  flour and baking powder and add. The batter will be rather firm. If you are using a non-electric heart-shaped, Norwegian waffle iron, it is ready for baking when it is so hot that a drop of water splatters when flipped across its surface. Lightly butter its surface before the first waffle only. Bake a small test waffle. Drop the batter by a topped tablespoonful onto the iron and close tightly. Bake until golden and crisp.</p>

<p class="noinden7"><i>If you are not in a hurry, these low-fat waffles are incredibly delicious. The batter must be allowed to rise ¾ of an hour. If they are baked too soon they will become too hard. </i></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>

<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) water</p>
<p class="noindent6">2–3 tbsp. sugar</p>

<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. active dry yeast</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. margarine, melted</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 ¼ cups (5 ½ dl) flour, approx.</p>
<p class="noindent2"><a id="page_160"/>Beat the eggs with the sugar until light and fluffy, 7–10 minutes. Add the milk and melted and cooled margarine. Stir yeast into a little sour cream, and add with ½ cup milk. Add enough  flour to make the batter a proper consistency—not too thin. Stir until well blended. Set aside to rise ¾ of an hour until bubbles form. Grease the iron well. Follow the baking directions for Cake Waffles (p. 159). Serve with butter and jam. These waffles taste just as good the next day if kept in an airtight plastic bag. They will lose their flavor somewhat if frozen.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Lemon Waffles (Vafler med sitronsmak)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>A rather unusual flavor, but delicious served hot or cold. </i></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">5 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. lemon peel, freshly grated</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ cup (½ dl) sugar</p>

<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ cup (½ dl) butter, melted</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. lemon juice, fresh</p>
<p class="noindent2">Beat the eggs and sugar until thick and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Alternately fold in the  flour, which has been sifted with the lemon peel, and sour cream. Stir in the butter and lemon juice. Set batter aside to rest 10–15 minutes. Heat a heart-shaped waffle iron. It is hot enough when drops of water sprinkled on its surface sputter. Pour approximately ¾ cup batter in the center of the iron. Lower the cover and bake until the steaming stops, 30–60 seconds on each side. Do not peek during the baking period.</p>
