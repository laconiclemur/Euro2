<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red"><em>Ajillo</em> essentially means a sauce made with garlic and other ingredients—but garlic is the key and dominating flavor. That is the case here, though in this classic tapa, there is usually a red chile, too, a tiny ½&gt;-inch-/1.25-cm- long one called a <em>guindilla</em> or <em>bicho</em> (literally “bug”). Use fresh shrimp if possible, as frozen sweat too much water while cooking and finish with a blander texture. Serve with plenty of country-style bread or baguette to dip into the flavorful oil.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     If you have heatproof <em>cazuelitas</em> (small round terra-cotta casserole dishes), prepare the servings individually in the dishes by dividing the ingredients among them.</span></strong></p>
