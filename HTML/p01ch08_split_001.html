<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ peasant food }</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">The real food of Spain was always the food of the peasantry, the</span> campesinos. Until the mid-twentieth century, eighty percent of the population lived and worked on land owned by big landowners, for the most part the Church and the nobility. Nowadays, eighty percent lives in towns and cities. Mechanized farming methods changed the old ways in the countryside, and people left the land to work in tourist industries. Supermarkets and exporters offer such a low price for agricultural produce that it is no longer worth farming in a small way and producing a variety of crops.</p>
<p class="para">Agriculture has become specialized and industrialized, and it is immigrants now—mostly North Africans, but also Latin Americans and East Europeans—who are the seasonal agricultural laborers. Huge areas concentrate on a single crop, such as grapes in Castile and olives in Andalusia. Foreigners are buying up the small farmhouses and cottages. Along the coasts, those who had a bit of land sold it to contractors who built golf courses, hotels, and holiday homes for tourists. Anybody who had a little plot by the sea could become a millionaire. (In the past, when families divided up their land, the eldest son would get the field; any land on the coast was not valued and was given to a daughter or the least-loved child.)</p>
<p class="para">Though few Spaniards want to work the land today, they still love the land. Families keep old farmsteads as holiday retreats, where they have vegetable gardens and fruit trees. In towns and villages, they keep allotments—small plots they lease at a low rent from local authorities to grow vegetables and herbs. People are sentimental about the human landscape of the land, the traditional rural life that disappeared so quickly, in just a few decades. And the foods associated with that life, including those once shunned as “poor foods,” are very popular today—that is, except with the young, who, as someone said, have gone from “poor foods” to fast foods.</p>
<p class="para">In Spain, there was no middling landowning subsistence peasantry as there was in France. Peasant life and conditions varied from one region to another, but the overwhelming mass of the peasant population was poorly paid salaried laborers. The rest, small tenant farmers, were obliged by the old sharecropping system inherited from feudal times, which remained in effect until the 1950s, to pay crippling rents, sometimes in kind with much of the produce they grew, to their landlords and to do unpaid work for them. In return, they were allowed to cultivate a portion of the estate for their own benefit. In the distant past, the peasantry had also borne the burden of constant warfare in the form of taxation to fund those wars and were expected as well to go to war with their warlords.</p>
<p class="para">In Andalusia, the peasantry was composed mostly of <span class="italic">jornaleros,</span> day laborers, who contracted for seasonal work by the day. In the north, especially in Galicia and Asturias, there were small proprietors and peasant farmers living on estates as sharecroppers. They handed over animals and crops to their landlords in lieu of rent, leaving little for themselves. Their smallholdings could barely support one family, and younger siblings had to emigrate to Latin America and Europe in search of a living. In Catalonia and the Basque Country, there were some well-to-do farmers who paid rent and debts of allegiance to the lords of their lands. By the nineteenth century, landlords in those parts were sometimes city merchants or industrialists who had invested their newfound wealth in land because there was more status in owning land than in trade or industry.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p074.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">The peasants ate what they grew. They grew grains and legumes for their landlords, to be dried and sold at the market or exported. They grew vegetables for their own use in the small private patches they kept. Beans and vegetables from the New World revolutionized the peasant diet centuries before they were adopted by the Spanish middle and upper classes, who viewed foods such as potatoes and vegetables as fit only for coarse palates. Potatoes, corn, and beans from the Americas replaced the grains and chestnuts that had been the mainstays of the peasantry. They used tomatoes and chiles as condiments and developed a predilection for dried and pulverized chiles, <span class="italic">pimentón,</span> both sweet and hot, which they sprinkled on almost everything. As early as 1560, there was scarcely a vegetable garden that did not have chiles.</p>
<p class="para">The peasants kept chickens for their eggs, which they used to make dishes such as <span class="italic">tortillas</span> and to barter at the market for foods such as salt cod, sardines, and anchovies, or for rice and legumes if they did not grow them. In the woodlands, they foraged for chestnuts and mushrooms and gathered snails. Deer, wild boar, and other game were by law reserved for the noble landlords, but that did not prevent the peasantry from snaring rabbits and hares, poaching game birds, and catching migrating birds such as quail in nets hung between trees. In the mountain hinterland, they fished in the rivers when they could; they never had fresh fish from the sea, because of the lack of transport and refrigeration. In the north, they had milk from the solitary cows they kept and could turn it into cheese and butter; elsewhere, they made sheep’s- and goat’s-milk cheese. Before roads began to be built in the 1960s, there was no modern transport, and the high mountains and harsh terrain made it difficult to go to market by mule or horseback.</p>
<p class="para">The culture of the pig had been important since the earliest times, and it came to symbolize the Christian Reconquista in the Middle Ages. By the middle of the eighteenth century, pork was an all-important part of peasant life throughout Spain. Those who could afford to buy a pig would feed it for nine months and then fatten it intensively for three more on their leftovers of beans, corn, potatoes, turnips, and cabbage, and sometimes fruit and chestnuts or acorns. Families killed their pigs in the coldest, driest, most windy months, usually November or December. They salted the hams and hung them to dry in airy lofts or, in wet rainy parts of the north, smoke-dried them in their kitchen hearth. They made sausages by chopping the meat with fat and seasonings, stuffing it into the scrubbed pig’s intestines, and cured them. The fat was rendered to be used for cooking.</p>
<p class="para">The <span class="italic">porcheria</span> (charcuterie) was made to last until the next <span class="italic">matanza</span> (the killing of a pig), and they didn’t begin to eat it until the spring. It had to go a long way to feed a family. Only tiny pieces of sausage were used in stews and soups. Itinerant vendors went around villages “hiring” ham bones and chorizo for people to put in their bean stews, calling “<span class="italic">¡Sabor! ¡Sabor!</span>” (Flavor! Flavor!). The women ran out of their houses or called from the windows when they heard them, and they were charged according to the number of minutes they kept the bone or sausage in their soup and whether they were the first or the last to use it. Cured hams were a luxury, used as currency to pay the doctor. On the big estates in Andalusia, the landowning aristocracy killed many pigs each year to feed their peasant laborers with chorizo.</p>
<p class="para">The pig is still the king of the Spanish kitchen, and it is used in its totality: you can see the feet, tail, snout, and ears at every butcher’s market stall. Until the civil war, though, pork products were eaten almost exclusively by the peasantry. Today salted and smoked cured pork products and all manner of sausages are a prized part of Spanish gastronomy, and <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> is the jewel in the crown. Until recently, lard was the cooking fat used in many regional dishes, including sweet pastries. During Lent and periods of abstinence, <span class="italic">bacalao</span> (salt cod), “the pig of the sea,” replaced cured pork in every kind of dish.</p>
<p class="para">The only fresh meats the rural poor ate, apart from the small game and game birds they poached, were pork offal on the day of the <span class="italic">matanza</span> and lamb or chicken during festivals, saints’ days, and events such as funerals, when the food was paid for by the community or offered by the rich (banquets were given as charitable legacies by rich people in their wills). Carnivals and other celebrations were dominated by food and drink. The way peasants ate and drank in excess on such occasions reveals their anxiety about and obsession with food. Their preoccupations and eating fantasies are reflected in mythical stories such as those about a land called Jauja, where the likes of partridges and hams flew through the air and landed in people’s mouths. Paradise meant a stomach filled with delicacies that in real life were eaten only by the rich. In <span class="italic">Don Quixote,</span> Cervantes captured the dreams of the perpetually hungry peasants in his description of Camacho’s wedding feast, a real orgy of excess: A whole ox, its belly stuffed with twenty-four tiny suckling pigs, is roasted on a spit over burning wood. Hanging on trees are skinned hares, plucked chickens, and a variety of game waiting to be cooked, as well as sixty wineskins, each filled with eight gallons of wine. Loaves of white bread and cheeses are stacked up like a wall. Sweet pastries are dropped into cauldrons filled with boiling oil, then lifted out and plunged into a pot of honey. A variety of spices are displayed in a huge chest. Sancho Panza asks a cook if he can dip a piece of bread into a simmering broth, and the cook ladles out three hens and two geese for him.</p>
<p class="para">The preservation of food was an important part of rural traditions. Provisions were made in the summer to last over the winter. Chestnuts and fruits were dried in lofts or on rooftops. In northern regions, corn was dried and stored in stone or wood buildings called <span class="italic">hórreos.</span> Tomatoes and fruits such as apples, grapes, apricots, and plums were dried in the sun or in the hearth. Olives were cured. Tomato sauces were bottled in jars, as were roasted and peeled peppers. Vegetables were preserved in brine, and fruits in sugar syrup. People also made <span class="italic">escabeches</span> of fish, partridge, and quail by storing them in a vinegary marinade after cooking. Today these are commercial delicacies that people keep in their pantry.</p>
<p class="para">In each region, there were two or three dishes that peasants ate almost every day, and these depended on what was available locally. Porridge, bread, and <span class="italic">tortas</span> (unleavened flatbreads) were made out of barley, millet, sorghum, wheat, and corn. Bread was the most important food and the basis of many dishes, such as <span class="italic">migas</span> (see page 476) and <span class="italic">sopa de ajo</span> (page 178). Soups and stews were made with fava beans, chickpeas, dried white beans, and peas and lentils. Chestnuts were among the “poor foods” of Galicia, Asturias, and the Basque Country. The wealthy ate them only <span class="italic">confitades</span> (preserved in sugar syrup), as <span class="italic">marrons glacés,</span> or pureed with cream and sugar. In the wet regions of the north, apples, pears, plums, walnuts, and hazelnuts were grown. In the Mediterranean regions, many more vegetables, such as eggplants, zucchini, and pumpkins, and fruits were available.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p077.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">In periods of economic crisis, corn was the main food of the poor. During the civil war, and the period of rationing after the war, eighty percent of the peasantry survived on corn. In Asturias, the exclusive diet of corn—as bread and as a kind of polenta with milk and butter—was responsible for the disease pellagra, referred to as <span class="italic">el mal de la rosa.</span> It was only in the 1950s that Spaniards started again making bread with wheat instead of corn flour; wheat had been too expensive before. They also ate <span class="italic">gachas,</span> a kind of gruel made with flour ground from grass peas (see page 478), beans, chickpeas, or wheat and oil and water.</p>
<p class="para">The pastoral industry and the wool trade were all-important, especially in Castile. Transhumance, the annual migration of sheep from grazing lands in the north to winter pastures in the south and then back, was practiced. At one time a vast network of sheep tracks (<span class="italic">cañadas</span>) crisscrossed the whole of Spain. Shepherds packed their cooking pots on their mules. They made <span class="italic">migas</span> with fried bread crumbs flavored with garlic and <span class="italic">pimentón,</span> and they ate fried cheese with honey (page 161). Although shepherds were not permitted to eat the sheep in their charge, there are lamb dishes called <span class="italic">del pastor,</span> of the shepherd.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p078.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">In the early twentieth century, peasants still worked simply to survive, and landowners did not invest in modernization to improve the yield of their land or the quality of their products such as grapes and olives. These were tumultuous times for Spain. There were peasant revolts, land seizures, miners’ revolts in Asturias, and declarations of autonomy by Catalans and Basques. Anarchist and Marxist movements were born, and a leftist network of underground trade unions developed. The boundaries between the cities and the hinterlands became fluid, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the urban and rural worlds. People who lived in cities could be employed in agricultural work, and city elites—nobles, merchants, and others grown wealthy in trades such as wool, textiles, furniture, and mining—owned land in the countryside, often large estates, and lived there for part of the year.</p>
<p class="para">With the huge migrations from the countryside to industrialized cities and from the poor south to the richer north that started in the late nineteenth century, peasant dishes began to appear in cities, usually with some modification. Some of these were saints’ day specialties. Traditional peasant dishes were adopted by the middle classes, who simply added more meat. It was in the early twentieth century that regional peasant foods began to be discovered by food writers. One of the most influential of these was María Mestayer de Echagüe, whose two-volume <span class="italic">Enciclopedia Culinaria: La Cocina Completa,</span> published in 1933 under the pen name Marquesa de Parabere, featured many traditional Spanish recipes. Teodoro Bardají’s <span class="italic">La Cocina de Ellas,</span> which came out in 1935, is now seen as the precursor of modern Spanish cuisine. Bardají was born in 1882 into a family of cooks and was sent as a boy to Madrid as an apprentice cook in a restaurant. He worked in several of the top establishments there and cooked for the Duke of Infantado for twenty years.</p>
<p class="para">The civil war, which began in 1936, changed people’s food habits. There was penury during the war and rationing after it, and Spaniards speak with deep emotion about the horrors of the war. Some are still haunted by how desperately hard life was. Hundreds of thousands died fighting or of starvation; others were executed after the war on the orders of General Franco. People were better off in the country than in the cities, where produce was scarce, but the breadwinners were fighting and agriculture was neglected. In the right-wing areas that had been on the side of the victorious Nationalists led by General Franco, people lived well; in the cities that had held out with the Republicans, they suffered most. Ignacio Doménech, who cooked for the high nobility and was a prolific writer about gastronomy, was the only author to produce a cookbook during the civil war. He wrote in the prologue, “The obsession in these last months of 1938 is food. . . . Everywhere all that people can think of is food.” They dreamed of seeing markets full of fresh food and of feasts.</p>
<p class="para">Don Quixote remarked that “there is no sauce in the world like hunger.” Today it is the fond memories of the old life that is the sauce.</p>
