<p class="noindent">I encountered Iberian soup in its most basic form while cooking one afternoon with a group of grandmothers in the Catalan village of Sils. One of them grabbed half a loaf of stale bread and crumbled it into a pot. She added water; she tossed in a few mint leaves. Intently and patiently, she stirred the soup with a long wooden stick until the bread all but dissolved into the liquid, swelling and forming a porridge. “Sopa de menta cura la venta” (mint soup cures the stomach), she intoned, swirling an egg into the soup to thicken it. Then she splashed in some olive oil. <em>Basta.</em> Maybe it was the taste of the good country loaf or the special aroma of the freshly pressed oil. Or was it the fact that the egg had been laid just that morning? No matter <a id="page_76"/>which, four simple ingredients added up to one of the most deliciously nourishing things I can remember—a taste I have never been able to replicate in my own kitchen. Spanish cuisine is full of such miracles.</p>
<p class="indent">The frugal Mediterranean combination of bread and water—often replaced these days by light stock or broth—still forms the basis for many traditional Spanish soups. We’re talking about classic Castilian garlic soup with its dusky additions of cured ham and <em>pimentón.</em> Or the delicious Extremaduran tomato soup poured over thick, toasted bread slices and unexpectedly garnished with figs. Or the Catalan wild mushroom soup to which bread pureed with the broth lends a special smooth creaminess. And gazpacho? Though most Americans associate it with the New World, tomato, bread, olive oil, and vinegar are actually the only constant ingredients in the endless regional permutations of this Andalusian summer refresher.</p>
<p class="indent">Rich, hearty potages that veer into stews are another popular soup genre. These are likely to be thickened with potatoes or legumes instead of bread and flavored with <em>hueso añejo</em> (a smoky ham bone) and sausages or, during Lent, bacalao. Not to forget the coastal fishermen’s soups, the velvety vegetable and legume purees, or the strong consommé that normally precedes a <em>cocido</em> (boiled dinner). Rustic they might be, but traditional Spanish soups are rarely stodgy or bland, deriving their earthy sophistication from a layering of flavors: a fruity swirl of olive oil, a green flourish of parsley, a mortar-pounded mixture of fried garlic, nuts, and yes, bread.</p>
<p class="indent">As you move into the <em>nueva cocina</em> territory, soups become vibrant, smooth, and adventurous. Often you savor them topped with foam or a crunchy contrasting garnish. Or they’ll be deconstructed into two textures or temperatures and served in a shot glass as an <em>aperetivo.</em> A scoop of saffron ice cream and some crisp fried basil turn a simple squash puree into something unexpected and magical. A tomato gazpacho is transformed into a refreshing sorbet enlivened with a tart-sweet reduction of vinegar. Whether it’s a hearty slurp of tradition or a dainty sip of innovation, there’s no better way to start a meal than with a Spanish soup.</p>

<h3 class="h3c"><a id="page_77"/>HOT SOUPS</h3>
<h3 class="h3bro">ROASTED SQUASH SOUP WITH SAFFRON ICE CREAM</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA DE CALABAZA ASADA CON HELADO DE AZAFRAN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The Roig Robí restaurant in Barcelona has a devoted clientele of intellectuals and artists (one of Spain’s greatest modern artists, Antoni Tàpies, designed its menu). Under the watchful eyes of Mercé Navarro and Inma Crosas, a mother and daughter team who cook like angels, the food, for all its modern touches, remains deeply soulful and utterly Catalan. Their soup is a case in point. A velvety, satisfying pumpkin puree, it comes with an imaginative garnish of saffron ice cream and deep-fried basil—a truly arresting contrast of hot and cold, smooth and crisp, sweet and savory. Catalan pumpkins have a delicious sweet, dense flesh; here a mixture of butternut squash and sweet potatoes serves as a good substitute. Roig Robí makes its own saffron ice cream, but stirring some saffron-steeped milk into store-bought vanilla ice cream does the trick easily. Ladle the soup into beautiful glass or stark white bowls and prepare for compliments.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 medium-size butternut squash (2 to 2</strong>½ pounds), cut in half lengthwise</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size sweet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons hot milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1 cup best-quality vanilla ice cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 to 12 large unblemished basil leaves, patted dry (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 teaspoons finely grated orange zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Course salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Scrape the seeds from the squash, brush the cut side with a little olive oil, and set it on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, cut side down. Wrap the sweet potatoes individually in aluminum foil and place them on the same baking sheet. Bake the squash and sweet potatoes until they feel completely tender when pierced with a skewer, about 1¼ hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the vegetables bake, prepare the ice cream: Steep the saffron in the hot milk for 15 minutes, then let cool completely. Place the ice cream in a bowl and let stand until just soft enough <a id="page_78"/>to stir, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir the saffron milk in gently but thoroughly, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refreeze the ice cream until firm, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Make the fried basil: Pour olive oil to a depth of 1 inch in a small, deep skillet. Heat it over medium heat to 360°F; when hot, a basil leaf dropped in the oil will sizzle on contact. Deep-fry the basil leaves 3 or 4 at a time until crisp, about 45 seconds, transferring them with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Let the squash and sweet potatoes cool until manageable. Remove and discard the squash skin and any browned bits. Peel the sweet potatoes. Cut the vegetables into medium-size chunks.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Heat 1½ tablespoons olive oil in a soup pot over low heat. Add the onion and orange zest and cook until soft but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the baked squash and sweet potatoes and the chicken stock and cook, partially covered, until the vegetables almost disintegrate, about 10 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally. Working in 2 or 3 batches, puree the soup in a blender until completely smooth, adding a little more chicken stock to each batch if it seems too thick. Return the soup to the pot, add the cream, and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> To serve, let the saffron ice cream soften at room temperature for 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls or tumblers, top each with a small serving scoop of ice cream (I use a melon baller for this), and top the ice cream with a fried basil leaf. Drizzle a little olive oil over each portion and serve immediately. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch03_note1"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> The basil must be completely dry before frying, otherwise the olive oil will splatter like mad. Although you will only need 8 basil leaves, fry extra in case any crumble during frying.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">TOMATO AND BREAD SOUP WITH FRESH FIGS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA DE TOMATE CON HIGOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Bread and tomato soups are a Mediterranean staple—think, for instance, of the Tuscan <em>pappa al pomodoro.</em> What makes this <em>sopa</em> from Extremadura unique is the way it is eaten: topped with fresh sliced figs or green grapes. This recipe is from Jarandilla de la Vera, an extraordinarily fertile section of northern Extremadura renowned for its fruit, which the locals happily mix into savory dishes such as soups and salads. Use the ripest tomatoes you can find, preferably ones from the farmers’ market, and make sure they are completely soft and cooked down before adding the stock. If you don’t have fresh figs, you can serve the soup with sliced green grapes instead.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_79"/><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds ripe, fleshy tomatoes, such as beefsteak or very ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 2½ cups chicken stock or broth, or vegetable broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of sugar, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 dash of red wine vinegar, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon cumin seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of coarse salt (kosher or sea), or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 slices (½ inch thick) dense country bread from a large round loaf, very lightly toasted</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 green or purple figs, cut in half vertically and sliced, or ⅔ cup sliced seedless green grapes</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the olive oil in a heavy 4-quart saucepan, preferably nonstick, and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the green pepper, cover the pan, and reduce the heat to low. Cook the vegetables until soft, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in half of the garlic and cook for another minute.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Stir the tomatoes into the vegetable mixture, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes reduce to a thick puree, 25 to 30 minutes, adjusting the heat so that the tomatoes don’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the paprika and 2 cups of the chicken stock, stir to mix, then let come just to a simmer; don’t let the soup boil. Add the sugar and vinegar and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes, skimming if necessary. If the soup seems a little too thick, add the remaining ½ cup chicken stock.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the soup is cooking, place the remaining garlic and the oregano, cumin seeds, peppercorns, and salt in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them into a paste. Add a little liquid from the soup to the mortar to rinse it out, then stir the contents into the soup. Let the soup cook until the flavors blend, 2 to 3 minutes, then taste for seasoning, adding more sugar, vinegar, and salt as necessary. Turn the heat off and let the soup cool for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> To serve, cut the slices of bread in half. Place each half bread slice in a soup bowl and ladle the soup over it. Top each serving of soup with a few fig slices and drizzle a little olive oil over them. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro">ROASTED VEGETABLE SOUP WITH ANCHOVY TOASTS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CREMA DE HORTALIZAS ASADAS CON ANCHOAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In this recipe, from Barcelona chef Xavier Franco, roasted vegetables are blended into a delicious cream and eaten warm or at room temperature with a garnish of slivered olives and garlicky anchovy toasts. Spanish red peppers and even <a id="page_80"/>onions have an almost candied sweetness not found in their American counterparts. To approximate the flavor, I add a bit of sugar and vinegar to the soup, not for a sweet-sour effect but to heighten the taste.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 medium-size ripe fleshy red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut in half lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size ripe tomatoes, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 large garlic cloves, peeled, plus 2 garlic cloves crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size eggplant, pricked in several places with the tip of a knife</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small red onion, cut into thick wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups hot chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon best-quality red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of sugar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 slices (½ inch thick) from a dense, skinny baguette</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup slivered pitted black olives, such as niçoise or cured green olives</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the red peppers, tomatoes, and 8 whole cloves of garlic in a large bowl, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and toss to coat. Arrange the vegetables on a large, well-oiled baking sheet, placing tomatoes and peppers skin side up. Place the eggplant on another well-oiled baking sheet. Wrap the onion wedges in aluminum foil and place them on the baking sheet with the eggplant. Bake the vegetables until the peppers and tomatoes are very tender, about 30 minutes, switching the position of the baking sheets halfway through. Remove the baking sheet with the peppers, tomatoes, and garlic from the oven and continue to bake the eggplant and onion until tender, about 10 minutes longer. Leave the oven on.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the eggplant finishes baking, place the peppers in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let stand. When the eggplant and onion have finished baking, peel the peppers, then scoop out the pulp from the eggplant and discard the skin. Coarsely chop all the vegetables. Working in three batches, puree the vegetables in a blender until medium-fine, adding 1 cup chicken stock per batch. Transfer the pureed vegetables to a large bowl, adding a little more stock if the soup seems too thick. Season the soup with salt, black pepper, vinegar, and sugar to taste. Let the soup cool slightly while you prepare the anchovy toasts.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and bake until lightly golden and slightly crisp, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the anchovies in a mortar or a small bowl and, using the pestle or the back of a wooden spoon, mash them well. Stir in the 2 crushed garlic cloves and whisk in 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Spread the anchovy mixture on the toasted bread.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To serve, ladle the soup into serving bowls and swirl some of the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into each serving. Sprinkle the olives and parsley over the soup, then top each serving with 2 anchovy toasts. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_81"/><span class="blue">CASTILIAN GARLIC SOUP</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA DE AJO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">What gazpacho is to Andalusia, <em>sopa de ajo</em> is to the plains of Castile and La Mancha—a dish that started life as a poor man’s porridge but that’s gone on to achieve status as the region’s gastronomic symbol. Garlic, bread, smoky paprika, <em>jamón,</em> poached egg, and olive oil (which has replaced the more traditional lard) team up to produce a boldly flavored and quintessentially Spanish potage filling enough for a one-bowl meal.</p>
<p class="indent">Tradition dictates that the soup be presented in individual earthenware <em>cazuelas</em>; if you don’t have these, use nicely rustic ceramic bowls or crocks.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 medium-size garlic cloves, 6 sliced and 4 crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (4 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 slices (½ inch thick) day-old dense country bread without crusts, from a medium-size round loaf, cut into 1½-inch squares</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 Poached Eggs (<a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_156">page 156</a>); see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03_note2">Note</a></strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 teaspoons finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley (optional), for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a heavy 4-quart saucepan over low heat. Add the sliced garlic and the ham and cook, stirring, until the garlic is very fragrant but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the bread and cook, stirring to coat the bread with oil, 2 to 3 minutes, adding a little more olive oil if the pan looks dry. Off the heat, sprinkle in the paprika, and toss the bread well to coat it evenly. Return the pan to the heat, add the stock, increase the heat to medium, and simmer until the bread swells but still holds its shape, about 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste, add the crushed garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Ladle the soup into four warmed soup crocks or ceramic bowls. Using a slotted spoon, transfer a poached egg to each soup bowl and garnish with parsley, if desired. Serve at once. To eat, break the poached egg, stirring the yolk into the soup; the egg will cook slightly from the heat and thicken the broth. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch03_note2"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Classically, the eggs are poached right in the soup, but they can be poached ahead of time. Once added to the soup they will warm through from the heat of the broth. In some versions the eggs are fried or broken into the soup crocks and baked. And there are practical home cooks who suggest breaking an egg into each serving of soup and microwaving it for about 1¼ minutes.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CREMA DE GARBANZOS CON JAMON CRUJIENTE</strong></small></p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_82"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0082_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Garbanzo Cream with Ham Cracklings</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Contemporary chefs all over Spain are enamored with chickpea purees, topping the humble legume with such luxury stuff as foie gras, <em>cigalas</em> (langoustines), sautéed fresh porcini mushrooms, or more traditionally, coins of fried blood sausage. While Spanish chickpeas are creamy and nutty, the dried legumes found in America are usually not much of an improvement on the canned stuff. So, I offer a quick version of the soup, using canned garbanzos, which are greatly improved by a simmer in a bacon-infused broth. The smooth, earthy puree makes an ideal backdrop for any number of garnishes, such as the smoky <em>pimentón</em>-infused oil and crisped diced <em>jamón</em> offered here. You can also top the soup with parsley oil (its color will contrast nicely with that of the paprika oil), crisp-fried chorizo slices, small piles of sautéed wild mushrooms, or shrimp stir-fried with garlic and olive oil. The soup is equally great as a sit-down first course or as a kind of predinner “shot,” passed around in tumblers or espresso cups.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>5 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 heaping teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size carrot, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small leek, white part only, well rinsed and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans; from two 15-ounce cans), plus 1 cup of their liquid</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (6 to 8 ounces) smoky slab bacon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (2 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Parsley Oil (optional; <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_353">page 353</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Tiny Olive Oil Croutons (optional; <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_90">page 90</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the paprika oil: Heat ¼ cup of the olive oil in a very small skillet or saucepan over low heat. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the paprika, and let the oil infuse for 30 to 45 minutes. When ready to use, spoon off the oil into a small bowl, leaving the paprika in the skillet. You’ll have more oil than you need for the garbanzo soup; set the rest aside for drizzling on other dishes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy, medium-size soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion, carrot, leek, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Cover the pot and cook the vegetables until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the chickpeas and their liquid, the chicken stock, and bacon and bring to a boil, skimming. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to very low, and cook for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Remove the pot from the heat and let the soup stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the bacon or save for another use. Working in two batches, puree the soup in a blender until very <a id="page_84"/>smooth, then return to the pot, adding a little more chicken stock if you’d like the soup to be thinner. Season with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place a heavy, medium-size skillet over medium-high heat (do not use a nonstick skillet) and heat until very hot, about 1 minute. Add the ham and cook (without oil), stirring, until it turns crisp, about 3 minutes. (If the ham bits begin to pop out of the skillet, cover it.) Transfer the ham to a bowl and let stand for 5 minutes; it will crisp further.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Reheat the soup, if necessary, then ladle it into soup plates or wide tumblers. Drizzle the paprika oil decoratively over the soup and sprinkle the crisp ham, parsley, and Parsley Oil and croutons, if using, on top.

<p class="box-title">PIMENTON: SPAIN’S SMOKY ESSENCE</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">La Chinata <em>pimentón</em> was a study in different shades of red: the vast rust-colored stacks of dried peppers, the bright-ocher pyramids of ground paprika, the shiny dark-crimson tins in which the product is packaged. Even the workers in their red jumpsuits resembled peppers. My friend Gabriela brought me to La Chinata so I could learn more about the production of one of the most essential Spanish ingredients, <em>pimentón de la Vera.</em> This indispensable paprika lends a reddish hue to myriad Spanish regional stews, imparts an earthy smokiness to chorizo, and decorates the classic Galician octopus dish, <em>pulpo a feira.</em> The center of its production is the extraordinarily fertile La Vera, a section of the Cáceres province in the western Spanish region of Extremadura.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Gabriela’s friend, the <em>pimentón</em> expert Julia Gonzales Serrano, whisked us around the factory reciting pepper lore. In 1493, Columbus brought capsicum peppers back from his second American voyage. Local legend holds that he presented them along with other edible curiosities to the Catholic monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand at the Guadalupe monastery not far from La Chinata. The peppers, Julia declared, were an instant hit with the monks, who began spreading the word to brothers at other monasteries in the region. It was the monks of the nearby Yuste monastery who are credited with inventing the technique of drying and smoking the pimientos that now grow in La Vera in such profusion.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Sifting through a heap of the smooth smoky-red powder, Julia explained what makes the local paprika so unique (<em>pimentón de la Vera</em> was the world’s first pepper to be awarded denomination of origin status). The process begins with unblemished, vine-ripened fruit that’s harvested by hand in the fall. Next comes the laborious task of drying the peppers over smoldering oak or holm oak for up to two weeks, during which time they are hand turned every twenty-four hours. This slow, patient smoking is the secret to <em>pimentón’s</em> unmistakable tangy, leathery punch and aroma.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Once the smoked peppers arrive at the mills, such as those of La Chinata, they are sorted into three types: <em>dulce</em> (sweet), <em>agridulce</em> (bittersweet), or <em>picante</em> (hot). Last but not least, the peppers are ground. Whereas as other paprikas might get no more than a quick whizz, <em>pimentón de la Vera</em> is painstakingly pulverized for eight to nine hours in temperature-controlled stone mills in a process specially engineered to bring out the peppers’ natural flavors and pigments. That’s how <em>pimentón</em> gets its velvety, powdery texture that dissolves so easily in soups and stews. La Chinata—which incidentally makes La Vera’s most prized <em>pimentón</em>—produces two-hundred tons of paprika per year. In Spain there’s no such thing as too much <em>pimentón</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Rosa Vilaseca, the accomplished Catalan country cook who gave me the recipe for Rosa’s Roast Chicken and Wild Mushroom Casserole with Red Wine (see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#page_273">page 273</a>), contributed this equally hearty mushroom soup. In the rustic tradition followed pretty much all over Spain, the soup is thickened with bread (just like Andalusian gazpacho). Both the <em>picada</em> of crushed garlic and almonds and the use of garlic shoots are characteristic of Catalan cooking. Look for garlic shoots at farmers’ markets or Chinese supermarkets. If you don’t find them, you can substitute julienned scallions (use the white and some of the green parts) or julienned leeks, plus three cloves of minced garlic (in addition to the garlic that’s in the <em>picada</em>). Cream is not part of Rosa’s recipe and has little use in the Catalan kitchen, but add it if you’d like to lighten the color of the soup. Because the soup is so rich and bosky tasting, I like to pass small portions of it before dinner in small, pretty glasses.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ ounce dried porcini mushrooms</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 garlic shoots, trimmed and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons (¼ stick) unsalted butter, or more if needed, cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces assorted delicate fresh mushrooms (chanterelles, oysters, morels, and/or stemmed shiitakes), wiped clean and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large ripe tomato, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skin discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slices (½ inch thick) day-old country bread from a medium-size round loaf, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup heavy cream (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 to 14 blanched almonds, toasted (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>) and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh chives, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place 1 cup of the chicken stock in a small microwave-safe bowl and heat in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes. Add the porcini and soak until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain the porcini in a small sieve lined with a coffee filter or cheesecloth, reserving the soaking liquid. Finely chop the porcini.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic shoots, and the chopped porcini and cook until the onion is soft but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the butter and the fresh mushrooms and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms cook down and release their liquid, about 5 minutes, adding a little more butter if the pot looks dry. Add the tomato and cook until thickened and reduced, 5 to 7 minutes more. Stir in the remaining 5 cups chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes, occasionally skimming the fat off the top. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Turn off the heat, add the bread to the soup, and let it soak for 10 minutes. Working in batches, coarsely puree the soup in a blender and return it to the pot. If the soup seems too thick, add a little more stock. Stir in the cream, if using.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the almonds, garlic, and parsley in a mini food processor and pulse until ground. Rinse out the processor bowl with a little of the soup, then stir the contents into the soup pot. Let the soup come to a simmer over low heat and cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with chives sprinkled on top. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The most important soup lesson I gleaned from Spain’s modern restaurants had to do with presentation. There’s nothing wrong with a rustic bowl or an earthenware <em>cazuela,</em> especially for a family lunch. But even the simplest potage acquires an aura of sophistication when ladled into a cool tumbler, a cappuccino cup, a minimalist white or glass bowl, or a dish with an unusual shape. My own favorites include triangular and jellyfish-shaped white bowls (spoils from a Crate &amp; Barrel sale) and the wide, stubby wine and cider glasses that are available cheaply at every <em>ferretería</em> (hard-ware store) in Spain.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Portions also matter. Rather than overwhelm guests with large servings, why not pass soup around in shot or martini glasses, or espresso cups, as a predinner teaser? Squat glass votive candle holders are also great for the job. Served this way, and sprinkled with a few interesting garnishes, even a plain vegetable puree becomes a showstopper.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">MORNING-AFTER VEGETABLE AND SAUSAGE SOUP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POTAJE DE VERDURAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Early in the morning, before customers descend on Barcelona’s La Boqueria market, a crowd of vendors and chefs gathers around the counter of Bar Pinotxo for breakfast. Some quickly scarf down a tostada rubbed with tomatoes and olive oil; others grab one of the vegetable <em>tortillas</em> (omelets) arrayed on the counter. But you always know the patrons who are recovering from a night out on the town—they are the ones fortifying themselves with Pinotxo’s thick vegetable soup with sausage and lacing their coffee with brandy or strong anisette.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_87"/>Of course, you don’t have to be hungover to love this soup loaded with La Boqueria’s beautiful vegetables. Its taste is somewhat reminiscent of an Italian minestrone, but with such Catalan flavorings as <em>sofrito</em> of leeks, tomatoes, and garlic; blood sausage, and chickpeas. If you can’t find or don’t like blood sausage, use chorizo or a good, smoky kielbasa or linguica. Sometimes the cook at Pinotxo also adds <em>fideo</em> noodles. Since the soup’s flavor improves on standing, I recommend making it a day ahead. If it thickens too much, thin it out with some water or broth.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large leek, white part only, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size tomatoes, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skin discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 quarts (12 cups) chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size carrots, cut into medium-size dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces diced pumpkin or yellow squash</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces diced daikon radish or turnip</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small zucchini, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size all-purpose boiling potatoes, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 loosely packed cups chopped spinach or Swiss chard</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces morcilla or other blood sausage or sweet Spanish-style chorizo, or 8 ounces kielbasa or linguica</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 can (15 ounces) small white beans, drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (3 to 4 ounces) serrano ham, prosciutto, or smoky boiled ham, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a 5-quart soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the leek and garlic and cook until the leek softens, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Skim thoroughly and add the carrots, pumpkin, daikon, and zucchini. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, to soften the vegetables, 20 minutes. Add the potatoes and spinach, bring the liquid back to a simmer, skim, and cook, partially covered, to soften the potatoes, another 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Blanch the sausage in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain and slice it. (If you are using kielbasa or linguica, there’s no need to blanch it.) Add the sausage to the soup along with the chickpeas, beans, and ham. Return the soup to a simmer and skim it. Continue cooking, partially covered, until some of the vegetables are falling apart and the flavors have melded, about 20 minutes longer. Skim the soup one final time, if necessary. Add a little more stock if the soup seems too thick and stir it vigorously if you’d like the texture to be creamier. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the soup rest for about 10 minutes, then serve it with the parsley sprinkled on top. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_88"/><span class="blue">POTATO SOUP WITH FRIED ALMONDS</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA DE PATATAS Y ALMENDRAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This easy recipe was passed on to me by Laura Lorca, the niece of the great Spanish poet Federico García Lorca. Laura, who directs the Lorca foundation in Granada, told me, “I know it’s a dish Federico would have loved, because it’s so Andalusian.” In its most frugal version, Laura explained, this popular soup from Granada is just fried almonds, garlic, potatoes, and water. To enrich it one can add chicken stock and/or <em>jamón</em>—which I’ve done here. It’s one of those elemental dishes that fairly screams Spain.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup whole blanched almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup (about 2 ounces) finely diced serrano ham or prosciutto</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Dense country bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cut the potatoes into irregular chunks by inserting the tip of a small, sharp knife into a potato and twisting it until a 1½-inch chunk comes out. Repeat until the entire potato is cut up, then continue with the remaining potatoes; set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a heavy 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the almonds and garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, 4 to 5 minutes, adjusting the heat so the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the almonds and garlic to a bowl. Add the ham to the pan and stir for 1 minute. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring, for another minute. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil, skimming. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the soup.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the almond and garlic mixture in a mini food processor and grind it. If you like almond bits in your soup, grind the mixture somewhat coarsely; otherwise, grind it fine. Add all but about 2 tablespoons of the ground nut mixture to the saucepan with the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Steep the saffron in a few tablespoons of the simmering soup for 2 minutes, then add it to the pan. Simmer the soup, partially covered, until about half of the potatoes have disintegrated, about 35 minutes. Skim the soup a couple of times as it cooks and add a little more chicken stock if the soup seems too thick.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> When ready to serve, check the texture of the soup. If you’d like it creamier, break up some of the potatoes with a sturdy spoon; if you’d like it thinner, add a little more chicken stock. Add 2 teaspoons vinegar to the remaining 2 tablespoons ground almond mixture and stir it into the soup. Add the parsley and cook for another minute. Taste for seasoning, adding a little more vinegar if necessary. Serve the soup with bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_89"/>FENNEL, POTATO, AND MUSSEL SOUP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CREMA DE HINOJO Y PATATAS CON MEJILLONES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The recipe for this elegant Catalan soup is adapted from one created by the Michelin three-star chef Santi Santamaría of El Racó de Can Fabes restaurant. To me, its aromas recall blissful walks in the hills above Costa Brava, with the scents of wild fennel and the sea. The velvety fennel cream is delicious on its own, but what really transforms the soup are the simple but expressive finishing touches: a swirl of delicate olive oil, the tiny croutons, and the fragrant accent of mint. Rather than serve big portions in bowls, I like passing small glasses of the soup before dinner. Served this way, it makes a perfect start to a festive occasion, such as a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner party.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>7 cups Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>), or 4 cups bottled clam juice diluted with 3 cups water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds mussels, scrubbed well and debearded right before cooking</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size fennel bulbs, trimmed (set aside some fronds for garnish) and coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Tiny Olive Oil Croutons (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_90">page 90</a>), for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely slivered fresh mint, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the fish stock, wine, and bay leaf in a large pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the broth for about 10 minutes. Add the mussels and increase the heat to high. Cover the pot and cook until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard any mussels that do not open. Strain the broth through a sieve lined with cheesecloth into a large bowl, setting aside the broth and the mussels separately and discarding the bay leaf. When the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells and discard the shells. Place the mussels in a bowl, pour a little broth over them to keep them moist, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside until ready to use in Step 4. (Refrigerate the mussels if you are cooking them ahead of time. They’ll keep for up to 6 hours.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a clean pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the fennel and potatoes, cover, and cook until the fennel begins to soften, about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside 1 cup of the strained broth and keep it hot. Add the remaining broth to the fennel mixture. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, skimming. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes and fennel are very tender, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> When the vegetables have finished cooking, working in two batches, puree them in a blender together with their cooking liquid. Return the puree to the pot and season the soup with salt and white pepper to taste. Add enough of the remaining reserved broth to thin the mussel soup to the desired consistency (you may not need all of it). Reheat the soup, if necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Ladle the soup into tumblers or bowls and add some mussels to each portion. Drizzle a little olive oil over each portion, add a few croutons, and sprinkle fennel fronds and mint on top. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindentb">When bread isn’t used to thicken Spanish soup, it often finds its way into the bowl in the form of crisp croutons. You can always make croutons in the oven, but little ones fried in good olive oil are an especially good crunchy treat. To make the bread easier to cut into cubes, freeze it for twenty minutes. Stored in an airtight container, the croutons will keep for several days.</p>
<p class="sb-uln">About 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or 2 tablespoons (¼ stick) butter, melted</p>
<p class="sb-uln">⅓ cup ¼-inch bread cubes</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">For fried croutons: Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until a bread cube dropped in the oil sizzles on contact. Add the bread and cook, stirring, until crunchy and golden brown, 1 to 1½ minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the croutons to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">For baked croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Toss the bread cubes with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or melted butter. Spread the bread cubes out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PORRUSALDA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Taking its name from the word <em>puerro,</em> or leek, <em>porrusalda</em> is a soup beloved by the Basques. And while theirs is a culture famous for its men-only gastronomic societies—where guys take turns cooking for one another—somehow <em>porrusalda</em> is a dish that always evokes mother or grandmother. Most renditions of <em>porrusalda</em> include bacalao, which gives it a savory smack and an unmistakably Basque identity. However, because really <a id="page_92"/>good bacalao is so hard to come by, I use fresh cod and add slivers of salty smoked whitefish at serving time. The results are completely delicious. I thank Oscar Alberdi, the great bacalao specialist of Bilbao, for this recipe. Oscar’s tip: Save the briny liquid from canned vegetables, such as artichokes or asparagus, and add it to soups instead of or along with stock.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 piece cod fillet (about 1 pound), pin bones removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons coarse salt (kosher or sea), plus more for seasoning the soup</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size leeks, white and pale green parts only, sliced ½ inch thick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ pound pumpkin or calabaza, cut into 1-inch cubes</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 cups Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_198">page 198</a>), or 3 cups bottled clam juice diluted with 3 cups water or with liquid from canned vegetables</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 ounces sliced smoked whitefish or salmon, torn into slivers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the cod on both sides with the 4 tablespoons salt and let stand while you prepare the soup.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy soup pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, onion, garlic, and pumpkin, cover the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are soft but not browned, about 10 minutes.</p>

Increase the heat to high, add the wine and fish stock, and bring to a gentle boil. Skim, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer the soup until the pumpkin and potatoes are very tender and beginning to disintegrate, about 25 minutes. Stir the soup vigorously with a wooden spoon to give it a creamy texture and season with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Rinse the cod under cold running water and cut it into 4 to 6 pieces. Add the cod to the soup and cook until it just begins to flake, about 5 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 to 7 minutes.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_94"/>SILKY – TEXTURED CHICKEN SOUP WITH MINI MEATBALLS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA DE MINI ALBONDIGAS DE TIA LOLA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Tía Lola is a wonderful cook (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03_box1">box</a>). Her chicken soup gets its silky texture from rice flour and is afloat with small, juicy meatballs. This is comfort food par excellence. The meatballs can be prepared ahead and the soup put together right before serving. Try to use good homemade chicken stock here, or failing that, chicken broth from a carton rather than a can.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound ground pork shoulder (preferably freshly ground and not too lean)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg white, beaten until frothy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flour, for coating the meatballs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>9 cups best-quality chicken stock</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 tablespoons rice flour (available at Asian groceries and some supermarkets)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh chives or flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the bread and milk in a bowl and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain, squeeze out some of the excess liquid, then finely crumble the bread.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the crumbled bread and the pork, half of the beaten egg white (discard the rest), salt, white pepper, and nutmeg in a bowl. Gently knead the pork mixture with your hands just until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate. Wet your hands, then break off a little piece of the pork mixture and shape it into a ball about cherry size. Repeat with the remaining pork mixture. Coat the meatballs very lightly in the flour, shaking off the <a id="page_95"/>excess and gently tossing the meatballs between your hands to give them shape. As you work, place the coated meatballs on a small baking sheet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, preferably nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add as many meatballs as will comfortably fit in the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cook the meatballs until cooked through but not browned, about 5 minutes, shaking the skillet and turning the meatballs so they cook on all sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked meatballs to a clean baking sheet lined with paper towels. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet and cook the rest of the meatballs in the same fashion. (The meatballs can be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated, covered.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Set aside about ⅓ cup of the chicken stock. Place the remaining stock in a 4-quart saucepan, bring it to a boil over high heat, and cook until reduced to 6 cups, about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Place the rice flour in a bowl, add the reserved ⅓ cup chicken stock, and whisk until completely smooth. Slowly whisk the rice flour mixture into the reduced stock, whisking constantly for a few minutes to prevent lumps from forming. Let the soup thicken slightly, then gently stir in the meatballs and cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve garnished with chives or parsley. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">STOCK OPTIONS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Let’s face it: These days nobody makes chicken stock at home, what with so many decent options available in the supermarket. The same goes for Spain, where many a recipe given to me by home cooks included <em>un cubito de caldo</em> (a stock cube). When it comes to commercial chicken broths, what comes in cartons is better than the canned kind, which can taste rather metallic. Swanson is my favorite among the nationally available brands.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Although fish stock is always better strong and homemade (see the recipe on <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>), bottled clam juice diluted with water is an acceptable stand-in. So are the cartons of fish stock now available at many supermarkets and the frozen fish fumet (concentrated stock) carried by many fishmongers. I often doctor store-bought fish stock by boiling it down a little with sautéed shrimp shells and a few mussels and/or clams.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Most commercial beef stock tends to be yucky stuff, although cartons are definitely better than cans. The good news is that you’ll hardly need it for recipes in this book.</p>

<p class="box-title">LUNCH WITH TIA LOLA</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">You are probably familiar with the cool, frosted bottles of Freixenet <em>cava</em>. Amazingly for a high-tech winery that produces the world’s largest volume of sparkling wine, Freixenet remains resolutely family-run. And each day, the numerous members of the Ferrer clan gather for lunch around the table of Tía Lola—aka Dolores Ferrer. Everyone’s favorite aunt, Tía Lola occupies spacious quarters above the bodega in the Catalan <em>cava</em>-producing town of Sant Sandurní d’Anoia. Now in her eighties, she is a woman who lives for her family and has three passions in life: cooking, religion, and soccer. The sort of domestic genius who spends an eternity making huge quantities of <em>sofregit</em> (Catalan <em>sofrito</em>), she peels and grinds almonds for <em>panellets</em> (marzipan-like confections) and puts up enough diced tomato <em>conservas</em> for the whole winter. The Freixenet workers pack these for her in elegant <em>cava</em> bottles. She also oversees the family <em>huerta,</em> which supplies her kitchen with green beans, cauliflower, and escarole. Hunched over her fancy wood-fired stove, Tía Lola listens to live soccer coverage on the radio, religiously keeping up with Catalonia’s favorite sport so as to better relate to the boys in the family.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">No one ever bothers to inform Tía Lola how many people will be coming to lunch. She just makes enough food for everyone: rich fish soups, plump meatballs smothered in homemade tomato sauce, the baked cheesy pasta that the kids love so much, and always a seafood paella on Thursdays. One day I had the pleasure to lunch with the Ferrers in Tía Lola’s palatial dining room. On the menu that day was the entire family’s favorite dish—a velvety-smooth chicken soup thickened with rice flour and topped with the tiniest, tastiest pork meatballs.

<h3 class="h3a">CLASSIC GAZPACHO</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GAZPACHO SEVILLANO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is the coral-pink Sevillian gazpacho that most foreigners are familiar with. Ripe, gorgeous tomatoes; excellent olive oil (preferably Andalusian hojiblanca); and a good aged (<em>reserva</em>) sherry vinegar make the soup unforgettable. It’s as good as classic gazpacho gets! Although the original mortar-pounded gazpachos were probably rather coarse in texture, modern Spanish cooks like their soup silky smooth. I suggest using a food processor to puree the vegetables, then switching to a blender to achieve a velvety texture. OK, so you might have to rinse an extra utensil, but the payoff is worth it, and the blender sure beats the tedious traditional method of forcing the vegetables through a fine sieve.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SOUP:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups cubed day-old country bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03_note4">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of cumin seeds or ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 pounds ripest, most flavorful tomatoes possible, seeded and chopped</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped red onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chilled bottled spring water, or more as needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE GARNISHES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely diced cucumber</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely diced peeled Granny Smith apple</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_98"/>GAZPACHO</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">If paella defines the Levante region and paprika-hued garlic soup represents Castilla–La Mancha, then gazpacho is the edible emblem of Andalusia. Although the smooth, zesty salad-soup is easy to love, I didn’t appreciate its genius until one torrid June in Seville. By 11 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>. the temperature had climbed to 105°F, the entire city was hiding indoors, and my body went into heat shock. Eating was simply out of the question. Except for gazpacho—filling yet light with an acidity that somehow combated the heat. I guzzled it down by the gallon, and to this day I refer to gazpacho as my “summer survival soup.”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Most Americans imagine gazpacho as something rust-red, possibly chunky, and likely to contain celery and tomato juice. A real gazpacho is none of these things. True, there are plenty of versions based on tomatoes; yet to understand gazpacho is to remember that its defining ingredient is actually bread. That’s what gives the soup body, and that creamy richness. Bread is what makes gazpacho into a meal rather than just a sip. And it was the foundation of the earliest gazpacho, pounded with water, vinegar, salt, garlic, and olive oil in a wooden tub called a <em>dornillo</em>. Although the arrival of the tomato from the New World revolutionized gazpacho, many regional versions still remain white, based on nuts or simply water, garlic, and bread.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The word <em>gazpacho</em> most likely derives from the Mozarabic <em>caspa,</em> which means fragments (referring to the broken-up bread), or from the Hebrew <em>gazaz</em> (to break into pieces). The origins of the dish itself could well date back to the Romans who roamed in antiquity what is now Andalusia and had a special fondness for bread gruels and vinegared foods. Though tomatoes and peppers were introduced to Spain in the 1500s, these “exotic” ingredients took several centuries to gain acceptance. Even as late as the mid-eighteenth century, Juan de la Mata, author of <em>Arte de Reposteria,</em> describes a gazpacho commonly called <em>capon de galera</em> as a frugal porridge of crustless bread, garlic, vinegar, oil, and anchovy bones.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Gazpacho truly came into its own in the early nineteenth century as the main summer sustenance of workers who labored in the sweltering Andalusian olive groves, cork forests, and wheat fields. The Sevillian food historian Juan Carlos Alonso describes how in the morning, before heading to work, the <em>campesino</em> packed his day’s meal: a hide flask of olive oil and vinegar and another of water, a paper packet of salt, stale bread, plus a few vegetables and the indispensable mortar and pestle used for making his lunch. Gazpacho acquired cachet when Eugenia de Montijo, the Andalusian-born wife of Napoleon III, introduced it to France in the 1850s. Romantic poets and travelers who fell for the exotic allure of Andalusia spread the word further.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Today the map of Andalusia is a veritable quilt of gazpachos. The most familiar, creamy-pink version comes from Seville. A tomato-less <em>ajo blanco</em> (literally white garlic), an alluring Moorish cream based on ground almonds and served with a cooling accent of green grapes or apples, is the traditional gazpacho of Málaga. Also in Málaga one finds a soup called <em>gazpachuelo,</em> which is not a cold soup but a light mayonnaise-based seafood chowder. <em>Salmorejo,</em> the gazpacho of Córdoba, resembles its Sevillian cousin but is thicker and creamier. In some parts of the province eggs and fried bread are added.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">And so it goes: the <em>gazpacho tostao</em> (with toasted bread and Seville orange juice) in Cañete la Real, near Ronda; gazpachos with fresh green fava beans in the province of Granada; the green gazpachos with lettuce and herbs enjoyed in the mountains of Huelava. And did I mention the hot, game-based gazpachos of La Mancha, the stewlike <em>gaspatxos</em> of Alicante, and the <em>nueva cocina</em> gazpachos—deconstructed into granitas, <em>sorbetes, espumas,</em> and gelées? The variations are endless and I invite you to experiment.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">CREAMY CORDOBAN GAZPACHO</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SALMOREJO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The Cordoban version of gazpacho, called <em>salmorejo,</em> is a cream with a texture that falls somewhere between a dip and a soup. It’s a wonderful accompaniment for crudités or a pile of poached shrimp and is delicious as a sauce. But more often than not it is served in individual bowls, with the traditional garnishes, as a savory warm-weather cream to be eaten with a spoon.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2½ cups cubed or torn day-old country bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds ripest, most flavorful tomatoes, seeded and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size Italian (frying) pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03_note4">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large hard-cooked egg whites, finely chopped, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (2 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, slivered or finely diced, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the bread in a bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and squeeze out the excess liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> While the bread is soaking, place the tomatoes in a sieve set over a bowl and let them drain for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place half of the drained tomatoes, Italian pepper, and garlic in a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer the tomato mixture to a blender and blend until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. With the motor running, add ¼ cup of the olive oil in a slow stream, as you would when making mayonnaise. Pour the tomato mixture into a mixing bowl and repeat with the remaining tomatoes, Italian pepper, garlic, and ¼ cup olive oil. Whisk the vinegar into the tomato mixture and season it with salt <a id="page_100"/>to taste. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the soup for at least 2 hours or overnight for the flavors to develop.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> To serve, place the <em>salmorejo</em> in bowls or shot glasses and invite the diners to garnish their portions with drizzles of olive oil, chopped egg white, and ham. Leftover <em>salmorejo</em> makes a great dip for poached or grilled seafood. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 IN BOWLS, 12 IN SHOT GLASSES</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">During the torrid Andalusian summer, <em>salmorejo</em> is appreciated as much as gazpacho. What distinguishes <em>salmorejo</em> from its relative is the absence of water, onions, and cucumbers, as well as a higher proportion of bread, which makes for a lusher, creamier texture. Each cook insists on a different ratio: Some suggest it should be one to one (one pound of tomatoes to one pound of bread). In my recipe, borrowed from Jaylu, my favorite restaurant in Seville, I use a quarter pound of bread to two pounds of tomatoes. To me, the texture is ideal.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The quality of the tomatoes is of utmost importance—they should be sweet and fragrant but also have a lively acidity. Adding vinegar is delicious but not necessarily traditional; it’s mostly used in <em>porra,</em> the version of <em>salmorejo</em> from the Andalusian city of Antequera near Seville. In some versions, especially those from Córdoba, a raw egg yolk is blended with the other ingredients. The classic garnishes are chopped hard-cooked egg whites and diced or slivered <em>jamón,</em> but other possibilities include small chunks of canned tuna, small poached shrimp, diced cooked potatoes, and/or chopped tomatoes and onions. As a tapa, I like serving <em>salmorejo</em> in shot glasses topped with a poached or grilled shrimp on a skewer. Once you learn how to make the soup, you’ll discover that its uses are almost endless—a perfect summer refresher!</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GAZPACHO DE CEREZAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Adapted from a soup prepared by Andalusia’s greatest young chef, Dani García, this dramatic gazpacho has a gorgeous pastel pink hue, the result of adding ripe cherries and beets to the usual base of tomatoes and bread. Pistachios, mint, and diced cucumber make a simple and sophisticated garnish. For something sublime, I suggest that you try this topped with a small scoop of Minty Granita (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_447">page 447</a>) or green apple sorbet. If fresh cherries are out of season, try the sour cherries that come in jars, imported from eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_102"/><strong>1 medium-size beet (6 to 7 ounces), stemmed</strong></p>

<p class="box-title">DANI GARCIA’S SOUP SORCERY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">People visit the Andalusian city of Ronda to admire the perfect proportions of one of Spain’s oldest bullrings and to gasp at the vertiginous Tajo gorge, which has sent many a Romantic poet into a tizzy. Me? I went there to taste what Dani García, a sweet teddy bear of a chef, was up to at his restaurant Tragabuches. Dani—who has since moved to a restaurant in Marbella—is already renowned in Spain as the father of new-wave gazpacho, producing dozens of futuristic riffs on the Andalusian classic.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">My soup tasting at Tragabuches was exhilarating. There was <em>ajo blanco,</em> a white almond gazpacho, poured around a floppy shrimp and caviar <em>raviolo</em>—the seemingly disparate flavors held together by tiny threads of candied angel hair squash. <em>Gazpachuelo</em> (a hot fish soup) resembled an eye-popping still life in white (squid), black (potatoes mashed with squid ink), and red (candied tomato), moistened with an earthy-sweet cuttlefish broth. As an homage to the New World, an avocado gazpacho came garnished with frozen corn dust. The best? A shocking-pink beet and cherry gazpacho, with a funky backdrop accent of anchovies mediated by the smokiness of cured <em>queso de Ronda</em> sorbet. It was the soup of the century.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In his quest to perfect the science of chilling, Dani is now working with a university scientist to explore the culinary uses of liquid nitrogen. In his kitchen, this high-tech freezing agent accounts for such edible miracles as olive oil “carpaccio” (flash-frozen sliced olive oil that melts in the mouth) or a crisp frozen foam of poached quail eggs, with a texture akin to a savory frozen meringue.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">ALMOND GAZPACHO WITH FIGS AND EDIBLE FLOWERS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>AJO BLANCO CON HIGOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Ajo blanco,</em> literally white garlic, is a smooth almond and garlic gazpacho popular in the province of Málaga. Containing no tomatoes or other vegetables, it is essentially an almond and olive oil emulsion diluted with ice water and enlivened by vinegar. Very Moorish tasting and completely original, <em>ajo blanco</em> is classically garnished with peeled green muscat grapes. Modern chefs, however, use <em>ajo blanco</em> as a blank canvas. Here, inspired by the <em>ajo blanco</em> I tasted at a small restaurant in Valencia, the garnishes include a veritable bouquet of baby lettuces, fresh figs, and edible flowers. Following the modern Spanish tradition, the garnishes are arranged in soup bowls and the gazpacho is poured around them as guests look on. The dish is gorgeous, dramatic, and fabulously delicious.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2½ cups cubed day-old country bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup whole blanched almonds, finely ground in a food processor</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea), or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ cups chilled bottled spring water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup fragrant light extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups baby lettuces of different colors</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup edible flowers, broken into petals</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 fresh Black Mission figs, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Tiny Olive Oil Croutons (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_90">page 90</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the bread in a bowl. Add cold water to cover and let soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the bread, squeezing out the excess liquid, then crumble the soaked bread into a blender.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Add the almonds, garlic, salt, and 1 cup of the spring water to the blender and puree until a smooth paste forms. With the blender running at the highest speed, drizzle the olive oil through the feed tube until emulsified.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Scrape the almond mixture into a large bowl. Whisk in the vinegar and the remaining ½ cup spring water. The consistency should be that of very thick cream or very thin mayonnaise. Taste for seasoning, adding a little more vinegar and/or salt as necessary. Transfer the soup to a pretty glass pitching and refrigerate it, covered, for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to develop.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> To serve, pile small heaps of the lettuce in the middle of soup bowls and top each with flower petals, 2 fig quarters, and some croutons. Bring the pitcher to the table and pour the soup around the lettuce and figs in each bowl. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Admittedly, elaborately garnished gazpachos are more of a formal restaurant thing. At home and in neighborhood bars, most people drink the cold soup from a glass just like a smoothie. But this isn’t to say that gazpacho’s smooth creaminess doesn’t invite all kinds of playful toppings. The most traditional restaurant garnish consists of diced vegetables and sometimes tiny croutons. Slivered herbs, such as basil and mint, are another good way to add a refreshing note. Ditto diced fruit, such as green apple, melon, or seedless grapes cut in half. More adventurously, gazpachos are magical when topped with a scoop of savory ice cream, tart sorbet, or an herbal granita. Aromatic, infused green oils, such as basil or parsley oil, make another terrific flourish, as does a simple swirl of fruity olive oil or a drizzle of syrupy aged balsamic vinegar. And don’t forget seafood: A small pile of crabmeat; a nice plump seared, poached, or grilled scallop or shrimp; a sweet nugget of lobster; or a small zesty jolt of seviche, if you happen to have some on hand, would all be welcome.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">SPICY GAZPACHO SORBET WITH BALSAMIC DRIZZLES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SORBETE DE GAZPACHO CON VINAGRE DE MODENA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Adventurous savory ice creams and sorbets are one of the hallmarks of Spanish <em>nueva cocina.</em> And what lends itself better to the ice cream maker than gazpacho? This version gets an extra punch from hot sauce and vodka. I can’t think of anything more vibrant and fun to start off a summer meal. Scooped into martini glasses, it forms a whimsical “soup course” that can be passed around in small glasses at a cocktail party. Or—as is often done in Spain—it can accompany shellfish or fish. How about serving gazpacho sorbet in a shot glass or on a porcelain spoon topped with a raw oyster or clam, a grilled shrimp, or a rolled-up anchovy? Or pair a scoop of the sorbet with grilled slices of rare tuna or tuna tartare.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the sorbet contains very little sugar (which normally acts as a stabilizer), it will freeze solid and crystallize somewhat if left in the freezer for too long. Try not to freeze the sorbet for more <a id="page_105"/>than two to three hours; if you must make it further ahead, leave it out at room temperature for twenty to thirty minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SORBET:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 very ripe but firm tomatoes (about 1½ pounds), seeded and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup cubed day-old country bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 envelope unflavored gelatin (2¼ teaspoons)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped red bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped celery</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped red onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small garlic clove, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chilled vodka</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons Tabasco sauce, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE GARNISHES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons syrupy aged balsamic vinegar, or ⅓ cup thin balsamic vinegar reduced over medium-high heat to 2 tablespoons and cooled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely diced peeled Granny Smith apple</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely diced red bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely diced cucumber</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely slivered fresh mint</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the sorbet: Place the tomatoes in a sieve set over a bowl and let them drain for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the bread in a bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain the bread and squeeze out the excess liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the gelatin in a small bowl, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cold water over it, and let stand for 5 minutes. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons very hot water and stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the drained tomatoes, soaked bread, dissolved gelatin, red and green peppers, celery, onion, garlic, vodka, corn syrup, olive oil, sherry vinegar, and Tabasco sauce in a bowl and toss to mix. Working in two batches, place the tomato mixture in a food processor and process until smooth. Once each batch is finished, puree it finely in a blender, then transfer it to a mixing bowl. Refrigerate the gazpacho, covered, until very cold, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Stir the gazpacho, then freeze it in an ice cream maker following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer the gazpacho sorbet to a plastic container and place it in the freezer for about 2 hours—but not much longer or the sorbet will crystallize. (If making the sorbet ahead, let it stand a room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Scoop the sorbet into large shot glasses or small martini glasses.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA DE SANDIA Y TOMATES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Want a soup that’s even simpler than a gazpacho and just as refreshing during the dog days of summer? Here’s a recipe from Hisop, an impossibly stylish small restaurant in Barcelona, whose playful chefs Guillem Pla and Oriol Ivern are enamored of soups made with raw vegetables and fruit. “Liquid salads” is what they call them, insisting they have to be made fresh and served right away. The effect is somewhere between a soup and smoothie. In Spain, the blending is done in a miraculous kitchen gadget called a Thermomix (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">box</a>) which produces unbelievably smooth purees. As with gazpachos, I use both a food processor and a blender, but you can certainly get away with just the food processor. For garnish, I like just a touch of slivered basil, but you can play with the soup, topping it with Tiny Olive Oil Croutons (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_90">page 90</a>), with julienned mint and/or fresh ginger, or with edible flowers.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 cups cubed, seeded, ripe but firm watermelon</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3a">CHILLED POTATO AND BACON SOUP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPA FRIA DE PATATA Y BEICON</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is another elegant chilled soup from Basque chef Martin Berasategui, this one made with salt-baked potatoes and bacon-infused cream, blended together into a luscious, extra-smooth potion. Shavings of white summer truffles make it truly luxurious, but if that’s too much of an indulgence, use just the truffle oil. Baking the potatoes on a bed of salt gives them a faint smokiness and a nicely concentrated flavor. However, you can also boil them in their skins until tender, then drain and peel them before mashing them with the cream.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ to 2 cups kosher salt, plus more coarse salt (kosher or sea) for seasoning the soup</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 ounces smoky slab bacon, cut into 3 or 4 pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>White truffle oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small white truffle (optional), shaved with a mandoline or a vegetable peeler</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh chives or chervil, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place a layer of kosher salt in a large, heavy ovenproof skillet (preferably cast-iron). Prick the potatoes with a fork, then arrange them on top of the salt. Bake the potatoes, turning them once, until they feel completely tender when pierced with a skewer, about 50 minutes. Let cool.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the potatoes are baking, place the cream, chicken stock, and bacon in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover the saucepan and let cook over very low heat for 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the cream infuse, covered, for about 40 minutes. Strain the cream mixture into a bowl, discarding the bacon.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> When the potatoes are just cool enough to handle, cut them in half, scoop out the flesh, and place it in a bowl, discarding the skins. Mash the potatoes finely with a potato ricer or a sturdy fork. Working in two batches, puree the potatoes in a blender, adding half of the bacon-infused cream to each batch. Run the blender in quick pulses, pureeing the potatoes just until smooth; do not overblend them or they will become gummy. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, season them with salt and white pepper to taste, and chill for 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> To serve, divide the soup among glasses or bowls, drizzle truffle oil over each portion, and garnish with a few slices of truffle, if using, and the chives. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="sb-noindent">The texture of Spanish cooking changed forever when Ferran Adrià popularized a kitchen gadget called the Thermomix. Now, not only every chef but also many middle-class home cooks have one in their kitchen. Made by a German company called Vorwerk, this space-age kitchen slave with a monster motor can perform a shocking number of tasks. It blends, whips, and kneads. It measures and weighs; it chops, pulverizes, simmers, and steams. And it performs most of these things brilliantly. Warm emulsions—cooked right in the machine—are creamier than anything you’ve tasted before. Gazpachos come out improbably silky and foamy. Ice creams are airy and smooth. Got a grand? Thermomix might now be available near you (try <a class="nounder" href="http://www.thermomix.com/en/home/">thermomix.com</a>). As for me, while I wait for the price to come down, I use my prehistoric food processor and blender, in combination, to approximate these twenty-second-century textures.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">FISH STOCK FOR SOUPS, RICES, AND SEAFOOD DISHES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CALDO DE PESCADO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">A good strong fish stock will lend a special marine smack to a number of soups, seafood dishes, and rices in this book. While you can always doctor a mixture of bottled clam juice and water with a few mussels and shrimp shells, real fish stock is easy to make and will keep for a long time in the freezer. You don’t need expensive fish to make stock: Just ask your fishmonger for fish trimmings, such as heads, tails, and frames. Black <a id="page_109"/>bass, grouper, rock cod, halibut, and especially the gelatinous monkfish tails will all work, but avoid oily fish like salmon or bluefish. For extra flavor, I like to toss in a couple of blue crabs and some mussels, as well as cheap small fish like porgy, mullet, whiting, or ocean perch. Chinatown fish markets—if there’s one in your area—are a good source of inexpensive, but very fresh, fish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 large garlic cloves, unpeeled and smashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large carrot, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 pounds fish frames, heads, and tails, thoroughly rinsed under cold running water, gills trimmed and discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound inexpensive small fish (see headnote), cleaned, gutted, and scaled (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 mussels, scrubbed and debearded right before using (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 blue crabs (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large parsley sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large heavy soup pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, and carrot and cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant and the vegetables begin to soften, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the fish frames, whole fish, and the tomatoes, cover, and cook until the fish is opaque and the tomatoes have thrown off some of their juices, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 11 cups water and the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil, thoroughly skimming off the foam. Add the mussels and crabs, if using, and the parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, until the stock is flavorful, about 30 minutes. If you’d like stronger-tasting stock, reduce it over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pot or bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids, taste the stock, and adjust the amount of salt and pepper. If using the stock right away, skim off as much fat as you can. Otherwise, place the stock, covered, in the refrigerator and remove the fat when chilled. The stock will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days and can be frozen for up to 3 months. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 10 TO 12 CUPS</strong></span></p>
