<p class="tx2"><b>This makes a fairly small batch of pickles that can be kept in the fridge. There is no need to sterilise the bottles or make the vegetables too salty or vinegary in order to preserve them. I prefer not to cook them as I like the crunch in this method of pickling. They never last long in our house as we love to eat them with cheeses or salami, cured meats or on mixed plates of antipasti.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 12–14 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) vegetables, such as (bell) peppers, carrots, cucumber, cauliflower, green beans, celery, radish</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) fine salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>FOR THE PICKLING LIQUID</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz/scant 2 tablespoons) caster (superfine) sugar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2¼ cups) hot water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>10 black peppercorns</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ teaspoon dried chilli flakes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2¼ cups) white wine vinegar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 bay leaf</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 fat garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces of similar scale. I like to cut the carrots into batons to avoid the school canteen look, the cauliflower into small florets and the peppers into strips. Cucumbers are best deseeded and green beans cut into manageable lengths. Toss them in a large plastic or glass bowl with the salt, then put a side plate on top of the vegetables, inside the bowl. Weigh the plate down with a milk carton or some jars and store in the fridge for 8 hours.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, make the pickling liquid. Put the sugar in a small saucepan with the water and spices. Heat for 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon until the sugar has dissolved and its crystals can’t be felt as you stir. Pour the sugary water into a large plastic or glass bowl and add the vinegar, bay leaf and garlic. Stir through, cover and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove the vegetables from the fridge and wash them in cold water. Taste them and if they are still very salty leave them to soak in a bowl of cold water for around 30 minutes. Taste again and, when they are just right, drain away the water. Tip the vegetables into the bowl with the vinegary mixture, stir through and cover. Transfer to the fridge to chill overnight.</p>
<p class="tx">The pickles are now ready to eat or can be stored in very clean jars in the fridge for up to a month. Make sure the vegetables are always covered with the liquid or they will begin to dry out.</p>
