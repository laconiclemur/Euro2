<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000594"><em class="calibre9">Juego de ranas</em> is a popular game in the north of Spain where you throw coins into the mouth of an iron frog. All the bars have it, and, in summer, everyone plays on the street. Club Ranero (‘the frog club’) used to be famous years ago and would hold a tournament.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000595">This recipe comes from the traditional Basque dish <em class="calibre9">bacalao pil pil</em>. The classic method is to put the salt cod, skin side up, into a terracotta pan and pour in enough olive oil to just cover the fish, along with crushed garlic, a bay leaf and chilli. As it cooks over a medium-low heat, the gelatine from the cod and the olive oil emulsify like a mayonnaise. When you see how it starts to change, it’s almost like magic.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000596">The story is that the chef at Club Ranero was making <em class="calibre9">bacalao pil pil</em> but there were too many people and he was short of sauce – so he made a new version, with peppers.</p>

<h5 class="serves">FOR 4–6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000597">500g salt cod, cut into 4 pieces and desalinated for 24 hours (see <a href="part0077.html#pg109" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000598">50ml extra virgin olive oil, plus at least 400ml to confit the cod</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000599">4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000600">3 onions, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000601">1 x 220g tin of <em class="calibre9">piquillo</em> peppers, drained</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000602">16 Padrón peppers, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000603">3 dried <em class="calibre9">choricero</em> peppers, soaked for a couple of hours, then blended to a paste</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000604">2 dried chillies, soaked for a couple of hours, then blended to a paste</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000605">2 bay leaves</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000606">First desalinate the cod (see <a href="part0077.html#pg109" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>).</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000607">Put 50ml of olive oil into a pan on a medium-low heat. Add the garlic, onions, peppers, <em class="calibre9">choriceros</em>, chillies and the bay leaves, and cook until the mixture becomes sweet and paste-like.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000608">Add the cod to the pan, skin side up, plus enough olive oil to cover it, and lower the heat. If it is too hot the oil becomes thin; if you see the oil start to change, turn off the heat and keep it moving – it’s like a dance. Swish the pan around until the oil emulsifies, the colour changes and everything becomes sticky. Serve with bread, to scoop up the juices.</p>
