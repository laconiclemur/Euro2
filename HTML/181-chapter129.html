<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Pork and cuttlefish or squid might seem like an unlikely couple in many kitchens, but they are a popular pair along much of the Mediterranean coast, and are found together in other recipes, such as traditional “mixed” paella and squid stuffed with fresh pork sausage.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a bowl, blend the ground meats, egg, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Season with salt. Add the breadcrumbs and work into a smooth paste. Moisten your hands with wine and roll the mixture into 1-inch-/2.5-cm-diameter meatballs with about 1-tablespoon portions.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and brown the meatballs, turning frequently, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Add the onion to the cazuela and cook over medium heat until it begins to soften and turn pale, about 5 minutes. Add the cuttlefish, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook until it has thrown its liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until pasty, about 20 minutes, dribbling in 2 or 3 tablespoons water once or twice during cooking to keep it from drying out.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Return the meatballs to the pan, cover with the wine and stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Meanwhile, prepare a picada with the almonds, hazelnuts, bread, and the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Stir the picada into the meatballs and add the peas. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, or until the cuttlefish is tender and the sauce has the consistency of thick gravy. Season with pepper. Serve from the cazuela.</p>
