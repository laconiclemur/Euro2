			<p class="rec-intro">Although this might not sound like a French dish, it employs French classic techniques and has become an indulgent favourite at Le Gavroche over the years. We like to present it in the rather spectacular fashion shown in the photograph opposite but if you prefer, simply serve the pieces of lobster on the lemon purée and pour in the warm bisque. </p>

			<p class="body">First make the lemon purée. Bring the sugar and water to the boil to make the stock syrup and set it aside. Put the lemons in a pan of cold water, bring to the boil, then drain. Repeat 10 times, adding fresh water each time, then set them aside until cool enough to handle. Cut the lemons open and remove any pips, then place them in a blender – skin and all –and purée until smooth, adding some of the stock syrup to taste and a little salt. The purée should be sharp so be careful not to add too much syrup. The purée sets when it is cool and keeps well for several weeks. </p>
			<p class="body">Bring a huge pan of salted water to the boil, add the lobsters and cook them for 4 minutes. Remove them from the pan and leave to cool. Once the lobsters are cool enough to handle, take off their heads and set them aside. Crack the bodies and claws, remove the flesh and cut it into into bite-sized pieces. Keep the tails and tips of heads for garnishing the dish.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the bisque, put the remains of the lobsters (not the heads) in a pan with any juices and a little olive oil. Add the chopped shallots, carrot, celery, garlic, piment d’Espelette and lemon grass. Cook gently for 6–7 minutes, then add the brandy and stir to deglaze the pan, followed by the white wine and the mirin. Continue to cook until the liquid has almost evaporated, then add the fish stock and tomato paste. Simmer for 20 minutes, then pass through a fine sieve. Tip the soup back into the pan and boil to reduce the liquid by half, then stir in the coconut cream and double cream. </p>
			<p class="body">Gently reheat the lobster meat in the melted butter and check the seasoning. Serve the lobster on a bed of lemon purée with white asparagus or salsify and slithers of fresh coconut, then pour in the warm bisque. I sometimes like to serve this with some seaweed pasta as well (see <a href="part0010_split_033.html#seaweed-pasta">here</a>).</p>
