<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Many fishmongers and some supermarkets now sell baby squid, not more than 2½ inches long, cleaned and ready to cook; and some also sell little sachets of concentrated squid ink. (When cuttlefish or squid sense predators, they squirt the ink that is stored in sacs to fend off attack, but there is hardly enough ink to cook with.) You can buy good enough ready-made fish stock in gourmet markets, so this dish is easy to make. Rinse and drain the squid, and cut the bodies into slices. If you are using squid that has not been cleaned, see the instructions on page 127.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Serve this dish with fried or toasted bread, or with plain white long-grain rice or vermicelli (see the variation) and with garlic mayonnaise (page 141). The long-grain rice grown in Andalusia and Extremadura has become popular now for making plain rice, as has basmati.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 large tomato or 2 medium, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">1½ cups fish stock</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 or 2 packets (4 grams each) squid ink</p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds cleaned baby squid</p>
<p class="qun">Plain rice (optional; recipe follows)</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley (optional)</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the onion in 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan, covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until soft and golden.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the aroma rises and it just begins to color, then add the tomato and cook, stirring often, for 5 to 8 minutes. Add the wine, fish stock, sugar, and some salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, then add the squid ink. (Some people blend the sauce with an immersion blender, or in a regular blender, but I like it as it is.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, slice the squid body into rings about ⅓ inch thick. Fry with the tentacles in the remaining oil in a large skillet over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring and turning the pieces.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Drop the squid with their juices into the ink sauce and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve hot, over the rice if serving it, sprinkled, if you like, with the parsley.</p>
