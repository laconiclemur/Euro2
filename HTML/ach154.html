<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pesce azzurro alla griglia</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">As a kid, I found it exhausting to eat around the bones in fish. However, this recipe for bluefish was so tasty it was impossible to resist. In this recipe the bluefish is butterflied—meaning it is left whole, sliced in half lengthwise, and opened up flat on the baking or broiling pan. This way the fish cooks quite quickly and does not require turning to brown evenly. I serve pasta with sauce, such as <a class="nounder" href="ach65.html#page_129">Tomato Sauce with Mushrooms</a> or <a class="nounder" href="ach78.html#page_150">Spaghetti with Tomato and Tuna</a>, before the bluefish. Sautéed mushrooms and a crisp salad make excellent side dishes for this main course.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 3-pound bluefish, cleaned and scaled (fins, head, and tail removed), and butterflied</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup plain bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Lemon wedges for garnish (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil. Place the fish on the foil and sprinkle with the lemon juice. In a small bowl, mix the bread crumbs, garlic, and parsley. Gradually add the olive oil, stirring with a fork, until the ingredients stick together. Evenly spread the bread crumb mixture over the fish. Arrange the lemon slices in a slightly overlapping line down the middle of the bluefish, on top of the bread crumb mixture. Bake until the fish flakes away from the bone, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_309"/><span class="red">3.</span> Remove from the oven. Set the oven on broil and return the fish to the oven. Broil for about 2 minutes or until the bread crumbs are lightly toasted. Remove from the oven and serve immediately, garnished with lemon wedges if you like.</p>
