			<p class="rec-intro">Calves’ brains are considered a great delicacy in France and can be prepared in a number ways – I like to blanch the brains, then fry them until golden brown as in this recipe. Zingara means gypsy woman and to serve a dish à la zingara means with a sauce containing mushrooms, ham and tomatoes. </p>

			<p class="body">Rinse the brains in cold water, then put them in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt and a splash of vinegar to keep the brains white. Quickly bring the water to the boil, then immediately turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer for 5 minutes. Leave to cool, then gently remove the brains, drain them well and pat dry with a clean cloth.</p>
			<p class="body">Make sure the mushrooms are clean. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan, add the mushrooms and a squeeze of lemon, then cover and cook until tender. Cut the mushrooms into slices or matchsticks and keep the cooking liquid to add to the sauce. Cut the ham into pieces similar in size to the mushrooms. Dice the tomatoes. </p>
			<p class="body">To make the sauce, sweat the chopped shallots in a little butter, then deglaze the pan with the white wine. Add the mushroom cooking liquid and the veal jus, then reduce to a sauce consistency. Finish with a tablespoon of butter and seasoning, then add the mushrooms, ham, tomato and finally the snipped tarragon. Keep warm.</p>
			<p class="body">Using a small knife, remove any sinew from the brains and cut them into slices. Dust in seasoned flour and gently fry the brains in a tablespoon each of oil and butter until golden brown – 3 or 4 minutes on each side. Serve with lots of the sauce and the potatoes.</p>
			<p class="for-the">pommes macaire</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Wash the potatoes, place them on a bed of rock salt in a baking tray and bake for 40 minutes or until cooked. Leave to cool, then cut them in half and scoop out the flesh. Mash the flesh with a fork and add the 30g of butter, cream, herbs, egg yolk and seasoning. Shape into little potato cakes about 5cm across by 2cm high, dust with flour, then fry in oil and butter until golden and hot. </p>
