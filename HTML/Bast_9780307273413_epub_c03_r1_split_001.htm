  <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span> I<span class="small1">RONICALLY, IT WAS AN AMERICAN WHO FIRST TOOK ME INTO THE</span> heart of the small mountainous region of Valle d’Aosta, in the northwest corner of Italy, back in 1985. And for that pleasure I am always grateful to my dear friend Dr. Paul Mandala. Paul was a great pediatrician (now retired) who adored Italian wines and food. He comes from a Sicilian background, but his love affair with Italian gastronomy blossomed during his years of medical study in Bologna.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the 1980s, long before culinary tours of Italy were a big business, Dr. Paul organized Italian wine-and-food dinners for a group of fellow food-loving physicians in New York (which is how I met him), and every year he would take them to a different area of Italy to eat and explore. One year, Valle d’Aosta was the destination, and he invited me to come with them. I had never been, and I accepted.</p>

  <p class="indent">Paul loved Valle d’Aosta and was intimately familiar with its spectacular terrain, set in the western Alpine range, surrounded by four of the highest mountains in Europe, Monte Bianco (Mont Blanc), Monte Rosa, Cervino (the Matterhorn), and Monte Gran Paradiso.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though Valle d’Aosta is best known as a winter tourist attraction, it was spring when we drove north from Torino, climbing steadily toward Courmayeur, underneath Monte Bianco. The rolling hills were emerald green, and the mountains ash gray, topped with glaring snowcaps under the spring sun. It was clear why one could fall in love with this beautiful, almost humbling setting. Paul had found us the perfect inn, a small chalet that looked up at the southern face of Monte Bianco. I will never forget the rumbling of an avalanche from that majestic peak, right across from my chalet window—the distant rocks rolling down the mountainside like jelly beans from a pile.</p>

  <p class="indent">We had a great time traveling around Valle d’Aosta that spring. We visited Alpine vineyards; we made friends with the local bovines and drank their freshly yielded milk, alive with the flavors of the Alpine spring pastures. We ate the complex fontina cheese, and dunked our grilled <em class="calibre4">polenta tarragna</em> into the creamy <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> at the dinner table. And, most memorably, we sang local folk songs in front of the fireplace, while passing around the <em class="calibre4">grolla.</em> The perfect symbol of our group’s journey, the <em class="calibre4">grolla</em> is a deep, lidded bowl, carved from local walnut wood, with a ring of small drinking spouts sculpted all around the bowl.</p>

  <p class="center"><a class="calibre8" id="page68"></a><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_030_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page69"></a>The many spouts of a <em class="calibre4">grolla</em> are the reason it is also known as a <em class="calibre4">coppa dell’amicizia</em>, the cup of friendship. As is the custom in Valle d’Aosta, our <em class="calibre4">grolla</em> was filled with a nearly boiling mixture of freshly brewed coffee, red wine, grappa, sugar, and lemon peels, and capped tightly with the beautifully engraved lid. As we passed it around, every one of us took a sip from one of the spouts. We learned quickly that the <em class="calibre4">grolla</em> should be held like a precious commodity, in both hands, and passed carefully—and passed again, and again, until there is no more. Friendship is sealed!</p>

  <p class="indent">I have made several visits to Valle d’Aosta in the years since Dr. Paul took us into the Alps. And I’ve come to understand that the cuisine of Valle d’Aosta, though it obviously reflects the influence of the bordering cuisines of France to the north and Piemonte to the south, definitely has a quality all its own.</p>

  <p class="indent">Soups are a main staple, dense and nourishing, such as the Soup with Bread and Fontina <em class="calibre4">Pasticciata</em>. Polenta accompanies many dishes, from <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> to meat and vegetables (see Polenta with White Beans and Black Kale). Risottos are made with the seasonal flavors of the mountains; for instance, in the fall, Rice and Chestnuts—<em class="calibre4">Riso e Castagne</em> could be a main course, or a dessert if sweetened. Game and meats, such as beef prepared as <em class="calibre4">Filetto alla Carbonade</em> and <em class="calibre4">Socca</em>, you’ll find are unique.</p>

  <p class="indent">But the flag dish of this region is <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em>, a melted fontina-cheese sauce that goes well with everything from polenta to vegetables and meats. And when you combine and stuff veal chops with fontina, you have the delicious <em class="calibre4">Costolette alla Fontina</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cheese is used a lot in Valle d’Aosta cooking, especially fontina. The fontina cheese is produced only in Valle d’Aosta. Somewhat different from other cheeses, fontina is a semi-cooked, semi-hard cheese made from the whole milk of the first milking of the cows. The rind is thin, and the paste is creamy, soft, and elastic. Its color is light straw to yellow, its taste is sweet, and to be a DOP it must contain 45 percent fat. It must be produced exclusively from the Valdostana breed, which feed on the local herbs and forage.</p>

  <p class="indent">The most prominent species of cows, which yield the rich milk for the production of fontina, are the dappled red, which from a distance seem like moving freckles on the mountainsides. The milk of all-black and dappled white-and-black cows is also used in making fontina.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page70"></a>My close encounter with these wonderful animals was when I asked Pietro Vallet, from Caseificio Pietro Vallet e Figli in Donnas, a small producer of fontina, to take me to the source, the fountain of goodness from which he made his delicious fontina. Up the hills we went to visit the pastures of Matilde, who runs a mother-and-son milk operation. I felt as if I were Heidi in my favorite book when I was a child. The pasture was sprinkled with these beautiful animals, peacefully grazing. Now and then the sound of the big Alpine cowbell chimed in the silence. When I asked Matilde why only a few of the cows had the bells—we could have had a symphony if they’d all had bells—she said, “Ah, only the leaders have bells, so the rest can follow.” They were so peaceful and secure that my coming barely evoked curiosity. I was more curious than they. Matilde noticed that I wanted to get closer to them, so she signaled with her hand for me to go among them, and slowly I did. They acknowledged me—some with just a look, but others came close enough to lick my hands and arms. Their raspy warm tongues were like a caress, and they seemed to know how I appreciate their hard work.</p>

  <p class="indent">On those initial trips, I was dubious about the quality of the wines at this high altitude, but, with each subsequent visit and tasting, it became clear that this challenging terrain, where the vines grow low, clinging to the rocks, produces some very interesting and delicious wines.</p>

  <p class="indent">The DOC reds are the Dommas, Chabave Rosso, and Nuss Rosso, and the whites are Blanc de Morgex, Bianco, and the sweet Nus Malvisie Fletri. A wonderful local producer, whom I discovered in my early visits, is Constantino Charrere from the winery Les Cràtes in Aymavilles. I have been there many times now, and carry his wines in our restaurants in the States. His passion is evident in his wines and in his words: <em class="calibre4">“Il nostro vino à la montagna che si fa bere. La Valle d’Aosta, i nostri vigneti e i nostri uomini contribuiscono alla realizzazione di questa stupefacente magia”</em> (“The mountain is the wine we drink. The Valle d’Aosta, our vineyards, and our people make the realization of this stupefying magic a reality”).</p>

  <p class="extract">This terrific dish brings into one bowl three essential Italian foods: polenta, cannellini, and the unique variety of kale called <em class="calibre4">cavolo nero</em>—one of my favorite vegetables. The customary green in Tuscan <em class="calibre4">ribollita, cavolo nero</em> has an earthy mouth-filling flavor, as if cabbage, broccoli, chickory, and spinach were all packed into one leaf. Fortunately, this delicious and healthful vegetable is now being grown and sold in this country under a variety of names, including <em class="calibre4">lacinata</em>, or dinosaur kale (for the texture of the leaves), and black kale (for their dark hue). In this recipe, <em class="calibre4">cavolo nero</em> is braised with bacon and cannellini and served atop hot polenta. But you can just braise it with bacon, following the same basic procedure, and serve it as a delicious side dish, or enjoy it in crusty bread as a great sandwich filling.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A 3-quart pot for cooking the beans; a heavy-bottomed 3- or 4-quart saucepan with a cover for cooking the polenta; a heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger, with a cover</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the beans: Drain the soaked beans and put them in the pot with fresh cold water covering them by an inch or so; add the bay leaves and olive oil. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to keep the liquid simmering steadily, and cook, partially covered, about 40 minutes or until the beans are just cooked through, but not mushy. Turn off the heat, stir in ½ teaspoon salt, and let the beans cool for a while in the pot, absorbing some of the cooking liquid.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the polenta: Pour the water and olive oil into the heavy pot, drop in the salt and bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Pick up the polenta by handfuls and let it rain into the water through your fingers, whisking steadily with a sturdy wire whisk, until it is all incorporated. Return the polenta to a boil over medium heat, still whisking. When big bubbles start bursting, lower the heat to keep the polenta <a class="calibre8" id="page73"></a>perking, and set the cover ajar on the pot. Stir frequently with the whisk or wooden spoon, scraping the bottom and sides of the pot as the cereal thickens. Cook for about 25 minutes or until the polenta is glossy and pulls away from the sides as you stir; for this dish it should be soft, not too firm. Turn off the heat and cover the pot to keep the polenta hot.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the kale: Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the skillet, set it over medium heat, and scatter in the bacon. Cook, stirring occasionally, as the bacon sizzles and renders most of its fat, 4 or 5 minutes. Pile the shredded kale in the pan, sprinkle the salt over it, put on the cover, and cook, tossing the kale a couple of times, until the shreds have wilted, about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Uncover the skillet, and stir in the cooked cannellini, along with about a cup (not all) of the bean cooking liquid and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or more, until the kale is tender. Stir in more bean liquid as needed to keep the greens and beans from drying.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the kale and beans are ready, stir half of the shredded fontina into the hot polenta. Spoon portions of polenta into warm shallow bowls, then top each with kale and beans and a sprinkling of fontina. Serve right away, while very hot.</p>

    <p class="center"><strong class="calibre13">R<span class="small1">EAL</span> F<span class="small1">ONTINA</span></strong></p>

    <p class="textbox1">For this <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> and many other recipes in this chapter, I always recommend using genuine fontina from Valle d’Aosta. With superb flavor, texture, and melting ability, this cow’s-milk cheese is unsurpassed in these dishes, far superior to the inexpensive cheeses called fontina produced outside of Italy, including American and Scandinavian versions.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">Fortunately, imported authentic fontina is widely available in markets with good cheese departments and from gourmet Internet vendors. Be sure that you are buying DOP (name-protected) fontina, with the distinctive imprint of an Alpine peak on the wheel. Though more expensive than other semi-soft cheeses, it is well worth the cost.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">If DOP fontina isn’t available, a less distinctive but similar cheese called Fontal, imported from Italy, is a good substitute.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Fonduta alla Valdostana <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 6</p>

  <p class="extract">If you liked the fondues so popular in the 1960s—those pots or chafing dishes of melted cheese in which everyone dunked crudités, crackers, and bread—you will be thrilled to taste an authentic <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> as it is prepared in Valle d’Aosta. Though the technique of melting cheese over a low flame is much the same, the main ingredient makes all the difference: nothing compares to a fondue of authentic fontina, the sweet, nutty, semi-soft cheese made only in the Aosta Valley—and only from the milk of those gentle dappled red, brown, and black Valdostana cows.</p>

  <p class="indent">Customarily served as a dip for chunks of toasted bread, <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> is a great sauce for all kinds of foods. I like it on poultry and meats, such as poached chicken or turkey breast, or lightly seared veal medallions; or on vegetables—steamed asparagus, broccoli, cardoons, celery, and many more. And it’s delicious spooned over a bowl of hot polenta or boiled gnocchi.</p>

  <p class="indent">There’s one more thing I must tell you. <em class="calibre4">La sua morte</em>, as it is said in Italian, the ultimate pleasurable enjoyment of <em class="calibre4">fonduta alla Valdostana</em>, is to top it with shavings of fresh white Alba truffle from neighboring Piemonte. Two Italian treasures in one dish.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heap the shredded fontina in a glass or glazed ceramic bowl, and pour the milk over it. Stir to make sure the cheese is submerged, seal the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make toasts for dipping: Heat the oven to 350°. Slice the bread chunk or loaf lengthwise into big oval slabs about an inch thick. Cut these into small blocks, 3 to 4 inches long and 2 or 3 inches wide (the size of a BlackBerry or iPod!), that will afford a few good bites when dipped in the fondue. Lay the bread blocks flat on a baking sheet, and toast in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, turning now and then, until golden brown and crisp all the way through.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page75"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the <em class="calibre4">fonduta:</em> Stir the milk and cheese shreds (now softened and crumbling) and scrape them into the saucepan.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Beat the egg yolks and pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl with the whisk.

Now slowly drip the tempered yolk mixture back into the saucepan of <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em>, whisking rapidly, until fully incorporated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Still over low heat, cook the <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> slowly, without boiling, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until smooth and thickened, easily coating the back of a spoon (or a bread toast).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For serving, warm the small serving bowls (or the large one if serving communally), and pour in <em class="calibre4">fonduta</em> in equal portions.

  <p class="extract">What I love about this recipe is its simplicity. With a chunk of fontina or other fine cheese and some tasty vegetables—here I use slices of roasted peppers and green olives—you have the basis for a zesty Alpine salad any time of the year. Freshly roasted peppers are best, but you can use jarred peppers if you like. The creamy mustard dressing can be whipped up in seconds, but leave some time for the dressed salad to sit and the flavors to blend. (The cream gives the dressing a velvety texture, but you can replace it with a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon or two of skimmed milk.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To roast the peppers: Preheat the oven to 350°. Rub the peppers all over with 3 tablespoons olive oil, season with ½ teaspoon salt, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast for 30 minutes or so, turning the peppers occasionally, until their skins are wrinkled and slightly charred. Let the peppers cool completely. Slice them in half through the stem end, discard the stem, peel off the skin, and scrape out the seeds. Slice the peppers into ½-inch strips, and place them in a sieve to drain and dry. (If using jarred peppers, slice and drain the same way.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Slice the fontina into ¼-inch-thick slabs, then into ¼-inch matchsticks. Slice the olives lengthwise into ¼-inch slivers. Toss the sliced peppers, cheese, and olives together in a large bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the dressing: Whisk together the cream, mustard, cider vinegar, and remaining salt in a small bowl. Whisk in the remaining olive oil gradually, until the dressing is smooth and emulsified. Pour the dressing over the salad; toss and tumble to coat all the pieces. Let the salad sit at room temperature, so the flavors blend, for at least 15 minutes, then sprinkle over it the chopped parsley, toss again, and serve. (You can assemble and dress the salad an hour in advance and keep it refrigerated. Let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before adding the parsley and serving.)</p>

  <p class="extract">In many mountain regions of Italy, chestnuts have been cultivated and gathered as staple foods for generations. In Valle d’Aosta (with thousands of cows), it is customary to cook chestnuts and rice together in milk, a simple, nourishing dish that lends itself to many variations. Traditionally, <em class="calibre4">riso e castagne</em> was made as a light supper in the evening, especially for children before bedtime. The dish has a natural sweetness that kids love, and if you emphasize that quality with sugar, honey, or a swirl of jam, you have a lovely dessert or sweet brunch dish.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is just as easy, though, to take <em class="calibre4">riso e castagne</em> in a savory direction, as I do in this recipe. With a finish of fontina and <em class="calibre4">grana</em>, it becomes a rich-tasting chestnut-flavored <em class="calibre4">riso</em> or risotto, wonderful as a <em class="calibre4">primo</em> or as a main course. And if the same dish is cooked with more milk—or less rice—it becomes a comforting, creamy, and warming <em class="calibre4">zuppa</em>, which I am sure is much appreciated in the Alpine winter.</p>

  <p class="extract">Veal chops are always something of an extravagance, though worth it when well prepared. In this exciting recipe from Valle d’Aosta, thick rib chops are stuffed with the region’s prized fontina, browned, and braised on the stovetop, then baked. The result is quite grand, because the succulent meat and pan sauce are enriched with driblets and hidden pockets of sweet melted fontina. And if you want to go superluxe for a special occasion, shave fresh truffle on top of each chop just before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">To return to earth, however, let me point out that you can make <em class="calibre4">costolette alla fontina</em> in more modest versions that are absolutely delicious and much easier on the pocketbook. For instance, you can form veal scallopine into envelopes to enclose the fontina, or stuff a veal loin chop, a thick pork chop, or a plump chicken breast in place of the veal rib chop. You may have to adjust the amount of cheese you put inside, and adjust the cooking time at each step to avoid overcooking. But if your meat, wine, olive oil, tomato paste, and broth are of fine quality, and—most important—if you use real fontina (and Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), you will produce a splendid dish.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Trim the chops, leaving only a thin layer of fat. With a sharp, thin knife, slice horizontally into the outer edge of each chop, splitting the meaty portion in two almost all the way to the bone, forming a pocket for stuffing. With the mallet, pound and spread the meaty part, flattening it to ½-inch thickness. Lift the top flap of the meat you just sliced apart, hold it up, and pound the bottom flap of meat a few more times, spreading it thinner and wider than the upper flap. When all the chops are sliced and pounded, salt them on both sides, using a teaspoon in all.</p>

One at a time, lightly compress the cheese portions into oval patties, and slip them into the sliced chop pockets. Fold the larger bottom meat flap over the top flap—enclosing the cheese—and thread a toothpick through both flaps to keep them together. (The chops can be prepared up to this point a day in advance, sealed in plastic wrap, and refrigerated.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil in the big pan, and set over medium-high heat. Spread the flour on a plate, dredge each chop on both sides, shake off excess flour, and lay it in the pan. When all the chops are in the pan, drop the sage leaves in between them. Cook the chops for 5 minutes or more, turning them once or twice, until well browned on both sides.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Clear a space in the pan bottom, drop in the tomato paste, and toast it in the hot spot for a minute.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve right away—while the cheese is still oozing—arranging all the chops on a warm platter and spooning the sauce over, family-style, or on warm dinner plates with mashed potatoes alongside and sauce drizzled over.

  <p class="extract">In this version of <em class="calibre4">carbonade</em>, the beef-and-wine dish that is a hallmark of Valdostana cuisine, the principal elements are cooked independently. First, you prepare the sauce, cooking red wine with aromatic vegetables and herbs until complex in flavor and highly concentrated. Later, the beef tenderloin, the <em class="calibre4">filetto</em>, is skillet-roasted (on the stovetop) until crusted and caramelized outside and juicy inside—a simple cooking method that takes barely 15 minutes. Before serving, you deglaze the empty skillet with the wine sauce and blend in the butter. It is only on the serving platter that the beef and wine come together, yet the pairing is perfect.</p>

  <p class="indent">I particularly like this separately cooked wine sauce because it is as good with other meats as it is with the <em class="calibre4">filetto.</em> Try it with roasts, such as loin of pork or rabbit, or with game, such as tenderloin of venison or elk, seared like the beef tenderloin here.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A 4-quart saucepan with a cover; a sieve; kitchen twine; a heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the wine and water into the saucepan, and drop in the garlic, onion, carrot, celery, porcini, rosemary, and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil, set the cover ajar, adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer, and cook for an hour or more, until the vegetables have exhausted all their flavors and the liquid level has reduced by half.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the sieve over a bowl, and pour the entire contents of the saucepan into it, straining out the solids and collecting the sauce in the bowl. Press the vegetables with a big spoon to release more sauce (then discard them). Rinse the saucepan, pour the strained sauce back into it, and bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, adjusting the heat so the sauce reduces steadily without scorching, until thickened and flavorful, about 1½ cups in volume. Season with ½ teaspoon salt, and keep the sauce warm.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, tie loops of kitchen twine tightly around the filet to keep it compact, even in shape, and easier to handle. Tie the first loops an inch in from either end of the filet, and more loops at 2-inch intervals along its length.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page84"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you are ready to cook the filet, sprinkle the remaining teaspoon salt all over its surface. Pour the olive oil in the skillet, set it over medium-high heat, and put in the beef. Pan-sear the filet for 15 minutes—more or less, depending on how well done or rare you like it. Frequently roll and shift the tied meat in the pan, so it cooks and colors evenly on all sides, until crusty on the outside and medium-rare inside. Turn off heat, and put the filet on a warm plate.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To finish the sauce: Pour it all into the searing skillet, turn on the heat, and bring the liquid to a boil while scraping up all the browned bits from the skillet bottom. Stir to incorporate this flavorful glaze into the sauce as it heats.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> While the sauce is boiling, drop in the cold butter, one piece at a time, vigorously whisking each one to amalgamate it fully with the sauce before adding the next piece. When the last bit of butter has disappeared in the sauce, turn off the heat and stir in the honey until it disappears, too.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve: Slice the meat crosswise into ½-inch-thick slices, snipping and removing the twine loops as you cut. Drizzle some of the wine sauce on a warm rimmed serving platter, and arrange the beef slices on top of the sauce (or drizzle a couple spoonfuls of sauce on rimmed dinner plates and top with individual portions of sliced beef). Serve immediately, with remaining sauce in a bowl to be passed at the table.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Socca <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 8 or more</p>

  <p class="extract">Make this dish once and you will make it over and over. Everything about it is good. It requires only one big pan, and that one will contain a complete supper of meat, potatoes, and vegetable for at least eight and likely a dozen people. Best of all, everybody loves every bit that comes out of the pan.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em class="calibre4">Socca</em>, as this is called in Valle d’Aosta, is exactly what the English recipe name says: a big casserole with layers of sliced beef, sliced potatoes, and shredded cabbage (all nicely seasoned). It bakes for several hours, until all the layers are fork-tender, then it’s covered with a final layer of fontina, which bakes into an irresistibly crusty cheese topping. (Though it is unlikely you will have much left over, the dish will keep well for several days in the refrigerator; reheat it either on top of the stove or in the oven.)</p>

  <p class="indent">In Valle d’Aosta, the meat of choice in <em class="calibre4">socca</em> is beef or game; in my recipe, it’s a top-blade roast from the beef chuck (or shoulder). Since I am sure you will make this again, I suggest you try it with slices of pork shoulder (the butt roast) or lamb shoulder or lamb leg. These meats will be delicious in the casserole, too.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A food processor; a large baking dish or roasting pan, 5-quart capacity, 10 by 15 inches or larger</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, and heat to 425°. Using a food processor, mince the sage, rosemary, garlic, ¼ cup of the olive oil, and ½ teaspoon of the salt into a fine-textured <em class="calibre4">pestata.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the potato slices in a large bowl; sprinkle on top 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of the <em class="calibre4">pestata.</em> Toss well to coat the slices with the seasonings.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With a sharp knife, slice the beef across the grain into ¾-inch-thick slices—if using a top-blade roast, slice it crosswise. As you did with the potatoes, put the meat slices in a bowl and toss them with seasonings until well coated, using 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the <em class="calibre4">pestata.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Brush the roasting pan with the remaining olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter. Arrange half of the potato slices in a single layer on the pan bottom, spread half the cabbage shreds evenly over the potatoes, and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Distribute all the beef slices, in a single layer, over the cabbage. (The pan should be about half full: press down on the beef if it looks like you need more room for the rest of the vegetables.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Dot the top of the beef with small mounds of butter, using another 3 tablespoons in all. Lay the remaining potato slices on top of the beef slices, spread the rest of the cabbage evenly over the slices, and season with the remaining teaspoon of salt. Stir all of the remaining <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> into the white wine, and pour the wine all over the cabbage shreds. Finally, dot the top with the rest of the butter.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Tent the baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil, arching it above the food and pressing it against the sides of the pan. Set the dish in the oven, and bake about 2½ hours, until the meat and vegetables are all very tender and almost all of the liquid has been absorbed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the foil, and sprinkle the shredded fontina over the top of the potatoes and cabbage (which will have sunk down in the pan). Bake another 15 to 20 minutes, until the fontina has melted, bubbled, and browned into a crusty topping.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the casserole rest for 10 minutes. Set the roasting pan on a trivet at the table, and serve family-style, spooned onto dinner plates.</p>

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Biancomangiare</em> (known as “blancmange” in French and English) is a very old milk-pudding dessert that food historians say has been made since the Middle Ages, in countries from the Middle East to Scandinavia. I am delighted with this modern <em class="calibre4">biancomangiare</em>, which I had recently in Valle d’Aosta. Rich with cream, flavored with both vanilla bean and almond extract, and molded in individual ramekins, it is quite similar to panna cotta. So, if you and your family like panna cotta, you will love this, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">The puddings are lovely as is, unmolded onto plates, with their caramel syrup. They’re even better served with poached fruit in season, such as poached pears or cherries. For a special touch, have the poached fruit ready when you make the <em class="calibre4">biancomangiare.</em> Place a pear half or a few big cherries in the bottom of each ramekin or cup just before filling with the sweet pudding mixture. When you unmold it, the <em class="calibre4">biancomangiare</em> will be crowned with the fruit and glistening with caramel.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make caramel: Put 6 tablespoons of the sugar and ⅓ cup water in the small skillet, and set it over medium heat. Bring to a boil without stirring—the sugar will dissolve into a syrup. Let it bubble away without stirring or shaking the pan for 10 minutes or more as the syrup and the bubbles thicken, until the syrup starts to take on color, usually near the edge of the skillet. Lower the heat, and swirl the syrup so it caramelizes evenly. When it is a uniform copper color, carefully pour the hot caramel in equal amounts into the ramekins. Tilt and swirl each ramekin so the caramel coats the whole bottom evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the milk and cream into the saucepan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise, and scrape the sticky seeds into the milk. Stir in the remaining sugar; drop the split, scraped bean pod in, too. Set the pan over medium heat, and heat slowly to a simmer. Sprinkle in the gelatin, whisking constantly until completely dissolved, then turn off the heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the mixture cool to room temperature, stir in the almond extract, and pour through the strainer into a large, spouted measuring cup.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To unmold: run the tip of a paring knife around the edge of the ramekins, set a dessert plate on top, and invert—tap the ramekin if necessary to release the pudding.

  <p class="extract">This delightful pudding is a fine example of the art of using leftovers to make something fresh and new (without evidence of recycling). Here, crumbled biscotti, chopped chocolate, and chopped hazelnuts are mixed into the warm custard. As it cools and sets, the dry cookies absorb and meld with the custard, but also contribute their flavor and texture. This recipe is one upon which you can improvise, using whatever sweet remnants you have on hand, whether ginger snaps or shortbread cookies, or bits of dry sponge cake or pound cake.</p>
