  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page334"></a>THE TERRINE OF POULTRY LIVERS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Technically, a pâté is a preparation like the one below (more often based on game or duck flesh) enclosed in a pastry, into which, after having been cooked and cooled, meat jelly is poured. When the preparation is simply prepared in a terrine (a deep oval or oblong oven dish of earthenware, porcelain, or often, today, enameled ironware), it is named after its container. The terms have become so confused, even in France, that pâtés are often referred to as <em>pâtés en croûte</em> and terrines as pâtés; and any sort of meat paste or spread is also termed “pâté.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Chicken livers are the most easily obtainable on the market, but, when duck or goose livers are available, they are even better; don’t hesitate to mix up the three. Whatever the bird, if it is fat, the liver (which is then larger, softer, and a creamy-beige color rather than a dark reddish-brown) is better. The result, even with unfattened chicken livers, providing they are not frozen, is very fine indeed. It is among the simplest and best of terrine recipes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sour gherkins traditionally accompany terrines, but, in as much as wine accompanies them beautifully and suffers from any proximity to vinegar, it is perhaps best to eliminate the gherkins, leaving one’s guests with no choice.</p>

  <p class="indent">This terrine should be prepared the day before it is served, but, unlike many, it does not keep remarkably well, and once cut into, it should be consumed fairly rapidly (within a day or so).</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c24-s89"><em><span class="color">Terrine of Poultry Livers</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Terrine de Foies de Volailles</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 ounces fat salt side pork, rind removed (if it is not impeccable in quality, substitute fresh fat side pork—but not bacon)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 clove garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 healthy handful stale (but not dried out) crumbled white bread crumbs, made without crust</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup tepid milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium onion, finely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page335"></a><em>1 teaspoon mixed herbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 “heads” of cloves (the tiny round ball attached to extremity of each clove)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound poultry livers</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 bay leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Put the fat pork to chill, to facilitate cutting it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pound the garlic clove to a paste in the mortar, add the bread crumbs and the milk, mix together so that the garlic thoroughly impregnates the whole, and put aside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the chopped onion gently in butter for 10 minutes or so, or until it is yellowed and soft.</p>

  <p class="indent">Reduce the mixed herbs and clove heads to a powder in a stone mortar.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove any greenish, discolored sections from the livers (they give a bitter taste from their proximity to the gall bladder), and carefully pull loose all of the little, white, threadlike nerve tissue possible (in particular, that connecting the two “lobes”—don’t worry about crushing the livers). Gather together the picked-over livers on the chopping board and, with a large, heavy, sharp, French chef’s–type knife, cut through the mass several times, then, holding the knife freely above the board and using a rapid “rat-tat-tat” loose-wristed motion, chop them, gathering the mass back together and turning it over with the blade of the knife from time to time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove enough slices (sliced as thinly as possible) from the fat pork to line the bottom and the sides of the terrine and to cover the surface, once filled, and cut the rest into little cubes (cutting it first into ¼-inch strips lengthwise, and then, cutting them, gathered together, crosswise).</p>

  <p class="indent">Squeeze the bread to eliminate any excess liquid and, with the exception of the slices of pork fat and the two bay leaves, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, working them thoroughly together with both hands, squeezing the mixture repeatedly, through clutching fingers, until it is completely homogeneous. Taste for salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page336"></a>Line the bottom and the sides of the terrine with slices of fat pork, pressing them to ensure their adhering, pour in the liver mixture, tap the bottom of the terrine 2 or 3 times against a wooden surface to settle its contents, place the bay leaves on the surface, and lightly press the remaining fat pork slices on top. Cover the terrine (if it does not have a lid, fit over it a piece of aluminum foil) and poach it in a <em>bain-marie</em>, either in the oven (the terrine placed in a larger, deep pan, hot water poured in to immerse it by two-thirds) or on top of the stove (in a tightly covered saucepan large enough to contain the terrine, filled to two-thirds the terrine’s height with hot water), without allowing the water to boil, for from 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. (After an hour, test it by pressing in the center—if it is firm, it is done. It should remain, once cut, rose in color.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the terrine on a large platter, in a cake pan, etc., to collect any juices that run over the edge, and remove the lid or aluminum foil (don’t be alarmed at the quantity of liquid in which the contents seem to float—it is made up of gelatinous juices which will solidify in the terrine and of fat which will solidify on the surface). Place a board or a plate just the size of the terrine’s opening, on the surface, with a weight of from 1½ to 2 pounds on top—a can of conserves, for instance. The weighting lends a firm, close texture to the body, without which it would be impossible to neatly slice and serve the terrine. When cooled, remove the weight and put the dish to chill. Serve it in slices directly from the terrine, the border of fat pork removed from each slice or not, as preferred.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c24-s90"><em><span class="color">Deep-fried Beef Tripe, Rémoulade Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gras-double Frit, Sauce Rémoulade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ pounds precooked honeycomb tripe (usually the only part available—if whole tripe can be found substitute it; in France this is always sold precooked), cut into approximately 2-inch squares</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Marinade:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon fines herbes (parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon—or whatever is available)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page337"></a><em>juice of 1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>stale</em> (<em>but not dried out</em>) <em>firm-textured white bread, grated into crumbs</em> (<em>passed, if necessary, through a coarse sieve to render them uniform</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>olive oil for frying</em> (<em>a good quart</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 handful parsley bouquets (leaf bunches, stems removed, except for the part necessary to hold leaves together)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Sprinkle the squares of tripe with all the elements of the marinade and leave for an hour or so, turning them from time to time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Arrange 3 plates before you, the first containing flour, the second, the eggs, beaten as for an omelet, and the third, the bread crumbs. Dip the pieces, one by one, first lightly on both sides in the flour, then on both sides, being certain that they are well coated, in the eggs, then in the crumbs, placing each piece on the bed of crumbs, sprinkling crumbs generously over the surface, and pressing lightly with the palm of the hand to ensure their adhering. Lift each from the crumbs and remove it to a board that has been lightly dusted with crumbs. Should any seem imperfectly breaded, pass them a second time in egg and crumbs. If one has the time, they may be breaded an hour or so before the meal, and are then less fragile when the moment comes to handle them.</p>

  <p class="indent">Drop them, one at a time, into very hot olive oil. Do not use a frying basket. (The heat may have to be lowered later, to prevent the oil’s overheating.) Fry no more than five at a time (if the frying pan is overcrowded, the temperature of the oil drops too radically, and at the same time the articles to be fried risk touching, sticking together, frying unevenly, and having their crisp surfaces damaged). When they are golden and crisp on one side, turn each over carefully with the prong tips of a fork, and, when evenly browned, lift them out with a large wire skimming spoon, sponge them lightly between two paper towels, and remove them to the folded napkin in which they will be served, while treating the others in the same way. When the last are removed from the oil, drop in the parsley bouquets and, as soon as the <a id="page338"></a>violent sizzling has stopped (after a few seconds), remove them, drain them, without sponging, on a paper towel, and sprinkle them over the fried tripe. Serve, enclosed in a folded napkin, and accompanied by the following <em>rémoulade</em> sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="heading_id_3"><em><span class="color">Rémoulade Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Sauce Rémoulade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Mayonnaise:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>something over 1 cup olive oil</em><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 anchovy fillet</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon capers</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 sour gherkins (or small, firm dill pickles)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon Dijon-type mustard</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon chopped fines herbes</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">It is said that, with a whip and a whir, all the ingredients thrown in at once, a perfect mayonnaise may instantaneously be produced in a blender. The method described here is the only one with which I am familiar at first hand. The olive oil should be of impeccable quality, and both it and the egg yolks must be at room temperature, not chilled. Vinegar may be used instead of lemon if the dish is not accompanied, for example, by a vinegar-dressed salad.</p>

  <p class="indent">Put the seasoning into a bowl (or better, a stone mortar, whose weight will prevent it from slipping around), add a few drops of lemon juice, stir, with either a wooden spoon or a wooden pestle, until the salt is dissolved, add the egg yolks, continue stirring until they lighten slightly in color, then start ad ding the oil, drop by drop, evenly and fairly rapidly, turning always in the same direction. As the egg yolks begin to absorb the oil and to show signs of developing “body,” the oil may be poured in a steady trickle, and finally in a fine stream. From time to time, the addition of oil should be stopped and a few drops of lemon juice added. Once all the oil has been absorbed (it need <a id="page339"></a>not all be added if the desired thickness is obtained before, but a cupful will probably be necessary), taste for lemon. Two teaspoons of hot water may be stirred in if the mayonnaise is not to be used at once—this is a safeguard against its “breaking.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Soak the anchovy fillet in cold water to desalt it, sponge it dry in a paper towel, and chop it finely. Rinse the capers, sponge them dry and chop them. Chop the gherkins finely. Stir these and all the other ingredients into the mayonnaise before serving.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE DANDELION AND SALT PORK (OR BACON) SALAD</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Young dandelions, gathered wild, are better than the giant bleached commercially raised variety, but either will do.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is absolutely essential that this salad be prepared the moment before it is served, that the salad bowl be hot (otherwise, the hot fat solidifies on contact with the cold bowl, and the result is distinctly unpleasant), and, in order for the dandelions to retain their freshness, that they be placed in the bowl just before the hot fat is poured in.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c24-s91"><em><span class="color">Dandelion and Salt Pork (or Bacon) Salad</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Salade de Pissenlit au Lard</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>12–14 ounces young dandelion plants, cut at the base of the root but kept intact</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 slices, each about ⅓ inch thick, of either slab bacon or lean salt side pork</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 2 <em>tablespoons wine vinegar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash the dandelion plants carefully, spreading the leaves at the base where earth often collects. Shake them as free as possible of water and dry them thoroughly between 2 towels.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page340"></a>Slice the bacon or salt pork crosswise into ½-inch sections, cover them with cold water, bring to a boil, simmer for 5 or 6 minutes, drain, and fry them in the olive oil over medium-low heat, turning the pieces around until they are lightly crisp on all sides and have rendered a couple of tablespoonfuls of fat. Put the dandelions into the preheated bowl, pour the bacon or pork and its fat over them, wash out the pan with the vinegar over a high flame and, the moment it boils, pour it over the salad. Sprinkle with very little salt (keeping in mind the saltiness of the pork), generously grind pepper over, toss and serve immediately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_5">THE STRAWBERRIES IN BEAUJOLAIS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Strawberries in wine are a common and much-loved dessert in all winemaking countries; usually the strawberries are simply presented at table and each guest fills his wineglass with berries, pours some more wine over, sugars to taste and lightly cuts up and mashes the berries so that their juice mingles with the wine. Those who are unfamiliar with the custom invariably shy away from what sounds like a bizarre combination, and one is obliged to exercise a bit of gentle blackmail by presenting the dessert intact.</p>

  <p class="indent">The extent to which the specific character of a wine comes through in the marriage is remarkable.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c24-s92"><em><span class="color">Strawberries in Beaujolais</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Fraises au Beaujolais</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound fresh, ripe strawberries</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sugar to taste</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>wine to cover</em> (<em>the same that has been drunk throughout the meal</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Pick over the strawberries, rinse them rapidly, drain them, and sprinkle them with sugar. Leave to macerate for an hour or so and, shortly before serving, pour enough wine over to just cover them.</p>
