<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 55 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2¼ pounds Idaho potatoes, unpeeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespons whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespons heavy cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1-inch piece horseradish, peeled, or 2 teaspoons wasabi paste</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to low, partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer 30 to 40 minutes, or until they are cooked through.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400°F. Drain the potatoes, then put them in a roasting pan and roast 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and as soon as the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and pass them through a strainer, using a ladle to help you, or through a food mill into a bowl. Cover the bowl and leave to one side but do not let the potatoes become cold or they will be gluey when they are mashed.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put the milk, cream and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Pour half the mixture into the potatoes and mix well, then gradually add the remaining liquid, stirring all the time. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then grate 2 teaspoons of the horseradish directly over the mash so you get all the juices. Alternatively, sprinkle with the wasabi paste. Serve hot.</p>
