I would also like to thank Noemi Guy for her skill at reading my scribbled lines on sauce-stained scrap paper; Cristian Barnett for capturing the taste of the food so perfectly on film; Miranda Harvey for her skilful eye, tips on how to relax a salad and making carrots disappear; Holly Clifton-Brown for the gorgeous illustrations; Polly Webb-Wilson for the beautiful choice of plates and her navigational skills; Jinny Johnson for being as passionate about good food as I am and for making </span><span class="italic">The French Kitchen</span><span class="char-style-override11"> delicious to read; Amanda Harris and Lucie Stericker at Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson for directing operations with such care and good humour; Gérard – my brother in law – for shooting straight and filling the freezer with game; and my neighbour Annie for the ‘mucky eggs’. </span><span class="char-style-override11"></span></p>
