<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pollo al mattone con limone e rosmarino</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In Italy it is customary for kitchens to include an indoor grill, where poultry and meat are prepared. To cook a whole chicken easily, it is butterflied and held down on the grill by a brick or a heavy pot. In this way the chicken cooks quickly and the meat stays tender and juicy. To butterfly a chicken, follow the simple instructions provided here, or ask the butcher to butterfly it for you.</p>
<p class="indentb">To accompany the chicken, I recommend serving roasted potatoes or roasted vegetables and sautéed broccoli rabe or escarole.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 3-pound free-range chicken, washed and patted dry, giblets discarded</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon very thinly sliced lemon zest</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, finely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon red pepper flakes</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> To butterfly the chicken, trim the wings at the second joint (reserve for making stock). Place the chicken, breast side down, on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife or poultry shears to cut along either side of the backbone. Remove the bone and reserve it for making stock.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> With scissors or kitchen shears, cut away and discard any small, sharp protruding bones. Use both hands to press down, breaking the ribs and flattening the chicken. Turn the chicken skin side up. Make a small incision just below the breast near the leg, where the meat thins out. Insert the bone end of the drumstick into the incision. Make a small incision in the thickest part of each chicken leg.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_292"/><span class="red">3.</span> Place the chicken between two pieces of plastic wrap. Pound until the chicken is uniformly <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inch thick. The chicken is now ready to cook.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> In a large casserole or baking dish, whisk the lemon zest, wine, olive oil, and vinegar. Add the chicken, skin side down. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the sage, rosemary, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Turn the chicken over and season with salt and red pepper. Turn the chicken several times in the casserole to coat it evenly with the marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or for up to 24 hours. (Note: If you are going to marinate the chicken overnight, do not add any salt until just before cooking. The salt will cure the chicken and make the meat tough.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Wrap a brick or heavy rock in aluminum foil and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Place the chicken, skin side down, on the grill. Sear the skin for about 5 minutes, then rotate the chicken on the grill to make cross-hatched grill marks. Continue searing for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Turn the chicken over and baste with some of the reserved marinade. Place the brick on top of the chicken. Cover the grill and cook the chicken, basting from time to time with the marinade, until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">8.</span> Remove from the heat, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Medium white and light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> This chicken is equally delicious baked in a preheated oven at 375° F. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wide cast-iron pan. Remove the marinade from the chicken and reserve. Sear the chicken, skin side down, placing a heavy pan or aluminum-foil-covered brick on top to hold it firmly in the pan. Cook until golden <a id="page_293"/>brown, about 7 minutes. Turn the chicken over. Pour the marinade into the pan. Place the brick on top and bake in the oven, uncovered, basting occasionally during the first 35 minutes of cooking time. Bake until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through, a total of about 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Individual Cornish game hens may be prepared in this same way. Bake or grill for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> Do not baste with the marinade during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Because it was in contact with the raw chicken, any unused marinade should be discarded and not served.</p>
