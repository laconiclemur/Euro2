  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page246"></a>A <em>cassoulet</em> is a meal. It would be an error to precede it with anything but the simplest of <em>crudités</em>, or to serve, at the end, more than a fruit or the lightest of fruit-derivative desserts. The celeriac and the watercress not only frame the <em>cassoulet</em> aesthetically, but their rough age is a distinct aid to digestion.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE CELERIAC IN MUSTARD SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Celeriac, also known as “celery root,” is coming, in recent years, to be better known in the United States. It is one of the most commonly used vegetables in France—most often served raw in a salad like the following. Mustard-flavored mayonnaise often replaces the cream sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cooked and puréed, its flavor attenuated with one part of potatoes to two of celeriac, plus a certain quantity of onion purée (turnips may also be added), finished with butter and heavy cream, it is an exquisite accompaniment to a roast, particularly to game.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c15-s56"><em><span class="color">Celeriac in Mustard Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Céleri-rave à la Sauce Moutarde</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 celeriac (about 1 pound)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon strong Dijon mustard</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the celeriac, cut it into pieces and pass it through the <em>mouli-julienne</em> into a fine julienne (or grate it). Mix the salt and pepper in the lemon juice, stir in the mustard and then the cream. Taste for seasoning, mix thoroughly with the celeriac, turn it out onto a serving dish, and sprinkle with parsley.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page247"></a>THE CASSOULET</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Cooked fat is, for most people, difficult to digest, and for some impossible. The same may be said for dried beans. Moreover, <em>cassoulet</em>, assuming it not to be the dreary bean soup, often canned, served in most restaurants that claim it as a specialty, is so good that only those with the strongest willpower, or those of puritan persuasion, will refrain from overeating. A regional specialty from <em>foie gras</em> country (the Languedoc), goose fat naturally lends the <em>cassoulet</em> its <em>onctuosité</em> (which description suggests a smooth, suave, velvety quality, but does not imply slippery, oily, nauseating or insincere, as does its English equivalent, “unctuousness”). For a peasant people whose life pattern turns, in large part, around hard, out-of-doors physical work, this kind of nourishment “passes”—is, indeed, essential to its well-being. We others are required to expiate the pleasures taken in <em>cassoulet</em> (or go back to the farm).</p>

  <p class="indent">Gastronomic literature, which, although abundant, is rarely able to stumble out of a pathetic morass of pretension and deliberate mystification (happily, a few artists have, incidentally, written brilliantly and with lucid passion of food and wine—Colette, no doubt, leading the twentieth-century contingent), has nearly drowned this good, solid dish of beans in more idiotic odes to its glory, essays on its mystic divinity, etc., even than those dedicated to <em>la bouillabaisse</em>; and it is more often read about than tasted, for although rustic in personality, it is long of execution and not particularly economical.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are said to be three <em>cassoulets</em> (Castelnaudary, Carcassonne, and Toulouse), but their definitions vary too much to be taken seriously and it would be more correct to say that there are as many as there are cooks, and to define a <em>cassoulet</em>, in a general way, as a slow-cooked gratin made up of two or more separate preparations, one of which is always a pork and bean stew, the others of which may be chosen among preserved duck or goose, braised lamb or mutton, and roast or braised partridge.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page248"></a>The gentle, sweet odor of broom which, in the past, was burned to heat the bread ovens in which <em>cassoulets</em> were cooked, lent, no doubt, a dimension to the dish that we shall never know.</p>

  <p class="indent">In France, where mature mutton is rarely eaten, the terms <em>mouton</em> and <em>agneau</em> are used interchangeably to designate grass, or yearling, lamb.</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>goose fat</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE GOOSE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Reduce the first pinch of herbs to powder in a mortar, sprinkle the goose with the herbs and salt and leave overnight. Render the goose fat (melt the pieces of fat over a low flame, and when nothing solid is left but the cracklings, strain off the pure fat). Cook the goose gently, well bathed in this fat, until tender, turning it after about 15 minutes. Save the fat. (This is merely the method of preparing preserved goose—<em>confit d’oie</em>. Normally it is then packed into earthenware jars, covered with melted goose fat, and kept this way in a cool, dry cellar throughout the year.)</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE BEANS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The beans should be uniform in size and uniformly white in color. Assuming them to be of the most recent harvest, there is no need to soak them.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roll up the pork rind and tie it with a string. Cover it, the salt pork, and the pig’s foot with cold water, bring to a boil, simmer for a few minutes, drain, and rinse them in cold water. Prick the sausage in several places with the prongs of a sharp fork or the tip of a knife.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cover the beans generously with cold water in a large, heavy saucepan or earthenware casserole. Bring slowly to a boil, drain them and return them to the cooking utensil along with the vegetables, garlic, herbs and pork products, including sausage. Pour in enough tepid water to cover everything by about 2 inches, bring to a boil again, slowly, and adjust the heat so that, covered, the barest simmer is maintained. Do not salt.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page250"></a>The sausage should be removed and put aside after about 40 minutes and the salt pork when it is tender, but still firm—about 1 hour. The foot and rind should remain with the beans until they are done—about 2 hours in all. Taste the cooking liquid and salt to taste. Put the rind and pig’s foot aside with the sausage and salt pork. Discard the onion and bay leaf.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE LAMB STEW</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel and coarsely chop the onions. Crush and peel the cloves of garlic. Peel the carrots and cut them into 1-inch lengths. Cook the carrots and onions in a couple of tablespoons of goose fat in a heavy <em>sauteuse</em> or skillet (just the size to hold the pieces of meat placed side by side) for about 15 minutes, stirring regularly, until lightly browned. Remove onions and carrots, making certain, to leave no fragment of onion behind, and, over a high flame, color the pieces of lamb in the same fat. Salt them just before turning, and when they are browned on all sides, sprinkle with flour, turn the pieces over, return the vegetables to the pan, and when the flour is lightly cooked, add the white wine, garlic, and herbs. Scrape and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve frying adherents and transfer the contents to a heavy <em>cocotte</em>. Add the tomatoes and enough of the beans’ cooking liquid to cover, and leave, covered, at a bare simmer, either in a slow oven or over a tiny flame, for 1½ hours, skimming off surface fat 2 or 3 times during this period. Pour the contents of the <em>cocotte</em> into a sieve, carefully pick out the pieces of meat and carrot and put them aside, discard the bay leaf, and pass the rest through the sieve. Bring the sauce to a boil, move it to the side of the fire, regulating to a “bubble,” and skim for 15 minutes.<br />
  <br /></p>

  <p class="indent">Rub the bottom and sides of a large, medium-deep earthenware oven dish with the 2 cloves of garlic until they are completely absorbed. Untie the pork rind, cut it into small rectangles about ½ inch by 2 inches and distribute them regularly over the bottom of the dish. Cut the goose into two pieces, place them on the bed of rinds, and, after having drained the beans, putting their liquid aside, distribute about ⅓ of the beans over and around the pieces of goose. Split the pig’s foot, remove the largest bones, cut each half into 3 or 4 pieces <a id="page251"></a>and arrange them, along with the pieces of lamb and carrot (both those from the lamb stew and from the beans), evenly over the surface. Sprinkle generously with pepper, cover everything with half of the remaining beans, and distribute the sausage, cut into thick slices, and the salt pork, cut into 1-inch lengths, on top, pepper again and cover with the remaining beans. Generously sprinkle the entire surface with bread crumbs and, carefully, so as to moisten them without displacing them, pour over, ladle by ladle, the sauce from the lamb stew until the liquid rises just to the surface of the beans. Dust lightly again with bread crumbs, sprinkle several tablespoonfuls of melted goose fat over the surface, and put the dish into a hot oven until it is heated through and the surface begins to bubble. Turn the oven low (275°–300° F.) so that a gentle bubbling is maintained, and, after about 20 minutes, as the liquid reduces, partly by absorption and partly by evaporation, begin to baste the surface, first with the remaining lamb sauce and, when it is finished, with the beans’ cooking liquid. Continue in this way every 20 minutes or so and, when a pretty, golden-crisp gratin has formed on the surface, break it regularly all over with a spoon so that part becomes submerged and the rest is moistened by the sauce. The <em>cassoulet</em>, in principle, should remain at least 2 hours in a slow oven, and the gratin should be broken a minimum of 3 times, but if the basting liquids should run short before this time, it is better to stop the gratinéing process than to risk the dish’s becoming too dry.</p>

  <p class="indent">The beans retain their form but at the slightest pressure may be reduced to a creamy purée, and all the elements are coated with a succulent sauce whose body is drawn from the gelatinous rind and pig’s foot and whose suaveness is enhanced by the discreet presence of goose fat.</p>
