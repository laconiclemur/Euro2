<p class="normal"><b>I love the flavor of just-ripe fall pears, roasted in a red wine syrup with slivered almonds, in a tatin, with chocolate and vanilla ice cream or simply on their own when they’re juicy. You will never enjoy them more, however, than when they are caramelized, then folded into a cake batter with a hint of scented rosemary. Of course, I could have replaced that with spices, but somehow that did not seem right. I wanted some freshness to spread through the cake while it was baking, so I added the rosemary only after the pears were caramelized and cooling to let the scent infuse the cake.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PEARS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 pears at room temperature, peeled, halved, cored and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxta">leaves from 1 rosemary sprig, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CAKE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">a little all-purpose flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup confectioner’s sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 315°F and butter and flour a 12- x 5- x 3½-inch bread pan or silicone cake mold. To cook the pears, put a large skillet over low heat. Add the sugar and cook slowly a few minutes until it turns to a light golden caramel, then add the butter. When it is foaming, add the pears. (Once more, it is essential the pears are at room temperature, otherwise the caramel will form lumps of hardened caramel and then it’s a matter of starting again!) Cook the pears about 10 minutes until they are soft and caramelized. Remove the pan from the heat, add the rosemary and toss gently to combine, then lay the pears on a clean dish towel to cool and dry slightly; you want the dish towel to absorb any juices.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> To make the cake, the butter needs to be really light in texture and color so beat the confectioner’s sugar and butter, using an electric mixer, until almost white in color and very, very light and fluffy. Only then, add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition. Sift the flour and baking powder together into a bowl, then sift two-thirds into the batter. Add the pears to the reserved flour and toss to coat thoroughly, then fold the dusted pears gently into the batter.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake 25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. If it isn’t baked, return it to the oven 5 minutes longer and check again.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Transfer the cake to a wire rack and leave to cool for as long as you can wait, then cut a slice and serve with a cup of tea. And, if I were you, I’d sneak a slice quickly before everyone else smells it and wants some, too.</p>
