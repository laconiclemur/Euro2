<p class="author1"><span class="txit">scarola</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My mother’s father grew escarole in his garden every year. If the winter was mild, it could survive into late November or early December. She remembers him covering the plants with a bushel basket at night to protect them from frost. We serve escarole prepared this way on top of pizza and as a side dish. It freezes well in small batches, packed in containers filled with some of the cooking water.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound escarole (about 1 large head), leaves coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Add the escarole and cook until tender but firm, about 10 minutes after the water returns to a boil. Remove the escarole with a slotted spoon, place in a bowl, and set aside. Reserve <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the cooking water. Set aside. (The escarole may be parboiled and set aside several hours before proceeding with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook to flavor the oil but do not let it brown, about 2 minutes. Add the escarole and the reserved cooking water. Cook, stirring occasionally, to warm through and bring the flavor of the garlic and escarole together, about 4 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_219"/><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Kale, Swiss chard, and mustard greens may also be prepared this way. They may need to be sautéed for an additional 5 minutes to soften and absorb the garlic flavor. Cannellini or other white beans make a tasty addition to this recipe. Warm one 19-ounce can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed, with the reserved cooking water. Add the beans and water to the escarole as it warms through with the garlic. Cannellini beans may also be warmed in <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a>. Stir the tomato-bean mixture into the escarole in place of the cooking water as it warms with the garlic.</p>
