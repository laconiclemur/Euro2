    <p class="nonindent"><strong class="calibre13">Ravenna</strong>, home to early Christian emperors, is sparkling and mystical, harking back to the almost magical period of the early Christian Empire. The city flourished when Honorius moved the imperial court from Rome to Ravenna in the fifth century. The colorful mosaics, imperial tombs, and cylindrical towers (characteristic of Byzantine architecture) all tell of the power and might once alive in this city. Galla Placidia, Honorius’s sister, was the first to adorn the city with mosaics and monuments, and her tomb is a small cross-shaped building filled with predominantly blue mosaics, beautifully preserved. Entering the small tomb is like walking into a jewel-encrusted secret place, the walls shimmering with tiny golden squares laid by the hands of masters.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Ferrara</strong>, a fine example of city planning, is located on a plain near the Po River and was home of the Este dukes, a family that promoted Italian Renaissance ideals in their court. In the fifteenth century, they devised the plan of the city, with wide streets, public spaces, wonderful architecture, and paths atop the city walls. The Este family castle is surrounded by a moat, and has drawbridges with dungeons underneath the courtyard; you can still see some decoration from the castle’s heyday. The city is dotted with magnificent Renaissance buildings. Palazzo di Schifanoia should not be missed, in particular the Salone dei Mesi, decorated for Duke Borso d’Este, depicting the months of the year and mythological scenes.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Parma</strong> is known not only for its famous cured ham, but also for its beautiful women and classical music. As I walk through town, I can’t help humming Verdi’s <em class="calibre4">Nabucco.</em> I always end up at my favorite place, the rooms frescoed by Correggio in the Camera di San Paolo. It was commissioned by the abbess Giovanna, who is depicted on the fireplace as the mythological figure Diana. The room has been transformed by Correggio into a green, leafy space, the walls covered with an intricate, foliage-covered trellis. Angels peek through the leaves, brandishing Diana’s attributes, such as a bow and arrow.</p>

    <p class="extract">Castles abound in the area surrounding Parma. My two favorite are <strong class="calibre13">Soragna</strong> and <strong class="calibre13">Fontanellato.</strong> The Meli Lupi family still live in the Castle of Soragna, and it occupies the center of town, reached by a large masonry bridge. It even has its own ghost, La Donna Cenerina, whose portrait is in the billiards room. Fontanellato, also in the center of its own town, is a surprise. Somehow one would not expect, when walking through this small town, to come upon a crenellated fairy-tale castle surrounded by a greenish-blue moat. Inside, there are sensual decorations of Diana and Atteone painted by Parmigianino.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
