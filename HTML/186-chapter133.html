<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Veal kidneys are rich in protein, iron, and vitamins, with a smooth, firm texture and bold flavor. Cooked with sherry, they are a delicious southern classic. But they do take some work to first purge them of their strong, acrid odor before they are ready to be stewed in the sherry sauce. When buying, freshness is paramount. Look for whole, very fresh kidneys.</span></strong></p>
<ul>

<li>FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML DRY SHERRY</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML LIGHT BEEF STOCK <a href="238-chapter174.html#page_336">(PAGE 336)</a> OR WATER</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Clean the kidneys. Slice them open in the middle and cut away the central white nucleus and any fat from the lobes. Sprinkle with salt, rub, and rinse well under running water. Cut into pieces slightly larger than bite-size.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a bowl, soak the kidneys with 1 quart/1 L water and the vinegar for 15 or 20 minutes. Drain, rinse well under running water, and drain again. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a sauté pan or skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until smoking. Fry the kidneys over high heat in single-layer batches that don’t crowd the pan, until they are cooked through and have expelled their liquid, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. (Add more oil to the pan if necessary between batches.) Transfer to a colander to drain of any impurities for 15 minutes. Rinse well under running water.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a clean sauté pan or skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until very soft and translucent, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the flour and saffron and season with pepper. Moisten with the sherry, add the stock, and bring to a simmer. The sauce should be very loose but not watery.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Let the sauce reduce for a few minutes if needed. Add the kidneys, reduce the heat to low, and gently cook, stirring from time to time, for 6 to 8 minutes without letting the kidneys boil in the sauce, until the flavors have blended. Taste for seasoning, adjust as needed, and serve.</p>
