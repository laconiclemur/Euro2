<p class="noindent">What would happen to Spanish cuisine if the egg suddenly disappeared? The idea is too shocking to even consider, as there are times when the entire Spanish diet seems to revolve around yolks and whites. Fried in lots of olive oil until the edges are sizzled crisp but the yolk is still runny, <em>huevos fritos</em> are an essential meal, taken at any time of the day, either alone or on top of everything from sautéed baby squid to the season’s first fava beans or peas. For <em>once</em> (a midmorning snack), the <em>huevo</em> shows up as a tall, fluffy <em>tortilla,</em> the cakelike omelet without which most tapas bars would instantly go out of business. A fancy restaurant lunch could begin with <a id="page_138"/>a poached egg served over a potato velouté with a shaving of truffles. Bar suppers might feature a stirringly good <em>revuelto</em>—eggs gently scrambled with other ingredients (the word means flipped over).</p>
<p class="indent">The egg in Spain goes high and low, haute and humble, universally adored by all. As all of Madrid knows, King Juan Carlos’s favorite dish is <em>huevos rotos</em> (smashed eggs) with french fries at a taberna called Lucio. Three-star Michelin chef Juan Mari Arzak once confessed to me that the only thing he bothers making at home is <em>revuelto</em>. The renowned food critic Rafael García Santos famously organizes a yearly <em>tortilla de patata</em> competition in San Sebastián, where the potato omelets are dissected and judged as if they were the latest culinary haute couture. And Andoni Luis Adúriz, one of Spain’s most creative young chefs, takes the egg so seriously that he has spent two years researching the chemistry of coagulation to conclude that for an ideal poaching, an egg should be just a few hours old and cooked at exactly 65°C (147°F)—sort of like a warm bath—for precisely 55 minutes. Today Adúriz’s 65°C egg is among the country’s most copied dishes.</p>
<p class="indent">As I said, the Spanish <em>really</em> like eggs.</p>
<p class="indent">In large measure, the egg’s cult appeal is due to that fact that Spain is a formerly agrarian culture where the dining habits still remain close to these roots. There is also the egg’s natural beauty, nutrition, and symbolism. The quality of Spanish eggs helps too. Even those from a corner store tend to be excellent. And when you get a <em>huevo</em> from a free-range, naturally fed barnyard hen, with its compact, flavorful, bright-saffron yolk, all you need to do is crack it into the pan to reach heaven. As the dishes in this chapter will demonstrate, eggs in Spain aren’t just for breakfast.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_139"/>POTATO TORTILLA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TORTILLA DE PATATAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here it is: Spain’s most iconic, most popular dish, <em>tortilla de patata,</em> prepared in the classic way. Which is to say, the potatoes are first cooked in plenty of aromatic olive oil and drained before being mixed with the eggs and fried into a fat, fluffy omelet. Served as a light luncheon, with a salad of perfectly ripe tomatoes and a glass of Rioja, this is one of life’s great simple pleasures. And you can’t beat it as a tapa. Some Spanish cooks in the States add a pinch of saffron to their <em>tortillas</em> to simulate the bright yellow color of Spanish egg yolks.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1½ pounds), peeled and quartered lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cups extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Using a food processor, slice the potato quarters thinly crosswise, then pat thoroughly dry with paper towels. Rub potato slices with salt.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the potatoes in even layers. Cook, stirring occasionally, to prevent the potatoes from sticking and browning, until they are half-cooked, about 7 minutes. Stir in the onion, reduce the heat to low, and cook the potatoes until all of them are soft, about 15 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes and onion to a colander set over a bowl and let them drain thoroughly. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the cooking oil and strain the rest for another use. Season the potatoes with salt.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the eggs, chicken stock, and a couple of pinches of salt in a large mixing bowl and beat until just scrambled. Gently stir in the potato mixture. Mash and stir the egg mixture gently with a fork to crush the potatoes just a little and mix them up well with the eggs. Let stand for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat 5 teaspoons of the reserved olive oil in a heavy 8-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat until it is just beginning to smoke. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and flatten the potatoes with a spatula until the top is fairly even. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, moving and shaking the skillet, running a thin spatula around the edge and sliding it into the middle so that some of the egg runs under. Cook the <em>tortilla</em> in this fashion until the top is a little wet but not liquid, 6 to 8 minutes. Run the thin spatula under the <em>tortilla</em> to make sure that no part of the bottom is stuck to the skillet. Top the skillet with a rimless plate slightly larger than the skillet and, using oven mitts, quickly invert the <em>tortilla</em> onto the plate. If the skillet looks dry, add a little more olive oil. Carefully slide the <em>tortilla</em> back into the skillet, uncooked side down. Shake the skillet to straighten the <em>tortilla</em> and push the edges in with the spatula. Reduce the heat to very low and cook the <em>tortilla</em> until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry, 3 to 4 minutes. <a id="page_140"/>Invert the <em>tortilla</em> again, as before, to cook on the first side for another minute.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Invert the <em>tortilla</em> onto a serving plate and pat the top with a paper towel to get rid of excess oil.

<p class="box-title">TORTILLA DE PATATAS, SPAIN’S EGG MASTERPIECE</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">All it takes is three ingredients: eggs, potatoes, and olive oil. It’s delicious hot, warm, or cold. It can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or supper. And it makes an ideal tapa or snack. No wonder that in Spain, <em>tortilla de patata,</em> a plump, moonlike, potato-filled omelet, basks in such universal devotion—its image deserves to be emblazoned on the country’s flag. When good, a <em>tortilla de patata</em> is about the most satisfying thing you can eat.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In Spanish, <em>tortilla</em> means a flat cake (in Mexico the same word came to describe the indigenous corn flat-breads). Though the term has been applied to omelets in Spain since the seventeenth century, the <em>tortilla</em> recipes found in historical cookbooks are for French-style omelets, without potatoes. The potato version probably emerged in the late eighteenth century, when the spud, which the <em>conquistadores</em> brought from the Andes around 1570, finally gained full acceptance. According to one legend, <em>tortilla de patata</em> was “invented” during the first Carlist War, a battle for the Spanish crown fought between 1833 and 1839. A famished general, goes the myth, dropped by an inn in the Navarra region and was treated to a wondrous dish improvised by the innkeepers with the staples from their war-ravaged larder: potatoes and eggs. (Scholars are skeptical of this story, pointing out that <em>tortilla de patata</em> had already been mentioned in an 1817 text that describes the foodstuffs of Navarra.) It is also possible that the very first potato omelet was flipped even earlier in Galicia, a region that pioneered the cultivation of the tuber. Either way, by the mid-nineteenth century, the potato omelet was a widely popular dish called <em>tortilla de patata</em> or <em>tortilla española,</em> to distinguish it from the French omelet.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">These days, every Spaniard can make a pretty decent <em>tortilla</em> blindfolded; it’s the sort of recipe that seems encoded in the national DNA. And while each cook brings a subtle personal touch to the dish, the most common version is a fat, round <em>tortilla,</em> loaded with olive-oil-fried potatoes, left to cool, then cut into wedges or squares. Of course, serious <em>tortilla</em> fanatics dismiss the make-ahead version as, well, lazy. For an exalted omelet experience, they’ll send you to Galicia, a region famous for its <em>tortillas de patatas,</em> thanks to the quality of its potatoes and farm-fresh eggs, and the skill of its cooks. There, at good tapas bars the <em>tortilla</em> is always made to order. Not necessarily thick, it has a runny interior that forms a delicious foil for the potatoes, which are fried until very soft with a suggestion of crispness around the edges. This is the <em>tortilla</em> elevated to an art form.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_141"/>TRUFFLED TORTILLA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TORTILLA TRUFADA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Dressed up with a few drops of truffle oil, sautéed mushrooms, and caramelized onions, the basic potato <em>tortilla</em> gets transformed into a Wow! restaurant-style dish that will leave your guests swooning. It’s best served just slightly warm.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ounces oyster mushrooms, trimmed, wiped clean with a damp paper towel, and finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size onions, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size (about 1 pound) boiled Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon white or black truffle oil</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until they are lightly browned and have released and reabsorbed their liquid, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the mushrooms to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Wipe out the skillet and add another 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onions and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are very soft and lightly caramelized, about 15 minutes. If the skillet looks dry as the onions cook, sprinkle in a little water, and adjust the heat so that the onions don’t burn. When the onions are done, add another 3 tablespoons of the oil to the skillet, then add the potatoes. Cook over low heat, stirring very gently, until the ingredients are mixed and the potatoes are infused with the oil, 2 to 3 minutes, adding more oil if the potatoes look dry. Transfer the mixture to the bowl with the reserved mushrooms and gently stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste and let cool completely. (The potato mixture can be prepared up to this stage a few hours in advance.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the eggs, chicken stock, and a few pinches of salt in a large mixing bowl and beat until the eggs are just scrambled. Add the potato mixture and the truffle oil and mix until well combined. Let stand for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat about 5 teaspoons of the remaining olive oil in a heavy 8-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat until it is just beginning to smoke. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and flatten it with a spatula until the top is fairly even. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, moving and shaking the skillet, running a thin spatula around the edge and sliding it into the middle so that some of the egg runs under. Cook the <em>tortilla</em> in this fashion until the top is a little wet but not liquid, about 6 minutes.

<h3 class="h3a">TORTILLA WITH CHORIZO POTATOES, AND ALLIOLI</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TRUITA TREMPERA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This omelet is so delicious! Filled with chorizo, potatoes, and sautéed onion, it is covered with a layer of garlicky <em>allioli</em> mayonnaise that brings all the flavors together under a piquant cap. This <em>tortilla</em>—<em>truita</em> in Catalan—is the proud creation of the venerable bar Cal Pep in Barcelona. They call it a “tricky” omelet, presumably because <em>allioli</em> in a <em>tortilla</em> is so unexpected. It’s excellent as a tapa and even better as a light supper or luncheon dish.</p>

<p class="sb-noindent">Ferran Adrià, the genius chef of El Bulli, has done quite a few far-out things to eggs in his life. One of the creations he is most pleased with, however, involves . . . a bag of potato chips. Galicians, who are the great <em>tortilla de patata</em> masters, Adrià notes, like their omelets with <em>patatas</em> a little bit crisp. To simulate the effect and eliminate the task of frying the potatoes, Adrià fills potato <em>tortillas</em> with chips. Though this isn’t the kind of dish you’ll ever eat at El Bulli, the simple idea has become a great hit with Spanish home cooks. Adrià suggests using fresh olive-oil-fried potato chips from a <em>churrería</em> (the fried cruller shops that also sell bags of chips). But even good-quality supermarket chips, such as Lay’s, work fine. Just avoid chips that are too thick, flavored, or oversalted.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">To make Adrià’s potato chip <em>tortilla,</em> use two 1-ounce bags of potato chips for every four eggs. Crush them slightly into the beaten eggs and let them sit for five to ten minutes. Then make the <em>tortilla</em> following the recipe on <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_139">page 139</a>.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_144"/>TORTILLA TECHNIQUE</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Though cooking the perfect <em>tortilla de patata</em> takes a bit of practice, once you get the knack, it’s the easiest thing in the world—and a whole lot of fun. It’s a dish you’ll be making again and again. Here are some pointers. (You’ll find a recipe for <em>tortilla de patatas</em> on <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_139">page 139</a>.)</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>THE POTATOES AND THE EGGS</strong></span> To make a <em>tortilla de patata</em> you need moderately starchy potatoes. In Spain they mostly use Kennebecs, a sort of all-purpose variety, but I find that the trusted and true Yukon Golds work best in the States. Start by cutting the potatoes into thin, uniform slices, then fry them in plenty of olive oil. Infusing the potatoes with the olive oil is what gives the <em>tortilla</em> its inimitable flavor and fragrance. (While Spanish cooks consider using boiled potatoes a crime, sometimes I cheat by sautéing boiled slices in olive oil; the trick works for me.) Once fried, scrupulously drain the potatoes of any excess oil, mix them with the beaten eggs, and let them sit a little while so that they meld properly. <em>Tortilla</em> “specialists” insist that overbeating the eggs makes for a dry omelet. However, adding a little chicken broth to the eggs will make the <em>tortilla</em> super <em>jugosa</em> (juicy).</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>THE FRYING</strong></span> Ready to fry the <em>tortilla?</em> Choose a deep, heavy skillet, preferably a nonstick one. The classic size is eight inches in diameter. Once you’ve mastered a smaller omelet, you can increase the ingredients and make <em>tortillas</em> as large as you want. You’ll also need a sturdy plate without a rim—one that’s slightly larger than the skillet—for when it’s time to flip the <em>tortilla</em> over. Let the oil in the skillet get hot before you pour in the egg and potato mixture so that the bottom of the omelet can begin to set instantly. Then, keep shaking and moving the skillet, running a spatula or knife under the eggs so they have no chance to stick. As you cook, adjust the heat so that the center of the omelet sets without the bottom burning. When the uncooked side is no longer liquid, but <em>is</em> still wet and jiggly, you’re ready for the dramatic <em>vuelta</em>—the flip!</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>LA VUELTA</strong></span> Before flipping the <em>tortilla</em> over, always check that no bits of the omelet are stuck to the skillet; that way, the omelet will come out in one piece. Wearing oven mitts, place the rimless plate over the skillet, holding it firmly with your left hand (if you are right-handed). With your other hand, grab the skillet handle and invert the <em>tortilla</em> onto the plate in a quick steady motion. Bits of <em>tortilla</em> stuck to the skillet? Remove them and tuck them into the top of the <em>tortilla</em> while it’s still on the plate. To cook the other side, slide the <em>tortilla</em> back into the skillet, shaking it to straighten the <em>tortilla</em> out in its pretty round shape and tucking the edges under with a spatula.</p>
<p class="sb-indentb">How do you know when a <em>tortilla</em> is done? Well, Spaniards prefer their <em>tortillas</em> slightly—or very—runny, but they have those incredible Spanish eggs. Your best bet is to cook the <em>tortilla</em> until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Flip the <em>tortilla</em> over once or twice more for the best-looking omelet—and because flipping is fun. Then, turn it out on a serving plate and wait for at least ten minutes before cutting into it. I like the <em>tortilla</em> best when it’s just slightly warm.</p>
<p class="sb-noindentb"><span class="blue"><strong>THE FLAVORS</strong></span> <em>Tortillas de patatas</em> are excellent made with only potatoes and eggs. They’re even better when you add onions. Beyond that, you can flavor the <em>tortilla</em> with just about anything. Some ingredients to try:</p>
<p class="sb-uln">Diced chorizo or ham</p>
<p class="sb-uln">Strips of roasted or fried red bell peppers</p>
<p class="sb-uln">Peas, cooked artichokes, or sliced cooked asparagus</p>
<p class="sb-uln">Cooked wild mushrooms</p>
<p class="sb-uln">Truffle shavings</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">Of course, <em>tortillas</em> don’t always include a potato filling. They can be made with a single vegetable or a combination or with such ingredients as salt cod and peppers. The Spanish <em>tortilla,</em> you see, is one of the world’s most versatile dishes.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">SALT COD AND GREEN PEPPER TORTILLA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TORTILLA DE BACALAO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">My idea of heaven? Eating fat, juicy salt cod <em>tortillas</em> at crowded Basque <em>sidrerías,</em> the traditional cider houses up in the countryside. The fancier <em>sidrerías</em> serve thick <em>chuletas</em> (steaks) and an assortment of cooked dishes. But at the no-frills rustic ones—usually big eating halls with long wooden tables that are only open during the fresh cider season in March—customers are content with plates of <em>jamón</em> and <em>queso</em> and their beloved <em>tortilla de bacalao.</em> The classic cider house version of this <em>tortilla</em> is made to order and eaten warm, fluffy, and a little runny. The version here can be served as a light main course, with a green salad, or as a tapa, cut into wedges or squares. The cod needs to soak overnight, so plan ahead.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large white onion, quartered and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 ounces salt cod, soaked and cooked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_198">page 198</a>), then drained, bones and hard bits removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_147"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the ½ cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and green pepper and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion and pepper are meltingly soft, about 12 minutes. Add the salt cod and cook for 5 minutes, flaking it with a fork. Taste for seasoning and, depending on the saltiness of the cod, add salt as necessary. Transfer the salt cod mixture to a sieve set over a small bowl and let it cool and drain for about 25 minutes. (The salt cod mixture can be prepared a day ahead and refrigerated, covered. Bring to room temperature before continuing with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the eggs, chicken stock, and a few small pinches of salt in a medium-size bowl and beat until just scrambled. Add the salt cod mixture and mix until well combined. Let stand for about 10 minutes.</p>

Cook, moving and shaking the skillet, running a thin spatula around the edge and sliding it into the middle so that some of the egg runs under. Cook the <em>tortilla</em> in this fashion until the top is a little wet but not liquid, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Run the thin spatula under the <em>tortilla</em> to make sure that no part of the bottom is stuck to the skillet.

Shake the skillet to straighten the <em>tortilla</em> and push the edges in with the spatula. Reduce the heat to very low and cook the <em>tortilla</em> until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Invert the <em>tortilla</em> again, as before, and cook on the first side for another minute.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Invert the <em>tortilla</em> onto a serving plate and pat the top with a paper towel to get rid of excess oil.

<h3 class="h3a">FLOWER MARKET EGGPLANT TORTILLA SANDWICH</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TORTILLA DE BERENJENAS, MERCAT DE LA CONCEPCION</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">To research Catalan recipes for this book, I rented an apartment in Barcelona that had a balcony overlooking Gaudí’s eccentric Sagrada Família cathedral. The best place for breakfast <a id="page_149"/>nearby was the vast Concepció flower market, with a food counter where vendors gathered for hearty Catalan stews or vegetable omelets. Every morning I’d perch at the counter, surrounded by the extravagant scents of roses and lilies, and order the same thing: a stupendous sandwich of tomato-rubbed bread, smeared with a little garlic mayonnaise and topped with an eggplant omelet and some roasted green pepper. It was the breakfast of champions. Feel free to use split, toasted focaccia instead of the baguette.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 medium-size green bell peppers, cored, cut in half, and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 slender Asian eggplant (7 to 8 ounces), peeled and cut crosswise into ⅓-inch-thick slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic, beaten together with a large pinch of salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pieces (each 10 inches long) crusty French bread, or focaccia, split horizontally</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 ripe tomato, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the green pepper halves skin side up in a broiler pan, crush them lightly with your hand, and brush them with olive oil. Broil the peppers until they are soft and charred in spots, about 15 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let stand for 10 minutes. Peel the peppers and cut each half in half.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the eggplant in a colander and generously sprinkle salt over it. Let stand for 30 minutes. Rinse off the salt and pat the eggplant thoroughly dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add as many eggplant slices as will fit in one layer. (Save any extra eggplant for another use.) Cook the eggplant until soft and golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side, adding olive oil, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the skillet looks dry (resist adding too much oil). Pour the eggs over the eggplant and cook until the bottom is set, about 3 minutes, loosening the <em>tortilla</em> with a thin spatula. Reduce the heat to very low, cover the skillet, and cook until the top is set, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Using the spatula, loosen the <em>tortilla</em> from the skillet and slide it onto a plate.

Arrange <em>tortilla</em> and green pepper wedges on top, then cover with the top half of the bread. Cut the sandwich in half. Repeat with the remaining bread, <em>allioli,</em> and <em>tortilla</em> and green pepper wedges.

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_150"/>EGGS OVER SMOKY BREAD HASH</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MIGAS CON HUEVOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In formerly destitute central and southern Spain (Castile, La Mancha, Extremadura, Andalusia), recipes for leftover bread are legion. Today, although the poverty is long gone, <em>migas</em> remain one of the most cherished tastes. The word <em>migas</em> means crumbs, and the dish is a kind of fried bread hash usually flavored with smoky meats and paprika, plus such original additions as grapes, raisins, radishes, or pomegranate seeds for a fresh counterpoint to the dense smoked flavors. Classically, <em>migas</em> are made with day-old country bread, which is dampened with a little water, wrapped in cloth, and left for several hours. (To simplify things, in this recipe I sprinkle the bread with water as it fries.) The damp bread is added to a skillet of hot oil, then stirred and crumbled until the liquid evaporates. The resulting “crumbs” are completely wonderful, especially with fried or poached eggs.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, thickly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (2 ounces) pancetta or smoky bacon, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (2 to 3 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups day-old dense country bread, torn into very small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup seedless green grape halves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea); optional</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 Spanish Fried Eggs (<a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_156">page 156</a>), or Basic Poached Eggs (<a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_156">page 156</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook until very fragrant and lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a bowl. Add the pancetta, ham, and chorizo to the skillet and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to the bowl with the garlic.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Add the bread to the skillet and stir to coat with the oil, adding a little more oil if the skillet looks dry. Sprinkle about ½ cup water evenly over the bread, using just enough to moisten it. Cook the bread, stirring, breaking it up, turning it with a spatula, and scraping the bottom of the skillet until the bread is no longer moist and is golden and crisp in spots, about 10 minutes. It should resemble coarse crumbs. If the skillet looks dry, add a little more olive oil. Add the paprika to the skillet and stir for a few seconds. Return the garlic, pancetta, ham, and chorizo to the skillet, add the grapes, and stir to distribute all the ingredients evenly. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Taste for seasoning, adding salt if necessary. Remove the hash from the heat and keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Divide the hash among four plates, top with the eggs, and serve right away. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 AS A BREAKFAST OR BRUNCH DISH</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HUEVOS AL HORNO CON PIPERRADA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Piperrada,</em> the sweet, luscious Basque bell pepper ragout, is an ideal partner for eggs. Though most commonly the eggs are scrambled into the peppers, here they bake in ramekins on top of the <em>piperrada,</em> with a round of toasted baguette tucked in the bottom. The result is one of the tastiest brunch dishes imaginable. The ragout can easily be beefed up with diced chorizo or serrano ham, which should be cooked with the peppers. You can prepare the ragout ahead; reheat it before adding the eggs. For a larger crowd, just double the recipe.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large white onion, quartered and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 red bell peppers, cored, seeded, quartered lengthwise, and thinly sliced crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large ripe tomato, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 slices (½ inch thick) of baguette, toasted</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and red peppers and cook, stirring, until softened, about 10 minutes, adjusting the heat so the vegetables don’t brown. Add the garlic and tomato and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock, cover the skillet, and cook until the vegetables are very soft, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a little more stock if the skillet looks dry. If there is too much liquid in the skillet by the time the vegetables are done, increase the heat to high for a few seconds to reduce the liquid slightly. Season the <em>piperrada</em> with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place baguette rounds on the bottom of four ¾-cup ramekins or soufflé cups. Spoon equal portions of the <em>piperrada</em> on top of each bread round and even out the top with the back of a spoon. Break an egg into each ramekin, being careful not to break the yolk, and sprinkle it lightly with salt. Set the ramekins on a small baking sheet and bake until the <a id="page_152"/>eggs are just set, 10 to 15 minutes. Carefully transfer the ramekins to serving plates and let them cool for about 5 minutes.

<p class="sb-noindent">On my bookshelf sits a fascinating Spanish cookbook with a bright-yellow cover. In it, the country’s most creative chefs pay homage to the <em>tortilla de patatas,</em> with recipes that take such basic ingredients as potatoes and eggs where they’ve never ventured before. Ferran Adrià contributes ravioli in which a gossamer “dough” of crunchy potatoes encloses a semiliquid poached egg. Sergi Arola, the young superstar chef of La Broche restaurant in Madrid, weighs in with nests fashioned from blue potatoes sautéed in the fat of <em>ibérico</em> pig, filled with an egg yolk, and accompanied by tomato sorbet and, of all things, toasted bread foam! Jean-Louis Neichel, of the Barcelona restaurant Neichel, reinvents the <em>tortilla</em> as a crisp potato tart, dolled up with sautéed foie gras and Périgord truffles and topped with a fried egg. And Basque chef Pedro Subijana presents his own futuristic take on the omelet: frozen sliced egg sandwiched between crunchy paper-thin potato rectangles miraculously encrusted with herbs. <em>Señores y señoras,</em> the potato <em>tortilla</em> has come a long way.</p>

<h3 class="h3">ASPARAGUS AND ARTICHOKE FLANS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>FLANES DE ESPARRAGOS Y ALCACHOFAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Inspired by a dish I tasted in the vegetable-rich Navarra region, these flans make a lovely first course for a festive spring dinner. I like them served straight from the ramekins, but for a fancier presentation you can turn them out onto dinner plates. To do this, you will need to line the bottom of the dishes with rounds of buttered waxed paper. Run a sharp knife around the finished flans, then invert them.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound asparagus, tough lower parts of the stalks trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 teaspoons olive oil, plus more for frying the ham</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 packages (each 9 ounces) frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and blotted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup grated Manchego cheese, Pecorino Romano, or good Parmesan</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic, beaten well</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 thin slices (about 2 ounces total) serrano ham or prosciutto</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a wide steamer. Add the asparagus, cover the steamer, and cook until tender but still bright green, 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness. Remove the asparagus from the steamer, pat it dry with paper towels, and chop it. Set the asparagus aside to cool.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-low heat. Add the artichokes and garlic and cook until the artichokes are soft, about 7 minutes; don’t let the artichokes brown. Remove the artichokes from the heat and let cool before proceeding. (The asparagus and artichokes can be prepared up to this stage 1 day in advance.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven, then preheat the oven to 325°F. Butter six ¾-cup soufflé dishes or ramekins. Set the dishes in a baking dish that can hold them snugly.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Working in two batches, puree the asparagus and the artichokes and garlic in a blender or food processor until smooth, adding half of the cream, cheese, and butter, and ¼ teaspoon of the salt to each batch. Scrape the puree through a sieve into a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs and whisk until the mixture is well combined.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Evenly divide the egg mixture among the prepared soufflé dishes. Add enough hot water to the baking dish to reach halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake the flans until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> While the flans are baking, make the ham crisps. Pour olive oil to a depth of ½ inch and heat it over medium-high heat; when hot, a piece of ham placed in the oil will sizzle on contact. Place 3 slices of ham in the hot oil and cook, stirring gently to <a id="page_153"/>submerge the ham, until it is crisp, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried ham to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining slices of ham.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> When the flans are done baking, carefully remove the soufflé dishes from the baking dish and let cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Spear each flan with a ham crisp and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 AS A FIRST COURSE OR BRUNCH DISH</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>REVUELTO DE GAMBAS Y ESPARRAGOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Simple but pristinely wonderful, <em>revuelto</em> (a kind of scrambled eggs) is a dish for which good Spanish restaurants charge dearly—and customers happily pay, knowing that a few good ingredients well prepared add up to much more than the sum of their parts. Taste it, and you will agree. The best versions of this <em>revuelto</em> feature matchstick-thin <em>espárragos trigueros</em> (wild asparagus), but any flavorful seasonal asparagus will work as well. As it has to cook very quickly, make sure you trim away all the woody parts. The <em>revuelto</em> is also excellent made with leek or garlic shoots. (For more about <em>revueltos,</em> see <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_157">page 157</a>.)</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large garlic clove, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup thinly sliced asparagus (4 to 6 stalks, well trimmed)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 ounces peeled small shrimp</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium heat. Add the garlic and asparagus and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp just turn pink and the asparagus is bright green and tender, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium-low and <a id="page_155"/>break the eggs into the skillet, leaving enough space between each egg so the yolks don’t run together. As soon as the egg whites turn opaque, about 20 seconds, vigorously stir and scramble the eggs with a wooden spoon or a spatula until they are barely set, 45 seconds to 1 minute. (Do not let the eggs over-cook!) Spoon the eggs onto plates while they are still a little wet. They will continue to set on the way to the table.

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">From the outlandish sculptures of giant eggs crowning Dalí’s museum in his former home town of Figueres, Catalonia, to the gravity-defying fried egg suspended on a string in his painting <em>Fried Egg on the Plate Without the Plate,</em> the humble <em>huevo</em> occupied a prime place in Salvador Dalí’s oeuvre. Eggs appealed to the artist’s scrambled imagination because of their smooth round surfaces, their sexual connotations, and the strange, formal contrast between their raw and cooked states. Dalí’s pal, the surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel, once recalled that “Salvador Dalí seduced many ladies, particularly American ladies, but these seductions usually consisted of stripping them naked in his apartment, frying a couple of eggs, putting them on the women’s shoulders, and, without a word, showing them the door.” Ouch.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and coarsely ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Prepare the egg cups: Hold an egg, pointed end up, in the palm of your hand. Invert an empty spice bottle on top of the egg and secure it with the thumb and forefinger of that hand. With the other hand, using a heavy wooden spoon, hit the bottom of the spice bottle. The shock will create a crack around the top of the egg. Remove the top of the eggshell and discard it. Pour the egg into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining eggs, placing 2 more eggs in the bowl, setting the remaining eggs aside for another use. You will need 6 eggshell cups for serving but only 3 eggs for the <em>revuelto.</em> Rinse the eggshells under warm running water. Turn them upside down on paper towels to dry, then place the empty shells in a 6-egg cardboard carton.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in an 8- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until they have released and reabsorbed their liquid, about 5 minutes, adding a little more olive oil if the skillet looks dry. Stir in the chives and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Working quickly, pour the 3 eggs into the skillet. As soon as the egg whites turn opaque, about 20 seconds, <a id="page_156"/>vigorously stir and scramble the eggs with a wooden spoon or spatula until they are barely set, 45 seconds to 1 minute. (Do not let the eggs overcook!) Quickly spoon them into the prepared eggshells. They will continue to set on the way to the table. Serve at once, with little cocktail forks. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 AS A TAPA IN THE EGGSHELL CUPS, 2 AS A FIRST COURSE SERVED ON A PLATE</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3a">BASIC POACHED EGGS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HUEVOS ESCALFADOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Though not particularly Spanish, my favorite egg-poaching method produces foolproof eggs without any fancy egg-poaching gadgets. A very Spanish way of serving these would be over cooked baby peas or tender fava beans sautéed with a little <em>jamón</em> or with garlicky sautéed mushrooms, Smoky Bread Hash (<a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_150">page 150</a>), or in Castilian Garlic Soup (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_81">page 81</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon vinegar (any kind is fine)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt">Carefully break the eggs into 4 small egg cups, measuring cups, or coffee cups. Fill a medium-size skillet with water to a depth of 2 to 3 inches, add the vinegar, and bring to a steady simmer over low heat. Lower a cup with an egg sideways into the simmering water so that the lip of the cup is slightly submerged in the water. Slide the egg carefully into the water and repeat with the remaining eggs. When the water returns to a simmer, cover the skillet tightly, turn off the heat, and let the eggs sit for exactly 4 minutes for medium-runny eggs. If making ahead, use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to a bowl. Gently resubmerge the eggs in simmering water for a few seconds to warm through before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 4 EGGS</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">THE SPANISH FRIED EGG</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HUEVOS FRITOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">For the Spanish, an ideal fried egg is one that has been fried in lots of very hot olive oil and has a lightly crisped, puffed-up white and a juicy, runny yolk that bursts in a bright-orange explosion when you puncture it with a fork. Cooked this way, the egg is deliciously different from the American diner-style sunny-side-up, particularly if you use fine olive oil and very fresh organic eggs. The recipe here is for one egg, but you can fry as may as you can fit in your skillet. With toasted dense sourdough, this is my favorite midday snack.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large, very fresh egg, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>
<p class="indentt">Heat the olive oil in an 8-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Break the egg into the skillet, being careful not to puncture the yolk. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the white is puffy, sizzled, and set, but the yolk is still runny, gently loosening the white from the skillet with a thin metal spatula and pouring hot olive oil over the yolk. The egg should be done in about 45 seconds. Using a thin slotted spatula, lift the egg out of the skillet, gently shaking off the excess oil. Transfer the egg to a plate. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 1 EGG</strong></span></p>

<p class="sb-noindent">As crazy as the Spanish are about <em>tortillas,</em> they are equally fond of <em>revueltos,</em> creamy scrambled eggs served for lunch or supper at countless tapas bars and restaurants all across the country. Unlike American scrambled eggs, which are about <em>eggs,</em> Spanish <em>revueltos</em> center on the ingredients that flavor them. The texture is smooth, light, and fluffy: Delicate moist curds barely jell around ingredients like leeks and shrimp, sautéed wild mushrooms, onions, and bacalao—even french fries!</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The basic principle of a <em>revuelto</em> couldn’t be simpler: Start with an ingredient or two—shrimp, onion, and/or mushrooms, for example—sautéed in good olive oil. Add eggs, scramble vigorously, serve at once. But while a <em>revuelto</em> requires less know-how than a <em>tortilla,</em> technique <em>is</em> important here as well. And the quality of the eggs makes all the difference. Each cook has his or her own trick. Many people break the eggs right into the skillet, but some beat them very lightly first. Some cook their <em>revueltos</em> over fairly high heat; others use a pan set in a skillet of simmering water so the eggs can’t scorch. The different methods produce similar results. The most important thing to remember is this: Work as quickly as you can so the eggs come out of the pan not quite set. They will continue to cook in their residual heat on their way to the table. The scrambling process should take less than a minute. If the eggs in the skillet look done, they are already overcooked and will land on the table dry. Once out of the pan, a <em>revuelto</em> should be served in an instant.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Wild mushrooms, garlic shoots, wild asparagus, mashed blood sausage, and shrimp or langoustines are some of the most popular <em>revuelto</em> flavorings in Spain. But do try the delicious combinations I offer here. Just remember to cook the ingredients in olive oil before the eggs go in the pan (with a little garlic, if you wish). And because eggs are by nature delicate and somewhat bland, make sure everything else is well seasoned.</p>
