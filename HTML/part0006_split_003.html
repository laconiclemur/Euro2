			<p class="rec-intro">A wonderfully soothing dish, blanquette de veau is cooked in homes and restaurants in many parts of France. Traditionally, the meat for a blanquette was from a very fatty part of the belly and kept on the bone. For today’s taste, it is more often cooked with a leaner cut and without the bone. Pilau rice is a good accompaniment.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6–8</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1kg boned breast of veal, cut into 4cm chunks </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 large onion, studded with 2 cloves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 carrots, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 leek, white part only</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bouquet garni, made up of leek, parsley stalks, bay leaf, thyme and celery (see <a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="for-the">Garnish</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">24 small cocktail onions, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g small button mushrooms, wiped </p>
			<p class="for-the">Sauce</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml double cream</p>

			<p class="body">Put the meat in a pan, cover generously with cold water and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down to a gentle simmer and skim any froth off the surface. After 30 minutes, add the vegetables, bouquet garni and a little salt. Continue to simmer for a further 80 minutes – you may need to top it up with boiling water. </p>
			<p class="body">While the meat is simmering, carefully decant about half a litre of the cooking liquid and pour it over the cocktail onions in a separate pan. Simmer until tender, then add the mushrooms. Cover and simmer for another 10 minutes until cooked. Now drain and pour the liquid back into the meat pan. Keep the onions and mushrooms warm in a tureen.</p>
			<p class="body">When the veal is tender, carefully remove it and put it into the tureen. Cover and keep warm. Discard the vegetables that were cooked with the meat.</p>
			<p class="body">Bring the cooking liquid to a rapid boil for 15 minutes or until reduced by half. Add the double cream, boil again for 5 minutes, then take the pan off the heat and stir in the whisked egg yolk and crème fraiche mixture. Check for seasoning and pour the sauce though a fine sieve over the meat and garnish. Serve at once.</p>
