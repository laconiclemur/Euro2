<p id="sab0003225" class="calibre10"><a id="pg9" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>Even when I was in my late teens and going out at the weekends, I was always thinking about eating well. I loved going to a particular restaurant where they served Galician-style octopus on potatoes: it was tapas, and you were eating standing up, but it was a great way to start the evening. I didn’t want to eat half a sandwich or a burger – that was for the end of the night. I spent all my money on food and restaurants. I still do.</p>
<p id="sab0003226" class="calibre10">I never thought I was going to be a chef. My mum used to say that she loved cooking but being a chef was different. Now, of course, it’s fashionable: you just have to turn on the TV to see the dozens of cooking shows.</p>
<p id="sab0003227" class="calibre10">I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do: I volunteered in the Red Cross because I liked caring for people, but I loved drawing and cooking too. I hadn’t enjoyed training to become a nurse and, when I studied architectural draughtsmanship, I found that every day was the same. So, halfway through my course, I decided to travel for six months, learn a different language and see if I enjoyed working in a kitchen. I came to London, and I fell in love.</p>
<p id="sab0003228" class="calibre10">One of my friends from home had a boyfriend who worked in a French restaurant called Simply Nico. When I went there to speak with the chef, he said, you don’t speak any English, you need to start as a KP. I was ready. I may have been unable to talk, but I showed my enthusiasm and ambition in other ways. If I had to peel the potatoes, I was the fastest at peeling the potatoes. If I had to peel the onions, I was the fastest at peeling the onions. I worked really long hours but everything was new to me and I was happy. After about four weeks, they said, OK, we’ll put you on salads. Then I moved to hots … and I started to speak English in the kitchen. The only way to really understand how to run a kitchen is to start from the bottom and work your way up, and it was at Nico that I realized that being a head chef isn’t just about cooking – in fact, that’s almost the easiest part.</p>
