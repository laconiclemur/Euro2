 Bebia’s Supi</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">-GRANDMOTHER’S SOUP-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>My maternal grandmother was very strict and had a lot of rules surrounding food. One of them was that soup had to be served at every meal, and nine times out of ten, this is the soup she served. When I was younger I didn’t like this soup, possibly because I was forced to eat it so often, but these days I have grown much fonder of it and the memories it brings.</strong>

<em>Memories of my Grandmother’s soup</em>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>My two grandmothers had very different approaches to food; for one it was a celebration, for the other a discipline. When it came to food, my maternal grandmother was very conventional and, because of this, I always dreaded visiting her home. When my family visited her, there was absolutely no eating between meals, which was in stark contrast to my paternal grandmother’s house, where we were always raiding the fridge to devour the goodies that she kept there. Another rule that my maternal grandmother had, and one that was even harder for me to follow, was that every meal had to start with soup.</strong>
</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Without fail, at the start of every mealtime a large bowl of steaming soup was placed in front of me and, also without fail, I battled with my grandmother about not wanting to eat it. I wasn’t allowed to leave the table or continue with my meal until at least some of the soup had been consumed, so eventually we would compromise and I would force down a few meagre mouthfuls to keep her happy. My grandmother tried everything to get me to eat her soup, from filling it with my favourite vegetables to buying me a special brightly patterned bowl to eat it from, but nothing ever did the trick. These days I love soup and eat it regularly, but I can never sit down to a bowl without a wry smile in remembrance of the battle of wills that my grandmother and I staged over the dinner table all those years ago.</strong>

<p class="para1">
<strong>This hearty soup is perfect for cold days when you are craving something warm, comforting and filling with just a hint of chilli heat to awaken your senses. The beans are mashed to give the soup a thick texture, which I enjoy, but liquid can be added to achieve a thinner consistency if you prefer.</strong>

<strong>Serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz dried beans (kidney, borlotti [cranberry] or cannellini beans or a mix), rinsed and soaked in cold water for at least 2 hours or up to overnight</p>

Cook for 40 minutes, until the beans are tender, gradually adding more of the water as the beans swell and absorb the liquid. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid, and return to the pan. Using a potato masher, mash the cooked beans until almost smooth (I like to leave a few lumps for texture). Set aside in the pan.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook, stirring continuously, until soft and just golden, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Add the cooked onions to the pan with the beans and enough of the reserved water to achieve a consistency that you are happy with. I like my soup quite thick, but this will depend on personal taste. Bring to a simmer, then add the bay leaf and <em>Ajika</em>
 and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para">Remove the bay leaf from the pan and discard. Add the celery and coriander (cilantro) to the pan and cook for another 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste and serve hot.</p>

<p class="para1">
<strong>Tarragon is one of my favourite herbs and, along with dill, coriander (cilantro) and basil, is one of the most commonly used in Georgian cuisine. Its distinctive aniseed flavour has an almost metallic edge which can drown out subtler flavours. Because of this, I think it’s best used in recipes where it is the main ingredient, such as this soup or the</strong>

 Borscht</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">-BEETROOT SOUP-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Although borscht is most commonly associated with Russian or Ukrainian cuisine, it has been adopted into Georgian culture. Borscht was one of the mainstays of my grandmother’s table. She made hers with cabbage and I always had to force it down. Years later, when making my own version I steered clear of cabbage and added apple and fennel instead, which adds a delicious sweetness to the mellow beetroot (beet) flavour with a delicious tang of aniseed coming from the fresh fennel.</strong>
