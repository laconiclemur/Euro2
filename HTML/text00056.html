<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">In the Kitchen with Julia Child</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">It was a quiet, ordinary early summer day in 1992 when the phone rang at our home in Duluth. I was out doing errands. My mother-in-law, who was visiting, picked up the phone and almost fainted when she heard the voice on the other end: “Hello, this is Julia Child. I’d like to speak with Beatrice.”</p>
<p>When I stepped in the door about an hour later, a breathless mom-in-law practically screamed: “Julia Child called you and she sounded just like she does on TV!”</p>
<p>I dialed the number she had nervously scribbled down, and sure enough, it <i>was</i>
 Julia. She explained that she was working on a book with Dorie Greenspan called <i>Baking with Julia,</i>
 and she wanted to know if I would be interested in doing a half-hour television show with her. WOULD I?!? Do birds fly? Is the pope Catholic?</p>
<p>I still don’t know exactly why I got to be so privileged, but what followed were intense discussions about the potential appearance on her show. What would I bake? How can I possibly show Julia Child something she didn’t already know? Julia, with her matter-of-fact wisdom, assured me that nobody knows it all. There is always something new to be learned.</p>
<p>But me? “Yes, of course,” she said. “I have your <i>Finnish Cookbook</i>
 and your <i>Scandinavian Baking Book</i>
 and have admired both of them very much.” She went on to say that she has a special place in her heart for Norway, as she and her husband, Paul, had spent some years there.</p>
<p>After much discussion with the producers of the show, we finally settled on my version of a quick buttery Danish pastry and whole-grain Swedish hardtack. What followed were questions from me such as: “What should I wear? What do I need to bring with me?” The answers: Bring a choice of a red and a blue blouse (the idea that if I wear blue, Julia will wear red), and they will supply an apron. It wasn’t necessary to bring along any equipment or food supplies. They had their Irving Street basement in Cambridge stocked with every imaginable tool and ingredient, not to mention what looked like a full kitchen complete with extra help.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I thought the house looked like it was on life support because of all the monstrous tubes snaking into the house through windows and doors blowing cool air in. It was a sultry-hot July day in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and with all the cooking and baking and equipment going full blast, the house and its occupants needed an extra boost in the air-conditioning.</p>
<p>The kitchen was set up as a photo studio, complete with burning-hot lights, reflectors, and cameras on tripods. The center table had become a work space. There was a stool to one side on which Julia perched just close enough to the action so she could poke her fingers into whatever I was mixing for a taste, or reach to feel the consistency of a dough—always offering a positive reaction in her nasal, heady voice. It felt like my mother was sitting there—all eyes and ears.</p>
<p>My face was smoothed with makeup and dusted with powder, my eyes outlined with eyeliner, which I wasn’t accustomed to using. A stylist set every strand of my hair in place, added just the right amount of lipstick, and I was deemed camera ready. I was put into place behind the counter, my ingredients and tools to the right and left, the microwave behind me, and a bowl of berries ready for cooking. Yet something was wrong—my white hair reflected too much, creating a lighting problem. So to correct the problem, the top of my head was dusted with a black powder. We were set!</p>

<p>We broke for lunch in the little patio space outside the house. At one point Julia remarked after I made a comment about her lovely home, “When we bought this place we spent sixty-nine thousand for it. Now they tell me it’s worth a million!” In the same manner she couldn’t quite understand that everybody knew who she was.</p>
<p>It was a great day in Cambridge. I left for home in Minnesota on a high! When my youngest brother called me that evening and asked where I had been, I excitedly replied, “I just filmed a cooking show with Julia Child!”</p>
<p>His response, “Who’s Julia Child?”</p>
<p>I guess you still can get a fair trial in this country.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Quick Method Danish Pastry</a>
</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">3½ to 4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter</p>
<p class="rpil">2 packages active dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup warm water</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup heavy cream or undiluted evaporated milk</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon freshly crushed cardamom seed (optional)</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 eggs, room temperature</p>
<p class="rpill">¼ cup sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Measure 3½ cups flour into a bowl or work bowl of food processor with steel blade in place. Cut the butter into ¼-inch slices and add to the flour. Process or cut the butter into the flour until the butter is about the size of kidney beans.</p>
<p class="rp">In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir in the cream or milk, cardamom, salt, eggs, and sugar.</p>
<p class="rp">Turn the flour-butter mixture into the liquid ingredients, and with a rubber spatula mix carefully just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours, overnight, or up to 4 days.</p>
<p class="rp">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board; dust with flour. Pound and flatten to make a 16- to 20-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds, making 3 layers. Turn dough around and roll out again. Fold from the short sides into thirds. This should result in a perfect square. Repeat folding and rolling again if you wish.</p>
<p class="rp">Wrap and chill the dough 30 minutes or as long as overnight. For filling, shaping, and baking, follow directions in the following recipe.</p>

<p class="rpil">¼ cup (½ stick) soft butter</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup powdered sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon almond extract</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup finely pulverized almonds</p>
<p class="rpil">1 (3-ounce) package almond paste</p>
<p class="rpill">1 egg white</p>

<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">1 slightly beaten egg</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons milk or water</p>
<p class="rpil">Pearl sugar or crushed sugar cubes, for topping</p>
<p class="rpill">Chopped or sliced almonds for topping</p>

<p class="rph1">Icing</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">1 cup powdered sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">2 to 3 teaspoons warm water</p>
<p class="rpill">½ teaspoon almond extract</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease and flour them.</p>
<p class="rp">Divide the chilled dough into 2 parts. Roll each part out to make a rectangle 12 by 6 inches. Place these strips on the prepared baking sheets.</p>
<p class="rp">To make the filling, cream the butter and sugar until light. Blend in the almond extract, almonds, almond paste, and egg white.</p>
<p class="rp">Spread filling down the length of the center of the strips. Cut slanting strips at ¾-inch intervals along both sides up toward the center using a pastry wheel. Fold strips over the filling in a crisscross manner.</p>
<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="rp">Let strips rise for 15 to 30 minutes, just until the pastry strips look puffy; they will not double.</p>
<p class="rp">To make a glaze, beat the egg with the milk or water. Brush the pastry lightly with it. Sprinkle the sugar and/or sliced almonds over the top.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake about 15 minutes or until golden.</p>
<p class="rp">Frost, if desired, with almond-water icing. Blend the sugar, water, and almond extract until smooth and thin enough to drizzle over the braids.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 2 filled braids</p>
