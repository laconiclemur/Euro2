The region exemplifies the extensive offerings of Italian traditional regional products, such as Grana Padano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mortadella, <em class="calibre4">prosciutto di Parma, aceto balsamico, cotechino</em>, <em class="calibre4">Culatello di Zibello</em>, <em class="calibre4">lardo</em>, porcini, and more. From this great region’s culinary culture, and the passion and artisanry of its people, stem some of the most magnificent meals in Italy. <em class="calibre4">Lasagna imbottita, tagliatelle alla Bolognese</em>, tortellini, <em class="calibre4">tortellacci, cappelletti, cappellacci, tortelli, anolini, bollito misto, erbazzone</em>, drizzles of <em class="calibre4">balsamico tradizionale</em> on everything from cheese to meat to strawberries and ice cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">I learned this firsthand when I opened Felidia in 1981, from Dante and Nino Laurenti, who hailed from Corchia, a small town near Parma, at the foot of the Apennines in Emilia-Romagna. Nino was the sommelier and Dante the head captain in my newly opened restaurant. They were gems at the service of food, but what I loved most about them was their talent, passion, and commitment for the food of their native region and their willingness to share it with me and our guests. The first traditional <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, tortellini, <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em>, and tagliatelle I learned to make was from them. Together we made <em class="calibre4">cotechino, bollito misto</em>, and even made and cured the whole prosciutto. They were away from their native land but held steadfast to the culinary culture of their upbringing. I was so enamored of their cuisine that I wanted to know more, and in the early eighties began my intense culinary missions of research to that region, which continue into the present; I continue to find gems of products, techniques, and flavors.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of the first things you can expect on a table in Emilia-Romagna is platters of <em class="calibre4">affettati</em>, sliced cold cuts, flanked with sweet and pungent fruit <em class="calibre4">mostarda</em>, followed by golden pasta stuffed, served in soups, or dressed with simple or savory sauces. If not filled, golden strands of pasta are dressed with the world-famous Bolognese sauce, sage and butter, or the drippings of the succulent, finger-licking sauce of slow-cooked roast, be it fowl, veal, or pork. The leftovers of these slow-roasting meats usually turn into the delightful stuffed pastas. And these are just some of the delights you will encounter traveling through Emilia-Romagna.</p>

  <p class="indent">In this region, one of the essential qualities of a good chef/cook is patience. In addition to the tradition of slow roasts there is the tradition of large pots of great soups made from capon and mixed meats, slowly simmering into a savory golden liquid to which some little stuffed <a class="calibre8" id="page123"></a>pasta like tortellini or <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> are added. The <em class="calibre4">stufato</em>—it could be of beef, pork, or veal—slowly perks and braises, yielding yet another one of this region’s succulent dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">So, as you can imagine, this is not a hurried cuisine. Everything from the products that need to be produced and aged, to the roast, to the time-consuming soups and braises, to the rolling, cutting, and stuffing of pasta—this cuisine needs time and dedication. It is no wonder that this regional cuisine yields some of the tastiest and most satisfying dishes in all of Italy.</p>

  <p class="indent">When you decide to begin cooking from this region’s culinary tradition, tagliatelle and stuffed pasta should be on top of your list, and it is the recipes for these that I share with you in this book and encourage you to make. The northern regions of Italy are known for their fresh pasta, just as the southern regions are known for their use of dry pasta. Hailing from the north, I can recall pressing my little fingers into the silky dough when I was a child and could not even reach the table.</p>

  <p class="indent">With all due respect to my northern roots, fresh pasta in Bologna takes the prize. So, a few years ago, while in Emilia-Romagna, I went on a mission to learn how to make the pasta as they do in Bologna and compare it with the one made by Dante and Nino. I had heard about a mother, Renata Venturi, and her two daughters, Daniela and Monica, in Bologna, who made the best pasta and sold it in a small store called Le Sfogline, meaning “the sheets”—of pasta, of course.</p>

  <p class="indent">Le Sfogline is located at 7B Via Belvedere, behind the Mercato delle Erbe, under a portico in the center of Bologna. There they make mounds of tagliatelle and <em class="calibre4">anolini, tortelli</em>, tortellini, and <em class="calibre4">cappellacci.</em> The fillings of the stuffed pastas changed according to season, but the shapes remained the same. The store was always bustling with discriminating Bolognese housewives, and each sale was packaged as a gift box, tied with a ribbon. One of the daughters was in charge of the money, always at the front, while the mother, with her muscular arms, was rolling the dough in the back, and the other sister was in charge of making the stuffing and shaping the pasta.</p>

  <p class="indent">The lesson was simple. Organic fresh eggs were used, with yolks the color of the sun, and freshly milled flour, local water, and lots of elbow grease to work the dough until it was resilient and yet as soft as silk when cooked. Of course, to dress the tagliatelle, or to make a <em class="calibre4">lasagna pasticciata</em>, the Bolognese sauce is essential. In simple terms, it is a meat sauce, but when it has been simmered for three hours with the best local ingredients, the sauce clings to the golden pasta like honey.</p>

  <p class="indent">In this chapter, I give you a recipe for <em class="calibre4">carni bianche</em>—a “white” meat sauce, which is traditional but maybe not as known as the traditional Bolognese, and is a great change. I also have a meatless but equally rich sauce option with <em class="calibre4">salsa alla Romagnola</em>. But meat is not in short supply in Emilia-Romagna. Besides the famous <em class="calibre4">prosciutto <a class="calibre8" id="page124"></a><a class="calibre8" id="page125"></a>di</em> <em class="calibre4">Parma</em>, if you travel about twenty miles south of Parma to Langhirano, you will be in the center of hanging-ham country; these ultimately cure into prosciutto. I learned that local farmers feed their pigs the remaining whey after making Grana Padano and Parmigiano-Reggiano, and this yields the best pork, which, combined with the constant flow of air coming down the Apennines with the Taro River, gives these prosciuttos their sweet, delicious flavor.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_047_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="figure1"><em class="calibre4">The Maletti Acetaia in Modena</em></p>

  <p class="indent">Traveling down the main road through the town of Langhirano, you can’t help noticing large warehouses with rectangular windows as high as the buildings, fitted with louvers. These louvers are raised or lowered according to the air movement, to cure the prosciutto properly. On one of these houses stands proudly the name of my dear friend Carlo Galloni, whose family has been producing great prosciutto for generations. If you happen to be in the area, do ring the bell and tell him you are Lidia’s friend. Otherwise, make sure that, next time you buy <em class="calibre4">prosciutto di Parma</em> in the States, you ask for Galloni.</p>

  <p class="indent">Another good friend is Carmen Maletti. The Maletti family hails from Modena, the <em class="calibre4">aceto-balsamico</em> capital, and they produce an extraordinary <em class="calibre4">aceto balsamico tradizionale</em>, which is available in the States. I love visiting the <em class="calibre4">acetaia</em>, which is in the attic of the Maletti home; here there are hundreds of barrels, ranging from five to thirty liters, placed in ascending size order. The spout of every barrel is covered with a handmade white linen lace doily, so flies or other insects do not drop in while the balsamic vinegar ages. But what I enjoy most is being with Carmen in her kitchen. She is an extraordinary cook (her <em class="calibre4">anolini in brodo</em> rivals Dante’s), and I credit her with the <em class="calibre4">Anolini alla Parmigiana</em>, <em class="calibre4">Cipolline en Agrodolce</em>, and <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em> recipes in this chapter. A jovial woman with a great laugh, she always dresses in bright colors. A feast of food and a welcome with a big hug await me whenever I visit her and her family.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Cipolline en Agrodolce <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 6</p>

  <p class="extract">You will find many ways to please your guests with this simple dish. The juicy, glazed onions are delicious as an hors d’oeuvre to be passed around, tossed in a salad, or served as a side dish with meats and fish. Here, I use balsamic vinegar to give the glazing syrup lots of flavor and a lovely caramel color, but you could use good wine vinegar as well. In which case, use just half the vinegar called for, and 1 teaspoon of honey.</p>

  <p class="indent">These onions are wonderful served warm from the pan or at room temperature and make a great house gift, packed in a nice jar with a label tied around the neck. They will keep in the refrigerator for a week or two and freeze well, too.</p>

  <ul class="none">

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, drop in all the peeled onions, and return the water to a simmer. Cook about 20 minutes, or until the onions are tender all the way through—pierce them with the point of a paring knife to test. Drain the cipolline and pat them dry.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the butter in the big skillet, and set it over medium-high heat. When it is melted, scatter the onions in the pan, and toss to roll and coat them with butter. Season with the salt, and cook, tossing frequently, until the onions are brown and caramelized all over, about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the vinegar into the pan, and sprinkle the sugar into it (use more or less sugar to taste). Shake the skillet, rolling the onions around, as the vinegar comes to a boil and the sugar dissolves. Cook at a boil for 5 minutes or so, frequently tossing the onions, until the syrup thickens and lightly glazes the cipolline.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve the cipolline warm, right from the pan with syrup drizzled on top, or cooled to room temperature (the glaze will thicken and can be spooned over).</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Here are two versions of <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em>, the traditional vegetable tart of Emilia-Romagna: one with a filling of butternut squash, rice, and ricotta, and the second of cooked chard scented with fresh rosemary. The squash is perfect for autumn or winter, and the Swiss chard is great in spring or summer—with these two recipes, you’ll be covered for a whole year of home-baked <em class="calibre4">erbazzone.</em></p>

  <p class="indent">Both tarts are delicious and versatile, and can be served small as an hors d’oeuvre, or in larger portions as a main course, with a salad, or with a poached egg on top. Though I prefer <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em> served warm, they’re fine at room temperature, terrific to take on a picnic or pack as a lunch-box treat. Frozen <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em> can be reheated in the oven (or toaster oven) and is nearly as good as when first made.</p>

  <p class="indent">First, however, I give you a tasty olive-oil dough to make the large bottom crust for any <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em>—with either of my fillings or with ones that you have thought of. The dough takes just minutes to mix.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c05s01.02">D<span class="small1">OUGH FOR</span> E<span class="small1">RBAZZONE</span></h2>

  <p class="nonindent1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about a pound of dough, for 1 <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em></p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the 2 cups flour and the salt in the food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse a few seconds to aerate. Mix the oil with ⅓ cup cold water in a spouted measuring cup. With the processor running, pour the liquid through the feed tube and process about 30 seconds, until a soft dough forms and gathers on the blade. If the dough is not gathering on the blade, it is probably too dry. Add more water, in small amounts, until you have a smooth, very soft dough.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for a minute, until it’s smooth and soft. Pat into a rectangle, and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for ½ hour. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to a day, or frozen for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A heavy-bottomed saucepan, 4-quart capacity; a baking stone, if you have one; a 10-by-15-inch jelly-roll pan, or similar-sized rimmed sheet pan</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the filling: Peel the butternut squash, slice it in half lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds. Cut the squash into a few big chunks, and shred them on the coarse-shredding holes of a box grater. Heap the shreds on a kitchen towel, wrap them up tightly, and vigorously wring the towel, squeezing out as much liquid from the squash shreds as you can.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the milk into the saucepan, and set it over medium heat. Add the rice, butter, and ½ tea-spoon of the salt, and heat to a boil, stirring occasionally. When the milk is boiling, stir in the shredded squash, and adjust the heat to keep the milk simmering away until it has all been absorbed (though the rice will still be quite <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>), about 12 minutes. Scrape all of the rice and squash into a large bowl, and let it cool a bit.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> In a small bowl, beat two of the eggs with the remaining 1½ teaspoons salt. When the rice and squash are no longer steaming, stir in the eggs, then the scallions, a cup of grated <em class="calibre4">grana</em>, all the ricotta, and the heavy cream. Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste, and stir the filling until thoroughly mixed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you’re ready to bake the <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em>, set a rack in the bottom half of the oven—with a baking stone on it, if you have one—and heat the oven to 375°.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface, gradually stretching it into a rectangle that’s 5 inches longer and wider than the jelly-roll pan. Drape the sheet of dough over the pan, then gently press it flat against the bottom and rims, leaving even flaps of overhanging dough on all sides.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread the filling into the dough-lined pan in an even layer over the entire bottom. Fold the dough flaps over the filling, making pleats at the corners, to form a top crust that looks like a picture frame, with the filling exposed in the middle.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page130"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup grated cheese over the filling. Bake in the oven (on the heated stone) about 25 minutes, until the filling and crust have set but not colored. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl, and brush it over the crust. Return the <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em> to the oven, and bake another 25 minutes or more, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is crisp on top.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cool the <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em> on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes to set the filling before slicing. The <em class="calibre4">erbazzone</em> can be served warm or at room temperature, cut into bite-sized, appetizer, or large pieces, in any shape you like.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the filling: Cut off the stems at the base of each chard leaf, and if the central rib is thick and tough, cut it out. (Save all the stems and ribs for stock—I do!) Pile up the trimmed leaves, and slice them crosswise into ribbons, about 1 inch thick.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bring 5 quarts of water to the boil in the big pot, heap all the chard into the pot, and stir, gradually submerging the strips. When the water boils again, adjust the heat to keep it gently bubbling, and simmer the chard until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool off, then squeeze the leaves by handfuls, pressing out as much vegetable water as possible.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Stir in the chopped garlic, and cook until sizzling and fragrant, then scatter the chard in the pan, loosening the compressed ribbons. Add 1¼ teaspoons salt, and stir and toss for a couple of minutes, until the chard strips are coated with olive oil and starting to cook. Transfer them to a large bowl to cool briefly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Beat the eggs with the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, and stir them into the warm chard; then thoroughly blend in the grated cheese, bread crumbs, and chopped rosemary.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface, gradually stretching it into a rectangle that’s 5 inches longer and wider than the jelly-roll pan.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread the filling into the dough-lined pan in an even layer over the entire bottom.

  <p class="nonindent">Tagliatelle—also known as “fettuccine” or <em class="calibre4">“lasagnette”</em>—are long flat ribbons of fresh pasta. And though you can find them all over Italy, nowhere are they made better than in Emilia-Romagna. And the cooks of Emilia-Romagna excel in marrying their golden tagliatelle with a brilliant variety of sauces that perfectly coat the strands and complement the rich flavor and tender texture of the pasta.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the following pages are recipes for fresh tagliatelle and three distinctive sauces to dress it. This pasta is so good, it will be a delight served with nothing more than sweet butter and freshly grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano. But I hope you’ll try all of the sauces I’ve brought you from Emilia-Romagna. If you’re in a hurry, try the uncooked walnut pesto with ricotta, or the luscious fresh Romagnola Tomato Sauce, which takes about half an hour to prepare. For a more complex dish, make the velvety long-cooked “white” <em class="calibre4">ragà</em>. And if you want to experience the quintessential dish of tagliatelle as it is made in the region, prepare the authentic <em class="calibre4">Ragà alla Bolognese Ricetta Tradizionale</em>.</p>

  <p class="extract">In addition to tagliatelle, use this rich pasta dough to make all the forms of filled pasta from Emilia-Romagna—<em class="calibre4">anolini, cappellacci, tortelli</em>, and tortellini—that I detail later in the chapter.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the flour in the bowl of the food processor, and process for a few seconds to aerate. Mix the whole eggs and egg yolks, olive oil, and ice water in a measuring cup with a spout.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Start the machine running with the feed tube open. Pour in the liquids all at once (scrape in all the drippings), and process for 30 to 40 seconds, until a dough forms and gathers on the blade. If the dough does <em class="calibre4">not</em> gather on the blade or process easily, it is too wet or too dry. Feel the dough and add either more flour or more ice water, in small amounts. Process briefly, until the dough gathers on the blade, and clear the sides of the bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand briefly until it’s smooth, soft, and stretchy. Press it into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for ½ hour. (You can refrigerate this dough for up to a day, or freeze it for a month or more. Defrost frozen dough in the refrigerator; return it to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make tagliatelle: Cut the dough in six equal pieces. Keeping it lightly floured, roll each piece through the machine at progressively thinner settings into sheets that are 5 inches wide (or as wide as your machine allows) and at least 20 inches long. Cut the long sheets in half crosswise, giving you twelve strips, each almost a foot long.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> One at a time, lightly flour each strip, and fold it over into thirds or quarters, creating a small rectangle with three or four layers of pasta. With a sharp knife, cut cleanly through the folded dough <em class="calibre4">crosswise</em>, at ½-inch intervals. Shake the cut pieces, opening them into long ribbons of tagliatelle. Dust them liberally with flour, gather into a loose nest, and set it on a floured towel or tray. Fold, cut, and unfurl all the strips this way, piling the tagliatelle in small floured nests. Leave uncovered to air-dry at room temperature, until ready to cook (or freeze the nests on the tray until solid, and pack in airtight ziplock bags).</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Tagliatelle con Ragà di Carni Bianche <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 7 cups, enough for 2 batches (3 pounds) tagliatelle or other pasta</p>

  <p class="extract">In a traditional <em class="calibre4">Ragà alla Bolognese</em>, the ground meats are slowly cooked with tomatoes and red wine and stock, developing a velvety texture and deep, rich flavor. This “white” <em class="calibre4">ragà</em> streamlines the process and omits most of the tomato, producing a lighter and more delicate sauce with much of the complexity of the classic <em class="calibre4">Bolognese.</em> (And if you want to make it even lighter, you might use ground rabbit meat or turkey or chicken in place of the chopped beef.) Typically used to dress fresh tagliatelle, <em class="calibre4">ragà di carni bianche</em> is also delicious as a sauce for other pastas, lasagna, polenta, and gnocchi.</p>

  <p class="indent">This recipe makes enough sauce to dress two batches of my fresh tagliatelle; use half the sauce for one dinner, and freeze the rest for a great meal to come.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the sauce: Put the ground meats in a large bowl; loosen, crumble, and toss the meats together with your fingers.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drop the chunks of onion, carrot, and celery into the food processor, and mince fine, to an even-textured paste. Pour the olive oil and drop the butter into the big saucepan, and set over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, scrape in the paste, or <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, season with 1 teaspoon of the salt, and cook and stir the <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> until it has dried out and just begins to stick to the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page134"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Quickly crumble all the meat into the pan, stir with the <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, sprinkle over it 1 more teaspoon of salt, and cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until the meat starts to release its juices. Turn up the heat a bit, and continue cooking and stirring the meat as the juices evaporate, about 10 minutes, taking care that the meat doesn’t brown or crisp.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the juices have disappeared, pour in the white wine, bring it to a bubbling simmer, and cook until evaporated, 2 or 3 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the tomato paste into the milk until blended. When the wine has cooked away, pour in the milk and cook, stirring, until it has cooked down.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now ladle 2 cups or more of the hot stock (or water) into the pan, just enough to cover the meat. Stir in the bay leaves and the remaining salt, and bring the liquid to an active simmer. Cover the pan, adjust the heat so the liquid is steadily bubbling (not boiling rapidly), and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, as the broth gradually reduces. Stir in about 2 more cups hot stock, just to cover the meat again, then give another 20-minute period of covered cooking and reducing. Stir in a final addition of 2 cups stock, and cook, covered, until the <em class="calibre4">ragà</em> is thick and concentrated, 20 minutes or so. (The sauce should have cooked for at least an hour and incorporated 6 to 8 cups of stock in total.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Taste the <em class="calibre4">ragà</em> and adjust the seasoning. If you’ve prepared it in advance, let it cool, then refrigerate and freeze as you wish. Or you can remove about half (for future use) and prepare tagliatelle now, keeping about 3½ cups of freshly cooked sauce in the big saucepan, to dress the pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the tagliatelle: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to the boil. Shake the nests of tagliatelle in a colander or strainer to remove excess flour. Drop all the pasta into the pot at once, and stir to loosen and separate the strands. Cover the pot, and return the water to a boil rapidly. Set the cover ajar, and cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes or more, until barely <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> (the pasta will cook a bit more in the pan of sauce).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, heat the <em class="calibre4">ragà</em> to a simmer. If it has cooled (or been chilled or frozen), it will have thickened, so reheat it slowly in a wide pan, stirring in a cup or so of stock or water, to loosen it.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift the <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> tagliatelle from the cooking pot quickly, with a spider and tongs, drain briefly, and drop the pasta into the simmering <em class="calibre4">ragà.</em> Toss together, over low heat, for a minute or more, until all the strands are coated and perfectly cooked. Thin the sauce, if necessary, with hot pasta water, or thicken it quickly over higher heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, sprinkle a cup or so of grated cheese over the tagliatelle, and toss well.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the pesto is ready and the water is boiling, shake the nests of tagliatelle in a colander or strainer to remove excess flour.

  <p class="extract">Just as the Neapolitans have their marinara, Romagnola cuisine also offers a savory, meatless tomato sauce as an essential pasta dressing. This version is made from fresh tomatoes—round, plum, or small cherry tomatoes can all be used—and cooks in the time it takes to heat the pasta water. A small amount of tomato paste is called for, and although you can omit it, I think it lends complexity to the sauce and makes it cling to the golden ribbons of tagliatelle so much better.</p>

  <p class="indent">This recipe makes enough for one batch of fresh tagliatelle, but if you have plenty of fresh tomatoes, you should certainly double the sauce formula and freeze half to use another time.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the sauce: Core the tomatoes, and cut them in half. With round or plum tomatoes, squeeze out seeds into a sieve placed over a bowl—save the juices and discard the seeds—then chop the tomatoes into ¾-inch pieces. Cherry tomatoes need only be cut in half.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big skillet, and set it over medium-high heat. Scatter the garlic slices in the pan, and heat for a minute or so, until they start sizzling. Toss in the rosemary sprig and peperoncino, let them heat for a few moments, then drop the tomato paste into a clear hot spot in the pan bottom. Toast the tomato paste for a minute, then pour in the chopped tomatoes, sprinkle on the salt, and stir all together.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook the tomatoes for a couple of minutes, until they begin to release their liquid. Pour in the reserved tomato juices from the bowl, along with ½ cup or so of water (use it to slosh out the tomato bowl). Bring the sauce to a boil, then adjust heat to keep it perking steadily. Cook, uncovered, until tomatoes break <a class="calibre8" id="page137"></a>down into a chunky sauce, about 10 to 12 minutes. When the sauce is done, stir in the parsley and turn off the heat (or keep it barely simmering if you are ready to cook the pasta).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the tagliatelle: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a rolling boil. Shake the nests of tagliatelle in a colander or strainer to remove excess flour. Drop all the pasta into the pot at once, and stir to loosen and separate the strands. Cover the pot, and return the water to a boil rapidly. Set the cover ajar, and cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes or more, until barely <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> (it will cook a bit more in the sauce).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Have the tomato sauce at a simmer; if it has cooled and thickened, loosen it with a bit of the hot pasta-cooking water. Lift the tagliatelle from the cooking pot quickly, with a spider and tongs, drain briefly, and drop into the simmering <em class="calibre4">ragà.</em> Toss together, over low heat, for a minute or more, until all the strands are coated and perfectly cooked. Thin the sauce, if necessary, with hot pasta water, or thicken it quickly over higher heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, sprinkle ½ cup or so of grated cheese over the tagliatelle, and toss well. Drizzle a couple of tablespoons of olive oil all over, and toss again. Heap the pasta in warm bowls, and serve immediately, passing more cheese at the table.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em class="calibre4">Anolini</em> are one of the classic filled pastas of Emilia-Romagna, very small, delicate pasta disks, enclosing morsels of savory pork filling, served in a rich broth. My version was inspired by the <em class="calibre4">anolini in brodo</em> prepared for me by Carmen Maletti at her home in Modena (where the Maletti family makes extraordinary <em class="calibre4">aceto balsamico tradizionale</em>).</p>

  <p class="indent">Because <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> are small—and your loved ones will each ask for 15 or 20 of the little treasures, enough to go with every spoonful of broth—my recipe makes enough for ten servings, about 150 to 200 <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> (depending on how thin you roll the dough). Though this may seem like an enormous undertaking, I assure you that it is not. The dough and filling are easy to make (and can be done in advance), and the technique I give you for forming the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> will produce dozens of little disks every few minutes. The procedure is fun—kids are great <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>-makers, I have found—and goes faster every time you do it. Even the first time you make these, I bet you’ll feel like a real pasta-maker from Bologna!</p>

  <p class="indent">The effort will also reward you with a pasta delicacy that you can enjoy in many ways. In this recipe, I provide instructions for serving six, which will use about half your <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, leaving you half to freeze for soup suppers in the months ahead. Simply cook up a handful of frozen <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> in hot broth, perhaps just for yourself, whenever you want. Of course, you could prepare your entire batch of pasta at once as a classic <em class="calibre4">anolini alla parmigiana</em> for a dozen guests—it would be a meal they would never forget.</p>

  <p class="indent">And whether you are serving one or a dozen, <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> are always best in a rich homemade <em class="calibre4">brodo</em>, such as my Chicken Stock. They deserve such special treatment.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A small roasting pan; a meat grinder with coarse grinding plate; a pasta-rolling machine; a 1-inch-diameter round pastry or cookie cutter; a narrow pastry brush; trays or baking sheets lined with floured parchment or kitchen towels</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the filling: Preheat oven to 425°. Cut the pork shoulder into 2-inch pieces, trimming away any excess fat or cartilage as you go. Put the meat in the small roasting pan along with the onion, carrot, celery, pancetta, porcini, and rosemary. Spread the tomato paste on the meat and vegetables, and toss to coat. Pour the hot stock into the pan.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roast the meat and vegetables, uncovered, until the meat is brown and tender and the pan juices have reduced to a thick gravy, about 1 hour. (If the meat is tender and the juices are still too thin, remove the pan from the oven and reduce on top of the stove.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the meat, vegetables, and juices cool. Toss in the cubes of mortadella and run the entire mixture through the meat grinder into a large bowl. Run day-old bread through the grinder to clean out the last bit of meat (and catch it in the bowl). Beat the egg with a pinch of salt, and pour over the meat, along with the grated cheese, nutmeg, and bread crumbs. With your hands, work everything together to make a smooth stuffing.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the <em class="calibre4">anolini:</em> Cut the dough in six equal pieces; work with two pieces of dough at a time, and keep the others covered. Roll one piece of dough through the pasta machine at progressively wider <a class="calibre8" id="page141"></a>settings, always keeping it lightly floured, until you’ve created a long strip, as wide as your machine allows, and a little less than ⅛ inch thick. Lay it out on the work surface. Roll out the second piece of dough to a strip of the same size.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lay one strip in front of you. Mark where you will be making the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> by lightly pressing the 1-inch cutter on the dough—don’t cut through it—fitting as many outlined circles on the strip as you can.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scoop small portions of the filling—⅓ to ½ teaspoon—and mound them in the center of all the circles. With the pastry brush (or your fingertip) dipped in water, lightly moisten the rim of the outlined circle around the filling mounds. Lay the second strip of dough over the first, gently stretching and draping it to cover all the mounds. Now center the cutter over each filling mound, and press it firmly, cleanly slicing through both layers of dough and cutting out the <em class="calibre4">anolini.</em> Pull away the excess dough to separate individual pieces, lightly dusting with flour as needed. Press the edges of the pasta circles together if they have gaps. Arrange the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> in a single layer on a floured and lined tray, and cover them lightly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now roll out and fill the remaining pieces of pasta dough, in pairs, to make two more batches of <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, in the same way. <em class="calibre4">Anolini</em> that you will cook soon can be left on the tray, lightly covered. Freeze <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> for future use right on the trays. When they are frozen solid, transfer them to freezer bags, packed airtight and sealed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook and serve <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> in broth for six, you will need about a hundred <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, so everyone gets at least fifteen in a bowl of soup. (Of course, you can vary this number, depending on the size of your pasta pieces, the appetite of those you are feeding, and what else you’ve prepared for the meal.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fill a large pasta pot—preferably with a wide diameter, so the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> won’t be crowded—with at least 6 quarts well-salted water, and bring to the boil. At the same time, heat the Chicken Stock in another pot, so it is just simmering. Have your soup bowls warm and ready for filling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With the pasta water at a full rolling boil, spill in all the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, stir well, cover the pot, and return the water to the boil over high heat. Give the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> another good stir, and let them cook for a quick minute, just until they’re barely <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> Check one for doneness—the thickest part of the pasta should still be slightly resilient, since the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> will continue to cook and soften in the <em class="calibre4">brodo.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat and, with a big spider or other strainer, scoop out hot <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, let them drain for a second, and spill fifteen to twenty into each of the warm soup bowls. Quickly ladle hot broth into each bowl (1½ to 2 cups a serving), and sprinkle over each a heaping spoonful or two of grated cheese. Serve each bowl of <em class="calibre4">anolini in brodo</em> while piping hot, with more grated cheese passed around the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you want to serve the soup right at the table, bring out the pot of hot Chicken Stock and set it on a trivet, then drain the <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> and divide them among the soup bowls in the kitchen. Bring the bowls filled with <em class="calibre4">anolini</em> to the table, add the Chicken Stock, and serve.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c05s01.10"><a class="calibre8" id="page142"></a>T<span class="small1">ORTELLINI WITH</span> R<span class="small1">ICOTTA</span>-F<span class="small1">ONTINA</span> F<span class="small1">ILLING</span></h2>

  <p class="nonindent1">Tortellini di Ricotta <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 180 tortellini, serving 9 or more, with cooking and finishing instructions to serve 4</p>

  <p class="extract">Tortellini are probably the best-known and most popular of the many forms of filled pasta for which Emilia-Romagna is famous. Although they are made all over the region, tortellini are the special pride of Bologna, where, according to food historians, they were first created centuries ago. When I visited the great artisanal pasta-makers Renata Venturi and her daughters, Daniela and Monica, whom I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, they showed me their techniques of hand-rolling and shaping tortellini in their marvelous pasta shop, Le Sfogline.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though tortellini are sold (usually frozen) in most markets in the United States, the recipe here will give you a big batch of fresh homemade tortellini, far superior to anything you can buy at the store. And you will see how easy and enjoyable the shaping is, especially the final twist that gives each piece its distinctive shape.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although meat-filled tortellini might come to mind first, I love this ricotta version, dressed with a simple tomato sauce, such as my Marinara Sauce. A more complex sauce, such as <em class="calibre4">Ragà alla Bolognese</em> or mushroom <em class="calibre4">guazzetto</em>, would also be delicious, as would a simple dressing of sage and butter. (If you want to try other pasta shapes than tortellini, you can make <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> or <em class="calibre4">tortellacci</em> with this ricotta-fontina filling.)</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the filling: Stir together the ricotta, fontina, grated cheese, and nutmeg in a large bowl. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the salt, pour them over the cheeses, and stir everything with a wooden spoon until thoroughly blended and smooth.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page143"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cut the dough in six equal pieces. You’ll make tortellini from one piece at a time; keep the others covered. Roll the first piece through the pasta machine at progressively wider settings, always keeping it lightly floured, until you’ve created a long strip, as wide as your machine allows, and a little less than ⅛ inch thick.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lay out the strip on a lightly floured surface and, with the fluted cutter, cut it lengthwise in thirds, to form three long narrow strips, each about 2 inches wide. Cut vertically through the strips at 2-inch (or smaller) intervals, forming small squares of pasta. You should have thirty or more squares in all. Remove excess bits of dough (which can be kneaded together, rested, and rerolled for more pasta).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Place a scant teaspoon of the filling in the center of each square. With the pastry brush (or your fingertip) dipped in water, lightly moisten the edges of the squares around the filling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To form each tortellino: Pick up one square and fold it over on the diagonal, creating a triangle with the filling inside; press the moistened edges together to seal it well. Next, grasp in your fingers the corners of the base of the triangle (its long side), twist them inward so the points of dough overlap, and pinch them together. As you make the twist, the stretching of the dough will make the fluted edges and the opposite point of the triangle will pop up, creating the plump hatlike tortellini shape.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fold and twist the rest of the squares into tortellini; set them in a single layer on a lined and floured tray. Make more tortellini from the other cut pieces of dough (and the rerolled scraps of dough, too). Tortellini that you will cook soon can be left on the tray, lightly covered.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook and serve tortellini with marinara sauce for four, you will need seventy to eighty tortellini (eighteen to twenty per serving, depending on pasta size and your guests’ appetites).</p>

Tumble the tortellini over and over for a minute or so, until all are coated and perfectly cooked.

  <p class="extract">In Emilia-Romagna, <em class="calibre4">zucca</em> (a pumpkinlike winter squash) is a traditional filling for <em class="calibre4">cappellacci</em>, stuffed pastas that are folded and twisted like tortellini but slightly larger. Butternut squash is the best substitute for Italian <em class="calibre4">zucca</em>, though you must squeeze out all the moisture after cooking it. With the sweetness and texture of crushed amaretti cookies and hints of lemon and nutmeg, this is a delicious and versatile filling, great in tortellini and <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> as well as <em class="calibre4">cappellacci.</em></p>

  <p class="indent">Sage-infused melted butter is the customary (and perfect) dressing for this autumn and winter dish. For a variation, omit the sage, and brown the butter in a hot pan before drizzling it over the pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the oven to 400° and arrange a rack in the center. Slice the squash lengthwise in half, and then quarters; scoop out and discard seeds. Arrange the wedges, peel side down, on the baking sheet, drizzle olive oil over the cut surfaces of the squash, and season with 1½ teaspoons of the salt. Tent the squash with aluminum foil, place the sheet in the oven, and bake 45 minutes, or until the squash flesh is very soft.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, grind the amaretti cookies in a food processor—using more cookies if necessary—to make a full cup of fine-textured dry powder.</p>

Bring the edges of the cloth together, enclosing the vegetable, and hold the bundle over a bowl or the sink. Twist the cloth, tightening the towel and squeezing the liquid from the soft flesh. When you’ve pressed out all the moisture you can, turn the wrung-out squash into a large bowl, and stir and mash it up with a large wooden spoon. Add the ground amaretti, the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, the grated cheese, nutmeg, and lemon zest, and stir them into the squash. Pour in the beaten eggs, and stir until thoroughly blended and smooth.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the <em class="calibre4">cappellacci:</em> Cut the dough in six equal pieces and roll each out as described. Make <em class="calibre4">cappellacci</em> from one strip at a time. Lay it out in front of you on a lightly floured board. With the round cutter, cut as many 2½-inch circles as you can from the dough strip, pressing firmly and occasionally dipping the sharp edge of the cutter in flour so it doesn’t stick. Separate the circles, pulling away the scraps of dough (which can be kneaded together, rested, and rerolled for more pasta). You should get about two dozen circles from the strip.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Place a heaping teaspoon of squash filling in the center of each dough circle. With the pastry brush (or your fingertip) dipped in water, lightly moisten the rim of dough around the filling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Tortelli</em> are filled pasta squares, like ravioli. These are the largest of the pasta shapes in this chapter—you need only eight to ten pieces per serving—and the simplest to make, too, since they need no twisting.</p>

  <p class="indent">Here I give you two savory <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> fillings that I discovered in Emilia-Romagna. The techniques for making <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> are the same for this cabbage-and-pancetta filling and for the chard-ricotta filling that follows. (You can also make <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> with the fillings I give you for <em class="calibre4">anolini</em>, tortellini, and <em class="calibre4">cappellacci.</em>)</p>

  <p class="indent">As I often say, homemade pasta is so good that you need nothing more than butter (or extra-virgin olive oil) and cheese to dress it. So, in the master recipe, I dress the cabbage-filled <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> with just melted butter (as is customary in the north of Italy)—I would do the same with the chard-filled <em class="calibre4">tortelli.</em> You could also dress them with a light tomato sauce, such as the Romagnola or my Marinara Sauce. And if you are making a meat roast or roast chicken for the same meal, the juices and drippings from the roasting pan would make a splendid dressing for your tortelli.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the cabbage filling: Trim away tough or blemished leaves from the head of cabbage, cut out the entire core, and slice the head in quarters. With a sharp, long-bladed knife, thinly slice the cabbage wedges. You should have about 3 quarts of very fine shreds.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page147"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the olive oil and the butter in the skillet, and set over medium heat.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heap the shredded cabbage in the skillet, season with the salt, and tumble it over to mix with the fat and pancetta. Pour in the hot water, cover the pan, and heat it quickly to a boil. Adjust the heat to maintain a steady bubbling simmer, and cook, covered, for about ½ hour, stirring and turning the cabbage now and then, until the shreds are very soft and the pan is nearly dry. Uncover, and cook away the remaining liquid (but don’t let the cabbage brown), then empty the pan into a bowl to cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the cabbage is at room temperature, beat the egg with a pinch of salt, pour egg over the cabbage, and toss in with the shreds.

Make <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> from one strip at a time. Lay a strip out horizontally in front of you on a lightly floured board. With the pastry wheel, trim the left, right, top, and bottom edges of the strip to form an even rectangle. Starting about 1 inch in from the left (short) edge of the strip and 1 inch above the bottom (long) edge, place a scant tablespoon of filling on the dough. Continue to make more mounds at 2-to-2½-inch intervals. You should be able to fit eight to ten mounds on the strip, depending on length.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With the pastry brush (or your fingertip) dipped in water, lightly moisten the top and bottom edges of the pasta strip; also wet the dough in a vertical line halfway between the mounds of filling. Fold the top edge down to align with the bottom edge, covering the mounds. Press lightly to seal the edges together, and press between the filling mounds, too. Finally, cut vertically (down) the lines between the mounds, separating the strip into individual <em class="calibre4">tortelli.</em> Arrange them in a single layer on a lined and floured tray.

Cook half the <em class="calibre4">tortelli</em> for 3 minutes or so, drain, drop them into the skillet, and keep them bathed in the warm butter while you cook up the second batch.

If the central rib of the leaf is thick and tough, cut it out. (Save the trimmings for stock.) Pile up the trimmed leaves, and slice them crosswise into narrow ribbons, about ½ inch wide.

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A meat mallet with a toothed face; a large heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger; a large rectangular baking dish or casserole pan, such as a 4-quart Pyrex dish (15 by 10 inches)</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page151"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the oven to 400° and arrange a rack in the middle.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Flatten the veal scallops into scaloppine, one at a time. Place a scallop between sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap, and pound it with the toothed face of a meat mallet, tenderizing and spreading it into a thin oval, about ¼ inch thick. The pieces will vary in size.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Season the scaloppine with salt on both sides, using about ½ teaspoon in all. Spread the flour on a plate and dredge each scallop, coating both sides with flour. Shake off the excess and lay them down, spread apart, on wax paper. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt in a wide shallow bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil and drop 3 tablespoons of butter into the big sauté pan, and set over medium-high heat. When the butter begins to bubble, quickly dip scallops, one by one, in the eggs, let the excess drip off, then lay them in the skillet. Fit in as many scallops as you can in one layer—about half the veal.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Brown the scallops on one side for about a minute, then flip and brown the second side for a minute. Turn them in the order in which they went into the skillet, and then transfer them to a plate. Remove any burnt bits from the skillet, and pour in the remaining olive oil; dip the remaining scallops in egg, and brown them the same way. (If your skillet is not big enough, it is fine to fry the veal in three batches.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When all the scaloppine are browned, arrange them in the baking pan, overlapping them so they fill the dish in an even layer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the Marsala sauce: Wipe out the skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in it, and set over medium heat. Scatter in the prosciutto strips, and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes or longer, until crisped on the edges. Pour in the Marsala and white wine at the same time, raise the heat, and bring to a rapid boil. Cook until the wines are reduced by half, then pour in the stock, heat to the boil, and cook for a couple of minutes more, stirring, untl the sauce has amalgamated and thickened slightly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the pan from the heat, scoop out the prosciutto strips, and scatter them over the scaloppine in the baking dish, then pour the sauce all over the meat, moistening the scaloppine evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the <em class="calibre4">gratinato:</em> shave the chunk of Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano with a vegetable peeler, dropping thin wide flakes of cheese over the scaloppine, lightly covering them.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the baking dish in the oven, and bake for 20 minutes or so, until the <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em> is nicely browned and very crisp (rotate the dish in the oven to ensure even coloring).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the dish from the oven and, with a sharp knife or a spatula, cut around the scaloppine and lift them out, one or two at a time, with the topping intact, onto a platter or dinner plates. Drizzle the pan sauce around the scaloppine—not on top—and serve immediately.</p>
