<p class="author1"><span class="txit">fagioli e pesce in casseruola</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe is tasty and economical—with inexpensive beans adding flavor and volume to the other more costly main ingredients, shrimp and squid. It may be served for lunch or as a light supper. Allow guests to help themselves from the casserole, placed in the center of the table along with a basket filled with toasted country bread that has been rubbed with garlic. It is also terrific served as an appetizer in shallow soup bowls with extra virgin olive oil drizzled on top, or tossed with cooked fettuccine as a pasta course.</p>
