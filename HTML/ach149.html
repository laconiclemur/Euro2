<p class="noindent">My grandfather Tropiano made wine. My mother says: “There was no science to his method, and whatever didn’t work one year would be changed the next. If the wine wasn’t drinkable, we had lots of vinegar.” My father claims, “The year your grandfather made his best batch of wine was the year your mother and I became engaged.”</p>
<p class="indentb">My grandmother often liked to serve this one-dish meal accompanied by a glass of homemade wine. To her basic recipe my mother has added rosemary.</p>
