<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_101"/><b>Goat Cheese, Summer Vegetable</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Herb Quiche</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>This quiche says summer to me—the warmth and sun of the Mediterranean—with its colorful mix of artichokes and red chard and aromatic lemon thyme. Not forgetting the crumbly goat cheese, which, when cooked slowly, adds an almost almondy flavor to the quiche. Do try it with the Reduced Balsamic Vinegar, because it gives the tart an added depth of flavor. Enjoy the quiche with a red chard salad and pickled shallots.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus making the dough and vinegar and 30 minutes chilling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 1 hour</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespooon unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">9 ounces Savory Piecrust Dough (see <a href="021_9781848991583_Recipe15.html#pageid_22">page 22</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">all-purpose flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespooons heavy cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ ounces soft goat cheese log, such as Golden Cross or Ste. Maure, rind removed, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 lemon thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2½ ounces bottled artichokes, drained and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup peeled and finely chopped carrot</p>
<p class="acktxt">handful red chard leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">small handful watercress leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon Reduced Balsamic Vinegar (see <a href="014_9781848991583_Recipe8.html#pageid_19">page 19</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Lightly grease an 8-inch loose-bottomed tart pan. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured countertop until it is 10 inches across and ⅛ inch thick, then use it to line the bottom and the side of the tart pan, gently pressing it into the edges without overstretching the dough. Trim any excess dough, prick the bottom with a fork and chill 30 minutes to prevent the dough shrinking during baking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, make the filling. Pour the cream into a saucepan, add two-thirds of the goat cheese and the lemon thyme and warm over low heat 3 to 5 minutes, whisking, until smooth and silky. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mxiture to cool while you make the rest of the filling.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Melt the butter with the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and fry 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until soft, but not brown. Add the artichokes and carrot, mix well and cook 5 minutes longer, or until they are soft. Add the red chard and watercress and cook 2 minutes longer, or until they wilt. Tip the vegetables onto paper towels and press dry.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Add the eggs and nutmeg to the cool cream mixture, season with salt and pepper and whisk to combine.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Meanwhile, heat the oven to 325°F. Line the dough case with parchment paper and cover with baking beans. Put the tart pan on a cookie sheet and bake 12 minutes, then remove the paper and baking beans and turn the oven up to 350°F. Brush the bottom of the pastry case with the reduced balsamic vinegar. Spoon in the vegetable mixture, sprinkle with the remaining goat cheese and pour in the egg mixture. Bake 35 minutes, or until the filling is firm to the touch. Slice and serve either warm or at room temperature.</p>
