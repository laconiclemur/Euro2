    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page305"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind391a"/>Blue mussels</span></span> are one of the most prized ingredients on restaurant menus in Iceland today. But just a few short years ago, no one was eating them. It wasn’t because there was something wrong with them. They were in fact flourishing in the pristine waters of Iceland, just as they had been for centuries. No one ate blue mussels in Iceland because no one had ever eaten blue mussels in Iceland. Sometimes starting a new tradition can be just as difficult as preserving an old one. It took Gunnar and his insatiable appetite for local ingredients to change the opinion of his countrymen. Once they sat down to a dish of blue mussels that had been freshly plucked from the ocean, they understood how good they could be.</p>
<p class="extract">To serve those mussels, Gunnar had to join forces with <a id="ind561a"/>Simon Sturluson, arguably Iceland’s most successful blue mussel farmer. Simon says that at first Gunnar was the only chef who was calling with orders, and he would sometimes venture out into the calm blue waters surrounding his idyllic village of <a id="ind605a"/>Stykkishólmur just to fill an order of a couple of kilograms from Gunnar. Those days are past, and now Simon can barely keep up with demand. He has hired a crew and bought an additional boat to fulfill orders that pour in from every region of the country. He also farms <a id="ind539a"/>dulse, a type of red seaweed, which he sells in Iceland and also ships to customers in Europe, including to Copenhagen’s famed <a id="ind402a"/>Noma restaurant. He grows the dulse and kelp on his mussel lines, harvesting it throughout the year.</p>
<p class="extract">It took Gunnar and Simon working in harmony—even if in the early days the harmony was sometimes fraught with pressure—to convince Icelanders that their blue mussels were a treasure to celebrate at the table. Icelanders are still generally leery of cooking them at home, but just like the tourists who can’t get enough mussels, locals regularly order them now in restaurants. Because of the efforts of a chef like Gunnar, who was intent on introducing a new food to Icelanders, and of a producer like Simon, who was willing to fulfill even the most humble order, it is quite likely that eating blue mussels will be an old tradition in the future.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c13-s94"><a id="page306"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Blue Mussel and Dulse Harvester Simon Sturluson</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Have you lived in <a id="ind606a"/>Stykkishólmur your entire life?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, I’ve lived here for thirty years. I came from the south, but I met a lady who lived here and now it is history. I was working for the electrical company and traveled all around Iceland, but when I met her, she convinced me to stay, and I’m glad I did. She’s not my wife any longer, but I’m grateful to her for talking me into moving here, because I really enjoy my life.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How long have you been collecting blue mussels and dulse?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I have been working with mussels since 2007, but I had to wait for three years for them to mature. We harvest once a week to supply the restaurants. I also harvest dulse, and I prefer this because I can export it, unlike the mussels, which are very cheap throughout Europe. I can sell the mussels only in Iceland. At first, Gunnar was the only chef asking for my mussels, and sometimes in the beginning, I would collect a kilogram or two just for him and that would be my only order. So much has changed since those first days of struggle.</p>
<p class="Answer">Even though now there is demand for my mussels throughout the country, I will always be grateful to Gunnar, because he was one of the first to take an interest in them and other chefs followed his lead. The company is getting bigger and bigger every day. One hope is that the government will provide me with more help, as this is one of the few companies harvesting mussels in Iceland. I hope the government begins to see the importance of the work we do here.</p>
<p class="Answer">Gunnar was also the only chef to begin using my dulse. Iceland had an ancient dulse tradition, but it was lost over the years. Gunnar brought it back into the kitchen, and people are now interested in it again, thanks to him. When interest started picking up, we would harvest about four tons of mussels and two tons of seaweed. It grew to fourteen tons of mussels quite quickly, but the seaweed has held fairly steady, because we don’t have enough time for it. We are struggling to keep up with demand, though we are working on it.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page307"/>What are some of the challenges you face when you harvest your dulse and mussels?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Dulse is best to harvest in September, but kelp is best to pick in May and June and it can be tricky to keep it all in balance. I have a drying house nearby, and dulse only takes about twenty-four hours to dry. I sell my dulse to customers in Sweden and also to <a id="ind403a"/>Noma in Copenhagen. They buy it because it’s healthful and because the Icelandic ocean salt that permeates it, which comes from clean, cold waters, is some of the best in the world. One of the biggest challenges I face is convincing Icelanders to try their own dulse. Ducks are one of the biggest challenges with regard to harvesting mussels. They love mussels, and they eat a few tons every year, so they are a big headache. But in the end, I suppose there is enough to go around.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Where did you learn to farm mussels and seaweed?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Older people taught me some of the things I needed to learn, but I also learned a lot by trial and error; that is, I learned from my mistakes. Because these traditions are relatively new in Iceland, there is not a great deal of documentation. A man from Canada was helpful too. I have had to look to other countries for guidance, since Icelanders have not done this before.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What is the history of blue mussels in Iceland?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">It is strange, but Icelanders don’t have a tradition of eating blue mussels. At first, they were just served in the restaurants in <a id="ind507a"/>Reykjavík, and it was mainly tourists ordering them. Since then, Icelanders have slowly gained an interest in them, but they will still primarily only eat them when they are eating out. It is hard to change traditions in Iceland. Even though Icelandic mussels are delicious, it takes a lot of effort to convince people to think in a new way. But year by year, this is changing. Hopefully, blue mussels will be a common ingredient in Icelandic homes one day.</p>

<div class="yield">MAKES 1½ CUPS (340 G) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR</div>
<div class="headnote">Gunnar pays special attention to his <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-s42">butter service at Dill</a>, and this butter turns up often at the restaurant. It’s ideal for drizzling onto fish and shellfish dishes, as it carries both richness and the taste of the sea. If you have trouble sourcing Icelandic dulse or another seaweed variety, nori is a good substitute.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup plus 1½ tablespoons (250 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (120 ml) buttermilk</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="method">In a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip the butter on high speed for about 5 minutes, until white and fluffy. In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and vinegar. On medium speed, add the buttermilk mixture in a slow, steady stream until incorporated. Be sure to add it slowly or the butter will seize. Add the seaweed powder and continue to whip on low speed until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate until chilled before serving.</div>

<div class="headnote1"><a id="ind171a"/>Dandelions flourish throughout Iceland and are transformed into everything from wine to syrup. Gunnar garnishes this dish with dandelion petals that can be easily foraged from your own backyard, but the roots may be challenging to source. A good alternative is to purchase dandelion root vitamin supplements at a health food store and break open the capsules. The chips are very light, and the <a id="ind174a"/>roasted dandelion root powder gives them depth and richness. Be sure to roast your roots for at least 10 minutes in or they will impart a bitter flavor to the dish.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Gunnar uses seawater for his sea-salted potato chips, but if you do not have access to pristine ocean water near where you live, heavily salted tap water will suffice. He uses a potato called Gunaugh in Iceland, and the closest match is Yukon gold.</div>

<div class="method">To roast the dandelion root powder, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Sprinkle the dandelion root powder onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast until aromatic, about 10 minutes. Keep a close eye on it during the roasting process to prevent burning. Cool to room temperature. Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, the roasted dandelion root powder will keep for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To make the sea-salted potatoes, bring the seawater to a boil and boil until reduced by two-thirds. Turn down the heat to a gentle simmer, then prepare an ice bath. Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible on a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>). Add them to the seawater, blanch for 2 seconds, then, using a slotted spoon, transfer the slices to the ice bath, immersing them. Let stand until chilled. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page311"/>Pour oil to a depth of 4 inches (10 cm) into a heavy, deep pot and heat to 320°F (160°C). Line a large plate with paper towels. Add half of the potato slices to the hot oil and fry for about 7 minutes, until light golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chips to the paper towel–lined plate and season with half of the seaweed. Repeat with the remaining potato slices and seaweed. The cooled chips will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cottage cheese, combine the cottage cheese and syrup in a small bowl and mix well. Season with salt and vinegar. Fold in some dandelion petals and 2 teaspoons of the roasted root powder, reserving a bit of each for garnish.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place the potato chips in a bowl. Sprinkle the cottage cheese with the reserved dandelion petals and root powder and serve alongside for dipping.</div>
<div class="note" id="c13-note49">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Nori is a good and easily sourced ingredient for the powdered seaweed, but if you can find dried dulse from Iceland, it is better. To dehydrate either seaweed enough to grind it, spread it on a baking sheet and place in an oven set to the lowest setting for 4 to 6 hours. It must be brittle enough to grind or it will gum up in the blades. Grind in a spice grinder.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. <a id="ind172a"/><a id="ind618a"/>Dandelion syrup takes a little time to make, but it is a versatile ingredient that you can drizzle over a variety of foods, from vegetables and ice cream to fish and cheese. It is an ideal way to use the dandelions that flourish in the summer, and it makes a wonderful gift. To make the syrup, combine ½ cup (100 g) of sugar, 1 cup (240 ml) of water, the petals from 20 dandelions, and a squeeze of lemon juice in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Cook, stirring frequently to prevent the petals from scorching, for about 30 minutes, until a syrupy consistency forms. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof container. Let cool to room temperature, then cover tightly and refrigerate. The syrup will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</span></p>

<p class="Essays_nonindent">Dulse, the iron-red seaweed that flourishes in the cold waters along the Icelandic shoreline, is a staple of the Icelandic diet and has been since the earliest times. One of its biggest contemporary proponents is Eyjólfur <a id="ind215a"/>Fridgeirsson, an eighty-four-year-old Icelandic Buddhist biologist who several years ago founded a company, <a id="ind326a"/>Íslensk Hollusta, to promote Iceland’s dulse, herbs, and moss. Today, his successful company sells its products to home cooks and restaurant chefs in Iceland and abroad. His dulse is used by Copenhagen’s <a id="ind404a"/>Noma restaurant and by Gunnar, who shares a deep and abiding friendship with his friend, a kindred spirit who appreciates Iceland’s local ingredients as much as he does.</p>

<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> When did you decide to become a Buddhist?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I’ve been practicing Zen for decades. I first grew to appreciate it during a visit to a Buddhist monastery in San Francisco. If you practice Zen Buddhism, it clears your mind and it’s easy to implement an idea. I always wanted to improve myself. Something inside of me was calling for more balance and I found it in Buddhism. It’s good for the mind and body and helped me find simplicity in my life. Many people have noise in their heads and it drowns out their ideas, but it’s easy to have a successful business if you are floating in your environment with a clear mind.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you implement your beliefs into your business?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">One of the principles of Buddhism is to cause no harm, and I try to convey this philosophy in my business by using native resources rather than sourcing from other places in the world. I keep it local and as pure as I can by creating products such as teas, lotions, and vitamins that are derived naturally and are extremely good for you. I am a biologist by training and was always interested in Icelandic nature.</p>
<p class="Answer">I sell <a id="ind324a"/><a id="ind384a"/>Icelandic moss that, once hydrated, is similar in texture to Japanese kombu. I sell to some Japanese companies who like to use it as something different in their food preparations. I use a lot of Icelandic berries for jams, I have chutneys, and I have herbal teas. Last year I bought eight metric tons of berries to use in my products. One example of how I incorporated Buddhism into the creation of my tea was that I started with moss, birch, and angelica. At first I thought that I needed to add more, because everything you see in the market is always so packed with different ingredients. But then I told myself to stop. You need only these three things to produce a perfect tea. I sell my blueberry juice and my tea to China, which seems strange to me. Sending tea to China seems like sending sun to the Sahara.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What is the history of dulse in Iceland?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The knowledge of using dulse came from the Vikings, who brought it with them from Ireland, which they passed through to collect slaves on the way to Iceland. These Celtic people cooked for the Vikings and used dulse and other seaweed in their recipes. Today, we use dulse in breads and soups, and we use a northern seaweed called <em>fjorurgos</em> as a thickener. At one point, Icelanders were using up to twelve varieties of seaweed, with dulse the primary one. During times of famine, it was a necessity to survive, and for a while it gained the reputation of being food for the poor. People used it only in secret, but everyone was using it. Today it is considered a delicacy.</p>
<p class="Answer"><a id="page319"/>Dulse has had a long history of coming into and going out of fashion, and the debate as to whether or not it is a legitimate form of sustenance rages on. In the sagas, there is the story of a Viking who lost his son. In his despair, he decided to kill himself through starvation. His daughter told him that she would then starve herself, too, but she continued to eat dulse. He asked if it was food and she said no, so he decided to eat it, too. The salt made him thirsty, and she told him to drink milk to wash away the saltiness. The combination of dulse and milk kept him alive, and by the time he was through with grieving, he realized his daughter had fooled him. But he was not angry with her. He was grateful that the dulse saw him through his dark time.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you collaborate with Gunnar?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Gunnar has inspired me over the years. I have known him for a long time, since before he was a chef, and he is like family to me. We have similar philosophies. We both love Icelandic raw materials and want to make something healthful and beautiful from them. I always call Gunnar to ask for his opinion about things, and I really value the suggestions he gives me.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What does your family think of your business?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">My wife is always telling me to slow down, but I can’t. I feel I am on a mission to inspire people to use Iceland’s raw ingredients. She supports me in the end, as do my two sons and my daughter. My oldest son is married to a Roman Catholic from Portugal, the other one is married to a Greek Orthodox woman, my granddaughter is an atheist, my wife is Catholic, and I am a Buddhist. We all come together on Christmas Eve with all of our differences. But the differences do not matter, because we are family and at our table there is peace. This is how life should be.</p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 30 MINUTES (PLUS 2 TO 4 HOURS TO DRAIN THE BUTTERMILK AND TO SET THE WHEY GELATIN)</div>
<div class="headnote">This beautiful recipe combines the delicate flavor of small shrimp with the tanginess of buttermilk and whey for a light spring or summer dish that you will turn to again and again for dinner parties. It’s relatively simple to construct, with most of the time being inactive hours during which the buttermilk drains and the whey gelatin sets. These elements, along with the chervil oil, the ceviche, and the toasted bread, can be completed in advance, making this recipe an easy one to assemble once guests arrive. It is best to use small shrimp, as they are essentially prepared as a ceviche and will “cook” more quickly in the vinegar than larger shrimp.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>BUTTERMILK ESPUMA</strong></span></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>9 ounces (250 g) small shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tail segments removed</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 tablespoons rapeseed oil</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 teaspoon cider vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>TOASTED BREAD</strong></span></p>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the espuma, line a colander with a coffee filter and place over a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into the colander and let drain at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, until it resembles a thickened crème anglaise. If it is too thick, whisk in some of the whey captured in the bowl. Reserve the whey for making the gelatin. Transfer the thickened buttermilk to a siphon and charge the siphon with 2 nitrous oxide (NO<sub class="frac">2</sub>) chargers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Shake the siphon vigorously and refrigerate until chilled (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-note50">see note</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To make the whey gelatin, in a saucepan over medium heat, bring the whey to a simmer. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin, and stir until fully dissolved. Pour onto a small, shallow plate or other container, creating a layer ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. Refrigerate for about 2 hours, until chilled and set. Cut into ¼-inch (6-mm) squares and refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page322"/>To make the chervil oil, combine the chervil and oil in a blender and process on high speed for 5 to 8 minutes, until steaming hot and the chervil is completely incorporated into the oil. Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and strain the oil through it. Transfer to a squeeze bottle. The oil will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To make the shrimp ceviche, combine the shrimp, oil, and vinegar in a bowl and toss together until the shrimp glisten evenly. Season with salt, cover, and refrigerate until chilled. As the shrimp cool, the acid in the vinegar will tenderize them and they will appear cooked on the outside but still rare inside.</div>
<div class="method">To make the toasted bread, melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bread and fry, stirring often, for several minutes, until evenly toasted. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, dispense the buttermilk espuma onto the center of a plate and surround the espuma with the shrimp. Sprinkle the espuma with the bread, dot with the chervil oil, and garnish with the whey gelatin, roe, and chervil.</div>
<div class="note" id="c13-note50">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">A double layer of cheesecloth can be used in place of the coffee filter. If you do not have a siphon, just before serving, froth the buttermilk espuma with an immersion blender or whisk it vigorously. It will not be enough to form a true espuma (a thick foam or froth), but it will be enough to lighten and aerate the thickened buttermilk.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">Here is Gunnar’s version of a healthy Icelandic fish and chips dish, only the fish are not fried and healthful kelp is a stand-in for the chips. When the fish is paired with pickled kelp, it is elevated to a sophisticated yet fun recipe perfect for a casual weekend lunch with friends. Any firm white fish can be substituted for the cod, and the kelp can be omitted if it proves too difficult to source. That said, Gunnar encourages you to spend a little time trying to find it, as it does impart the true spirit of Iceland to the dish.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 carrots, peeled and cut into uniform pieces about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ tablespoons rapeseed oil</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 star anise pods</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>SHOESTRING BEER CRISPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Rapeseed oil, for deep-frying</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>6½ tablespoons (50 g) all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¾ teaspoon baking powder</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (60 ml) brown ale</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Powdered kelp (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-note51">see notes</a>), for seasoning</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Sea salt</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled kelp, rinse the dried, salted kombu under cold, running water for at least 10 minutes to remove as much salt as possible (as an alternative, soak the kombu in cold water for 20 minutes, refreshing the water twice during the process), then place in a heatproof glass jar. Combine the white vinegar, water, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the kombu, immersing it. Let cool to room temperature, cap tightly, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours. The kombu will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cod, preheat an immersion circulator to 149°F (65°C). Place the cod and oil in a vacuum bag and seal on the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for about 13 minutes, depending on the size of the cod. Check for doneness by pinching the cod through the bag. If it’s tender and you are able to pinch through its flesh, it’s ready. If not, continue to cook it for 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove the bag from the circulator and the cod from the bag, discarding the oil. Cut the cod into 4 equal pieces and keep warm.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page325"/>To make the sour cream, in a bowl, whisk the sour cream until fluffy. Season with salt and beer vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the carrots, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Preheat the immersion circulator to 167°F (75°C). Place the carrots, oil, and star anise in a vacuum bag and seal on the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for 13 minutes, until the carrots are tender. (If the carrots are particularly thick, they may take a few minutes longer.) Remove the bag from the circulator and, when cool enough to handle, drain the carrots, reserving the carrots and cooking liquid separately. Heat 1½ tablespoons of the cooking liquid in an ovenproof sauté pan or frying pan over medium heat. Add the carrots, stir until evenly coated with the liquid, and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast for about 12 minutes, until caramelized. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the shoestring beer crisps, pour oil to a depth of 6 inches into a deep, heavy pot and heat to 356°F (180°C). Line a large plate with paper towels. While the oil is heating, sift together the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Whisk in the ale and salt until incorporated. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a ⅛-inch (3-mm) plain tip. (Alternatively, transfer to a heavy-duty plastic bag and snip off the corner of the bag.)</div>
<div class="method">When the oil is ready, squeeze the batter in thin strings about ¼ inch (5 mm) wide and about 8 inches (20 cm) long into the hot oil, being careful not to crowd the pan. Fry for about 2 to 3 minutes, until puffed and golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the strings to the paper towel–lined plate to drain. Season with kelp and sea salt. Repeat until all of the batter is used.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place a portion of the cod on a plate and arrange the carrots and a generous handful of the beer crisps alongside. Dot the plate with the sour cream. Tear a portion of the pickled kelp into bite-size pieces and use it as a garnish.</div>

<div class="headnote">In the town of <a id="ind608a"/>Stykkishólmur where <a id="ind563a"/>Simon Sturluson harvests his blue mussels and dulse, there is a cozy restaurant that serves a beer called Black Death, which features a skull and crossbones on its label. The beer dates back to only 2011, but it was inspired by the story of a family that lived on a small island just off the coast from Stykkishólmur in the early twentieth century. They brewed a dark beer to trade with sailors who passed by the island for items they had collected on their journeys through Europe. This is why the contemporary version is nicknamed the “sailor’s beer” and has a flavor profile that recalls roasted coffee and chocolate. Gunnar uses the beer in this recipe, but any good-quality porter will work. This elaborate dessert of porter-infused apples, cake, and fudge is decadent and delicious, but any of the elements would provide plenty of enjoyment on its own.</div>

Add the flour mixture and the apple puree to the egg mixture and stir until incorporated.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pans, dividing it evenly. Bake for about 30 minutes, until golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out dry. Let cool in the pans on a wire rack to room temperature, then turn out of the pans.</div>
<div class="method">To make the caramel, prepare an ice bath. Combine the sugar, glucose, porter, salt, and butter in a small, heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until it registers 356°F (180°C) on a candy thermometer. This is a finicky step in this recipe and the temperature should be monitored extremely closely to prevent burning. The glucose will help to prevent it but attentive eyes help too. While whisking constantly, add the cream in a slow, steady stream, remove from the heat, then continue to heat to 234°F (112°C). Nest the pan in the ice bath, then let the caramel cool to room temperature, stirring frequently so that it remains smooth. It will have a fudgelike consistency. Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the granola, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, combine the oats, flours, brown sugar, and salt and stir to mix well. Add the butter and stir until all of the ingredients are evenly coated.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and spread it in an even layer about 1 inch (2½ cm) thick. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool to room temperature, then break into bite-size pieces. Add the hazelnuts and <a id="ind42a"/>puffed barley and toss and stir to combine. Transfer to an airtight container and store at room temperature until ready to use. It will keep for up to 3 days.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place a scoop of the ice cream on a plate and arrange a slice of the cake, a spoonful of the porter-infused apples, and a bite-size piece of the caramel alongside. Garnish the plate with the granola.</div>

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Brown rice flour is easier to source than barley flour and can be substituted. The one caveat is that it will not bind as well as barley flour.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Puffed barley is available in some specialty food stores, but it is also easy to make at home. To make it, preheat the oven to the lowest setting. Spread hulled barley on a baking sheet and dehydrate in the oven for 12 hours, until golden brown. Pour rapeseed oil to a depth of 2 inches (5 cm) into a heavy, deep pot and heat to 365°F (185°C). Add the dehydrated barley to the hot oil and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until puffed and golden brown. Using a wire skimmer, transfer to paper towels to drain. Let cool to room temperature before using.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. The mixture of porter and apples can instead be refrigerated in a large ziplock bag, with all of the air pressed out before sealing.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">Gunnar likes to serve sweets after dinner, and this unique presentation is a favorite at Dill. The shape of the stones mirrors the stones on a black rock beach near where Gunnar gets his blue mussels and dulse. He sometimes serves the rocks on a bed of dehydrated seaweed to showcase the inspiration behind them. The black food coloring and dusting of confectioners’ sugar makes them look like stones, but the beet-red interior is the real fun. They are fairly simple to make and such a joy to eat. They are also a great way to slip a few beets into a child’s diet, for no one, young or old, can resist the flavor of Gunnar’s beet stones.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1¼ cups (300 ml) red beet juice</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2½ tablespoons granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 sprig rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>6½ tablespoons (100 ml) heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>21 ounces (600 g) white chocolate</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ cups (180 g) confectioners’ sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 g <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-note11">powdered black food coloring</a> (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-note52">see note</a>)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Combine the beet juice, granulated sugar, and rosemary in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cook until reduced to ¼ cup (60 ml). Meanwhile, put the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced to ¼ cup (60 ml). Remove both pans from the heat.</div>
<div class="method">Add the cream to the beet juice mixture and whisk until incorporated. Place 10½ ounces (300 g) of the white chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler over barely simmering water and heat, whisking as needed to prevent scorching, until melted. Do not let the chocolate exceed 100°F (38°C). Whisk in the cream mixture until emulsified, season with salt, and remove from the heat. Let cool to room temperature. The mixture will become firm as it cools.</div>
<div class="method">When the mixture has firmed up but is still pliable, mold it into stonelike shapes, using 1 to 1½ tablespoons of the mixture for each stone. As the stones are shaped, place them on a baking sheet. When all of the stones have been shaped, cover and refrigerate them until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">In a blender, combine the confectioners’ sugar and 1 g of the food coloring and process on medium speed until stone gray. Transfer to a bowl large enough to dredge the stones. Melt the remaining 10½ ounces (300 g) of the chocolate in the same manner as you melted the first half. Whisk the remaining 1 g of food coloring into the chocolate.</div>
<div class="method">Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. While the melted chocolate is still fluid and warm, dredge the chilled stones, one at a time, in the chocolate, coating each stone completely and then placing it on the prepared baking sheet. Once the stones have cooled slightly, dredge the stones in the confectioners’ sugar, coating evenly and shaking off the excess. Arrange on a large plate or baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate until chilled before serving.</div>
<div class="method">To store the stones, layer them between sheets of parchment in an airtight container. They will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
