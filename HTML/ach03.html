<p class="author1"><span class="txit">baccalà mantecato</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Don’t be put off by the cod’s aroma, because once the <span class="txit">baccalà</span> is soaked in liquid for a full day the smell disappears and its sweet taste is revived. (We selected salt cod for this recipe because it is widely available in American supermarkets.) When Gianni was old enough to drive, it was his job to go to a nearby town, Bassano del Grappa, every week to pick up a whole dried cod for Friday’s fish dinner, in the Catholic tradition. The aroma was so pungent and the trips so frequent that his car smelled perpetually fishy. (“You don’t know what a hard time I had trying to sell that car!” Gianni adds.) This dish is best served still warm on toasted bread that has been rubbed with garlic or on a slice of grilled polenta.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound salt cod</span></p>

Drain the cod and return it to the saucepan. Add the milk, which should cover the fish (add additional milk if necessary), two of the garlic cloves, and the potato. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer until the potato is tender when pierced with a knife, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
