  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page166"></a>THE COMPOSED SALAD</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A composed salad may be a combination of any number of things. Lobster, truffles, asparagus tips, chicken breast, crayfish tails and artichoke hearts often enter into the composition of elegant versions. Depending on its makeup and the menu, it may begin a meal, or be the principal course, or replace the usual green salad.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dill has a rather special taste that does not please everyone. <em>Fines herbes</em> may be substituted.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c07-s27"><em><span class="color">Composed Salad</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Salade Composée</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 celery heart</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 pints mussels</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 small new potatoes of nonmealy variety</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 chopped onion</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>lettuce leaves</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Sauce:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon chopped tender fresh dill (or a pinch of dried dill weed)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a scant teaspoon French mustard</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup heavy cream (a few days old, if possible)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">If the celery is not absolutely crisp, put it to soak in ice water for an hour or so. Scrape the mussels and rinse them well several times in salt water (if sand is imprisoned inside the shells, the bulk of it is usually disgorged this way).</p>

  <p class="indent">Boil the potatoes in their skins, peel them the moment they are drained, slice them fairly thickly into a soup plate or bowl, pour the white wine over, and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page167"></a>Put the mussels and chopped onion into a large pot, grind in some pepper, pour over them the wine from the cooled potatoes, cover tightly, and place over a high flame, shaking the pot occasionally. Leave only long enough for all the mussels to open (3 or 4 minutes). Remove them from their shells, put them aside, and allow the cooking liquid to settle for a few minutes. Pour it carefully through a couple of layers of muslin into a small saucepan, leaving all the heavy sediment behind. Reduce the liquid rapidly by half. Taste it—fresh mussels often contain a large quantity of sea water and their cooking liquid is intensely salty—and use it accordingly in the seasoning of the sauce. (If the cream for the sauce is not very thick, forget about the cooking liquid.) Cut the celery crosswise into approximately ¼-inch slices.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="small">SAUCE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Mix together the juice of ½ lemon, the chopped dill, the mustard, and some freshly ground pepper (if dried dill is used, allow it to macerate for ½ hour in the lemon juice). Stir in the cream and add as much (if any) of the mussels’ cooking liquid as the sauce can support without becoming too thin. Taste for salt, lemon and other seasoning and adjust if necessary.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mix the celery, the mussels and the potatoes into the sauce carefully, so as not to damage the potato slices, turn it out onto a platter or shallow bowl lined with lettuce leaves and sprinkle with chopped fresh dill or <em>fines herbes</em>.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">BOILED PIGS’ TAILS AND EARS WITH VEGETABLES</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A <em>potée</em> is a mixture of meats and vegetables, boiled, traditionally, in a large earthenware pot. Each province of France has its own. (This, although all its components are found in one or another <em>potée</em>, is not traditional; it lacks the preserved goose of one, the smoked sausage of the other, etc.)</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page168"></a>Boiled, pork is finer salted than fresh. Salt pork is so little used in America that when one finds it, it is almost always too old, and sometimes rancid. The best solution is to buy fresh pork and salt it. The ears and tails, in any case, are likely to be found only fresh: sprinkle generously with coarse salt (put layers of salt and meat in a large bowl or spread out on a platter), cover and leave for several days. Rinse well before using. Commercially salted or smoked products should be rinsed, parboiled for 15 minutes (starting them out in cold water) and re-rinsed.</p>

  <p class="indent">If fresh white beans are not to be found, dried beans will serve. They should be precooked for an hour and added at the same time as the first batch of vegetables.</p>

  <p class="indent">A <em>potée</em> for 4 can always feed 6. The unused cooking liquid forms a splendid base for a rough peasant soup.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c07-s28"><em><span class="color">Boiled Pigs’ Tails and Ears with Vegetables</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Potée aux Queues et Oreilles de Cochon</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small cabbage (preferably green)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 medium leeks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound (unshelled) fresh white beans or 1 cup dried beans</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound green beans (the large overmature specimens commonly marketed will do very well)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ½ pound turnips</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ¾ pound carrots</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 pigs’ tails and 2 ears</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½-pound slice of lean side pork—fresh, salted or smoked</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3–4 quarts water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ teaspoon thyme</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 branch celery, 1 bay leaf, 1 large bouquet parsley, all tied together in a bundle</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 whole head of garlic, left intact and unpeeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 onions, peeled (1 stuck with 2 cloves)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>small handful of coarse salt</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page169"></a>Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage, cut it vertically into quarters and pare the core, leaving only enough to keep the leaves of each quarter attached. Reassemble the cabbage in a saucepan, cover with salted boiling water, cook, covered, at a slight boil for 15 minutes, and drain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the tough dark-green parts from the leeks, slit the upper halves, wash them well and tie them firmly into a bundle, the slit halves folded down.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shell the white beans, or partially cook dried beans, snap the green beans and break or cut them into short sections, peel the turnips and carrots, leaving the turnips whole or cutting them into halves or quarters, depending on their size, and cut the carrots into large sections.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cover the meats generously with water, bring to a boil, and skim (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page90">this page</a>), adding a glassful of cold water at 2 or 3 intervals each time the boil is reached. Add the thyme, the aromatic package, the head of garlic, the carrots, the turnips, the onions and the salt. When the boiling point is again reached, skim; cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and adjust to a simmer.</p>

  <p class="indent">One-half hour later, add the leeks and the shelled white beans, and gently immerse the cabbage quarters. Return to a boil and leave to simmer as before. When the white beans show signs of softening (after 30 or 40 minutes), add the green beans and cook as before for another ½ hour, or until everything is done.</p>

  <p class="indent">Discard the onions and the aromatic bouquet, remove the string from the leeks, split the ears into several sections lengthwise, and cut the side pork into pieces.</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve, if possible, in a large deep preheated platter, the cabbage quarters placed outside, the meats in the center, and the other vegetables distributed pell-mell around. Pour a couple of ladles of bouillon over the lot.</p>

  <p class="indent">A pot of mustard, a dish of coarse salt, and a jar of sour gherkins should be at hand. If possible, the accompanying bread should be coarse, heavy, and not too fresh. Each clove of garlic contains a delicious and delicate purée which may be spread on one’s bread. Squeeze the skin and the purée plops out.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><a id="page170"></a>THE PERIGORD PUDDING</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A Périgourdine specialty, a Périgord pudding (<em>flaugnarde</em>) is essentially nothing but a dish of baked crêpe batter filled with brandy-soaked prunes and raisins. Those accustomed to leavened pastries may, at first contact, find the custardy texture and the somewhat leathery skin bizarre. Its simple honesty rarely fails to seduce.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c07-s29"><em><span class="color">Périgord Pudding</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Flaugnarde</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 ounces raisins (dried currants)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound prunes (of the year’s production, if possible)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup cognac (or eau de vie de prune)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>tiny pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cover the raisins with cold water, bring them only just to a boil, remove from the heat, leave to swell for 10 minutes, and drain them. Cut the prunes in two and remove the pits. Combine the prunes and the raisins in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid, pour the cognac over and screw the lid tightly. Shake from time to time, turning the jar over. After 6 or 7 hours, the liquid will have been completely absorbed (a few hours more won’t hurt, nor will a few hours less be disastrous).</p>

  <p class="indent">Beat the sugar, eggs, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Sift in the flour, a little at a time, stirring all the while with a whisk. Stir in the milk, the vanilla extract, and the contents of the jar (don’t be alarmed <a id="page171"></a>by the thinness of the batter). Butter liberally a gratin dish or a Pyrex pie plate, ladle in the bulk of the prune-and-raisin batter and pour the rest of the batter over. Bake in a hot oven (375° to 400° F.) for 20 minutes. Serve lukewarm, directly from the baking dish. It may be eaten cold, although it is less good, but it must, in any case, be served freshly made.</p>
