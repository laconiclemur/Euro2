    <p class="nonindent">In <span class="small1">URBINO</span> you can visit one of Italy’s finest palaces. It was built by Federico da Montefeltro, a true Renaissance man, under whose patronage architects and painters flourished. Inside, Piero della Fran-cesca’s masterpiece, the <em class="calibre4">Ideal City</em>, is a clear embodiment of the humanist thought supported at his court. The ideal city is depicted as absolutely still and flat, yet it is a complex reflection of geometry, perspective lines, and amazing detail. I love the Urbino Palace. Even the storage rooms and washrooms in the basement are interesting. The greatest treasure of the Urbino Palace is Federico’s study, with its richly colored woods inlaid on flat walls, creating a marvelous three-dimensional effect: cupboards open and scrolls tumble out; a gorgeous landscape lies beyond the windows.</p>

    <p class="extract">Children love to explore Italy’s largest limestone caves at <span class="small1">FRASASSI</span> Caves. The caves are dramatically illuminated, and the main cave, the Grotto of the Wind, is so huge that the guide always proudly announces that the Cathedral of Milan would easily fit inside. My children enjoy the rickety bus ride to the entrance of the cave, the spaceshiplike airlock doors that clang shut as you move forward, and the deep descent into the earth.</p>

    <p class="extract">On a hill with a view past Porto Recanati to the sea is the quiet town of <span class="small1">LORETO</span>, one of the most revered sites in the Roman Catholic world. There, in the elaborate Basilica of Loreto, is the simple brick house where the Virgin Mary is reputed to have been born, brought here miraculously on angels’ wings from Nazareth. The most beautiful Luca Signorelli frescoes, depicting religious scholars, the Evangelists, and Saint Paul, are in the church, each figure very lifelike, with an individual personality. Don’t miss the sacristy on the other side, painted in the fifteenth century by Melozzo da Forlí. It is a masterpiece in perspective.</p>

    <p class="extract">Leave the coast behind and head inland to visit some of the most picturesque castles in Italy. You can drive in a circle essentially from Senigallia and back, visiting the lovely brick castle of <span class="small1">MONDAVIO, CORINALDO</span> Castle with its gorgeous intact fortified walls, as well as the castle at <span class="small1">FRONTONE</span> and the <span class="small1">CASTELLONE DI SUASA.</span> Along the way, you’ll feel you are taking a trip back in time as the little town of <span class="small1">PALAZZO</span> slowly unfolds up the hill. The fourteenth-century city gate and fortified walls make this tiny city a gem to visit. It takes only four minutes to walk from one side of the town to the other, but you will absorb centuries of Italian small-town tradition. Near Palazzo is <span class="small1">SAN SETTIMIO</span>, where the hills have been transformed into a country vacation spot where you can ride horses, hunt, explore the land, and swim in a glorious pool that overlooks the Marche countryside. Each guest room is a small converted stone farmhouse, which you’ll feel is your home away from home.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
