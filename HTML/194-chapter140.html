<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">A sibling of sorts to <em>arroz con leche</em> (Creamy Rice Pudding, facing page), this ancient, bucolic Basque dessert smacks of the region’s many farms and verdant valleys so rich in dairy cows and walnut trees. But as rustic as it is, <em>intxaursalsa</em> finds a place on many Basque tables on Christmas Eve. It’s simple, and requires only patience in letting it slowly reduce down to a creamy, soothing dessert. (The name literally means “walnut sauce” in the Basque language.) Traditionally, cooks crushed the walnuts to a paste in a large mortar and pestle, or used a rolling pin to mash them on a hard surface. It should go unsaid, but grinding them in a food processer is significantly easier.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     The dessert will thicken up more once it cools, and the slight graininess of the ground walnuts will soften. This dessert is best served at room temperature.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2½&gt; CUPS/285 G WALNUT PIECES</li>
<li>4 CUPS/1 L WHOLE MILK</li>
<li>1 CINNAMON STICK</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/100 G SUGAR</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Coarsely grind the walnuts.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a heavy saucepan, bring the milk and cinnamon stick to a boil over medium heat, stirring so that it does not scorch. Add the walnuts and sugar, reduce the heat to low, and gently simmer, stirring frequently to keep from scorching, until it has reduced by about one-fourth to a creamy, saucy consistency, about 45 minutes. (Add in a touch more milk if needed, or, conversely, let it reduce a bit longer.) Remove the pan from the heat and let cool.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Remove and discard the cinnamon stick. Ladle the sauce into bowls and serve at room temperature.</p>
