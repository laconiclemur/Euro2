<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red"><em>Berberechos</em> are fat, almost heart-shaped clams about 1 or 1½&gt; inches/3 or 4 cm across with some two dozen distinct, deeply marked ridges in the shell. The best come from the <em>rías</em> (inlets) of Galicia, specifically around Muros and Noia. Their season begins in autumn and winds down in March or so, as the weather warms. They are gathered by women known as <em>mariscadoras</em> who scour the beaches with rakes. Although most commonly preserved in tins in natural brine, they are at their plumpest and sweetest when steamed and eaten with a few drops of lemon. That is all they need—and all they ever get.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 POUNDS/910 G FRESH COCKLES</li>
<li>1 BAY LEAF</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>4 LEMON WEDGES</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> If needed, purge the cockles of any sand by soaking in salty water following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Discard any cockles with broken shells.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large pot, add 3 tablespoons water, the cockles, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt and snugly cover the pot with a lid. Over high heat, bring the water to a boil and steam the cockles, shaking the pot from time to time, until they have opened, 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any cockles that did not open.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Transfer to a serving bowl with a slotted spoon. Serve immediately with the lemon wedges to squeeze over the tops.</p>
