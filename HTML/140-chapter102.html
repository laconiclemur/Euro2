<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red"><em>Gambas</em> cooked <em>a la plancha</em>—on a flat grill pan—exemplify one of the delights of Spanish cooking: few ingredients and intense flavors. After all, what’s the point of buying good, fresh shrimp and then cooking them in a manner where you can’t fully appreciate their exquisite briny flavors or enjoy their firm, juicy texture?</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     I learned to cook shrimp when living in Spain, but that is also where I learned to eat them. There <em>is</em> a proper (or at least recommended) way to do so. First, break off the head, pinch it between your thumb and forefinger, and noisily slurp out the juice (that is where the flavors are most concentrated); then attack the body with your fingers, freely licking the salty, flavorful oil from them. Cloth napkins in Spain tend to be extra-large, and this is a reason why. Some like to dollop a spoonful of minced garlic and fresh parsley on top before serving, but I find that if the shrimp are of the highest caliber, it isn’t necessary or even advisable.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     These make great tapas, but also a spectacular first course—one that is now traditionally found at even the most special of occasions, Christmas lunch.</span></strong></p>
