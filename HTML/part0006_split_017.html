			<p class="rec-intro">This is a traditional Alsace feast. There are quite a few variations but they are always based around different cuts of pork. I have seen choucroute served with tail, snout – which I particularly love – and every morsel in between. The more mainstream versions include frankfurters, a more meaty sausage such as a Morteau, as well as knuckle or gammon and belly, all heaped over a steaming pile of pickled cabbage and cooked either in beer or white Alsatian wine. Boiled potatoes are a must. I have also come across choucroute de la mer – cabbage with an assortment of seafood – and I must say I’m quite partial to this too!</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">3 green pork knuckles, salted or 1kg green gammon </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1kg pork belly in 1 piece</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 onions, peeled and halved</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">10 juniper berries</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">16 medium potatoes, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1kg choucroute (pickled cabbage), precooked</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml Riesling wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 frankfurters</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Rinse the knuckles or gammon in cold water and place them in a deep pan with the belly. Cover with cold water and bring to a gentle simmer, then skim well and add the onions, spices and bay leaves. Cook for 75 minutes, then add the Morteau sausages and continue to cook for another 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover the pan with a cloth or greaseproof paper. </p>
			<p class="body">Ladle out enough of the liquid to cook the potatoes in a separate pan until tender. Reheat the cabbage in a saucepan by gently simmering it with the Riesling wine and a little of the pork cooking liquid. Five minutes before serving reheat the frankfurters in the pan with all the other pork and serve piping hot. </p>
			<p class="body">Serve the meat and potatoes in big bowls on top of the hot cabbage. </p>
