<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Along the Garraf coast, south of Barcelona, are a handful of fishing villages that each claim the origin to this popular salad. The differences in the versions tend to be subtle, and each roughly adheres to the same list of ingredients. Bitter, curly endive leaves are tossed with a nutty sauce called <em>xató</em> prepared with garlic, roasted nuts, usually tomatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, and vinegar. Garnishes include olives and salted fish.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Begin desalting the salt cod 2 to 3 days before (depending on the cut), following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Drain, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels. Shred the cod by hand into bite-size pieces following the flakes and fibers. Set aside.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Cut the peppers open and remove the seeds. Put the peppers in a bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for 30 minutes; drain. Scrape out the soft pulp with a spoon and transfer to a bowl. Discard the skins.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In the bowl of a food processor, add the almonds and hazelnuts, pepper pulp, one of the anchovy fillets, the bread, and garlic along with the vinegar. Add the pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper. Begin puréeing while slowly pouring in the olive oil. Grind into a moist, loose, and gritty paste.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Cover and refrigerate the sauce until chilled.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Clean and tear the endive into pieces. Rinse, drain, and spin or pat dry. Place in a large bowl and spoon over some of the sauce. Toss, add more sauce, toss, and so on until all of the sauce has been added and the endive is moist and covered. Transfer to a large platter or bowl.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Remove the tuna from the tin or jar in large flakes and place on the salad. Add the pieces of salt cod, crisscross the remaining anchovy fillets over the top, and scatter around the olives before serving.</p>
