			<p class="rec-intro">I love the delicate flavour of quail and, prepared like this with grapes and vine leaves, these little birds are just exquisite. I prefer to serve quail on the bone and attack them with my fingers, but if you want to make the dish a little more elegant, remove the fillets and present the meat off the bone.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4 as a starter or 2 as main course</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g smoked ventrèche (or pancetta)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 large quails</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3½ tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50ml verjus (or light white wine if you can’t find verjus)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tsp brown sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100ml brown chicken stock (see <a href="part0010_split_002.html#chicken-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>) or veal stock (see <a href="part0010_split_005.html#Veal-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g button mushrooms, wiped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 sprig of thyme, leaves picked</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 vine leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">small bunches of green and red grapes</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Cut the ventrèche into 4 and put a piece inside each quail. Place a roasting tin on the hob and heat 2 tablespoons of the butter with ½ tablespoon of oil until foaming. Season the quails and turn them in the butter and oil until golden, then place them in the hot oven to roast for about 8 minutes until cooked but still pink. Remove the quails from the tin and leave them to rest in a warm place.</p>
			<p class="body">Add a finely chopped shallot to the roasting tin and cook gently until softened. Add the verjus and sugar, then the stock and simmer for a few minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve and stir in a tablespoon of butter to finish the sauce. Check the seasoning. </p>
			<p class="body">Set aside 12 of the mushrooms and finely chop the rest. Heat ½ tablespoon of oil in a pan with the remaining shallot, finely chopped, and the thyme leaves, then add the chopped mushrooms. Once cooked, add a spoonful of the sauce to moisten the mixture. Divide this between 4 of the vine leaves and wrap them up into little parcels. Briefly sauté the whole mushrooms in the remaining butter until tender.</p>
			<p class="body">Peel the grapes and remove any seeds if necessary. Just before you’re ready to serve, pat the remaining vine leaves dry. Pour some vegetable oil into a frying pan to a depth of about 1cm and heat. Shallow fry the vine leaves until crisp. Meanwhile, place the stuffed vine leaves in a steamer over simmering water for a few minutes to reheat. </p>
			<p class="body">Serve the quail with the stuffed vine leaves and garnish with the button mushrooms, fried leaves and a few grapes. If you have time, try fixing a few green and red grapes on to one stalk.</p>
