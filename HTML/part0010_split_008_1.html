  <h3 class="h3a">Rustic mutton stew</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">I love mutton. As a boy, I remember, during the winter months, farmers would bring mutton to the village to sell and my father would always buy some to be slow-cooked with lots of herbs in a casserole. Mutton cut into chunks for stewing is now available from supermarkets; not only is it more economical than lamb, I find it more flavoursome, especially when making stews. It is ideal for slow-cooking and with the addition of potatoes is a complete one-pot meal.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz mutton pieces</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp tomato purée (paste)</p>

  <p class="ing2">600g/1lb 5oz potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and garlic and sweat for a couple of minutes. Add the mutton and brown well all over. Reduce the heat, add the wine, and allow to evaporate gradually on a low heat for about 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Stir in the herbs, some salt and pepper and 600ml/20fl oz/2½ cups of stock and cook on a low heat, partially covered with a lid, for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the remaining stock with the tomato purée and potatoes and cook for a further 25 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked. Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.</p>
