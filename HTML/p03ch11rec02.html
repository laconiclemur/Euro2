<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">I have a fabulous memory of the original “real”</span> paella valenciana <span class="italic">that I ate more than twenty years ago when I was on reconnaissance for a BBC television series. It was cooked in the open in a field in a giant paella pan. It was fantastic and exquisite. This is Lourdes March’s recipe from her</span> Libro de la paella y los arroces. <span class="italic">She uses</span> garrofón, <span class="italic">a type of fresh white lima beans, but you can use canned beans. The snails bring a taste of the rosemary they feed on. If you can’t find them, you can just use the rosemary. It will not be the</span> <span class="italic">paella</span> <span class="italic">they cook in the Valencian countryside, but it will be near enough. If you can’t find Spanish paella rice, use Arborio or Carnaroli.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds chicken thighs and drumsticks</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound rabbit or lean pork, cut into chunks</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound green beans, trimmed and cut in half</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium tomato, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="qun">9 cups water</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">12 small land snails, cleaned, in their shells or canned snails</p>
<p class="qun">A sprig of rosemary</p>
<p class="qun">2 pinches of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup canned lima beans, drained</p>
<p class="qun1">2 cups paella rice or Bomba</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in an 18-inch paella pan, and fry the chicken and rabbit pieces over high heat, turning to brown them lightly all over. Add the green beans, tomato, <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (or paprika), and water and bring to a boil, then turn down the heat, season with salt, and simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the meats are very tender. Much of the water will have evaporated.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Take out about 2 cups of the water and set it aside. Add the snails, rosemary, saffron, and lima beans, turn up the heat, and add the rice, spreading it out evenly in the pan. (Do not stir the rice again.) Add as much of the reserved water as you need to cover the rice. Cook for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, until the grains are tender but firm, adding a little of the reserved water if the rice looks dry before it is done. The best part is said to be the crunchy and slightly brown part at the bottom called <span class="italic">socarrat.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Artichoke hearts or bottoms can be used instead of the green beans.</p>
