<h2 class="h2b" id="page41">SARDINES GRILLEES, SAUCE VIERGE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Grilled Sardines with Tomatoes</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>Both the</em> sauce vierge <em>and the tomato compote are high on the list of wonderful preparations that accompany and enhance almost anything. Try both or either with lamb cutlets, grilled aubergines, peppers and mozzarella, or even with just a thick slice of crisp, garlicky, olive-oil-rich grilled bread</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Once you’ve tried boning the sardines, you’ll be surprised at how simple it is and, as you get the hang of it, how very satisfying as well</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
20 sardines<br/>
1 recipe <em>Compote de Tomates</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006a.html#page165">see here</a></em>)<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">SAUCE VIERGE</span><br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon<br/>
20 cherry tomatoes, halved<br/>
12 black olives, stoned and halved<br/>
1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your grill to its highest setting.</p>
<p class="normala">Very gently scrape the scales from the sardines with the back of a knife. Give the fish a good rinse, then cut off the heads, slit the bellies and remove the innards. Press your thumb along the inside of the central bone then open the sardines outwards with the thumb and forefinger of your other hand and remove the bone. Give them another quick rinse then store them flat, skin side up in the fridge until you need them.</p>
<p class="normala">Make the tomato compote and keep warm. Mix the ingredients for the <em>sauce vierge</em> together, season well and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Finally, put the sardines skin side up, flat on a tray that will fit under your grill, brush them with some of the oil from the <em>sauce vierge</em> and season with salt and cayenne. Grill for 5 minutes until the sardines are soft and the skin is just starting to blister.</p>
<p class="normala">Serve with the warmed tomato compote and the <em>sauce vierge</em>.</p>
