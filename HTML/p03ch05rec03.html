<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Traditionally, it was the custom to visit cider makers in the hills of the Basque Country to taste the new vintage and stock up on provisions. Today cider houses still open for a few months of the year, from mid-January through the end of April, and offer local dishes in their tavernlike restaurants with communal wooden tables. Hard cider runs out of taps from enormous barrels as people line up to have their glasses replenished. A moist-creamy salt cod omelet is one of the specialties. Basques are crazy about salt cod, but if you can’t get salt cod, use hake fillets or fresh cod (for how to make it taste like salt cod, see Bacalao, page 338).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2</span></p>
<p class="qun">8 thin scallions or 4 fat ones, trimmed and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="qun">½ green bell pepper, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">4½ ounces salt cod, desalted (see Bacalao, page 338)</p>
<p class="qun">4 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun1">1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the scallions and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet, stirring occasionally and adding a little salt, until they are soft.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Put the cod in a pan of cold water and bring it slowly to a boil, then barely simmer for 3 minutes. Lift out the fish, and when it is cool enough to handle, remove any skin and bones and break it up into small pieces. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork in a bowl, adding a little salt. Add the scallions and peppers, fish, and parsley and mix well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Clean the skillet with paper towels, and pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Heat over high heat until the oil is almost smoking, then pour in the egg mixture, tilt the pan so that it spreads evenly, and reduce the heat to medium. The trick now is to stir for only a few seconds to allow some of the liquid at the top to reach the bottom of the pan and set. Shake the pan so that the omelet does not stick. In less than a minute, when there is still some liquid in the center, using a spatula, fold one side of the omelet over to the center, then fold the other side to overlap. You will have an elongated oval. Cut the omelet in half—it should be runny in the middle—and slide onto your plates.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Instead of the scallions and green pepper, use a chopped onion and a little chopped chile pepper.</p>
