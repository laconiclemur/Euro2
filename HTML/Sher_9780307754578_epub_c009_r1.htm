  <em>Game and Game Birds</em></h1>

  <h1 class="subchapter" id="heading_id_2">(Wild und Wildgeflügel)</h1>

  <p class="nonindent">Germany’s magnificent forests and mountain slopes are filled with an enormous variety of game, and the country’s cooks certainly make the most of that natural bounty. Through the centuries, they have developed recipes that keep the meat moist, tender and full of flavor, and they have mastered a number of sauces and condiments, both sweet and tart, to complement the richness of the meat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although every part of Germany has its game specialties, the section most celebrated for its variety and preparations is Swabia, where the Black Forest is a lushly green, pine-scented storehouse of venison, wild boar, hare, pheasant, partridge and grouse. Swabia borders on Alsace, and as in that French province, juniper berries (Wacholderbeeren) are a favorite seasoning, especially for game dishes. Red currant jelly (Johannisbeergelee) or a compote of those tiny cousins of our cranberries, Preiselbeeren, is almost always served with game throughout Germany, as are cooked pears, pineapples or apples. Creamed Pfifferlinge, perhaps the most delicately aromatic mushroom in the world, accompany game here too, and since Swabia is Spätzle-land, those tiny flecks of dough, steamed and then sautéed in butter, are eaten with the gravy, while in Bavaria the preference is for bread or potato dumplings.</p>

  <p class="indent">But whether you have game in the Rhineland, in the mountains of Franconia, in Munich or in the Allgäu Alps, or in one of the northern provinces, you will find it has been well hung and cooked to perfection. Because such game meats as venison, wild boar and hare tend to have <a id="page237"></a>a strong flavor, German cooks usually marinate the larger cuts for two or three days in buttermilk, or in a combination of vinegar, red wine, juniper berries, celery root, onion, carrots, lemon peel, thyme and crushed peppercorns. In some cases they use white wine, and in others no wine at all but a blend of three parts of water to one of vinegar; others prefer plain lemon juice with any herbs and spices that appeal to the individual cook. Smaller cuts of these meats, such as chops, filets, stew meat or cutlets, are cooked with a little wine or vinegar and most of the same seasonings. Game birds are hung but not marinated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since most game is lean, the meat becomes dry, stringy and tough if it is not cooked properly. It must be larded or wrapped with bacon, salt pork or sheets of fresh lard, or, if it is a stew, enough fat should be cooked in the sauce. In Germany, game is preferred stewed, roasted or braised. In the latter cases, the gravy is a combination of strained pan juices, sweet or sour cream, and a little brandy or red currant jelly stirred in just before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unless you have experience in preparing game, I would suggest you leave hanging, skinning, plucking, bleeding, cutting and boning to your butcher. Even if you bag your own, there are butchers who will prepare and store it for you, so that it is ready to marinate and cook when you get it home.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Hasenpfeffer is one of Germany’s most famous dishes. Like most such classics, each cook who prepares it thinks his or her method is the only authentic one. The hare or rabbit meat may be marinated in a wine and vinegar mixture, or in buttermilk; or it may not be marinated at all. If it is not, it is always cooked in a sharply flavored sauce, so the end result tastes just about the same. If you are using hare, or a rabbit that is not very young, it is best to marinate the meat. Some cooks use only the loin and rump of the hare; others insist that all parts should be used, including the cleaned head and scalded giblets.</p>

  <p class="right"><a id="page239"></a><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 well-hung hare or rabbit (about 5 pounds), cut in serving pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup dry red wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>10 peppercorns, crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 juniper berries, crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cloves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ tablespoon pickling spices salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter or bacon fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>black pepper, freshly ground</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sour cream (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Place hare or rabbit pieces and giblets in a deep bowl. Simmer vinegar, water, wine, onion, peppercorns, jumper berries, bay leaf, cloves and pickling spices 15 minutes. Cool marinade and pour over hare. Marinate in refrigerator 1 or 2 days, turning meat once or twice each day. Remove meat from liquid and pat dry. Sprinkle with salt. Heat butter or bacon fat in a casserole and when hot and bubbling, add hare pieces and giblets. Brown thoroughly on all sides and sprinkle with flour. Stir over moderate heat until flour begins to brown and is absorbed by fat. If there is excess fat, pour it off. Strain marinade and add to hare. Cover and simmer 35 to 45 minutes, or until meat is tender. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Stir in sour cream if you want to use it, and heat but do not boil.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This highly seasoned hare (or rabbit) casserole is well spiked with madeira, red wine and a little brandy. It is a superb dish and a specialty around Düsseldorf, where it is made with fresh pork, and in Swabia, where the cured raw ham, Schinkenspeck, is substituted.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 well-hung, 5-pound hare (or rabbit)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>brandy</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to ¾ pound raw pork loin, thinly sliced, or ½ to ¾ pound Black Forest Schinkenspeck, or ½ to ¾ pound Canadian bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>black pepper, freshly ground</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to ¾ cup minced parsley fresh rye or pumpernickel breadcrumbs (approximately 1 cup)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup dry red wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup Madeira</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour and water for very stiff dough</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page240"></a>Cut hare or rabbit off the bones and slice; sprinkle with brandy. Let stand at room temperature 20 or 30 minutes. An earthenware casserole is traditionally used for this, but you can substitute enameled cast iron. The casserole should be about 5” deep, with 2- to 3-quart capacity; you should be able to arrange 3 layers of meat in it. Line bottom with thin slices of pork loin, Schinkenspeck or Canadian bacon. Then add layers in following order: hare or rabbit meat, salt and freshly ground black pepper, a little minced garlic, some parsley, a thin layer of bread crumbs and a layer of bacon slices. Continue until all ingredients are used up. The top layer should be bacon and casserole should be about ¾ full. Pour red wine and madeira into casserole, along with any hare or rabbit blood you might have. Cover casserole. Make a very stiff dough of flour and water and pack it around edge of casserole cover so that pot is completely sealed. Bake in 350° oven 2 hours. The casserole should be brought to table unopened.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">A little paprika and thyme are sometimes added with other seasonings.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 saddle of venison (6 to 8 pounds)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 quart buttermilk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ pound bacon or salt pork salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 juniper berries, crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup beef or veal broth</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons red currant jelly</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Marinate venison in buttermilk 2 days in the refrigerator. Turn the meat several times each day. Remove from buttermilk and pat dry. Lard with strips of bacon or salt pork at intervals of about 1½″ to 2,” or in the center of each chop. Rub well with salt, pepper and juniper berries. Melt butter in a roasting pan and brown venison in it on all sides. Pour beef or veal broth into the pan and roast in a 375° oven, allowing about 15 minutes to the pound if you like your venison rare, 18 minutes per pound if you like it well done; it should be pink to be at its best. Remove meat to a carving board, skim excess fat from pan juices and stir in sour cream and currant jelly. Heat for a minute or two and serve in a heated gravy boat.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page241"></a><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Instead of buttermilk, you can marinate the venison in a mixture of 3 parts water to 1 part vinegar. Cook the liquid with some sliced onion, carrot, celery, peppercorns and a bay leaf. Cool and pour over venison. Use this marinade for cooking the meat instead of the broth called for above.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. If a whole saddle is too much for you, use a single loin instead. (A saddle is a double loin.)</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. To make Roast Leg of Venison (Gebratene Rehkeule) follow the recipe, but marinate 3 days instead of 2. Allow 15 minutes to each pound in a 350° oven.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Venison Baden-Baden is a standard feature on German menus. It is either roast loin or leg of venison, but since Baden-Baden is in Swabia, Spätzle are served with it and the garnish is always halves of canned pears, heated (sometimes in white wine) and filled with red currant jelly.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cutlets from leg of venison</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>mustard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter or rendered bacon fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ pound white button mushrooms, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon dried Pfifferlinge, if you can get them</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water or stock if needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sour cream or sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cutlets should be pounded slightly, but should remain about ½″ thick. If they are very large, cut in half. Sprinkle with salt, spread with just a little mustard and dredge with flour. Heat butter or bacon fat in a skillet and when hot and bubbling, add venison cutlets. Brown slowly on both sides; cutlets should be cooked in 7 or 8 minutes and should be pink inside. Then add sliced mushrooms to skillet, and if you can get them, dried Pfifferlinge which have been soaked and drained according to instructions on package. Stir and sauté slowly about 5 or 6 minutes, or until mushrooms are cooked and golden in color. Add a little water or stock if the pan is dry. Stir <a id="page242"></a>in sour cream, heat and season sauce to taste with salt and a dab of mustard.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter, lard or bacon fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup red wine</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Each cutlet should be pounded to paper thinness. If very large, cut them in half. Sprinkle each slice with salt and pepper and spread with a little mustard and currant jelly. Lay a strip of bacon on each cutlet, then roll, jelly-roll style, fastening with toothpicks or tying the roll with kitchen thread. Dredge each rolled cutlet in flour. Heat fat in a small casserole and brown game rolls on all sides. Add red wine, cover tightly, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly about 40 minutes, or until meat is well done and tender. If you need more liquid during cooking, add a little water or broth.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ to ½ cup sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon drained capers</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The liver should come from a freshly killed deer, before it is hung. It must be wiped off and washed very well so that there is no liquid blood in it. Soak whole liver in a mixture of half water, half milk 2 hours, or until you are sure all the blood is out of it. Cut liver into to 1”-thick slices. Melt butter in a skillet and when hot and <a id="page243"></a>bubbling, add liver slices. Brown on both sides over moderate heat. When hver is nicely browned, sprinkle with salt, parsley and lemon juice and remove to a heated platter. Bring pan juices to a boil, stir in sour cream and blend over low heat until smooth. Stir in capers and spoon sauce over hver slices.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>dash of vinegar (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cook lentils in salted water to cover 1 to 1¼ hours, or until <em>almost</em> done. Drain off cooking liquid by pouring lentils into a strainer; reserve both liquid and lentils. While lentils are cooking, rub partridges inside and out with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Tie 2 strips of bacon across the breast of each. Heat diced bacon in a heavy 3-quart casserole or Dutch oven, and when fat begins to melt, add onion, carrot and celery and sauté until bacon is brown and vegetables are soft and golden. Stir in tomato purée and red wine. Place partridge in casserole and turn once or twice until they are coated with sauce. Cover the casserole and place in a 400° oven 45 minutes. Remove cover, turn oven temperature down to 350° and roast 15 or 20 minutes, or until birds are brown and <em>almost</em> done. Baste with pan juices as they are browning, and if you need more liquid, add meat stock. Cut the partridges in half. Pour pan juices into a saucepan and skim off excess fat. Turn drained lentils into empty casserole and top with partridge halves.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add about 1 cup of the liquid in which the lentils were cooked to pan juices in saucepan.

  <p class="nonindent">For two servings you will need 1 young pheasant that was hung about 4 days. Rub bird inside and out with salt, pepper and softened butter and cover breast with 2 or 3 strips of bacon, fastening into place with toothpicks. Roast in a 350° oven 45 minutes, or until tender. Baste once or twice with melted butter. Remove bacon strips before serving. Serve with pan juices from which excess fat is skimmed.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">If you have a young pheasant, roast as described in above recipe. When done, cut into halves or quarters and place on top of Wine Kraut. Bake in 400° oven 10 minutes. Pan juices from pheasant should be mixed through the kraut. If the pheasant is old, prepare in same way but roast only about 30 or 40 minutes, or until browned and about half done. Cut into quarters and cook with Winekraut for another 30 or 40 minutes, in covered casserole.</p>
