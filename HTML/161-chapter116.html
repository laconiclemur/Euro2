</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Clean and boil the snails with the unpeeled garlic, bay leaves, and thyme, following the directions on <a href="247-chapter183.html#page_340">page 340</a> (for fresh) or <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a> (for preserved). Leave the snails in the water.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Cut the rabbit into eight or nine pieces, following the directions on <a href="254-chapter190.html#page_342">page 342</a> (or have your butcher do it). Trim any excess fat. Reserve the liver. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the bread and fry until golden, turning once, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and reserve. Add the rabbit to the cazuela along with its liver. Cook until the liver is cooked through and the other pieces are well browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Prepare a sofrito in the cazuela with the onion, tomatoes, and one of the garlic cloves, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. When the sofrito is ready, add the jamón and chorizo, stir well to coat, and then add the wine. Return the rabbit (except the liver) to the pan along with any juices and turn over the pieces with a spoon to coat well with sofrito.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the snails to the pan, reserving the liquid. Filter 1 cup/240 ml of the liquid from the snails into the cazuela. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Prepare a picada with the reserved bread and liver, the remaining garlic cloves, the parsley, and 2 tablespoons of liquid from the snails, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. Season with 1 or 2 pinches of red pepper flakes. Loosen with ½&gt; cup/120 ml reserved liquid from the snails and stir into the cazuela.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Cook until the sauce has thickened and the rabbit is tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add salt, if needed, before serving.</p>
