<p class="noindent"><em>Aves</em> (poultry) has historically occupied an important place at the Spanish table. Medieval and Renaissance cookbooks abound in chicken recipes, many of which would startle modern palates with their extravagant use of sugar and spice. “Confections” such as <em>manjar blanco</em> of chicken breast mixed with almond milk, sugar, and rose water; or chicken <em>mirrauste,</em> in a thick, sweet sauce of nuts, lemon, ginger, and wine were clearly of Arabic inspiration. White chicken meat even found its way into marzipan! And hens figured prominently in recipes for the sick.</p>
<p class="indent">Iberian chicken recipes have gotten much less baroque over the centuries. And if today they aren’t particularly plentiful, that’s because in the countryside, <a id="page_272"/>away from palace kitchens, the egg always came first—meaning that hens were more valued for <em>huevo</em> production than they were for their meat. With the egg as the symbolic center of the Spanish culinary universe, chicken has come to be regarded as a bit of an afterthought. But what a delicious afterthought, as you’ll see here. The famous <em>pollo al ajillo</em>—bite-size pieces of chicken fried in olive oil with plenty of garlic—is impossible not to love. Another classic is <em>gallina en pepitoria,</em> hen in a medieval sauce of almonds, saffron, and eggs. In this chapter, you will also find a cider-braised bird from the <em>sidra</em>-mad northern Asturias region, a Basque chicken with cured ham and sweet peppers, and an irresistible Catalan recipe for <em>pollo</em> smothered in a delicious eggplant and zucchini ragout. And don’t miss Ferran Adrià’s chicken with dried fruit and pine nuts, which shows what wonders can be done with a take-out rotisserie bird. Duck? Few poultry dishes can match the depth and the satisfying complexity of chef Jaume Vidal’s duck legs braised with olives and prunes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hunting remains one of Spain’s favorite sports, and at restaurants game is a treat far more common than chicken. What luck! The Spanish knack for game shows in recipes like quail slowly baked in a warm vinaigrette and the marvelous Catalan rabbit stew with a surprising accent of chocolate. As for turkey, introduced from the Americas in the early sixteenth century, it proved to be an almost instant hit with the Spaniards; today it graces most Christmas tables. I haven’t included partridge recipes here; these exquisite game birds are out of reach of most cooks. But I do often daydream about sitting in my favorite restaurant in Toledo, picking every morsel of white delicate meat off the bone of <em>perdiz roja,</em> the prized red-legged partridge, in <em>escabeche.</em> For some things, you just have to travel to Spain.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_273"/>ROSA’S ROAST CHICKEN AND WILD MUSHROOM CASSEROLE WITH RED WINE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO AL HORNO CON SETAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Rosa Vilaseca is a perfectionist cook who has developed a vocal following for her robust Catalan country cooking at Sant Ferriol, a small spa hotel in the Catalan countryside. This chicken is a big hit with her guests, and Rosa puts it on the menu in autumn when the forests are buzzing with mushroom pickers. The chicken, Rosa explains, should be placed on top of the vegetables so that it roasts rather than stews; the red wine lends extra body to the dark, rich, deeply flavorful sauce. Rosa is also pretty adamant about using a real country chicken (<em>pollo del país</em>), so try to find a good organic bird or, failing that, a kosher or a Chinese one. (The recipe can also be made with two three-pound chickens.)</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 roasting chicken (6½ to 7 pounds), rinsed well, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons crumbled dried rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons crumbled dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing the chicken</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fresh rosemary sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 dried thyme sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chopped onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small carrot, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 whole unpeeled medium-size garlic cloves, lightly smashed, plus 2 garlic cloves, finely minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups full-bodied dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 2 cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound assorted wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles, cèpes, morels, and/or trompettesde-la-mort or a combination of wild and cultivated mushrooms (see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the chicken generously with salt, black pepper, and the crumbled rosemary and thyme and brush it with a little olive oil. Place the rosemary and thyme sprigs and the bay leaf in a double layer of cheesecloth and tie it closed.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy 12-inch ovenproof skillet or a flameproof baking dish of similar size over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, red pepper, and 8 whole garlic cloves and cook until richly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add <a id="page_274"/>1 cup of the wine and 1 cup of the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Tuck the cheesecloth bag of herbs into the vegetables, then place the chicken on top. Roast the chicken until it is cooked through, about 1 hour and 35 minutes; an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh (but not so it touches a bone) should register about 180°F. As the chicken roasts, replenish the wine and stock in the skillet every 20 minutes or so (you may not need to use all of the wine or stock).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Clean the mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Leave small mushrooms whole and coarsely chop the rest. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release and reabsorb their liquid and are lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste, then set them aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> When the chicken is done, transfer it to a cutting board, tilting it slightly as you remove it from the skillet to let the juices in the body cavity run out. Cover the chicken loosely with aluminum foil to keep it warm as it rests.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Skim as much fat as possible from the pan juices. If you have any wine or stock left, add it to the skillet. Bring the pan juices to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until reduced, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bag. Press the solids through a fine sieve back into the skillet, fold in the mushrooms, and cook until the sauce is heated through. Stir in the parsley and minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Carve the chicken and arrange it on a serving platter. Spoon a little of the sauce over the chicken and pass the rest separately in a deep bowl. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch09_note1"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If wild mushrooms aren’t readily available, you can use a mixture of dried porcini and oyster mushrooms. Just soak an ounce of dried porcinis in hot water for half an hour, chop them up, and toss them in the skillet with the oyster mushrooms, adding a little of the mushroom soaking liquid to the chicken’s pan juices.</p>

<h3 class="h3g">GARLICKY ROAST CHICKEN WITH APPLE AND QUINCE COMPOTE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO ASADO CON COMPOTA DE MANZANAS Y MEMBRILLO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">With its seductively sweet fragrance and Arabic heritage, quince has a special place on the Spanish table, most notably as <em>membrillo,</em> the dark fruit paste usually eaten with cheese. Here the quince works magic with chicken, a combination that harks back to medieval Moorish-Spanish cuisine. If you’re serving a larger crowd, I recommend roasting two chickens. As some quince can be as bland as potatoes, choose carefully, making sure the fruit is deep yellow and very aromatic.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_275"/><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>15 large garlic cloves; 10 crushed with a garlic press, 5 lightly smashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon dried rosemary, crumbled, plus 1 large pinch of rosemary for the compote</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the quince compote</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 chicken (about 4 pounds), rinsed well, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 3 cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large quince, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09_note2">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, cut into ½-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, the 10 crushed garlic cloves, the crumbled rosemary, paprika, and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl and stir until a paste forms. Set about 1 tablespoon of this paste aside for the quince compote. Rub the rest of the paste all over the chicken and under the skin. Season the cavity with salt and pepper. Cover the chicken loosely with plastic wrap and let stand while you prepare the next step.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place 1½ cups of the chicken stock and the wine and quince in a medium-size saucepan, stir to mix, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the quince is softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the quince, setting aside the poaching liquid. Place the quince in an 8-inch-square baking dish along with the apple, onion, and the 5 slightly smashed garlic cloves. Using your hands, toss the quince mixture with the reserved 1 tablespoon spice paste, season with more salt and pepper, and drizzle enough olive oil on top to lightly coat the compote.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the chicken breast side up on a rack set over a roasting pan. Place the chicken and the compote in the oven and bake both for 20 minutes. Then, add the reserved quince poaching liquid to the compote and about 1½ cups water to the roasting pan holding the chicken. Continue roasting, checking the water level in the roasting pan and the stock in the compote (every 20 minutes) and adding more, as necessary. The chicken is done when its skin is crisp and golden and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh (but not so that it touches a bone) registers about 180°F, 40 minutes more (1 hour total cooking time). The fruit in the compote should be very tender. If it isn’t, continue baking while the chicken rests.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for w10 minutes. Strain the juices from the roasting pan through a sieve into the compote. Carve the chicken and arrange it on a serving platter. Transfer the compote to a bowl and serve it with the chicken. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_276"/>POTTED CHICKEN WITH CHORIZO AND CHICKPEAS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COCIDO DE POLLO CON CHORIZO Y GARBANZOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s my all-chicken version of Spain’s famous <em>cocido</em> (boiled dinner), a dish not dissimilar to the French <em>poule-au-pot</em> but made with the typically Iberian chorizo and chickpeas. Because the chicken flavor here is rather unmasked, using a quality bird—organic, kosher, or Chinese—makes all the difference. The refreshing sauce of parsley and slightly under-ripe tomatoes is the perfect counterpoint to a hearty, wintry, one-pot meal. You can either save the broth the chicken cooks in for another use or serve it as the Spanish do, as a first course, afloat with cooked pasta shells or fine vermicelli. Another option is to spoon the chicken, chorizo, and all the veggies into large, deep bowls together with the broth, rather than serving the chicken and vegetables on separate plates.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE CHICKEN, CHORIZO, AND VEGETABLES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 chicken (about 3½ pounds), rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small garlic head, top trimmed off, outer layer of skin removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 celery rib</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fat carrots, cut into 3-inch-long pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 smallish boiling potatoes, cut into wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausages</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained (from two 15-ounce cans)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PARSLEY SAUCE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slightly under-ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced white onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate it for several hours, then let it come to room temperature before cooking.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the chicken breast side down in a heavy 6-quart pot that can hold it snugly. Add the chicken stock and enough water to come almost level with <a id="page_277"/>the top of the chicken. Add the onion, garlic head, bay leaf, and celery and bring to a boil over high heat. Thoroughly skim any foam off the top, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer the chicken for 10 minutes. Add the carrots and potatoes, bring the broth to a simmer, and continue simmering for another 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the chorizo for 2 minutes, then drain it. Add the chorizo and the chickpeas to the pot with the chicken. Cover the pot again and continue simmering over low heat until the chicken is cooked through and is very tender, about 20 minutes. Occasionally skim any foam off the top.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> While the chicken is cooking, make the parsley sauce: Place the parsley and the tomatoes in a food processor and add ⅓ cup of the chicken poaching liquid. Pulse the processor until the tomatoes are crushed but not pureed, scraping down the side of the processor bowl several times. Scrape the parsley mixture into a bowl and add the onion and garlic. Whisk in the vinegar and the olive oil and season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce stand while the chicken finishes cooking.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_278"/><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> To serve, using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a cutting board, cover it with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to a cutting board. Carve the chicken and slice the chorizo into thick slices and arrange both on a serving platter. Moisten the chicken and chorizo with some of the cooking broth and sprinkle with the flaky salt. Using a slotted spoon, transfer all of the vegetables and chickpeas to another platter, discarding the onion, celery, garlic head, and bay leaf. Moisten the vegetables generously with some of the broth. Serve the chicken, chorizo, and vegetables accompanied by the parsley sauce, and by a bowl of broth on the side for sprinkling. Set the remaining broth aside for another use. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">CHOOSING CHICKEN</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Like any other developed country, Spain has its share of mass-produced chickens. But when you buy a <em>pollo del corral</em> (free-range bird) at a market or order it at a good restaurant, the flavor comes as a revelation: taut, rather lean, and full of taste that is supremely chickeny. For the recipes in this chapter, an organic bird from a reputable producer is ideal. Before you splurge, however, consider the following, less pricey, options. Empire Kosher chickens taste deliciously moist because they are soaked in salt brine to remove all of the blood. Salt also draws out the flavor (even a regular chicken tastes infinitely better when rubbed with salt and refrigerated for a few hours before cooking). Another excellent non-boutique option is Chinese poultry, labeled “Buddhist style” by the USDA. Found at any good Chinese grocery, these chickens often come with the head and feet still attached and white metal tags on their ankles. The Chinese are obsessive about their poultry, and their chickens, fed on soybeans and corn and slaughtered according to precise and ingenious methods, tend to be very fresh. They are also inexpensive and although not as plump chested as American-style birds, they usually have a nicely firm texture and a clean, healthy flavor.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Don’t be fooled by poultry advertised as “all-natural,” “fresh,” or “young”—these terms are nearly meaningless. To be labeled free-range by the USDA, the chicken must have “been allowed access to the outside” for at least part of its life. This isn’t saying much and doesn’t necessarily mean better flavor if you don’t consider other criteria, such as breed and feed. Equally, organic can be a rather fuzzy term, referring to chickens that have been certified as such by a certifying entity. At best this means the birds were reared on organic feed—grain grown in pesticide-free soil—without the usual antibiotics, supplements, or tranquilizers. But it is important to read any fine print and look for the words “certified organic by so-and-so” on the label and buy from a reputable producer. Good chickens take more care and time to raise—eight to nine weeks compared to the six weeks for regular poultry—and that’s what you are paying for. If you really like chicken, it’s worth it.</p>

<h3 class="h3g">LEMON CHICKEN WITH HONEY AND SAFFRON</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO A LA MIEL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s an old Andalusian recipe that enticingly displays the influence of the Moorish cuisine of Al-Andalus (the Arabic name for Andalusia). Despite the presence of honey, the dominant flavors here are tart, rather than sweet, and sour. The chicken needs to marinate for at least two hours, so plan ahead. Sautéed spinach would make a good accompaniment.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 chicken (about 4 pounds), quartered, backbone removed, rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground ginger</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground coriander</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 teaspoons light honey, such as orange flower</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 1 tablespoon very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons lightly toasted sesame seeds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the chicken in an earthenware <em>cazuela</em> that will hold it in one layer, or in an attractive enamel or glass baking dish. Rub the chicken all over with salt and the cumin, ginger, and coriander. Let stand for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the lemon juice, 5 teaspoons of the honey, and the saffron in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Pour the mixture over the chicken. Prick the chicken all over with the tines of a fork, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, turning several times. Let the chicken come to room temperature before cooking.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Transfer the chicken to a bowl, then scatter the onion in the <em>cazuela.</em> Place the chicken on top of the onion and brush it with the remaining 1 teaspoon honey and the olive oil. Bake the chicken for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and <a id="page_279"/>continue baking the chicken until it is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes longer. (To avoid over-cooking the breast halves, remove them after 30 minutes.) Stir in the sesame seeds, return the breast halves to the <em>cazuela,</em> and bake for 5 minutes longer. Serve the chicken straight from the <em>cazuela.</em> <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>
<p class="pagebreak"> </p>
<h3 class="h3">SMOTHERED CHICKEN WITH VEGETABLE JAM</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLASTRE AMB SAMFAINA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Similar to Provençal ratatouille, <em>samfaina</em> is an autumnal Catalan vegetable mélange eaten on its own or cooked with meats (I love it with pig’s feet). Along with <em>escalivada</em> (mixed grilled vegetables), it constitutes one of the foundations of Catalan cooking. While the French cook the vegetables together into a kind of jam, many Catalan cooks insist that <em>samfaina</em> requires each vegetable to be fried separately over a lively heat, then cooked together briefly. It takes a little extra effort, but this way the vegetables retain their shape and character (to save time, while one vegetable cooks, I dice the next one). <em>Samfaina,</em> of course, is also great without the chicken, cooled to room temperature and served as a spread for grilled bread. And you can combine it with almost any meat in a stew or spoon it over grilled chicken or fish.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t be put off by the large quantity of olive oil—it’s healthy stuff and much of it is drained off. Roasted or boiled new potatoes are the best accompaniment for this saucy dish, which is also great cold or at room temperature.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small eggplant (12 to 14 ounces), peeled and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 small zucchini, cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large, sweet onion, such as a Vidalia, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size, ripe tomatoes, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skins discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of sugar, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large roasted red bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup pitted small oil-cured black olives, such as Gaeta or niçoise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 chicken (about 3½ pounds), cut into 8 pieces, rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Best-quality white wine vinegar (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Roasted or boiled new potatoes, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the eggplant and cook until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. (The eggplant will absorb all the oil, then release it once browned.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplant to a sieve set over a bowl and let the oil drain off. Add <a id="page_280"/>the zucchini to the skillet and cook until lightly browned, adjusting the heat as necessary so that it doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the zucchini to the sieve with the eggplant.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> If there seems to be too much oil left in the skillet, pour out all but about 2 tablespoons. Add the onion and garlic, reduce the heat to very low, and cook until the onion is very soft but not browned, about 10 minutes, adding a little water if the skillet looks dry. Add the tomatoes and sugar and cook until most of the tomato liquid has evaporated and the tomatoes are thickened and reduced, 5 to 7 minutes. Return the drained eggplants and zucchini to the skillet (setting aside the drained oil) and stir in the roasted peppers, rosemary, and thyme. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Add ⅓ cup water, cover the skillet, and cook the <em>samfaina</em> over very low heat to blend the flavors, about 10 minutes. (If you will be serving the <em>samfaina</em> on its own, continue cooking it for another 10 to 15 minutes.) Stir in the olives.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Rub the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved drained olive oil in a wide ovenproof casserole over medium heat (add more oil if there isn’t 2 tablespoons). Working in batches, brown the chicken lightly on all sides, transferring all of the browned pieces to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Spread half of the <em>samfaina</em> on the bottom of the casserole, add the browned chicken, top it with the remaining <em>samfaina,</em> and add the wine. Bake the chicken, covered, until it is very tender, about 45 minutes, turning it once.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Ferran Adrià’s Rotisserie Chicken</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">As this recipe demonstrates, Ferran Adrià, the alchemist chef of El Bulli, is as practical as he is inventive. It’s adapted from the cookbook he dedicated to quick recipes that can be made with supermarket ingredients, and it features a store-bought rotisserie chicken that’s deliciously doctored with a sauce of dried fruit, pine nuts, and port wine. Though you can whip the dish up in less than half an hour, the flavors are sophisticated enough for a fancy dinner party. If you’d like to roast your own chicken, so much the better.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup pitted prunes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dried apricots</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup pitted dried sour cherries</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons pine nuts</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 strip orange zest (4 inches), white pith removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 strip lemon zest (4 inches), white pith removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup tawny port</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 store-bought rotisserie chicken (about 3½ pounds), cut into 8 pieces, juices reserved</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the prunes, apricots, cherries, pine nuts, and orange and lemon zests and cook, <a id="page_283"/>stirring, until the pine nuts turn golden and the fruits are browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the port and cinnamon stick and cook until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock and the chicken juices. Increase the heat to high, bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the chicken pieces in a baking dish that can hold them snugly. Pour the sauce over them, scraping up all the fruit and liquid from the bottom of the skillet and turning the chicken to coat it with the sauce. Bake the chicken until it is warmed through and the sauce is further reduced, about 10 minutes. Transfer to plates and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_282"/>FERRAN ADRIA GOES TO THE SUPERMARKET</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Ferran Adrià, the Catalan chef of El Bulli restaurant, likes to experiment with liquid nitrogen and calcium chloride. He fashions paella out of Rice Krispies, entraps quail eggs in cages of gold-tinted caramel, and turns foie gras into frozen dust. He’s been featured on <em>Time</em> magazine’s list of the hundred most influential people of our time and touted by the press as an alchemist and a genius. A thirty-course tasting menu at El Bulli is closer to interactive performance art than anything most of us know as dinner.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">So what’s the guy doing doctoring a take-out rotisserie chicken?</p>
<p class="sb-indent">When I came across Adrià’s cookbook <em>Cocinar en Casa</em> (<em>Cooking at Home</em>), it seemed like a volume in which Einstein explains fractions to school children. Yet for a man portrayed by the press as a mad scientist, Adrià emerges from the pages as surprisingly practical. Done in collaboration with the Caprabo supermarket chain and featuring step-by-step photos and quick recipes based on common ingredients, the book combines El Bulli’s playful <em>esprit</em> (gazpacho Popsicles, mojito foam made in a whipped cream maker), stylish suggestions on what to do with take-out fried rice (serve it with a soy sabayon), and realistic advice on everything from the virtues of Microplane graters to how to produce ice creams without an ice cream maker (just whizz some frozen berries and cream in a food processor).</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Adrià has also produced a series of DVDs called <em>La Cocina Fácil</em> (<em>Easy Cuisine</em>), in which menus and recipe demos are themed around occasions such as candlelit cold supper, a Japanese dinner, or eating with an empty fridge. Here is Adrià making a quick meal for himself from a package of pasta, grated Parmesan, and the surprising addition of vanilla seeds—a brilliant idea! There he is improvising a <em>tortilla de patata,</em> Spain’s famous potato omelet, using a bag of potato chips, a creation he says he’s particularly fond of (see <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_143">page 143</a> for more). Now, he’s calling for a take-out rotisserie chicken, which he finishes in a lusty Catalan sauce of dried fruit and pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#page_280a">previous page</a> for the recipe). One of my favorite simple salad ideas is this: Open a bag of mesclun and place it in a bowl. Toss it with a few raspberries, a handful of mint leaves, pine nuts, coarsely chopped hazelnuts and macadamias, and shaved Parmesan. Dress it with a quick olive oil and sherry vinegar vinaigrette that includes a small pinch of cinnamon. Adrià calls it <em>ensalada de contrastes.</em> I say delicious.</p>

<h3 class="h3">CHICKEN IN ALMOND AND SAFFRON SAUCE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO EN PEPITORIA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">“Silly,” said my friend Gabriela, as we pored over glossy magazine spreads dedicated to the glitzy wedding of Spain’s crown prince Felipe. “Why did they have to do that dumb roasted capon, for sixteen hundred people? Why didn’t they do something real and truly Spanish, like <em>pollo en pepitoria?”</em> she wondered, referring to the famous dish of chicken (or hen, actually) stewed with a mortar-pounded mixture of fried almonds and garlic and tinted with saffron. In addition to being delicious, <em>pepitoria</em> is one of the oldest Spanish recipes around, one that dates back to thirteenth-century Hispanic-Moorish cooking. It’s mentioned by Cervantes himself. They should have served <em>that</em> at the royal wedding.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 chicken (about 3½ pounds), cut into 12 pieces, rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup whole blanched almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 whole medium-size garlic cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small onions, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 3 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of ground cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 very thin lemon slices, cut in half, seeds removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 hard-cooked eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Toasted slivered almonds or almond flakes (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>), for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the chicken with salt and pepper and let stand while preparing the next step.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large flame-proof casserole over medium heat. Add the blanched almonds and cook until they take on some color, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until the almonds and the garlic are golden brown, <a id="page_284"/>about 2 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the almonds and garlic to a plate lined with paper towels to drain; leave the oil in the casserole.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the browned almonds, garlic, pepper-corns, and parsley in a mini food processor and pulse to a paste, then set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat the casserole over medium-high heat. Working in two batches, brown the chicken well all over, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the browned chicken to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Drain off all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil from the casserole, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the onions and the cinnamon stick, and cook until the onions are very soft, about 10 minutes. Return the chicken to the casserole, add the wine and chicken stock, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Add the almond paste to the casserole, then rinse out the processor bowl with a little of the cooking liquid and add this as well. Stir in the saffron and cloves. Season with salt to taste, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the casserole, and cook until the chicken is very tender, about 40 minutes, turning the pieces several times. Stir the lemon slices into the cooking liquid and cook for 10 minutes more.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Remove the yolks from the hard-cooked eggs. Finely chop the whites and set aside for garnish. Place the yolks in a small bowl, mash them thoroughly, <a id="page_285"/>then whisk in a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Transfer the chicken to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Heat the casserole over medium-high heat and cook until the liquid is reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mashed egg yolks, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook to thicken the sauce slightly, another 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the casserole, turn to coat it with the sauce, and cook for another 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish, spoon the sauce on top, and garnish with slivered almonds, chopped egg whites, and some parsley. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">SAFFRON: THE SPANISH GOLD</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">There are few kitchen tasks I find more rewarding than pounding a good pinch of La Mancha saffron to a fine powder in my weathered stone mortar. I splash in a few tablespoons of hot water and let it steep for a while. Then, I swirl the bright-orange liquid into a stew or a soup, watching as the dish takes on a hue of twenty-four-karat gold, plus that faint but instantly recognizable exotically bitter scent. From the Arabic <em>za’ farán</em> (yellow), saffron has been venerated since antiquity, utilized as a spice, dye, and medicine. Introduced to the Iberian peninsula by the Moors in the tenth century, today it is cultivated in the region of Castilla–La Mancha, where the fickle crocuses flourish despite harsh winters and arid, hot summers. “An arrogant flower that is born at sunrise and dies at dark,” is how a nineteenth-century Spanish lyric referred to the spice.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">At forty dollars per ounce, saffron is worth its weight in gold. Those who quibble at the price tag should consider this: The number of crocuses needed to produce a pound of those fragile amber threads is around 70,000. The crocuses flower in the fall, carpeting the fields of La Mancha in purple. In mid-October they are handpicked one by one—an arduous task, as they grow so close to the ground, which must be performed on a dry morning, after the dew has evaporated but before the sun begins to wither the flowers. Each crocus yields only three red stigmas, the female part of the flower. Pulling a pound of these fragile filaments from the flowers can take the quick-fingered <em>mondadoras</em> (petal strippers) who perform this task some two hundred hours. Once extracted, the stigmas are spread out in a sieve and toasted until they lose all their moisture. Saffron farmers usually get paid in kind. It’s a deal they gladly accept, because a kilo of <em>azafrán</em> in the cellar is better than euros in the bank.</p>

<h3 class="h3g">GARLIC CHICKEN</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO AL AJILLO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">What fried chicken is to the American South, <em>pollo al ajillo</em> is to central Spain. And as with fried chicken, arguments over how to make it best never end. Some insist on marinating the chicken in garlic, others add garlic at the very end, so that it doesn’t burn. Some fry the chicken in oil alone until it’s rather crunchy, others add wine and/or vinegar to the sauce, as in this recipe. The only consensus is that <em>pollo al ajillo</em> is best with french fries and a cool, frosty glass of beer. And like American fried chicken, the preferred bird is a young, tender, small one that will cook quickly. It’s also important that the chicken be cut into fairly small nuggets of a uniform size, a task that’s probably best left to your butcher. If you can only get supermarket chicken, hack it into the smallest pieces you can manage. A Chinese cleaver works well for this.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 chicken (about 3½ pounds), cut into 16 to 18 pieces of roughly equal size, rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of all fat (see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09_note3">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the chicken, plus 1 teaspoon for the sauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 whole unpeeled medium-size garlic cloves, lightly smashed, and 10 large garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ dried small red chile, such as arbol, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the chicken in a bowl and rub it generously with salt. Let stand for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Pour olive oil to a depth of ½ inch in a heavy ovenproof 12-inch skillet and heat it over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Lightly dust the chicken pieces with flour, shaking off the excess. Add the 12 whole garlic cloves to the skillet and stir to coat with the oil, 1 minute. Working in two batches, cook the chicken until somewhat crisp and <a id="page_286"/>richly browned all over, 8 to 10 minutes per batch, adjusting the heat so that the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned chicken pieces to a 12-inch earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or a baking dish of similar size.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Discard the whole garlic cloves. If the oil doesn’t seem clean enough, pour it off, wipe the skillet, and add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh olive oil. If the cooking oil seems fine, pour off all but 3 tablespoons of it. Heat the skillet over low heat, add the 10 sliced garlic cloves, and cook until very fragrant and just beginning to color, about 2 minutes. Add the chile and stir for a few seconds. Add the 1 teaspoon flour and stir for about 20 seconds. Add the wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil, stirring. Season the sauce with salt to taste and pour it over the chicken. Bake the chicken until it is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and the parsley, coating the chicken evenly with sauce, and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch09_note3"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If you don’t have a butcher who can help you out and you don’t own a cleaver, substitute 2½ pounds of boneless chicken thighs.</p>

<h3 class="h3">GRILLED CHICKEN WITH PIQUILLO GAZPACHO SAUCE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO A LA BRASA CON SALSA DE GAZPACHO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Colorful, flavorful, and thoroughly modern, this recipe shows off the versatility of gazpacho, a soup that contemporary Spanish chefs don’t hesitate to turn into sauces or sorbets. Here’s a kind of showy restaurant-style dish that can be made at home with great ease. The sauce and the presentation—with a touch of basil-scented oil—also work wonders on cold poached chicken or grilled fish or vegetables.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PIQUILLO GAZPACHO SAUCE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 slice white sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large ripe tomato, seeded and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup piquillo pepper strips (from a can or jar; if unavailable, substitute pimientos), with a little of their liquid</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped Italian (frying) pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped red onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of cayenne, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_287"/><strong>FOR THE CHICKEN:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 boneless chicken breast halves (each about 8 ounces) either skinless or with the skin, rinsed and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh Basil Oil (<a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#page_287a">recipe follows</a>), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Small fresh mint leaves, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the piquillo pepper gazpacho sauce: Place the bread in a small bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain and squeeze out the excess liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the soaked bread and the tomato, piquillo pepper strips and liquid, Italian pepper, onion, garlic, cumin, cayenne, sugar, olive oil, and vinegar in a food processor and puree until completely smooth. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste and more cayenne, if desired. Scrape the sauce into a bowl and let stand until the flavors develop, at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Make the chicken: Light the grill and preheat it to high or preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Rub the chicken generously with salt and pepper and brush it with olive oil. Grill or broil the chicken, turning it once and brushing it again with olive oil, until lightly charred and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes per side.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes, then slice it on the diagonal. To serve, spread a few tablespoons of the gazpacho sauce on dinner plates and fan the chicken slices on top. Drizzle some basil oil around the sauce and over the chicken, sprinkle flaky salt lightly on top, and garnish with mint leaves. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_287a"/><small>FRESH BASIL OIL</small></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ACEITE DE ALBAHACA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">A great way to add a splash of color and herbal flavor, basil oil features in many contemporary Spanish dishes. If using the oil right away, you can skip blanching the basil. If storing it, blanching helps prevent the basil from discoloring.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ cups packed basil leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ extra-virgin or light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Bring a medium-size saucepan of water to a boil over high heat and prepare a bowl of ice water.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Blanch the basil in the boiling water just until it turns bright green, 10 to 15 seconds. Drain and plunge it into the ice water. Drain the basil again, pressing it against the sieve to extract as much water as possible.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the basil in a blender, add the olive oil, and puree until completely smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, season with salt to taste, and let stand for at least 30 minutes before using. (If you’d like to have the bright green oil without the basil puree, strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl.) The oil will keep in the refrigerator for 1 week. Bring it to room temperature before using. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT ½ CUP</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO A LA BRASA CON SALSITA DE HIGOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">There is tradition and there is innovation. And in between? For a taste of modern Spanish cuisine, I scour local food publications and the recipe supplements of popular women’s magazines. “Spanish women,” says my friend Toni Monné, editorial director of a Barcelona-based magazine group that publishes the wildly popular <em>Cocina Fácil,</em> “are no different from women all over the world. They work, they play, they tend to their families. When they cook, they want something attractive, healthy, and easy. Spanish for sure, but also worldly and modern.” The recipe here, which I adapted from one of his magazines, captures this spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>salsita</em>—a kind of uncooked compote of sliced figs and onion, steeped in sherry and vinegar and tossed at the last moment with mint and almonds—is so yummy, consider making an extra batch. It also works great made with sliced plums.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 to 9 smallish, ripe but firm fresh purple figs, trimmed and cut into thin wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ small red onion, very thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons medium-dry sherry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste if figs are very sweet</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 boneless chicken breast halves (each 8 ounces) either skinless or with the skin, rinsed and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup lightly toasted slivered almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup finely slivered fresh mint</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the figs, onion, sherry, vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a bowl and toss to mix. Let the <em>salsita</em> stand for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Light the grill and preheat it to high or preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them to a paste. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Brush the chicken with some of the garlic paste. Grill or broil the chicken until lightly charred and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes per side, turning it once and brushing it a few times with the remaining garlic paste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes. Slice the chicken on the diagonal into thick slices and arrange on a serving platter. Add the almonds and mint to the <em>salsita</em> and toss to mix.

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_289"/>CHICKEN FLAMENQUIN</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>FLAMENQUINES DE POLLO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Classic <em>flamenquines</em> (Andalusian fried pork and serrano ham rolls) tend to be a bit pig-intensive and hefty. Not this updated chicken version, which I tasted in the Andalusian city of Osuna. Normally the rolls are layered with only ham and chopped parsley and garlic, but here they are made brighter and moister by the addition of piquillo peppers and luscious melting cheese. Sliced, the rolls turn into delicious, colorful pinwheels that can be served as a tapa or a light luncheon dish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 thinly sliced skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (scaloppine-cut, about 1 pound total)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 fat garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 wide, thin slices serrano ham or prosciutto (1 to 2 ounces)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), split and opened like a book, or 2 roasted red bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 logs easy-melting cheese, such as Fontina, each about 3 inches long by 1 inch wide by ½ inch thick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1 cup dry white bread crumbs, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, beaten in a shallow bowl</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place a chicken scaloppine between two pieces of waxed paper or in a large, sturdy zipper-top bag and pound it with a kitchen mallet or heavy skillet until very thin, taking care not to tear the meat. Repeat with the remaining cutlets.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the parsley and garlic on a chopping board and, using a chef’s knife, finely mince them together.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place a pounded chicken scaloppine on a work surface and lightly sprinkle it with salt. Top with a slice of ham, trimming it to fit. Sprinkle some of the parsley mixture over the ham, then top with a piquillo pepper, trimming it to fit if necessary. Place a log of cheese across the shortest end of the cutlet, about 1 inch from the edge. Starting at this end, roll the scaloppine into a compact roll. Secure the end with a toothpick.

<h3 class="h3g"><a id="page_290"/>BASQUE CHICKEN WITH PEPPERS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO A LA VASCA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The taste of sweet bell peppers is one of the quintessential flavors in the cooking of the País Vasco (Basque Country). Slowly sautéed and enriched with bits of <em>jamón,</em> they become a delectable sauce for chicken. In this recipe, given to me by Txuno Etxaniz—a cooking teacher and cookbook author from San Sebastián—the chicken is partially roasted then flambéed and baked in the pepper sauce. Roast potatoes are a classic accompaniment.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 medium-size chicken legs (about 2½ pounds total), separated into drumsticks and thighs, rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed, plus more for brushing the chicken</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (3 to 4 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup brandy</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the chicken with salt, black pepper, and the paprika. Arrange the chicken in one layer in a wide earthenware <em>cazuela,</em> shallow casserole, or deep flameproof baking dish. Brush the chicken lightly with olive oil and bake until almost cooked through, about 35 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the chicken is baking, heat the 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until limp but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the ham and cook, stirring, until it just begins to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the red and green peppers, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the peppers soften, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, and chicken stock, cover the skillet, and cook the pepper sauce until the vegetables are very soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Remove the <em>cazuela</em> from the oven and carefully spoon off the fat (leave the oven on). Place the <em>cazuela</em> over medium heat, add the brandy, and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully ignite the brandy with a match, standing back until the flames subside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. Pour the pepper sauce evenly over the chicken and return the <em>cazuela</em> to the oven. Bake the chicken until it is very tender and the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Let the chicken cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3g">CHICKEN AND APPLES BRAISED IN HARD CIDER</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POLLO A LA SIDRA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The population of Asturias is hooked on hard apple cider. Whatever isn’t drunk ends up in a <em>cazuela</em> for braising smoky chorizo (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_51">page 51</a>), sardines, or hake, or this deliciously homey <em>pollo al sidra.</em> Asturian cider isn’t sweet—in fact it can be diabolically acidic—so don’t substitute regular apple cider or nonalcoholic sparkling cider. If you can’t find dry imported hard cider at a specialty food shop or good liquor store, try using a cup of <em>cava</em> and two tablespoons of clear apple juice.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 to 10 chicken thighs (3 to 3½ pounds total) with skin, rinsed, patted dry, and trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>

Add the bacon, if using, to the casserole and cook, stirring, until it begins to render its fat, 2 minutes. Transfer the bacon to the bowl with the chicken. Add 2 more tablespoons olive oil and the onions to the casserole and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of the cider, reduce the heat to low, cover the casserole, and cook until the onions are very soft, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining cider to the pan and boil over high heat until it is reduced by one-third, 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the casserole, placing it skin side up, stir in the bacon, and tuck in the bay leaf.

<p class="box-title">SIDRA, SIDRA!</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">In the region of Asturias, Spain’s answer to the Scottish Highlands, cider consumption is a highly ritualized activity. You enter a dim rustic tavern called a <em>chigre</em> and call out your order. The barman uncorks an unlabeled green bottle the size of a bottle of wine. To your great surprise, he stretches his arm high above his head and, holding the bottle at a slight angle, pours about an inch of <em>sidra</em> into a thin, wide pint-size glass held way below his waist. Good <em>esacanciadores</em> (pourers) can pour from great heights without as much as looking; virtuosos can even pour holding the glass behind their back. These guys aren’t just showing off. The procedure—called “throwing” the cider—oxygenates and fizzes it up, reinforcing the natural fermentation and the <em>sidra’s</em> apple bouquet. Tradition dictates that you swallow your aerated inch quickly, leaving some in the glass and splashing the dregs right onto the sawdust-covered floor. The same tradition tells you to beware of cider drinkers who seem to aim at your shoes. After the first round, you take a bite of chorizo (usually braised in cider) or Cabrales cheese (often mashed up with, what else . . . cider), and start over. The alcohol content may be low—usually between 4 and 6 percent—but after about four glasses, you suddenly realize that your legs can barely carry you home. An average Asturian male is said to consume some ten liters of cider a day. <em>Que vida.</em></p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_294"/>CATALAN CHRISTMAS TURKEY</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GALL DINDI FARCIT</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Turkey or capon graces Christmas tables in many regions of Spain, but in Catalonia it’s a holiday must, normally accompanied by a delicious stuffing of dried fruit, pine nuts, and the subtly spiced pork sausage called <em>butifarra.</em> No reason this regal dish can’t be translated to American Thanksgiving. And if you’d like to Americanize the stuffing a little, add two or three cups of plain bread stuffing to the dried fruit and sausage mixture. Gravy isn’t a particularly Spanish concept, but feel free to thicken the yummy sherry-flavored pan juices with flour. Using good-quality, preferably organic dried fruit in the stuffing will make all the difference.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE TURKEY:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 medium-size garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon crumbled dried rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon crumbled dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 bay leaves, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh turkey (12 to 14 pounds), preferably kosher, rinsed and patted dry, neck and giblets reserved for making stock or another use</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE STUFFING AND SAUCE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups dry sherry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound mixed dried fruit, such as apricots, apples, peaches, and/or prunes, larger pieces cut in half or quarters</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups dried cherries or cranberries</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound fresh mild pork sausage links (if using Italian sausage, use one without fennel)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size onions, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ½ cup chicken stock or broth, if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup lightly toasted pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Prepare the turkey: Place the garlic, the rosemary and thyme, and the salt, peppercorns, and olive oil in a mini food processor and process to a paste. Rub this mixture all over the turkey, including inside the cavities. Cover the turkey loosely with plastic wrap and let stand while you make the stuffing.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Make the stuffing: Place 1 cup of the sherry in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Place the dried fruit and the cherries in a heatproof bowl, pour the hot sherry over them, and let stand for 30 minutes. While the fruit is soaking, cook the sausage in boiling water for 2 minutes, drain, and cut into thick slices.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until barely softened, about 5 minutes. Add the apple and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, 5 minutes. Add the <a id="page_295"/>sausage and cook, stirring, until it is lightly browned, another 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the dried fruit and their soaking liquid, the rosemary and thyme, and the cinnamon stick. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook the stuffing, stirring occasionally, until the sausage is cooked through and the fruit is soft, about 8 minutes, lowering the heat if it seems to be browning too much. If you’d like the stuffing a little moister, add a little chicken stock. Transfer the stuffing to a bowl, stir in the pine nuts, and let cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Right before roasting, loosely stuff the main cavity of the turkey with some of the stuffing. Tie the legs together with kitchen string, or if you prefer, secure the legs together with a skewer. Spoon some stuffing into the neck cavity and tuck the excess skin under the turkey. Place the remaining stuffing in a 1½- to 2-quart baking dish, cover it with aluminum foil, and set aside. Place the turkey breast side up in a large roasting pan and bake for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F, add 1 cup water to the roasting pan, and bake until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the inner thigh (but not so that it touches a bone) registers about 180°F, about 3 hours longer. As the turkey roasts, add 1 cup water to the pan every hour. (The total roasting time will be about 3 hours and 40 minutes.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Transfer the turkey to a cutting board, cover it loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm, and let rest for 35 to 40 minutes. Skim the fat off the pan juices, and set it aside if you want to make gravy.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Moisten the remaining stuffing with about ½cup of the turkey pan juices and bake, covered with aluminum foil, while the turkey rests.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> To make the sauce, add the remaining 1 cup sherry to the roasting pan. Set the pan over medium-high heat on 2 burners and scrape the bottom to dislodge the brown bits. Cook the pan juices until they are reduced by about one fourth, 5 to 7 minutes. (If you’d like to make gravy, add 3 to 4 tablespoons of flour to 3 to 4 tablespoons of skimmed fat and whisk until a paste forms. Whisk the flour mixture 2 tablespoons at a time into the pan juices and cook until the sauce thickens to your liking, 3 to 5 minutes.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">9.</span></strong> Carve the turkey and arrange it on a serving platter. Serve with the reduced pan juices or gravy and the stuffing from the turkey and the baking dish. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ANEC AMB PRUNES I OLIVES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Say Ampurdan to the Catalans, and they’ll start smacking their lips, gleefully recalling the specialties of this inland region north of Barcelona, where the earthy, homey cuisine revolves around rich duck stews, meat and dried fruit combinations, snails, wild mushrooms, and game. This quintessential Ampurdán recipe is from Jaume Vidal, a great chef and hotelier whose small, lovingly decorated inn—La Plaça, in Madremanya—is one of Spain’s great little secrets. The combination of the sweet prunes and briny olives lends the sauce a very special complexity. As with many Catalan dishes, the final layer of flavor comes from the <em>picada,</em> a mixture of garlic, parsley, and nuts. This isn’t exactly a throw-it-in-the-pot-and-forget-it affair, but the resulting dish is truly sensational, well worth a little extra effort.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE DUCK:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large, meaty duck legs (about 4½ pounds total)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large leek, white part only, trimmed and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size carrot, cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size ripe tomatoes, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cups full-bodied dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3½ cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh or dried thyme or rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup halved pitted prunes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup pitted green olives, such as picholine, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PICADA:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tea biscuit, such as a Maria, or 2 Ritz crackers, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped lightly toasted hazelnuts or almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>), plus ¼ cup for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup sweet white wine, such as muscatel, or ¼ cup medium-sweet sherry</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the duck: Trim the excess fat from the duck legs, setting aside about 1 tablespoon fat. Rinse the duck, pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels, and season it with salt and pepper. Heat the 1 tablespoon duck fat over medium-high heat in a heavy casserole large enough to hold the duck legs in a single layer. Working in two batches, cook the legs, skin side down, until richly browned, about 10 minutes per batch. Turn the legs and cook them until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer the duck to paper towels to drain. Carefully spoon off the excess fat before browning the second batch.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Once the second batch of duck is browned, pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from the casserole. Add the leek, onion, and carrot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until richly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Add ¾ cup of the wine, the chicken stock, bay leaf, and thyme and bring to a simmer, skimming any foam off the surface. Return the duck to the casserole, then cover it. Bake the duck until it is very tender, 1¾ to 2 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_297"/><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> While the duck is cooking, place the prunes and the remaining ½ cup wine in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high power for 1½ minutes. Let stand until the prunes soften, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> When the duck legs are done, transfer them, using tongs, to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Spoon off as much fat as possible from the braising liquid. (The dish can be prepared up to a day ahead to this point. Gently reheat it before proceeding.) Strain the braising liquid and the vegetables through a fine sieve, pressing down on the vegetables to extract all the liquid. Then discard the vegetables and return the liquid to the casserole. Add the prunes with their soaking liquid and the olives and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook over low heat, covered, for 15 minutes, skimming any foam off the surface if necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Meanwhile, make the <em>picada</em>: Place the tea biscuit, hazelnuts, 2 tablespoons pine nuts, the garlic, and parsley in a mini food processor and pulse just until the biscuit and nuts are ground. Add the muscatel and pulse to combine. Stir the <em>picada</em> into the sauce and simmer until the flavors blend, about 3 minutes, stirring. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little more stock or some water. Return the duck legs to the casserole, spooning the sauce on top so that they are covered. Cook over low heat until the flavors meld, about 3 minutes. You can serve the duck and sauce directly from the casserole or transfer it to a serving dish. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup pine nuts on top before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">HUNTER’S-STYLE BAKED QUAIL IN ESCABECHE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CODORNIZ ASADA EN ESCABECHE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Slowly baking quail completely covered with an <em>escabeche</em> of olive oil, vinegar, white wine, and herbs produces exceptionally moist birds, deliciously suffused with the tang of the marinade and so tender that the meat easily slips off the bones. Served hot or warm, the quail is delicious over lentils, with some marinade on the side. Cold, it’s wonderful over an astringent frisée salad. This preparation is usually reserved for partridge, the “it” game in Spain, but quail, as well as Cornish hen or small chickens, are also exceptionally tasty made this way.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t worry about the generous amount of olive oil here; the birds are drained before serving. Just don’t use a heavy oil for this dish, as it would drown out other flavors. (For more about <em>escabeche,</em> see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#page_298">page 298</a>.)</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>Chicken stock or broth (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Season the quail generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a large flameproof casserole that can accommodate all of the birds in one layer. Working in two batches, brown the quail on all sides, about 7 minutes. Transfer the quail to a bowl, add the shallots to the casserole, and cook until soft and lightly colored, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Return the quail to the casserole, arranging them breast side down. Add the vinegar, wine, garlic, bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, and peppercorns. If there isn’t enough liquid to completely cover the quail, add enough chicken stock or water to cover. Bring to a simmer, then carefully transfer the casserole to the oven. Bake the quail, uncovered, until they are extremely tender (the legs should wiggle easily in the joints), about 1¼ hours. Remove the casserole from the oven and let cool for about 15 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_299"/><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> To serve, remove the quail from the cooking liquid and wipe off the excess. If serving the quail hot or warm, make a quick sauce by boiling some of the strained cooking liquid over medium-high heat until it reduces by one third, about 10 minutes. Transfer the quail to serving plates and pass the sauce alongside. If serving the quail cold, transfer it and the cooking liquid to a bowl and let cool. The quail will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch09_note5"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Look for quail at Chinese groceries and supermarkets, where they cost a fraction of what you’d pay at a fancy butcher. Try to find birds labeled jumbo or extra-large.</p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The Mediterraneans have a delicious tradition of pickling cooked fish or fowl in a mixture of vinegar and olive oil, typically perfumed with bay leaves, herbs, and plenty of garlic. Known as <em>escabeche</em> in Spain and <em>scapece</em> in Sicily, the technique was introduced to the area by the Arabs (the word is possibly derived from the Persian <em>sikbaj,</em> meaning vinegar stew). In pre-refrigeration days, <em>escabeches</em> constituted a basic but ingenious way of preserving food. The ancient Romans were on to this pickling method as well. To preserve fried fish, Apicius instructs, “the moment they are fried and taken out of the pan, pour hot vinegar over them.” Not only did food conserved in oil and vinegar last almost forever, it was also delectable: The vinegar kept it tender; the oil made it luscious and moist; the long pickling time left it permeated with the flavor of garlic and spices. According to historical sources, as long ago as the fourteenth century, Spain had roving <em>escabeche</em> merchants who packed fish in the marinade in port cities, then transported their wares to the landlocked interior, where fresh fish would never otherwise make it without spoiling. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish cookbooks offer plenty of recipes for <em>escabeches,</em> usually extravagantly spiced with saffron, bay leaves, and cloves and often including honey and orange juice, as well as mashed-up raisins and pounded nuts and bread.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Though the need for preservation is long gone, <em>escabeches</em> continue to captivate Spanish taste buds (this is, after all, a country crazy for conserves). Most popular <em>escabeches</em> involve fish, such as tuna, sardines, or anchovies, but the method is even more delicious with poultry and game, such as quail, rabbit, and especially partridge. You’ll find an <em>escabeche</em> recipe for quail on <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#page_299a">following page</a> and for fish on <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_57">page 57</a>.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CODORNIZ A LAS BRAVAS CON SETAS Y VINAGRETA DE MIEL Y CAFE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This dish was inspired by Josep Maria Boix, a great Michelin-starred chef at the Torre del Remei hotel in the Catalan Pyrenees. Boix’s secret ingredient, coffee, adds an interesting note to the sauce, accenting the earthiness of the mushrooms and the smokiness of the grilled quail. At his restaurant, Boix serves quail legs as a dainty appetizer on top of frisée leaves. My adaptation, featuring halved birds, will serve four as a light main course or eight as an appetizer. If you’re serving it for eight, you’ll need to increase the amount of the frisée and the mushrooms slightly.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE HONEY-COFFEE VINAIGRETTE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons strong brewed coffee</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large shallot, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon coarsely ground coffee beans</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE QUAIL:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon crumbled dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 partially boned quail (about 4 ounces each), cut in half lengthwise through the breast (ask your butcher to do this; see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09_note6">Note</a>), rinsed, and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound mild mushrooms (chanterelles, cèpes, shiitake caps, small cremini), wiped clean with a damp paper towel, larger ones coarsely chopped, small ones left whole</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 cups frisée, rinsed and dried</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the vinaigrette: Place the brewed coffee, vinegar, honey, shallot, and ground coffee in a small <a id="page_300"/>bowl and whisk to mix well. Gradually whisk in the olive oil. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper to taste, then set it aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the quail: Place 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, half of the garlic, the rosemary, thyme, and ½ teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a small bowl and stir to mix. Rub this paste all over the quail and let stand while you prepare the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and the remaining garlic and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are lightly browned and tender, about 6 minutes, adding a little more olive oil if the skillet looks dry. Add about 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette to the mushrooms and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Light the grill and preheat it to medium.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Grill the quail on a well-oiled grate about 5 inches above the glowing coals until the skin is nicely browned and charred in spots and the breast meat is pink, about 3 minutes per side. (The quail can also be broiled or cooked on the stove top in a well-oiled ridged grill pan.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To serve, place the frisée in a large bowl and toss it with just enough of the vinaigrette to coat the leaves lightly, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the frisée among 4 dinner plates, placing it to one side. Spoon some mushrooms on each plate and top them with two quail halves. Serve with the remaining vinaigrette on the side. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>
 <p class="indentt"><a id="ch09_note6"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Many butchers carry partially boned quail with the rib cage removed, but the legs and wing bones still intact. They weigh about 4 ounces (boned weight). If you can’t find them at your local market, they may be mail-ordered from <a class="nounder" href="http://www.dartagnan.com">www.dartagnan.com</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">RABBIT STEW WITH A TOUCH OF CHOCOLATE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CONEJO CON CHOCOLATE RODRIGO MESTRE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Cooking meat, chicken—even crustaceans—in a dark, intense sauce tinged with chocolate is a culinary tradition that never fails to surprise and delight visitors to Catalonia. As with Mexican moles, chocolate contributes complexity and intrigue to the sauce without overpowering it. This exceptional rabbit recipe comes from my friend, Rodrigo Mestre, a legendary Catalan bon vivant and author of sixteen cookbooks. Adding chocolate to savory dishes, Rodri says, became fashionable in Catalonia during the boom in chocolate trade with the Antilles. For the cooking wine, he suggests a good Priorat red, but as that’s not a cheap proposition, feel free to use any full-bodied red with a lively acidity. Adding orange zest is Rodri’s secret touch, of which he is justifiably proud. He suggests following the dish with a salad of curly endive, torn into small pieces and dressed with good olive oil, <a id="page_301"/>lemon juice, and a generous pinch of salt. Spinach with Raisins and Pine Nuts (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_388">page 388</a>) is always a fine accompaniment.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 rabbit (2½ to 3 pounds), cut into 8 pieces, rinsed well and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups full-bodied dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large carrot, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh thyme sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the rabbit</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup brandy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, grated or finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the rabbit generously with salt and pepper, then place it in a glass dish large enough to hold the pieces in a single layer. Add the wine, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cover the dish and refrigerate the rabbit for about 4 hours, turning the pieces occasionally.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, peppercorns, and cinnamon stick in a double layer of cheesecloth and tie it closed. Set the cheesecloth bag aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Remove the rabbit from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Strain the marinade, setting aside the liquid and the vegetables separately. Blot the vegetables dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate and lightly dust the rabbit with it. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a heavy 4- to 5-quart flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Working in two batches, cook the rabbit until nicely browned all over, about 7 minutes per batch, then transfer it to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the casserole over medium-high heat, add the vegetables from the marinade, and cook until softened and lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add the brandy and boil for 30 seconds, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the casserole. Add the reserved liquid from the marinade and the chicken stock and bring to a simmer, skimming any foam off the surface and scraping up any more brown bits. Return the rabbit to the casserole and tuck the cheesecloth bag of herbs under it. If there isn’t enough liquid to just cover the rabbit, add a little water. Cover the casserole and simmer over low heat, skimming off the foam occasionally and turning the rabbit pieces, until the rabbit is tender, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the rabbit to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Increase the heat to high and cook the sauce until it is reduced by one third, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bag. Reduce the heat to low and add the chocolate, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the casserole, until the chocolate melts. Add the orange zest and simmer, stirring, for 1 minute longer. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and/or pepper as necessary. Return the rabbit to the casserole and cook over very low heat until the flavors meld, 5 to 10 minutes. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>
