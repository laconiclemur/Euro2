<p class="noindentt">This book is a tribute to the genius and generosity of Spanish cooks. It couldn’t have been possible without their friendship, support, information, and recipes—not to mention the countless astonishing meals that I’ve enjoyed in Spain over the years. My heartfelt <em>gracias</em> to all the following people, as well as to those whom I may not have mentioned but whose kindness is deeply appreciated nonetheless.</p>

<p class="indent">I first started writing about Spain as a journalist, and I am sincerely grateful to Nancy Novogrod at <em>Travel+Leisure</em> and Dana Cowin at <em>Food&amp;Wine,</em> and to their respective editorial teams, for all the amazing assignments over the years. As always, my agent, Jane Dystel, was unflappable, inexhaustible, and full of savvy and cheer, while her partner, Miriam Goderich, offered invaluable assistance with the proposal. <em>Mil gracias</em> to Pilar Vico for her years of friendship and for nurturing my passion for Spain. Thanks, too, to ICEX, Janet Kafka, and Holly Hansen and Karen MacKenzie for their support. All those recipe-testing marathons would have been utterly pointless without our friends who came to dinner, tasted the food, listened to my stories, and stayed up late drinking <em>orujo</em>. I also thank Melissa Clark for her crumbly treats, and Maricel Presilla for the seventeenth-century chocolate.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the vision and brilliance of Peter Workman, being published by Workman is a writer’s dream. To my editor, Suzanne Rafer, I’m grateful not just for whipping this book into shape, but for launching my entire food writing career more than fifteen years ago. Who knows where I’d be without her? Huge kudos to Lisa Hollander, Paul Hanson, and Lori Malkin for the dashing look of the book, and to Barbara Peragine for making it work; to Barbara Mateer for her unswerving attention to detail; to Katie Workman for her marketing genius; and to Sarah O’Leary and Jen Pare for their tireless publicity efforts. Susan Goldman, together with food stylists Mariann Sauvion-Grady Best and prop stylist Sara Abalan, made the book sparkle with fabulous food photography, and Leora Kahn found just the right scenics. Thanks, too, to Fred Rose of the Chelsea Ceramic Guild.</p>
<p class="indent">My mother, Larisa Frumkin, has taught me that food is a pleasure meant to be shared with others, even if my dinner parties are still nothing compared to hers. Her love is what calls me back home from Spain. My final <em>gracias</em> are to Barry Yourgrau, who shared in every stage of this project, from savoring the alchemical cooking of Ferran Adrià to washing the dishes after long, happy nights recipe-testing at our table.</p>
