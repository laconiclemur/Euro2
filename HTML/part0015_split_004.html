  <h3 class="h3a">Preserved porcini mushrooms</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Porcino, cep or penny bun – the king of the forest during the autumn mushroom season. The succulent, delicate taste of this highly prized fungi is hard to beat and always a winner with hunters and restaurateurs. I love to search for them in the forests and when I spot the first one, I’m like a child, excited and eager to find more. If I find lots, I usually enjoy a plateful sautéed or with some pasta, but the rest I preserve so that I can enjoy them later in the year and give them away as presents to friends. Preserved porcini are delicious served as part of an antipasto of cured meats, alongside other preserved vegetables.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 1kg/2lb 4oz</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz fresh porcini mushrooms</p>

  <p class="ing1">300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 sprig of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 cloves</p>

  <p class="ing2">1–3 red chillies (optional) about 500ml/18fl oz/2¼ cups olive oil</p>

  <p class="para">Carefully clean the porcini, removing any earth and impurities with a small knife or brush, then go over them with a slightly damp cloth – don’t wash the mushrooms or they will lose their lovely flavour. Trim the stems slightly; leave the smaller mushrooms whole and slice the larger ones.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the vinegar and 700ml/1¼ pints/2¾ cups water in a large pan together with the salt, peppercorns and bay leaves and bring to the boil. Add the porcini and boil for 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and leave to drain on a clean tea towel, cover with another clean tea towel and leave to dry out overnight.</p>

  <p class="para"><a href="part0015_split_002.html#pg172a" class="calibre1">Sterilize jars</a> with a total volume of 1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups.</p>

  <p class="para1">Put the mushrooms into the sterilized jars together with the thyme, cloves and a chilli (if using) and cover completely with olive oil. Secure with a lid and <a href="part0015_split_002.html#pg172b" class="calibre1">pasteurize</a> for 30 minutes. Label and store in a cool, dark, dry place for at least 1 month before using. Once opened, store in the fridge.</p>
