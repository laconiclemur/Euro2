<p class="h1"><a id="ch12"/><span class="blue">Vegetables</span></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Cucumber (Agurk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">European cucumbers, sometimes called English cucumbers, are about twice as long in length as the American variety. They are smaller in circumference, have less seeds, and are crisper. The Norwegians call them <i>slangeagurk</i>, or snake cucumber. They should have a fairly smooth surface and be as straight as possible. Use a Norwegian cheese slicer to get paper thin slices.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg75_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Onion (Løk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">It is difficult to imagine a delicious meal without onions in one form or another. In Norway the most widely used onions are <i>kepaløk</i> (yellow or red onions), <i>purre</i> (leek), and <i>gressløk</i> (chives). Onions keep well the year around and are a culinary additive with some rank, but too many use them only as such. Onions are versatile, add flavor to soups, sauces, casseroles, salads, meat, and fish, and are delicious served separately as a vegetable. Boiled, onions acquire a rather sweet taste and are easier digested than when fried. Onions should be kept in an airy and dry place.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Hasselback Onions (Hasselback-løk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Plan about 1 medium onion per person. Peel and slice onion thinly, being careful not to slice all the way through. Place in a baking dish, cut side up. Brush with a little melted butter. Sprinkle with salt and paprika, and some shredded cheese. Bake at 390°F (200°C) about 30 minutes. Serve with meat or chicken and a green salad.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Baked Onions for Roast (Bakt løk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">No more tears if you add whole un-peeled onions to boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and peel, and add to roast in the oven. They are delicious!</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Tips on Frying Onions  (Steketips for løk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">The warmer the fat is, the crisper the onions will be. If you mix a little oil with the butter, or use straight oil, you can use a higher temperature and your onions will be crisper. If you desire soft onions, add 1–2 tablespoons of water when the onions have reached the light golden state. Simmer covered a few more minutes, and soft onions are guaranteed.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">French Fried Onion Rings  (Frityrkokte løkringer)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Peel and slice onions thinly. Divide into rings and place in a bowl. Pour milk over to cover and let stand for 30 minutes. Beat an egg and dip the onion rings in the egg,  <a id="page_76"/>then in  flour, and fry until golden brown in hot shortening. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Onions with Cheese Sauce  (Løk med ostesaus)</span></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">6 onions, medium</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 tbsp. butter</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. paprika</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. curry</p>
<p class="noindent6">1	1/8 cups (2 3/4 dl) coffee cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 tbsp. bread crumbs</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) cheese, Jarlsberg or Gouda</p>
<p class="noindent2">Boil onions until tender. Place in a baking dish. Make white sauce using butter,  flour, and cream. Add grated cheese, salt, paprika, and curry and pour over the onions. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">The Glorious Leek (Den herlige purren)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">The leek has been cultivated along the Mediterranean for five thousand years. In Norway it was cultivated as early as 1694. Norwegians use them in every conceivable way. It is a vegetable rich in iron and <small>C</small> vitamins. It adds a savory taste to numerous cooked dishes and soups, and great zest to salads. It keeps best in humid and dark places and freezes well. Cut in chunks and parboil or slice thin and freeze.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Boiled Leeks (Kokt purre)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Select large leeks. Cut off tops. Leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of the green part. (The green part may be frozen, cut up or whole, and used later as an excellent addition to vegetable or meat soups.) Slice the leek lengthwise and wash well. Tie together with cotton string. Place in a small amount of boiling, lightly-salted water and cook until tender, about 15–20 minutes. Serve with butter, margarine, or your favorite sauce.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Rutabagas (Kålrot)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>This unpretentious, tasty vegetable supplies vitamin a (carotene), minerals, and 45 milligrams of vitamin C in 3.5 ounces (100 g.), about our minimum daily requirement. It tastes good raw, in salads, or with other vegetable snacks, cooked, or fried in slice, and keeps well. It has earned the name “orange of the North.”</i></p>
<p class="noindent2">The summer of my ninth year, my sister Eva and I weeded our neighbor farmer’s rutabagas fields. We joined nine other young people, all older than I, at Mellom-Granerud farm on Nesodden. We rode in a rickety hay wagon pulled by a large stocky horse. The vegetable fields seemed to stretch endlessly. We started to work at 9 a.m. and worked with great enthusiasm until the lunch bell rang. It was wartime in Norway and food was scarce. However, this lunch was a feast, with meat, boiled potatoes, gravy, and mashed rutabagas with nutmeg. I have loved rutabagas since that day. When I worked in the rutabagas fields I knew nothing of their value. Most of the rutabagas were cattle and horse feed. Lucky animals!</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg76_01.png"/> </p>
<p class="indent">Many people shun this lowly vegetable, not knowing how to prepare it; however it can be prepared any number of ways to complement numerous recipes. Remember to wash the rutabagas thoroughly, slice in thickness desired, and peel.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Mashed Rutabagas (Kålrotstappe)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Mashed rutabagas are the traditional accompaniment to <i>pinnekjott</i>, (cured ribs of lamb). Use milk, cream, broth, or a combination in your rutabagas. Using milk or cream or adding potatoes or a carrot gives it a milder flavor.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg76_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2–3 lbs. (900–1,350 g.) rutabagas</p>
<p class="noindent6">Pinnekjøtt broth (optional)</p>
<p class="noindent6">Water to cover</p>
<p class="noindent6">Salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 potatoes, medium, cooked</p>
<p class="noindent6">White pepper</p>
<p class="noindent6">Table cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">Nutmeg, freshly ground (optional)</p>
<p class="noindent2">Wash rutabagas thoroughly, slice in ½-inch (1	¼-cm) thickness, and peel. Place in lightly-<a id="page_77"/>salted boiling water to cover and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and mash together with the warm potatoes. Add salt, pepper, and nutmeg if desired. Add a little cream and broth. Serve decorated with parsley.</p>
<p class="indent">For a delicious flavor, when you are cooking<i> pinnekjøtt</i>, place peeled and sliced rutabagas on top of the meat. When the meat is cooked the rutabagas are tender. Steaming rutabagas on top of the ribs give them an indescribable flavor. When cooked, proceed as above.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Cotter’s Kettle (Husmannsgryte)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">If you are concerned about preparing a nutritious meal and there is no time to cook, try this recipe. It is bursting with nutritious, colorful vegetables.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 beef bouillon cube</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ½ cups (3 ½ dl) rutabagas, cubed</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) boiling water</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ lb. (340 g.) medisterpølse or bratwurst</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 large carrots, sliced</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 medium parsnips, diced</p>
<p class="noindent6">Dash of dry mustard</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 large leek, sliced, including the green</p>
<p class="noindent6">Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p class="noindent2">Dissolve bouillon in boiling water. Add all the vegetables and let simmer 15–20 minutes or until vegetables are barely done. Remove skin from sausage, cut in thick slices, and add to vegetables. Add mustard, salt, and pepper, and let it simmer, covered, for a few more minutes. Do not overcook. Serve with mustard, potatoes, and dark bread.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Cauliflower (Blomkål)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Buy firm heads that are white and spotless. Sometimes they will be a pale yellow but the leaves should always have a fresh green color.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Use the whole head, even the leaves if desired. For salad grate the center stem, or dice it. It is best to steam the cauliflower. If it is cooked in water, do not overcook; 10–15 minutes will do for an average size head and 5–10 minutes for florets. When cooking a  whole head it cooks quicker if you cut a crisscross deeply into the bottom of the stem. When cooked cauliflower is to be used in salads it will keep its delicate color if it is dipped in cold water immediately after cooking. Place leftover florets in the pickle jar and use as pickles.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cauliflower may be added to soups, purées, salads, and soufflès. It will keep for several days in the refrigerator if kept in a plastic bag.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Celeriac (Sellerirot)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Celeriac, a white round tuber with firm flesh, adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. It is hard to find in America but the produce manager of your market can order them when in season.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg77_01.png"/> </p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Parsley Root (Persillerot)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Smooth leaved wild parsley originated in a small area around the Mediterranean. The first recording of curly parsley comes from the late sixteenth century. In Scandinavia the smooth-leaf, turnip-rooted parsley is popular for soups and casseroles; it has a large, white fleshy root. The produce department of your market can help you get it.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Creamed Green Peas <br/>(Grønn ertestuing)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">It is amazing how inexpensive traditional food can be. I remember these creamed peas served with mamma’s delectable meatballs (they taste good with any meat), or when we ate <i>lutefisk</i>. The dried peas cost only pennies a pound. If unavailable at your food market, check out your Scandinavian delicatessen or natural food stores.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) dried green peas</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 qt. (liter) water</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tsp. salt or more</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 tbsp. butter</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent2">Rinse the peas well and pick out any foreign objects. Place in water to soak overnight in a cool place. <a id="page_78"/>Let them simmer in the water they were soaked in, approxemately 1 ½–2 hours. Mix the  flour with the butter and add to the peas and let simmer about10 minutes longer. Add salt and sugar to taste. If you wish you may add a peeled or diced carrot to the peas during the last half hour of cooking. No sugar is needed if you add a carrot.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sweet/Sour Cabbage (Surkål)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">A traditional vegetable that tastes delicious with meatballs and all pork dishes. It can be made with green or red cabbage. Red cabbage makes it a more colorful dish.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 head red cabbage, about 1 ½ lbs. (¾ kg.)</p>
<p class="noindent6">1–2 tbsp. caraway seeds</p>
<p class="noindent6">1/3 cup (75 g.) pork fat or butter</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) currant juice or vinegar</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 apple, chopped</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. sugar if vinegar is used</p>
<p class="noindent2">Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage and rinse the cabbage in cold water. Divide in fourths and remove core. Lay flat side down on cutting board and slice thinly. Add the fat to a heavy saucepan. Peel and chop the apple. Layer cabbage and apple in the saucepan. Pour currant juice over the cabbage, or add sugar to vinegar, if used, and pour it over the cabbage. Place saucepan on the burner. Cook over low heat until very tender. It is best to let it simmer, for about 1–1 ½ hours or until done. If you keep the heat on low there is no need to stir, but watch from time to time so it does not burn. If necessary add a small amount of water.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4–5</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Let’s Talk Potatoes (Potetsnakk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Norway, in years past, was thought of as a fish, meat, potato, and porridge country. When planning dinner, the first thing a homemaker thought of was potatoes. Most often cooked until wonderfully mealy. (There is a special trick to that, see recipe that follows.)</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg78_01.png"/></p>
<p class="indent">However, Norwegians did not just cook potatoes enough for one meal but would cook enough to be used with breakfast or for <i>Pytt i Panne, lumper</i>, or <i>lefser</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">We know potatoes are one of our most nourishing foods and are not fattening. The culprits are what we put on them: gravy, butter, sour cream, melted cheese, and bacon bits, or the hot fat we fry them in.</p>
<p class="indent">Potatoes are one of the most inexpensive nutritional foods, nearly fat free (0.1 percent fat). They have starch that helps fill you up and gives energy, fiber to help with digestion, and minerals, particularly iron—so important for blood, and vitamins B and C to help strengthen the body.</p>
<p class="indent">In ages past, grain was the staple food in Nor-way, and the Norwegians, like many other Europeans, were reluctant to accept potatoes when introduced. South America had cultivated the potato for thousands of years before it came to Europe. In the 1700s food was scarce in Norway, but following hundreds of years of raising grain it was difficult to convince people of the benefit of the potato, until a minister, P. H. Hertzberg, took up the cause of the potato in his sermons. In fact, he wrote a book about the cultivation of the potatoes, a best seller and sold out of three printings. Before long the knowledge of the benefit of potatoes, as they understood them in those days, spread across Norway, and today, it remains Norway’s most important vegetable.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Boiled/Steamed Potatoes <br/>(kokte melne poteter)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Bring water to a boil and add even-sized potatoes. Add just enough water to cover. If the potatoes are un-peeled you do not need salt in the water. (Obviously cooking the potatoes with the peel on saves nutrition.) Quickly bring thinly peeled potatoes to a boil and cook until easily penetrated by the tip of a sharp knife, about 20–30 minutes. Let simmer and do not overcook or  <a id="page_79"/>they will become soggy and fall apart easily. Drain immediately. Return to low burner, shake pan gently to prevent sticking, and continue steaming until the pan is completely dry. This produces a dry, mealy potato. Cover with cloth, not a lid, until ready to serve. Note: The potatoes will not stay mealy if cooled and reheated.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg78_02.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Hasselback (Roasted) Potatoes <br/>(Hasselbackpoteter)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">This easy way to prepare potatoes is becoming increasingly popular in Norway. And it is simply delicious. Once I watched a Norwegian chef place a peeled potato in the hollow of a large wooden spoon and begin to slice it in 1/8 -inch (¼-cm) slices till about ½-inch (1 ¼-cm) from the end. (The spoon prevented the knife from slicing all the way through the potato.) So easy! </p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">4 oval baking potatoes, medium</p>
<p class="noindent6">Jarlsberg cheese, grated</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. butter</p>
<p class="noindent6">Paprika</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. butter melted</p>
<p class="noindent2">Preheat the oven to 425°F (215°C). As you peel the potatoes drop them into cold water to prevent discoloring. Slice as explained above. Butter an oven-proof dish. Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a paper towel. Place the potatoes side-byside, cut side up, in the dish brushed with butter. Brush the potatoes with melted butter and sprinkle with salt. If needed brush again with melted butter after 30 minutes. About 5 minutes before they are baked, sprinkle with grated cheese and paprika. Total baking time is 50 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg79_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Raw Potato Dumplings <br/>(Klubb, kumle, kumpe)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">This dish is well known all over Norway, and its name and recipes vary from district to district. The foundation of these dumplings is potatoes with variations achieved by adding different ingredients. In eastern Norway <i>klubben</i> is made from barley and pea  flour and eaten with <i>myssmørdupp</i> (a sauce of soft cheese made from whey) On the southern coast these dumplings are called <i>kumpe</i>, and further north they are known as <i>ball. Ball</i> is often served with fish. Generally this type of dumpling is large—about the size of a medium size apple. These old, traditional dumplings have numerous stalwart fans.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Potato Dumplings from Agder  (Kumpe fra Agder)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Grate potatoes, drain most of the liquid, and add enough barley  flour or other  flour until the dough is firm. Add a little salt. Form into round or oblong shapes with your hands, enclosing a piece of bacon or suet in the center of each dumpling. Simmer dumplings in lightly salted water ½–¾ hours, depending on size. Cold dumplings may be sliced and fried in bacon drippings.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Potato Dumplings with Bacon, North <br/>Norway (Klubb og fett, Nord Norge)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Grate raw potatoes and blend with barley  flour until a proper consistency. Some ground, boiled potatoes and a little salt may be added. Form round or oblong dumplings with your hand. Bring salted water to a boil, add dumplings, and simmer until done. Serve with boiled rutabagas and fried bacon. Some people enjoy these dumplings served with syrup.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Potato Dumplings from Ryfylke  (Klimpor fra Ryfylke)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">These dumplings are smaller and were used in meat soups at banquets and weddings. Follow directions for previously described dumplings but use white  flour, boiled potatoes, a little salt, sugar, and cinnamon. The addition of an egg is optional. <i>Klimpor</i> may also be cooked in milk.</p>
