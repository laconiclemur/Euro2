 BEEF WELLINGTON WITH FENNEL &amp; MINT SALAD</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_lavd" id="nad0000610">
<em>For me, something like beef Wellington always seemed like such a far-fetched idea when I watched my favourite celebrity chefs make it on television. Even once I’d decided to have a go, and ventured out to buy a fillet of beef, it sat in my fridge until it had to be either cooked or thrown away. So I pushed myself and here I am, and I can reassure you that it is not as scary as it sounds or looks on the telly. A few simple steps is all it takes, and I promise I won’t make you do the pastry from scratch either. So you can have time to breathe and pat yourself on the back. It’s served with a very simple fennel salad which complements it nicely.</em>

<span class="lavd">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000636">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Place the beef in a roasting dish, brush with olive oil all over and season. Roast in the oven for 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000637">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile put the butter, garlic and onion into a medium pan and cook for 10 minutes. Then add the salt, mushrooms, fenugreek and water and cook for another 15 minutes, until all the liquid has evaporated.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000638">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Add the mustard to the mushroom mixture and set aside on a plate in the fridge to chill.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000639">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Take the beef fillet out of the oven and place in a dish. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until completely cold.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000640">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Divide the block of pastry into two pieces, one about 200g and the other 300g. Roll out the smaller block into an 18 x 30cm rectangle. Roll out the other block into a 28 x 36cm rectangle.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000641">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Note that beef fillets do vary in size, so the key is to have the base piece of pastry large enough to sit the fillet on with a gap of at least 2.5cm around the edges. The top piece then needs to be larger, as it has to cover the top and sides of the fillet but still with 2.5cm excess around the edges. Bear this in mind when rolling out the pastry and adjust to suit your meat if necessary.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000642">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Put the pastry in the fridge while you prepare everything else.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000643">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 On a large piece of cling film, line up the rashers side by side, leaving no gaps. Spread the cold mushroom mix all over the rashers in an even layer.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000644">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Put the beef fillet in the centre, across the layer of rashers. Using the cling film, wrap the rashers and mushroom mix around the beef fillet, encasing it completely and using the rashers to keep it all secure.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000646">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 Roll tightly into a sausage shape, using the cling film, and make sure to secure the ends by twisting. Place in the fridge for at least an hour, for the shape to firm up.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000647">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>12.</strong>
</span>
 Place the smaller rectangle of pastry on a baking tray. Unroll the beef fillet from the cling film and place on top of the pastry.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000648">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>13.</strong>
</span>
 Lightly whisk the egg yolk and milk together and brush the edges of the pastry with it. Then place the larger piece of pastry on top and tease it around the fillet, starting from the top, making sure to remove any air.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000649">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>14.</strong>
</span>
 Seal the edges by pressing down firmly with the back of a fork. At this point, neaten the edges by cutting, if you need to. Using the back of a knife, score the top of the pastry without cutting right through. Brush the pastry all over with the egg mixture, then sprinkle with salt and place in the fridge for 3 hours (or overnight, if you’re making it in advance).</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000650">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>15.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6 and put a baking tray in to heat up. Once the tray is hot, take it out of the oven and place the fillet on the hot tray, on a sheet of baking paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000651">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>16.</strong>
</span>
 Bake for 25 minutes for medium rare or 30 minutes for medium. Leave to stand for 15 minutes before slicing.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000652">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>17.</strong>
</span>
 To make the salad, prepare the fennel by removing the hard tops. Slice thinly using a knife or a mandolin. Squeeze the lemon juice over the sliced fennel and put into a bowl.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000653">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>18.</strong>
</span>
 Add the onion, salt and mint to the salad and, using your hands, squeeze the mixture to release some of the juices. Add the olive oil and mix through, then add the rocket leaves and mix with your hands.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000654">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>19.</strong>
</span>
 Cut the Wellington into thick slices and serve with the salad.</p>
