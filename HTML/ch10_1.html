<p class="image"><a id="page_184"/><a id="page_185"/><img alt="image" src="../images/10fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The question was as inevitable as the darkness of winter. November had just laid her cold damp hands on us, and the merchants had already begun to set up their kitschy Christmas decorations. And, just as sure as there would be six weeks of pre-Christmas parties, shopping, and preparations, there would also be the ever-returning question: “So, what are you having for Christmas?” meaning, “What are you and your family eating for Christmas Eve supper?” I have always tried to dodge the subject, for I know I cannot answer to the satisfaction of the questioner.</p>
<p class="indent">In Norway, Christmas dinner is the most important meal of the year. It is the one time when otherwise modern people return to their roots, to what they perceive as an unchangeable tradition. This one time of year, they lay aside their balsamic vinegar, Thai curry, prefabricated pizzas, and whatever else they eat the rest of the year and cook what they grew up with, the way Mother made it. If done any other way, it would not be Christmas.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_188"/>The Christmas food traditions are not uniform—there are at least six recognized Norwegian Christmas supper variations. In northern and southern Norway, cod with its liver and roe is common. To the west, <em>pinnekjøtt</em>—dried, salted, and smoked lamb ribs steamed and served with mashed rutabaga—holds its firm grip on tradition. A little farther north, in the stockfish-exporting cities of Kristiansund and Ålesund, the Portuguese-inspired <em>bacalao</em>—salted and dried cod, reconstituted and cooked with tomatoes, chiles, and pimientos—reigns. And for those traveling the wilder shores of cooking, <em>rakfisk</em>—fermented trout—and <em>lutefisk</em>—dried cod reconstituted in lye, not as dangerous as it sounds but not exactly delectable, either—are powerful reminders of a time when unhinged creativity was the only way to ensure survival through hard times. The most popular and geographically neutral dish, however, is <em>ribbe</em>—rib roast of pork with a crisp crackling.</p>
<p class="indent">People are attached to their Christmas tradition in much the same way they are attached to an old relative they see only once a year—he may not be kind or interesting, but he is family, after all, and that is what matters most. I have met people who hate <em>lutefisk</em> or <em>ribbe</em> and would never think of eating it at any other time of year but who would rather starve than go without it on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="indent">The question about what you are eating for Christmas supper is of enormous importance. The answer says something about where you are from and what kind of Norwegian-ness you identify with. My answer, although amiable from a purely gastronomical point of view, is hardly ever accepted: “I eat different things each year,” I tell people, and I am almost always met with stunned silence, followed by an endless inquisition: How is it possible? does it not feel meaningless? and, most of all, how did it come to be that way? To some it sounds like a liberating lack of traditions, to others like pure nihilism, a mockery, rather like pouring solvent into the glue of shared nationhood.</p>
<p class="indent">There are good reasons why it has come to be this way: My parents divorced when I was a young child, and I spent most Christmases with my mother. Because we were only two, we often spent Christmas Eve with friends and relatives, so we ate whatever they ate. Sometimes the food was good, occasionally it was catastrophic, but most of the time it was plain but enjoyable. And it was hardly ever the same two years in a row. As I grew older and my mother and I started to have Christmas by ourselves, we did not have a fixed tradition to build upon, so we continued our drift, this time not out of necessity, but out of curiosity and hunger and what had unintentionally become our very own tradition. Over the years, my Christmas table has seen both unusual exotic dishes and conventional Christmas fare, but the times I have been most happy have been when I have been able to take something well used and traditional and make it into something that tastes fresh and new.</p>
<p class="indent">After all the questions are answered, my tradition, or lack thereof, is generally accepted with overbearing amusement. Sometimes it is even found to have its advantages, especially when negotiating a joint Christmas Eve celebration. And when discussing how to get the perfect crackling on the <em>ribbe,</em> I can announce that, in order to ensure a sufficient variation, I have tried more than a few different ways to get the crackling more crackling and the meat more juicy, and I can assure them that the traditional way to cook the roast—by covering it with foil and letting it steam before broiling it until crackling—is indeed the best. And when that is done, I will provoke either anger or interest when mentioning that the roast will taste even better, juicier, and more Christmasy if spiked with cloves, and somewhat lighter if marinated in orange juice.</p>
<p class="indent">Cooking different foods every year allows me to investigate different Christmas foods, to combine traditional food with innovation, and, of course, to make Christmas the way my mother did when I was growing up.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_190"/>Pork Rib Roast with Cloves</h3>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/10fig03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 6</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 4-pound pork rib roast, with rind and fat, bones cut at 3-inch intervals (have the butcher do this)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 oranges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>A handful of whole cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds russet potatoes, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound onions, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the meat skin side up on a cutting board. With a sharp heavy knife, cut through the rind and fat to make a crosshatch pattern with 1-inch squares. With a thin sharp knife, make a small slit in each square. (This is where you will insert the cloves; you could insert them now, but I have found that all the handling is likely to break off most of the nice-looking tops of the cloves.) Rub the meat with the salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the meat in a baking dish. Cut 1 orange in half and squeeze the juice over the meat. Slice another orange and place the slices under and over the meat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days, turning three or four times.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Discard the orange and place the meat fat side down in a roasting pan. Insert the sage between the cut ribs. Turn the meat skin side up. Cut the remaining orange in half and squeeze the juice over the meat. Cut the orange halves into smaller pieces and place them under the meat. Insert a clove in each of the slits in the fat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cover the roast with foil. Place the roasting pan in the middle of the oven and roast for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 350°F. Remove the foil. Remove the meat from the pan and add potatoes and onions to the pan, making a foundation for the meat. Return the meat <a id="page_191"/>to the pan and place in the oven, this time setting it in the lower third of the oven; roast for about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Move the pan to the middle of the oven. Increase the heat to 400° to 425°F and roast for about 20 minutes longer under frequent surveillance to produce a good crackling. If you have a top oven broiler, you could use it, but be very careful that you don’t burn the roast. It is difficult to give the exact time for the crackling process, since that depends on the intensity of heat in your oven. If there is no sign of crackling after 10 minutes, gradually turn the heat up to 450°F. The crackling will be superb if it looks as if the rind is boiling and the fatty squares have started to separate. Remove and allow to cool slightly.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cut the meat into 2-rib sections and place on serving plates. The meat looks nice served with the cloves, but be advised that they should be removed before eating, as they are still quite strong-tasting.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent"><em>Ribbe,</em> as the traditional Christmas supper is called in Norwegian, has a special position in Norway, something almost as sacred as the Thanksgiving turkey in America. Almost everyone I know eats pork rib roast, and for them a Christmas without it would be unthinkable.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The measure of success is how well the crackling turns out. There is a fine balance between getting the fat hot enough for it to start crackling, but not so hot that it burns. I have found that a convection oven is the best for this purpose (a normal oven is also fine, but it is not so easy to get an even result). If you cannot find a pork rib roast with fat and rind, you will miss out on the crackling, but the dish is still very good.</p>
<p class="noindentt">I always cook onions and potatoes in the roasting pan. A more traditional way would be to serve Mashed Rutabaga (<a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_198">page 198</a>). Some strong mustard is also good with the fatty meat. The roast ideally should be salted and marinated in orange juice for 1 to 2 days before cooking, to make the meat more tender and flavorful.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><small><strong>YOU COULD ALSO MAKE THE SAME DISH WITH DUCK BREAST.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Two 16- to 20-ounce boneless goose breasts, skin on (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#ch10_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped shallots</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup Goose or Duck Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch01.html#page_18">page 18</a>) or chicken stock</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup ruby port</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon coriander seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 sweet apples, such as Golden Delicious, peeled (optional), cored, and cut into 1-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ pound (about 1 cup) prunes, pitted and halved</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">With a sharp knife, make a crisscross pattern in the fatty skin of the goose breasts. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron or other heavy skillet over high heat. Add the goose breasts skin side down, reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the skin is crispy. Flip and cook for 2 minutes on the other side. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the goose breasts skin side up in a baking dish. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the balsamic vinegar, scatter half the minced garlic and 1 tablespoon of the sage over them. and season with salt. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the center of the meat reaches 145°F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest, uncovered, for at least 15 minutes. Set the baking dish aside.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat 2 teaspoons of the butter over medium heat. Sauté the shallots and the remaining garlic for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the stock, 6 tablespoons of the port, 1 tablespoon of the balsamic vinegar, 1 tablespoon of the sage, the bay leaves, peppercorns, and coriander seeds. If there are any cooking juices from the goose left in the baking dish, add them to the pan. Reduce over medium heat until about ¼ cup is left. Strain the sauce and return it to the pan. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_193"/>In a small nonstick skillet, heat the sugar over medium heat until it melts and becomes a light brown caramel. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons port. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until you have a thick syrup, then add the apples and prunes and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sage and salt to taste.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, just before serving, return the port reduction a boil and stir in the rest of the butter; do not let boil.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Slice the goose breasts. Place on four individual plates, along with the apples and prunes. Pour the port reduction over the goose and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="ch10_note1"/><strong><small>NOTE:</small></strong> If the goose breasts are skinned, cook them in 3 tablespoons goose fat or butter.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">The most touching story by the Danish fairy-tale writer Hans Christian Andersen is, no doubt, the story of the Little Match Stick Girl, about a poor girl who freezes to death in the cold on Christmas Eve. The last thing she does is warm herself on her unsold matches while smelling the goose cooking in a nearby house.</p>
<p class="noindentt">With the danger of being somewhat inappropriate, this is the traditional Danish way of serving goose—almost exactly the same dish as the one the Little Match Stick Girl never got to taste. I have modernized it a bit, mainly by adding a few drops of balsamic vinegar.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><small><strong>I MAKE MY MEATBALLS SPICIER THAN MOST TRADITIONAL VERSIONS. THE MEATBALLS CAN BE MADE 1 DAY IN ADVANCE AND REHEATED JUST BEFORE SERVING.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ pounds finely ground pork (about 30 percent fat)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup potato starch or all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground ginger</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 prunes, pitted and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 sweet apple, such as Golden Delicious, peeled, cored, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons chopped caraway seeds, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 teaspoons curry powder</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Beet Salad (<a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#ch10_rec1">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Combine the ground pork, potato starch, nutmeg, ginger, salt, and milk in a large bowl and mix well with your hands until you have a smooth, thick, sticky mixture.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a small saucepan, combine the prunes, apple, caraway seeds, curry powder, and ½ cup water. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Reduce the heat to low and boil gently until all the water has evaporated and you have a thick paste. Remove from the heat and let cool off for a few minutes, until nicely warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Divide the pork mixture into 20 more or less equal pieces. Flatten one piece at a time with the back of a spoon until it is approximately 2 inches in diameter. Place 1 teaspoon of the prune mixture in the middle of the pork mixture and fold the pork mixture up around it to make a round ball.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add only as many meatballs as will fit in the skillet without crowding it and cook, turning frequently, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through. Add more butter if needed.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the meatballs to a serving platter or bowl and cook the remaining meatballs. Serve with the Beet Salad.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">I prefer to serve the meatballs on their own, rather than with other meats, accompanied by Caramelized Potatoes (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_76">page 76</a>) and a green salad or Savoy Cabbage with Dill Butter and Bacon (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_237">page 237</a>) without the bacon.</p>

<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/10fig05.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">According to the Norwegian anthropologist Runar Døving, rutabaga is what all Norwegians are thinking of but do not dare to talk about. This somewhat puzzling assertion is made on the basis of some astounding statistics and Døving’s fieldwork and personal experiences.</p>
<p class="indent">But if we love the rutabaga, why don’t we talk about it? In his influential essay <em>“Brassica Napus”</em> (the Latin name for rutabaga), Døving found that people have a strong urge to talk about it, to discuss recipes, cooking times, preferences (waxed or unwaxed), and its somewhat unfortunate looks, but there is no tradition of talking about it. You can discuss the way you like your meat cooked or the fine nuances of cooking the traditional Christmas rib roast. But the rutabaga’s lack of prestige prevents us from talking about it, making it “what everybody is thinking about but no one knows how to talk about.”</p>
<p class="indent">While they barely utter the word, Norwegians insist on a different kind of rutabaga than the other remaining rutabaga nation, Sweden. The Norwegian rutabaga has orange-yellow flesh, while the Swedish rutabaga is white. In each country, the other sort would be categorized as an inferior item.</p>
<p class="indent">Luckily, there are some signs that the rutabaga is coming back to a position of prominence, perhaps even greater than before. After all, it has, against all odds, managed to keep its position both on the weekday dinner table and at many traditional feasts. At the same time, a few innovative chefs are pulling the modest vegetable out from the dark, dressing it up like a king, and serving it in ways one would never have thought possible—with truffles, infused with vanilla, or as part of a luxurious potato gratin. And who knows, one day we might be able to start talking about it, too.</p>

<p class="noindentt">With your hands, squeeze out as much of the remaining buttermilk as you can before the heat of your hands starts melting the butter. Place the butter in a large bowl of cold water and continue squeezing gently for 2 minutes, until the water is white. Transfer to a small bowl and add salt to taste. Cover and refrigerate. Remove from the refrigerator 20 minutes before serving.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">The most appreciated butter is called Kvitseid butter and is made from the milk of cows grazing on summer mountain pastures. It contains more salt and is made from slightly soured cream, giving it an almost cheeselike complexity.</p>
<p class="noindentt">It is not often I take the time to make my own butter, but when I do, often at Christmas, the difference between it and commercial butter is remarkable. I make my own butter from sour cream, and the result is very similar to the traditional Kvitseid butter. (The slightly sour buttermilk that is left is excellent in bread dough or Christmas morning pancake batter.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">The butter will keep for 1 week, refrigerated; it can be frozen for up to 2 months.</p>
