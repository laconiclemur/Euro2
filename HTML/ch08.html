            <p>Rinse the duck breasts and pat dry with paper towels. With fat side lying up, cut
                through the fat in gashes about 1 inch apart. Season breasts with the rosemary and
                salt, making sure some rosemary gets into the cuts. Fry duck breasts in a nonstick,
                heavy-bottomed pan for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until meat is browned and
                fat is starting to get crispy. Remove from heat and cool until duck can be handled.
                Slice the breast into 1/2-inch-thick slices. They should still be quite raw in the
                middle. </p>
            <p>In the duck fat left in the pan, fry the onion and garlic until caramelized. Add duck
                breast and olives and cook until meat is cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat
                and lay the duck out on a platter. Top with Blood Orange Vinaigrette and olives.</p>
