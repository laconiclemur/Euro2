<p class="summary1"><span class="bi">When I arrived in Madrid airport for one of my research trips for the book,</span> Alicia had a vegetable feast waiting for me. Alicia is a friend of many years. She was my mentor in Spain as I worked on the book, arranging invaluable contacts, taking me to visit people, answering endless questions, and sending me recipes and articles. I stayed with her in Madrid, where I used her extensive library of culinary books. You will find her name throughout the book.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p272.png" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="summary">Alicia is tall and thin and dresses toreador-style, her clothing fashioned of the exotic silks and colorful cottons she has collected on her travels. She adopted a Vidal Sassoon haircut when she came to London after college in the sixties to improve her English. During her stay, to earn extra money, she cooked at Cranks and other vegetarian restaurants. Alicia taught philosophy and psychology before opening her own restaurant. She is a food historian and an olive oil specialist and is known internationally as a food artist who creates collective performances. I met her at the Oxford Symposium of Food in 1985. The theme was “Food Ways, Science, and Lore.” Harold McGee was there. Alicia made a Galician <span class="italic">quemada,</span> recited a spell, and I helped to light it.</p>
<p class="summary">Alone or with Ali&amp;Cia, the EAT Art group she founded with her architect niece Barbara Ortiz, she has created edible hats, edible greenhouses, edible libraries, and, most spectacularly, edible cities and islands in different parts of the world. For the edible cities, they invite the local communities to think of ways to construct a section of their city using their own traditional foods. With columns of spring rolls, palaces built of Indian sweets, parks of green rice, and skyscrapers of bagels, stuffed grape leaves, and sushi, the final edible map reflects the ethnic mix of the population. At the end of the performance, with background music, the public is invited to eat the result. On April 28, 2007, I was in Trafalgar Square with my children and grandchildren and we watched fourteen volunteer teams from community centers and social clubs led by Alicia and Barbara bring their models of different parts of London created with samosas, pakoras, pizzas, and the like. Because of the huge crowd, we did not get to eat any of it.</p>
<p class="summary">Alicia has a summer house in Calpe, on the Costa Blanca in the province of Alicante. Her little <span class="italic">casita</span> is next to her mother Pepa’s house. Her maternal grandfather had land in Alicante, and her parents—her father was an internationally renowned geological scientist from Zaragoza—were so taken by a rock in the sea, called El Peñón de Ifach, that they built three little houses overlooking it so that their three daughters would always have a home there. They were the only houses near the little fishing village of Calpe. Now one has been sold and the two houses left are the last Spanish enclave in a world of high-rise buildings and an English, German, and Russian expat population.</p>
<p class="summary">I stayed at the <span class="italic">casita</span> with a group of Alicia’s friends. She had suspended hundreds of plastic flowers on strings from the ceilings and strewn many more over the floors and beds. Margarita, Pepa’s <span class="italic">dame de compagnie;</span> young Rosemary from Bolivia, Alicia’s maid; and Ana, whose husband is a local fisherman, prepared sumptuous meals for us every day. Many of their recipes are in this book.</p>
<p class="summary">On Saturday nights, after it gets dark, Alicia sometimes projects films in the garden on a whitewashed wall that houses the laundry and wood oven and the grill where she makes paella. She has a collection of silent films, Hollywood musicals, old newsreels, Almodóvar films, old Catalan films, blues and rock and roll concert films, documentaries. She calls it the Cantina Visual Cine Club, and everybody is invited, even people she meets on the beach and passersby. Friends and neighbors bring their own chairs and sandwiches. Her mother’s friends are in their eighties and nineties. Alicia puts out drinks, cordials of herbs and flowers, on the table, with food nibbles. At the end, everyone is invited to dance to music from a small portable record player.</p>
