<p class="MsoNormal2"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN" class="calibre3">Thank You!</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal2"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal2"><span lang="EN">A great big
heartfelt THANK YOU to all my friends and family from near and afar who trusted
me with their best and favorite recipes.  Thank you to all of you who
volunteered to be cookie tasters, especially my husband and all my pool
buddies.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">A truly special thanks to my husband, Emmett, who always showed up just
in time when the chaos was the greatest.  He was a pillar of calm in the
kitchen that often looked like a herd of buffalos stampeded in, not only
through, it.  He put things back onto the shelves, cleaned dishes and made
emergency runs to the store.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Thanks to my son Andy and daughter Christina who took time out of their
busy schedules to edit the text and take mouth-watering photos.  Not to forget
Hannah and Constance who loaned me a standing mixer and dishes, and Madeleine
who located hard to find ingredients.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">And of course not to forget Diane, who devised the “ingenious cookie
rating system” – If it is a cookie, it’s a five star!  That made it all so
easy.</span></p>
