<h3 class="h3"><em>Baked Salt Cod with Tomatoes, Olives and Capers</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>I am told this is a traditional Christmas Eve dish in the Var, our surrounding region. It is not a dish for the faint-hearted, with massive flavours that manage not to compete but combine. I have veered from the original recipe in cutting the cooking time for the sauce by about two-thirds and adding a little Parmesan cheese. Be warned, though, about the pungency of the fennel seeds when simmered: they certainly like to be noticed</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 × 200g (7oz) boneless portions of salt cod, soaked for 24 hours<br/>
2 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
4 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan<br/>
3 large sprigs flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, chopped</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">SAUCE</span><br/>
1 small onion, peeled and diced<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed<br/>
2 tbsp olive oil<br/>
1 tsp plain flour<br/>
500ml (18fl oz) red wine<br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) chopped tomatoes (tinned are fine)<br/>
200ml (7fl oz) water<br/>
1 bouquet garni (bay, thyme, 3 strips of orange zest)<br/>
1 pinch fennel seeds<br/>
20 black olives, stoned and chopped<br/>
2 tbsp small salted capers, well rinsed<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
Caster sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 5 minutes until soft. Add the flour and stir for a minute or so to combine. Pour in the wine and reduce by two-thirds, then add the tomatoes, water, bouquet garni and fennel seeds and simmer for 20 minutes until fairly thick. Strain through a sieve little by little, pressing well to extract the maximum of sauce. Add the olives and capers and season well with salt, sugar and cayenne. You will probably need plenty of sugar to balance the wine.</p>
<p class="normala">Fry the salt cod fillets for a few minutes each side in the vegetable oil until golden. Put them in an ovenproof dish, pour over the sauce, sprinkle with the Parmesan and parsley, and bake for 10 minutes. Serve immediately. Mashed potatoes made with olive oil instead of butter are a good accompaniment.</p>
