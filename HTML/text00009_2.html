 carne</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">meat, game, poultry</h2>
<p class="parab1">The backyard of my childhood home was like a small farmyard. There were chickens scratching about in the dirt, lots of rabbits and guinea pigs, and we always had a pig. Every Sunday, we bought meat from one of the three village butchers. We only ate meat once or twice a week but it was truly fresh and we knew where it came from, whether it was the farm or our own back garden. Markets full of live animals – rabbits, chickens, lambs and cows – were part of our lives. We saw animals as a source of food, yet we cared for them and loved them as if they were our pets.</p>
<p class="parab1">Every Thursday, a bullock was slaughtered in Minori. It was a fascinating event for the children. Great groups of us used to sit on the slaughterhouse wall to watch the gruesome spectacle. The butcher was a bull of a man himself, with a jutting chin. The killing was so cruel and brutal that to our childish eyes it looked like the crucifixion of Jesus. The butcher would tie the bullock’s head to a post and bash it hard with a large mallet. Then he slit its throat and drained off all the blood. Finally the bullock was lifted up with large, heavy chains to be gutted and skinned.</p>
<p class="parab1">People are so removed from the source of their meat these days. You go into a supermarket and see endless rows of pre-packaged poultry, meat and game. It’s difficult to associate meat with live animals. For me, it was part of my culture. We respected animals because we knew they were our food. I never saw my mother buy a chicken or pigeon at the butcher’s. She had a pigeon coop and she would take the birds out as she needed them.</p>
<p class="parab1"><a id="page_96"></a>
 By the time I was 11, my father was wise enough to see where my heart lay. During the summer holidays, he found me a job in a fine restaurant run by one of his friends – a great chef by the name of Alfonso. I adored the job, but I think I must have been rather a handful, if only because of my boundless enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="parab1">As a very junior waiter, I was permitted to greet customers and tell them what was on the menu, but I was not yet entrusted with the important task of taking orders. However, I invented a special responsibility of my own. Almost immediately, I discovered that I could predict people’s orders from their reaction when I recited the menu. I would run straight into the kitchen and prepare the ingredients necessary for those dishes, ready for the chef to cook them. Alfonso thought he was losing his mind when, time after time, he went to the preparation table only to find his work already done. He was afraid he had done it himself and then forgotten about it. Eventually he caught me in the act and, after much shouting and swearing, he banned me from the kitchen for the rest of the day. Later, he calmed down, and when he realised how keen I was to cook, he found me work in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="parab1">Alfonso’s restaurant had chickens, rabbits and sometimes even lambs in the backyard. We killed what we needed each day. If the chef ran out of chicken in the middle of a shift, I’d have to run out and prepare another. It might sound gruesome but it meant that all our meat was very fresh.</p>
<p class="parab1">My time in the kitchen taught me about every sort of meat and every way to cook it. I learned not to waste anything; we used every last scrap.</p>

 antipasto di pesche e prosciutto crudo di parma</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">antipasto of fresh peaches and Parma ham</h3>
<p class="para1">Parma ham with melon, Parma ham with figs … both wonderful combinations, but in the middle of a warm summer why not with peaches? It makes a lovely and refreshing starter, but you must use ripe peaches. If you can find them, the small organic ones are out of this world. I dedicate this recipe to Dominique, who loves Parma ham so much she would have it at every meal.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 1</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 ripe peach</p>
<p class="ingre">a few slices of Parma ham, very thinly and freshly cut</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of rocket</p>
<p class="ingre">extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the skin from the peach – this is made easier by immersing the peach in boiling water for a minute. Cut the peach in half and discard the stone. Arrange on a plate with the Parma ham and rocket. Drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil and grind over some black pepper.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h3 class="h3">polpette al vapore</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">steamed meatballs</h3>
<p class="para1">This dish has great sentimental value for me, as my mother would cook it when I was recovering from an illness. Because the meatballs are steamed and not fried, they are gentle on the stomach and easy to digest. It’s also a good way to enjoy meatballs without the added fat! Use the best lean minced beef you can find – minced steak is ideal.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp water</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/1lb 2oz very lean minced beef</p>
<p class="ingre">2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Half fill a pan with water and bring to the boil. Cover with a plate roughly the same size as the pan, or just a little larger, and put half the olive oil and the 3 tablespoons of water on the plate.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together the mince, garlic, parsley, the remaining olive oil and some salt and pepper. It is much easier to do this with your hands. When all the ingredients are well combined, shape into about 25 small balls.</p>
<p class="para1">When the water begins to boil, turn down the heat to medium, so the water is gently simmering. Place the meatballs on the plate on top of the pan and cover with an upturned plate or, ideally, a glass bowl so that you can see through it.</p>
<p class="para1">Leave to steam for 30 minutes, turning the meatballs over halfway through. Serve immediately, as the meat tends to toughen slightly when cool. You can serve the meatballs with pasta or on their own, with some good bread to mop up the liquid.</p>

 vitello alla genovese</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">veal slow-cooked with onions</h3>
<p class="para1">This is an old recipe from the Campania region, and not from Genoa as the name suggests. In the days of the old Italian maritime republics (Genoa, Amalfi, Venice and Pisa), this dish was made for Genoese sailors when they docked in Amalfi, hence the name. Although it takes three hours to cook, it is an extremely straightforward dish to make and you get two courses from just one pot. The onion sauce is used to flavour pasta as a starter, or primo, and the veal joint is served as a main course. Try it for a different Sunday lunch.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1kg/2¼lb veal joint</p>
<p class="ingre">3 garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley, roughly torn</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2.5kg/5½lb large onions, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 celery stalk, diced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 carrot, diced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 bunch of rosemary sprigs, 2 bay leaves and 2 sage leaves, tied together to make a bouquet garni</p>
<p class="ingre">200ml/7fl oz white wine</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Place the veal joint on a chopping board. With a sharp knife, unroll it until you obtain a long, flat piece, then put skin-side down. Season with salt and pepper, rubbing them well into the meat, followed by the garlic and parsley. Roll up again and tie together with 4 pieces of string, trimming off any excess.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the veal and seal on all sides. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onions, celery and carrot to the pan, season with salt and pepper and stir well. Add the bouquet garni and cook until the onions begin to soften. Put the veal back in the pan, cover with a lid, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 3 hours, until very tender. Stir the onions and turn the meat from time to time to prevent sticking. After 3 hours, turn up the heat, add the wine and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. With a potato masher, mash the onions slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p>
<p class="para1">Serve the onion sauce with some cooked pennette pasta and freshly grated Parmesan. For the main course, slice the veal and serve with a little of the sauce and a green salad.</p>

 il ragu</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stuffed beef rolls in tomato ragu</h3>
<p class="para1">This recipe takes me back to my childhood Sunday lunches and, more recently, to family gatherings when I return to my home village. My Aunt Maria was the ‘queen’ of this dish and would spend the entire morning checking, stirring and making sure it was just right for all the family to enjoy. It is traditionally made every Sunday in all regions of southern Italy. It is a simple dish to prepare and takes about two hours to cook – some traditionalists will cook it for longer to get an even richer tomato sauce, but if you follow this recipe two hours will suffice. The tomato sauce is used to flavour pasta for the <em>primo</em>
 (pasta course) and the meat is eaten as a <em>secondo</em>
 (main course). Any leftover sauce can be used to flavour pasta dishes throughout the week.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">12 small thin sirloin steaks</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre">4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley, torn</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint red wine</p>
<p class="ingre">1 onion, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 celery stalk, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp tomato concentrate or tomato purée, diluted in 400ml/14fl oz lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre">2 x 400g/14oz tins of chopped tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingre1">a handful of fresh basil leaves</p>
<p class="para1">Arrange the slices of meat on a chopping board or a clean work surface and flatten them with a meat tenderiser (if you don’t have one, place a flat wooden spatula over the meat and bash with the palm of your hand). Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with the grated Parmesan, garlic and parsley. Roll each slice up tightly and secure well with toothpicks.</p>
<p class="para1">For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. When hot, lower the heat, add the meat rolls and seal well on all sides. Increase the heat again, add the wine and simmer until it has reduced by half. Remove the meat and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Add the onion and celery to the pan and stir well. Cook until the remainder of the wine has nearly evaporated, then put the meat back in the pan and pour over the diluted tomato concentrate and the chopped tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the basil. Lower the heat and partially cover with a lid. Cook gently for 2 hours, stirring from time to time. Check the seasoning.</p>
<p class="para1">Serve the tomato sauce with some cooked pasta such as tagliatelle or large rigatoni. Then serve the meat rolls as a main course with a green salad.</p>

 cotolette di agnello alla griglia ripiene di prosciutto ed erbe</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">grilled lamb cutlets filled with Parma ham and herbs</h3>
<p class="para1">You can make the filling in advance, or make lots of it and store some in the fridge or freezer for another time. When choosing lamb cutlets, go to a reliable butcher and ask for organic (if available) or the best-quality racks of lamb. Usually one rack of lamb contains approximately six cutlets.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">12 lamb cutlets</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">10 fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh rosemary needles</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh basil leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz butter, slightly softened (remove from the fridge about an hour before using)</p>
<p class="ingre1">6 slices of Parma ham</p>
<p class="para1">Place all the herbs on a chopping board and chop very finely together. Place them in a bowl with the garlic, Parmesan, butter and some salt and pepper and mix well until you get a smooth paste.</p>
<p class="para1">Arrange the Parma ham slices overlapping slightly on a piece of clingfilm and spread the paste evenly over them with a spatula. Then, with the help of the clingfilm, roll up the ham into a sausage shape, encased in the clingfilm, and tie the ends so the filling doesn’t escape. Place in the fridge for at least an hour.</p>
<p class="para1">Slice each lamb cutlet horizontally through the centre, leaving it joined at one end, and open it up like a butterfly. With a meat tenderiser, flatten each piece. (You can ask your butcher to do this for you if you prefer.)</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the filling from the fridge and discard the clingfilm. Cut the filling into 2.5cm/1in slices, pressing slightly to flatten. Place on one side of each cutlet and fold the other side over the top. Press together well, making sure that none of the filling escapes. Transfer the cutlets to a baking tray lined with foil and season with salt and pepper. Place under a hot grill and grill for about 2 minutes on each side for rare, 4 minutes for medium or, for well done, as long as you like!

 <span class="big">‘</span>
 I have always loved animals. My father kept cats and dogs and I grew up surrounded by a whole range of farmyard creatures, which became my playmates. But I soon learned not to become too attached to them.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Every Easter, my father would return from his travels laden with goodies for our traditional spring feast: the finest goat, chicken, capon and lamb, raised by his farmer friends. To make sure he was getting the freshest meat and the finest quality, he would make a point of seeing each animal alive before he bought it.</p>
<p class="paraba1">One year he made his mistake. A couple of weeks before Easter, he accepted a baby goat as payment for an old debt. It was just a few weeks old but he knew it would be perfect for our Easter lunch. He also thought it would be fun for me to have a baby goat to play with. To be fair to my father, he did tell me that it was our Easter lunch, but I was just a small child and really didn’t want to believe such a brutal truth, so I pushed it to the back of my mind.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Looking after this hungry kid was a 24-hour-a-day job. I called him Bottiglia (Bottle) because I fed him milk from a bottle. He quickly became my whole life. My family and friends teased me mercilessly but I loved him. Bottiglia was my friend, constant companion and confidant. I created a wonderful adventure dream world in my head for the two of us. He came with me to the beach, trotted behind me on my jaunts to the mountains and wandered through the village streets with me. He was my little shadow, and I believe he loved me as much as I loved him. I was his surrogate mother and he was my pride and joy.</p>
<p class="paraba1">It came to school time and I kicked up a fuss. I didn’t want to leave my new best friend at home but my parents threatened me, saying that if I didn’t go to school they would take him away. For two weeks I went to school every day without fail and without complaint. I didn’t want to lose Bottiglia.</p>
<p class="paraba1"><a id="page_105"></a>
 The day before Easter, I ran home from school and straight through the house to find him. I had been thinking all day about Bottiglia and the adventures we could have. I was so looking forward to seeing him … and there he was, hanging by his back legs from the ceiling, his throat cut and blood still dripping from his neck. I couldn’t believe the horror in front of my eyes. Even now, it still counts as the worst day of my life. I started to cry, and my mother shouted at my father, telling him he shouldn’t have done it, knowing how much I loved the goat. My father would have none of it. As far as he was concerned, he had done nothing wrong. He walloped me for crying and said I was old enough to know better than to get attached to food.</p>
<p class="paraba1">The next day at lunch I felt sick. I couldn’t eat my friend but I had to sit and watch everyone else tucking in. I’ll never forget my little sister laughing at me, and the rest of the table joining in.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Although this might seem harsh, ultimately my father was right. The kid was always intended as our Easter meal. It was a valuable lesson. From that moment, I still loved animals but I also respected them as a source of food.<span class="big1">’</span>

 porchetta</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stuffed rolled pork belly</h3>
<p class="para1">Traditionally in Italy, porchetta is a whole piglet filled with lots of fresh herbs and slow-roasted either in a wood oven or outdoors on a spit. It is made at home or sold ready-made as a takeaway, and you can buy it whole, a few slices or just have a slice between bread as a sandwich. As whole piglets are not that easily obtainable, I use pork belly and the result is the same. It is simple to prepare and can be made in advance and eaten cold – a good idea for parties or to feed a large group of people for Sunday lunch.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 10–12</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">5kg/11lb piece of pork belly – ask the butcher to remove the ribs and trim off the excess fat</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingre">leaves from a large bunch of fresh thyme</p>
<p class="ingre">needles from a large bunch of fresh rosemary, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">a large bunch of fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp fennel seeds (if you are lucky enough to find wild fennel, use it instead, finely chopped – its flavour is unique)</p>
<p class="ingre">8 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp runny honey</p>
<p class="ingre1">coarsely ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to its highest setting. Lay the pork belly skin-side down. Sprinkle half the salt and lots of coarsely ground black pepper over it, rubbing them well into the meat with your fingers. Leave to rest for 10 minutes so the salt and pepper settle well into the meat. Then sprinkle the herbs, fennel seeds and garlic evenly all over it.</p>
<p class="para1">Next tie up the meat. You will need 10 pieces of string, each about 30cm/12in long. Carefully roll the meat up widthways and tie it very tightly with string in the middle of the joint. Then tie at either end about 1cm/½in from the edge and keep tying along the joint until you have used up all the string. The filling should be well wrapped – if any excess filling escapes from the sides, push it in. With your hands, massage 1 tablespoon of the olive oil all over the joint. Then rub the remaining salt with some more black pepper over it.</p>
<p class="para1">Grease a large roasting tin with the remaining olive oil and place the pork in it. Roast for 10 minutes, then turn it over. After 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 150°C/300°F/Gas Mark 2 and cover the meat with aluminium foil. (If you like the crackling very crisp, don’t bother with the foil, but remember that the porchetta needs to be sliced thinly and crispy crackling will make this difficult.) Roast for 3 hours.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the joint from the oven and coat with the honey, drizzling some of the juices from the roasting tin all over it, too. Insert a fork in either side of the joint and lift it on to a wooden board. If you are serving the porchetta immediately, place the roasting tin on the hob and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the caramelised bits from the base of the tin, until the juices from the meat reduce and thicken slightly. Slice the joint thinly and serve with the sauce. Alternatively, leave the meat to cool and slice when needed. It will keep for up to a week in the fridge.</p>

Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the chickens, then reduce the heat slightly and cook until golden brown on all sides. Cover the pan and cook gently for about 20 minutes, until the chickens are cooked through.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the sauce. Place the garlic and rosemary in a mortar and pound with a pestle. Add the wine, vinegar, sugar and capers, and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1">Turn up the heat under the chickens, add the sauce and simmer until reduced by half, stirring all the time. Arrange on a plate and pour over the sauce. Serve immediately, scattered with parsley, if wished.</p>

<p class="para1">Oh, the taste of my childhood: chickens scratching in the backyard, lemons and thyme from the garden. A distant but very vivid memory. Try this recipe with free-range or corn-fed chicken breasts – the combination with lemon and fresh thyme is wonderful. Serve with boiled new potatoes and green beans.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingre">4 boneless chicken breasts</p>
<p class="ingre">plain flour, for dusting</p>

<p class="ingre">2 small onions, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 lemon, zest and pith removed, thinly sliced, plus a few lemon slices to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre">16 sprigs of fresh thyme, plus a few extra to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">In a small bowl, mix together the wine and lemon juice, then set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and rub in well. Lightly dust them with some flour, shaking off any excess. With the palm of your hand, flatten the breasts slightly. Heat the olive oil in a large pan. Add the chicken and seal on both sides (some chicken breasts contain water and may spit while cooking – to prevent this, cover the pan with a lid). Once they are well sealed and golden brown, remove the chicken breasts from the pan and set aside. Lower the heat, add the onions, season with salt and pepper and sweat until the onions are soft. Add the lemon slices, thyme mix well. Return the chicken to the pan, cover and cook over a gentle heat for 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Turn up the heat (but be careful not to burn the onions and lemon), add the wine and lemon juice mixture, then cover and cook for 10–15 seconds, until the mixture is bubbling. Remove the lid and simmer until the liquid has evaporated slightly – the sauce will begin to thicken. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>
<p class="para1">Arrange the chicken breasts on a large plate or on individual serving plates and pour the sauce over. Garnish with lemon slices and extra sprigs of thyme.</p>

 bocconcini di pollo con aceto alle mele</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">chicken bites wrapped in pancetta and sage with a cider vinegar dressing</h3>
<p class="para1">This recipe came out of the blue when I was making a chicken dish for some guests at home. As usual, I had bought too much food and was left with a couple of chicken breasts. In the fridge I found pancetta and fresh sage, so I decided to put these ingredients together with a tangy cider vinegar dressing and made these delicious <em>bocconcini</em>
 , which I served with pre-dinner drinks. They make an excellent starter. Alternatively, you can make lots of them in advance for parties or as snacks with drinks. If you serve them cold like this, don’t pour the dressing over as they will go soggy. Arrange the <em>bocconcini</em>
 on plates garnished with some salad leaves and put the dressing in small bowls for dipping.</p>

<p class="ingre">2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">a few salad leaves, to serve</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the dressing:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">120ml/4fl oz extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp cider vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp finely chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Cut the chicken breasts lengthways in half and cut each half into 3 chunks. Lay the half slices of pancetta on a clean work surface, place a sage leaf on top of each one and wrap them around the chicken chunks.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the pancetta-wrapped chicken and seal all over, taking care not to burn the pancetta. Turn the heat down and, with the help of 2 forks, keep turning the <em>bocconcini</em>
 until the chicken has cooked through. This should take about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the dressing. Place all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk with a fork until it begins to thicken slightly.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the <em>bocconcini</em>
 from the pan and drain on kitchen paper to remove excess oil. Arrange on a plate with some salad leaves and pour the dressing over. Serve immediately.</p>

 petti d’anatra in limoncello</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">duck breasts in limoncello</h3>
<p class="para1">Limoncello is a lemon liqueur made on the Amalfi Coast, near my home. When I was a child it used to be home-made only, but now it has become quite an industry and is sold worldwide. It is a very pure liqueur, made solely from lemons, sugar and alcohol. The citrus/sweet flavour goes very well with duck. Serve this dish with a purée of root vegetables such as carrot and celeriac.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 boneless duck breasts</p>
<p class="ingre">2 large lemons</p>
<p class="ingre">250ml/8fl oz limoncello liqueur</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>To serve</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">400g/14oz celeriac, peeled weight</p>
<p class="ingre">300g/10½oz carrots</p>
<p class="ingre1">large knob of butter</p>
<p class="para1">Pat the duck breasts dry and place them in a shallow dish. Peel the lemons with a potato peeler so you get ringlets of lemon zest, then squeeze the juice from them. Scatter the lemon ringlets over the duck, pour over the juice and limoncello and leave to marinate for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the duck from the marinade, dry on kitchen paper and season well all over with salt and pepper. Do not discard the marinade.</p>
<p class="para1">Clarify the butter in a large frying pan by letting it melt, then when it begins to foam, carefully lifting off the foam with a tablespoon, leaving just the clear, golden liquid. Add the olive oil. When it is hot, place the duck breasts in the pan, skin-side down, and seal well on both sides. Reduce the heat and cook for about 12 minutes, turning the duck over from time to time. This will give you medium-cooked duck, which I think is ideal for this dish. Now turn the heat up to high, pour in the marinade and let it evaporate, turning the duck over and giving the pan a shake from time to time – this will help the sauce thicken.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the purée. Cook the root vegetables in boiling water for 20 minutes. Drain, then pass through a potato ricer, until smooth. Stir in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="para1">As soon as the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and place the duck breasts on a chopping board. Leave to rest for about 5 minutes, then cut them into slices, arrange on 4 plates or one serving dish and pour over the sauce. Serve immediately.</p>

 petto di faraona ripieno di erbe con salsa al balsamico</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">breast of guinea fowl stuffed with herbs and served with a balsamic sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">This is an old recipe from the Naples region, traditionally made with pig’s spleen. Spleen is no longer commonly available and probably a little off-putting to a lot of people, so I have used guinea fowl breasts instead. If you prefer, you can use chicken.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 boneless guinea fowl breasts</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint red wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre">275ml/9fl oz red wine</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the stuffing:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz softened butter</p>
<p class="ingre">4 garlic cloves, squashed and finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 red chilli, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz fresh mint, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">50g/2oz fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</p>
<p class="para1">First make the stuffing. Put all the stuffing ingredients in a bowl and mix together until smooth, adding a little salt to taste. Shape into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge until ready to use.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the guinea fowl breasts on a chopping board, skin-side down. Make a small pocket in each one with a sharp knife and fill with the herb butter. Fold over the skin from both sides to cover the flesh and secure it with wooden toothpicks, weaving them in and out. Ensure that none of the filling comes out.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the guinea fowl breasts and cook until sealed on all sides. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar and wine, turn down the heat and cook for 20 minutes, turning the guinea fowl over halfway through the cooking time. Remove the guinea fowl from the pan and leave to cool. Take the saucepan off the heat and beat with a whisk until the sauce begins to thicken and has an almost creamy consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the toothpicks from the guinea fowl and slice. Arrange the slices on a plate and pour the sauce over.</p>

 faraona con pancetta e uva passa</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">guinea fowl with pancetta and raisins</h3>
<p class="para1">The sweetness of raisins goes well with guinea fowl – although you could substitute chicken if you prefer. You could also buy ready-cut guinea fowl pieces rather than jointing a whole bird, but I do recommend that you use the legs, as they enhance the flavour of the dish. Smoked streaky bacon can be substituted for the pancetta.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 x 1kg/2¼lb guinea fowl, jointed into 4 (you could ask your butcher to do this)</p>
<p class="ingre">75g/3oz plain flour</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz pancetta, cut into thin strips</p>
<p class="ingre">10 garlic cloves, unpeeled</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz raisins</p>
<p class="ingre">2 sprigs of fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="ingre">1 glass of white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">1 glass of chicken stock</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/Gas Mark 2. Coat the guinea fowl pieces in the flour, shaking off any excess. Heat the olive oil in a large, ovenproof heavy-based pan over medium heat, add the pancetta and fry until browned. Remove the pancetta from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the guinea fowl in the pan and cook until sealed on all sides. Add the garlic cloves, raisins, rosemary and wine. Simmer until the wine has reduced by half, then add the stock and return the pancetta to the pan. Cover tightly with a lid, transfer to the oven and cook for 30–40 minutes, until the guinea fowl is tender. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning, then serve.</p>

 coniglio con aglio e rosmarino servito con bruschetta</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">rabbit with garlic and rosemary served with bruschetta</h3>
<p class="para1">Rabbit is cooked all over Italy in different ways and the method I have given here is the way we cook it at home. It was always my son Christopher’s favourite dish at Sunday lunches and I dedicate this recipe to him. If you don’t like rabbit, you can cook chicken, guinea fowl or turkey in exactly the same way. Use good extra virgin olive oil for this recipe, as you need quite a lot and the flavour really comes out.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 rabbit, weighing 1.5kg/3lb 5oz chopped into medium-sized chunks on the bone (including the liver, kidneys and ribs), or use ready-prepared boneless chunks of rabbit</p>
<p class="ingre">plain flour for dusting</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">cloves from 1 garlic head, kept whole with skins on</p>
<p class="ingre">a large bunch of fresh rosemary, broken in half</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the bruschetta:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">a few slices of slightly stale bread</p>
<p class="ingre1">a few garlic cloves, peeled but left whole</p>
<p class="para1">Season the rabbit with salt and pepper and dust with the flour. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan. When hot, add the floured rabbit chunks and seal well on all sides until golden brown and quite crisp. Reduce the heat, add the garlic and rosemary, cover with a lid and cook gently for 30 minutes, turning the pieces of rabbit from time to time. Turn up the heat to high, remove the lid, pour in the wine and simmer until it has evaporated.</p>
<p class="para1">When the rabbit is ready, make the bruschetta. Toast the slices of bread, immediately rub them with the garlic and then drizzle with some of the olive oil that will have risen to the top of the rabbit sauce. Serve the rabbit accompanied by the bruschetta.</p>

 insaccati</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">preserved meats</h3>
<p class="para1">Preserved meats are extremely popular throughout Italy, with each region having its own specialities. Although pig is the most common animal from which preserved meats are made, wild boar, goose and beef are also used.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Bresaola</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Bresaola is air-dried beef. It is a popular antipasto on many Italian restaurant menus and can also be found ready-sliced in packets in most supermarkets, although this variety is very ‘plastic’ and tastes nothing like the original. My friend, Mauro Bregoli, who lives in the New Forest, is a master of curing and preserving meat, and his smoked bresaola is exceptional. Whenever I put bresaola on the menu at Passione, I ordered his. The best-quality bresaola can be found at good Italian delicatessens and you should ask for the <em>punta d’anca</em>
 , which is the fleshiest and most succulent part.</p>
<p class="para1">Bresaola should be served thinly sliced, drizzled with some extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice, and accompanied with some rocket and shavings of Parmesan cheese or with warm caprino (mild Italian goat’s cheese).</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Cotechino and zampone</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">These are both a type of huge sausage. Cotechino is a mixture of pork rind, fat and meat, all minced up and very finely seasoned with spices, then placed inside sausage skins and cooked for a long time. Zampone is pig’s trotter minced up with pork rind, back fat, lean meat and some spices and seasoning. The mixture is then stuffed in sausage skin.</p>
<p class="para1">Both are now made commercially and sold in vacuum packs, making them easy to cook in boiling water at home. They are traditionally served at New Year with stewed lentils. The descriptions of both may sound a little off-putting, but I guarantee that if you like sausages, these are the best! They are easily obtainable at Italian delis. Serve with stewed lentils or mashed potatoes and braised cabbage for a filling winter meal.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Prosciutto crudo di Parma</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Made from pigs raised in the Emilia Romagna region, this is probably Italy’s most renowned cured ham. Other regions have their own versions – for example, San Daniele from Friuli and San Leo from Marche. The best-quality hams are cured on the bone for at least 18–24 months. Parma ham is traditionally served as part of an antipasto with other cured meats, pickles and <a href="text00010.html#page_138">preserved vegetables</a>
 . See also Antipasto di Pesche e Prosciutto <a href="text00009.html#page_98">Crudo di Parma</a>
 .</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Salami</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Italy has a vast variety of salami, which are mostly commercially produced nowadays, although many farmers and local <em>salumerie</em>
 still make their own in the old-fashioned way. Good salami is made with <em>suino</em>
 (pure lard), and the regional varieties have their own flavourings, such as black peppercorns, fennel seeds, chilli and red wine. Some of the most common varieties of salami found in delis in this country are Milano, Napoletano, Felino, Cacciatorino, Soppressata, Finocchiona and Calabrese, each of which has its own characteristics. I suggest you try a few slices of each before picking your favourite. Serve a selection of salami as part of an antipasto, with pickles and <a href="text00010.html#page_138">preserved vegetables</a>
 .</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Sausages</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">There is a wide range of Italian sausages available in good delicatessens. Most are pork-based, with flavourings such as fennel seeds, rosemary, sage and chilli. They are usually short and fat, tied with string, and sold loosely from the cold counter. Italian sausages are delicious grilled or fried, as you would cook other sausages, or added to a thick <a href="text00009.html#page_100">tomato ragu</a>
 to make a filling pasta sauce.</p>
<p class="para1">There is also the luganega sausage, which is a very long pork sausage, common in northern Italy, usually sold by the metre. Buy a long piece and wrap it round in a spiral shape (like the English Cumberland sausage), secure it with toothpicks and fry it, adding rosemary sprigs and finishing off with red wine. This is delicious eaten with polenta or mashed potatoes.</p>

 <span class="big">‘</span>
 When I came to England at the end of the 1960s, there were two things I wanted: a pair of Levis and a gun. I had been out hunting with my father on Sunday mornings since I was tiny. Our family had hunted for at least two generations, so it was in my blood. When I was a small boy, I was effectively the dog! I would run through the undergrowth and frighten the birds out. When my father was about to shoot, he would shout, ‘Hop!’, which meant, ‘Don’t move!’, and I would duck down. Then we would head back to the village to go to church. My father would leave his gun and pack of game outside. It would be full of blackbirds, wood pigeons, sparrows and quails.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I remember how strict my father was about his gun. I was never allowed to touch it. He always prepared and stored the cartridges at my grandfather’s house and the gun at ours. He frightened me with stories of accidents and injuries, so I was always very careful. He usually let me have a couple of shots with his sixteen-bore at the end of a day’s hunting, though.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I bought my gun and Levis almost as soon as I got to England. Then I found there was nowhere to shoot. I spent days going round the countryside asking farmers if I could shoot on their land. Eventually one took pity on me and allowed me on his property, as long as I stuck to wood pigeons and rabbits. There is quite a large hunting fraternity in England, which I was lucky enough to join, and I used to go hunting frequently. These days, if friends ask me to join them, I gladly go along.<span class="big1">’</span>
