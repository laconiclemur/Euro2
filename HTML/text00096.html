 YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS SWEET &amp; SAVOURY</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_green" id="nad0000031">
<em>This recipe gives an insight into how my cooking brain works. Having lived in Yorkshire, married a Yorkshireman and given birth to three Yorkshire babies, I just can’t get away from all things Yorkshire. In our house, we like to use Yorkshire puddings as bowls and fill them with beef and horseradish and some crisp cooked broccoli or seasonal veg. While I’m about it, I make twelve extra small Yorkshires and fill them with spoonfuls of canned custard and strawberry jam, for afters! The jam in this recipe requires no boiling, just a tiny bit of patience to let the magic of the dried basil seeds happen. If you can’t find dried basil seeds, chia seeds also work.) So let me introduce you to my showstopper Yorkshire puddings, dinner and dessert style.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 The Yorkshire pudding batter and the jam both benefit from being made early and left overnight. You can also make the beef and horseradish a day in advance if you want, and then reheat it when you need it (but don’t stir the parsley through until just before serving).</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000062">
<span class="green">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 For the batter, place the sifted flour in a large mixing bowl, add the eggs and mix to a stiff batter. Now pour in the milk slowly, whisking all the time until it has been incorporated and the mixture is free of any lumps. Season, stir, then transfer the mixture to a large jug, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge overnight. Allowing the batter to chill lets any air bubbles settle, and when the cold batter eventually comes into contact with the hot oil this helps produce a fast rise.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000063">
<span class="green">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Now for the jam. Blitz the strawberries in a blender or with a hand-held blender to get a smooth paste. Add the dried basil or chia seeds and mix well. You will see the mixture instantly begin to thicken and take on a jam-like texture. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and put into the fridge to chill.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000064">
<span class="green">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 The following day (or you can also do it in advance if you want), make the beef and horseradish. Put the beef into a bowl and season. Add the flour and mix so all the beef is coated. Put 1 tablespoon of the oil into a large non-stick pan on a medium to high heat and brown the beef in three batches, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. You’re not cooking the beef, you’re just getting a golden colour and crust on the meat. Set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000065">
<span class="green">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Add another glug of oil to the pan. Add the garlic, onion, salt, nutmeg and yeast extract, and cook gently till the onions are browned and really soft. Add the potatoes and mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes, just to get a bit of colour on the vegetables.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000066">
<span class="green">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Return the meat to the pan. Add the stock and bring the whole thing to a rapid boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the mixture has thickened and the meat is tender (about 1 hour 15 minutes). If the sauce is thin, lift out the meat and veg, bubble the sauce until thickened and reduced, then stir the meat and vegetables back in. Add the horseradish and chopped parsley right at the end and mix it through.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000067">
<span class="green">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Now it’s time to cook the Yorkshires. Preheat the oven to 230°C/210° fan/gas 8. Have two baking trays ready, a four-hole Yorkshire pudding tray for the large ones and a twelve-hole bun tin for the small ones. Pour sunflower oil into the base of each cavity, about 2–3 teaspoons in each large hole and 1 teaspoon in each small one, so the bases are fully covered.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000068">
<span class="green">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Put the trays into the oven for about 10 minutes, until the oil is really hot and begins to smoke a little.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000069">
<span class="green">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Take the batter out of the fridge (and also take out the jam at this point, so it has time to come up to room temperature). Take the trays out of the oven, pour the batter straight on top of the oil, to come about two-thirds of the way up the holes, and immediately put back into the oven. Don’t get distracted at this point, as timing is absolutely key to a successful Yorkshire pudding. The small Yorkshires will need about 15 minutes and the large ones need about 20 minutes. Be sure not to open the oven until you’re ready to get the small ones out. Once baked, set aside, leaving them in the tray.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000070">
<span class="green">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, put the broccoli florets into a microwaveable dish, add 2 tablespoons of water and cover with cling film. Microwave for 5 minutes on high – this will lightly steam the broccoli without overcooking. Take off the cling film and season with a little salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000071">
<span class="green">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 Divide the beef between the four large Yorkshires, along with the broccoli, and serve warm.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000072">
<span class="green">
<strong>12.</strong>
</span>
 Leave the twelve small Yorkshires to cool completely. After you have finished your main course, top the mini Yorkshires with spoonfuls of custard and strawberry jam. I like to serve them with fresh strawberries and squirty cream.</p>
