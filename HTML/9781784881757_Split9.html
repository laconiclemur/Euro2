<p class="cap">Giancarlo will always value the tips passed down from his Auntie Orlandina (bottom left), family friend Livia (top centre) and his mother Marietta Bellugi (top right)</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Do read this! These are the foundations of Tuscan cooking: the essential stocks, sauces and flavour bases. Master these and you can build your meals and really get the flavour of Tuscan food in your kitchen. I thought I knew a lot about Italian cooking, but I learnt so much more in the year of writing this book and concentrating on what made food Tuscan. This chapter is about passing on that knowledge we’ve acquired from working with our friends, family, and professional cooks from Tuscany such as Antonella Secciani, a cook at an <i>agriturismo</i> and restaurant. She is Tuscan through and through, and learnt to cook from her mother.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Giancarlo has immersed himself in the past and recalls the mantras and tips his mother, Marietta, his Auntie Agnese, and his neighbour Elide gave him as he would always be found in the kitchen with them. I often imagine hearing Marietta’s voice in my ear telling me I haven’t used enough olive oil, or haven’t cooked something for long enough! ‘Have patience,’ she would have said. ‘Give your body the good food and time it deserves.’</p>
<p class="tx">The Tuscan kitchen is a waste not, want not kitchen. During centuries of poverty nothing was thrown away. There was continuity in the kitchen: a stock used for two meals; tomato sauce used in several different ways; and leftovers respected and re-used (if it couldn’t be eaten it went to the pigs, the chickens or back into the land). Everything was seasonal, freshly picked and eaten quickly as there were no fridges. People preserved food throughout the year, from gluts of fruit in summer to the pig slaughtered in winter. Now, as in the past, Tuscan locals tend to shop daily. This ensures fresh ingredients but also for many older people it is a ritual: a daily chore that provides contact with local people, a chance to talk, and the exercise of walking up a hill and down again. This is part of the Mediterranean life that keeps people healthy.</p>
