<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_194"/><b>Zucchini Stuffed</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Camargue Rice</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Melted Cheese</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>My mom often used to make stuffed vegetables to use up leftover food, as when I was growing up, life was hard and food could not be wasted. But actually, we really liked it and sometimes the mix was fantastic—potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, all with different fillings, lined up on a tray. I remember as though it were yesterday how delicious they were served with a freshly made tomato coulis tossed with fresh herbs. You can try different cheeses, such as a sharp farmhouse Comté or Gruyère, which are readily available, or try a Tomme de Savoie, which you should find at a good delicatessen.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus making the stock and coulis</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 50 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 large zucchini, trimmed</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small bouquet garni, made with 1 thyme sprig and 1 parsley sprig, tied together with kitchen string</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup Camargue rice or mixed white and wild rice</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups Vegetable Stock (see <a href="010_9781848991583_Recipe4.html">page 17</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespooons unsalted butter, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 recipe quantity Tomato Coulis (see <a href="020_9781848991583_Recipe14.html">page 21</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 ounces semisoft sheep’s milk cheese, such as Ossau Iraty, rind removed, grated</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 300°F. Bring a saucepan of water on to simmer, with a steamer insert on top large enough to hold all the zucchini. Carefully cut a strip of the smallest amount lengthwise down each one, so they will sit flat on the countertop, then cut lengthwise again, taking off the top one-third to use later as a lid. Use a teaspoon to scoop out the inside of each zucchini, taking care not to make a hole in the bottoms or break the sides, then leave the zucchini to one side. If the scooped-out flesh don’t have too many seeds, chop it to use in the rice stuffing.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Put the lids back on the zucchini and tightly wrap each one in plastic wrap. Twist and secure each end with a knot, pushing out any air, to keep the lid in place. Steam 12 to 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the steamer lid and leave the zucchini to rest while you make the rice.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, onion, chopped zucchini, if using, and the bouquet garni and fry 5 minutes until just soft. Turn the heat down to low and gently fold in the the rice, then fry 3 to 4 minutes. Add the stock, bring to a simmer and season with salt and pepper. Dot the butter over the top of the rice, then cover with a lid or a <i>cartouche</i> (see <a href="140_9781848991583_KitchenTerminology.html#pageid_218">page 218</a>) and put in the oven 25 minutes. Check to see if the rice is tender and the liquid has all been absorbed. If the rice is not quite tender, re-cover and return the pan to the oven 5 minutes, then check once more.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Meanwhile, heat the broiler. Run a fork through the rice, discard the bouquet garni and and adjust the salt and pepper to taste. Remove the zucchini from the plastic wrap and turn hollow-side down on a clean dish towel to drain. Turn them the right way up in a baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Fill with the rice, pressing down lightly, then put a large spoonful of tomato coulis on top of the rice and sprinkle with the cheese. Put the dish under the broiler 2 to 3 minutes until the cheese melts. Top with the lids and serve with extra tomato coulis.</p>
