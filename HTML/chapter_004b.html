<h2 class="h2b">CEPES ET CHATAIGNES SAUTES AU VIN ROUGE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Sautéed Ceps and Chestnuts with Red Wine Sauce</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is a wintry combination of some of the best local ingredients. If the whole cloves of garlic come as a surprise, let yourself be surprised, for after the repeated blanchings they become soft and melting and ooze into the rich sauce. The ceps shouldn’t be washed; they just need their stalks peeled or scraped and the tops wiped with a damp cloth</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
800g (1lb 12oz) small tight ceps, cleaned and halved<br/>
4 tbsp olive oil<br/>
20 cooked chestnuts<br/>
2 heads of garlic, split into cloves, peeled and blanched in 3 changes of water<br/>
100g (3½ oz) butter<br/>
1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
200ml (7fl oz) rich red wine<br/>
Caster sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Heat your largest frying pan with the olive oil until it smokes, then toss in the ceps and fry them over the highest possible heat for about 5 minutes. Add the chestnuts and cooked garlic, then sauté for a couple more minutes. Add half the butter and let it foam and bubble, then toss in the parsley and give the lot a good stir. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper, and turn all of this into a warm container.</p>
<p class="normala">Pour the red wine into the pan and boil until it is almost totally reduced. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining butter. Season with salt, pepper and some sugar and spoon it on to your plates with the ceps, chestnuts, garlic and parsley.</p>
