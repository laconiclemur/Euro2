			<p class="rec-intro">A salmi can be made with all kinds of game, but invariably has a rich wine-based sauce. This is thickened with liver, or sometimes blood, and has a depth of flavour that salmi aficionados appreciate. In this recipe, the woodcock are roasted complete with guts, as is the tradition. The birds are then drawn and any inedible parts such as the gizzard removed. In a classic salmi the meats are reheated in the sauce, but I find that this overcooks the game and spoils the dish. </p>

			<p class="ing-nu">4 woodcock </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">about 150g butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">good brandy</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">375ml good red wine, preferably Burgundy</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">260ml veal stock (see <a href="part0010_split_005.html#Veal-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g white button mushrooms</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 slices of brioche</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">12 slices of cooked truffle</p>

			<p class="body">Season the woodcock. Heat the oil and a tablespoon of the butter in a large pan on the hob and roast the woodcock for 8–10 minutes. Remove the breasts and legs from the woodcock and keep them warm. Set the heads aside.</p>
			<p class="body">Remove the intestines from the birds, discarding the gizzards, and chop them finely. Put them in a bowl and beat in an equal weight of butter and a good splash of the best brandy. </p>
			<p class="body">Chop up the bones of the birds and put them in the roasting pan with ½ tablespoon of fresh butter and a generous seasoning of pepper. Cook on the hob until well browned, then add the wine. Cook until reduced by two thirds, then add the stock and continue to cook until the liquid has reduced again by two thirds. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve, then whisk in the intestine and butter purée to finish. </p>
			<p class="body">Quickly cook the mushrooms in a little butter and fry the slices of brioche in butter. Serve the woodcock breasts and legs with the sauce, fried brioche, mushrooms and truffle slices, then add the woodcock heads cut in half to reveal the delicate, delicious brains. </p>
