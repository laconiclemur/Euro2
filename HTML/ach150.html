<p class="author1"><span class="txit">anitra arrosta con fichi freschi</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Figs grow in both northern and southern Italy and thus are a delicacy enjoyed by both the Tucci and Scappin families. The fruit was in abundance on the day Gianni created this sauce that makes a happy pairing of port and figs. To balance the sweetness of the figs, consider serving a mixed salad of bitter greens, such as arugula, topped with thin slices of fennel bulb and tossed with a simple vinaigrette.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 4-pound duck</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Two 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cloves garlic, crushed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> medium-size onion</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup coarsely chopped onions</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup coarsely chopped celery</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 5-inch sprig fresh thyme</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup honey</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 large fresh figs, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup port</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Wash the duck inside and out, reserving the giblets. Pat dry. If there is a long flap of neck skin, cut it off and discard it. Cut the wing tips at the joints and place in a large roasting pan along with the giblets. Set aside. Fill the duck cavity with one of the rosemary sprigs, the sage, and the garlic. Add the onion half, positioning it so that it holds the herbs inside the duck.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the duck and sear it, browning it evenly on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the duck, breast side down, in the roasting pan. Roast, turning once, to render the fat, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_297"/><span class="red">4.</span> Add the chopped onions, carrots, celery, and halved garlic to the roasting pan, distributing them evenly around the duck. Cook to soften the vegetables, about 15 minutes. Add the remaining rosemary sprig and the thyme sprig. Continue cooking to begin to brown the vegetables, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Reduce the oven to 350° F. Brush one third of the honey over the duck. Continue roasting until the duck is golden brown and cooked through, about 30 minutes. During this time, brush the duck twice with additional honey and stir the vegetables.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Remove the duck from the oven. Place it on a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Remove the giblets and wing tips from the vegetables and discard. Discard the sprigs of herbs. Drain off the fat, reserving about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the cooking juices. Place the reserved cooking juices and the vegetables in a blender, puree until smooth, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">8.</span> Melt the butter in a sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Stir in the figs and cook until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in the port. Allow to simmer until reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Stir in the pureed vegetables and simmer gently to warm through, about 2 minutes. Cut the duck into portions and serve, topping each portion with some of the sauce.</p>
