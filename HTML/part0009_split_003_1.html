  <h3 class="h3a">Sardines marinated in orange</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Sardines are so good for you, and I am pleased to see they are now readily available on most supermarket fish counters ready cleaned and filleted and excellent value! Fish is often made in this way in Italy, known as <em class="calibre4">al carpione</em>; once cooked it is left to marinate and it was a popular way to preserve fish before the arrival of fridges. It makes an excellent antipasto served with a crunchy raw fennel salad.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">70g/2½oz dried breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp finely chopped parsley</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 sardines, 50–60g/about 2oz each, cleaned and filleted</p>

  <p class="ing1">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">vegetable oil for shallow frying</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">125g/4½oz shallots, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest and juice of 1 large orange</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the fennel salad</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large fennel bulb, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing2">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="para">Put the egg in a bowl, season and beat well. Put the breadcrumbs on a plate and combine with the parsley. Dust the sardines in flour, shake off excess flour, dip into the egg mixture, then coat well with the breadcrumbs, gently pressing and flattening with the palms of your hands.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat some oil in a large frying pan. When hot, cook the sardines for a couple of minutes on each side until golden. Drain on kitchen paper and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">For the marinade, put the olive oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat, add the shallots and cook until they have softened and are slightly golden. Stir in the vinegar and leave to infuse for a minute. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Stir in the orange juice and zest. Pour over the sardines, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to marinate for at least 2 hours – or up to 3 days in the fridge; serve at room temperature.</p>

  <p class="para1">For the fennel salad, put the sliced fennel in a bowl and mix well with olive oil, salt and pepper. Serve with the sardines.</p>
