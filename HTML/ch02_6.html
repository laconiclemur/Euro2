<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">M</span>y mother and I share an enthusiasm for that moment when family and friends arrive at our homes. We love the excitement of people coming through the door, embracing, talking, and greeting one another, and we take pleasure in introducing new visitors to the group. From my mother I learned the custom of always having an assortment of little dishes set out—olives, salami, cheese, and <span class="txit">biscotti</span> (twice-baked bread)—with wine or espresso at the ready so that guests feel warmly welcomed. To these little dishes I will add one of the appetizers from this section of the book. Many of them can be prepared in advance, as they store well and can generally be served at room temperature or easily reheated.</p>
<p class="indenti">In the Veneto region of Italy, where Gianni comes from, they use the term <span class="txit">cicchetti</span> to describe these appetizers—it is a Venetian term for “little bites.” Cicchetti may be as simple as half a hard-boiled egg topped with a slice of anchovy and drizzled with olive oil, or more complicated, such as sliced frittata. The appetizer recipes that follow will help whet the appetite for the following meal or make a meal in themselves when accompanied by a green salad and bread. And don’t forget the wine!</p>
