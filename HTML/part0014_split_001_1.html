  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_149" class="calibre1"></a>The traditional Italian meal nearly always ends with fruit; a bowl of fresh, seasonal fruits placed in the centre of the table for everyone to help themselves, so when I think of dessert, I naturally think of fruit. A lot of Italian sweet treats like <em class="calibre4">crostate</em> (tarts and pies) and cakes include fruit and for me there is nothing nicer than a home-baked dessert oozing with sweetness from ripe, seasonal fruit. Slowly cooked apples or pears undergo an amazing transformation from when they are fresh, and turning fruit into wonderful desserts has always been a pleasure for me.</p>

  <p class="center-para">My mother, sisters and grandmother loved to make sweet treats, especially on Sundays or feast days, and I was always sent to get the fruit because I knew where the best was to be found. I was the first to climb the fig trees and pick the ripest – I knew when this was because I used to check each day. The same went for cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, pears, apples – and during spring I would come home with basketfuls of wild strawberries, which grew on the hillside. I remember my mum used to fill jars with morello cherries, sprinkle them with sugar and leave them out in the sun for days until the sugar had dissolved; the result was a sweet cherry syrup which was used to fill pies or make cherry ices or simply serve as an accompaniment to cakes. This was effortless slow cooking, as the warm sunshine did the work.</p>

  <p class="center-para">My sisters often made <em class="calibre4">crostate</em>, which were slowly baked when the wood-burning oven was still warm from the day’s bread baking. The smell of this home cooking was amazing, filling the house as well as our nostrils, and I couldn’t wait for the delicacy to come out of the oven, constantly checking, so I could secure the first slice.</p>

  <p class="center-para">A lot of traditional desserts and cakes were made during festivities, in large quantities, to share with friends and family. For instance, at Easter the <em class="calibre4">pastiera di grano</em> (wheat and ricotta pie) was a favourite and women would spend entire days making them – and many still do. I like to maintain this tradition and I reserve a day before Easter Sunday to make a batch to give away and, of course, one or two to keep for my family.</p>

  <p class="center-para">A lot of Italian cakes and desserts, including <em class="calibre4">babà all’arancia</em> (see <a href="part0014_split_004.html#page_154" class="calibre1">here</a>) and the Italians’ favourite Christmas cake, <em class="calibre4">panettone</em> (see <a href="part0014_split_013.html#page_168" class="calibre1">here</a>), use yeast and require several slow risings; it is the slowness of the risings that give the desserts their lightness.</p>
