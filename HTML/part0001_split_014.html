			<p class="rec-intro">Mussels are plentiful, cheap, and quick and easy to prepare. The deep-fried breaded mussels I suggest below make a great snack on their own but really do make this simple soup into something special – a meal in itself. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 8</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6kg mussels</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 shallots, peeled and coarsely chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bouquet garni, made up of thyme, bay leaf and parsley stalks (see <a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bottle of dry white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 carrots, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 celery sticks, chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 large potato, peeled and chopped</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g flour, seasoned with salt and pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Wash the mussels well and scrub off any beards or barnacles. Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a large pan and gently cook the chopped shallots until soft. Add the mussels, bouquet garni and white wine, put a lid on the pan and place it over a high heat until the mussels have opened and are cooked. Tip them into a colander over a bowl to collect the cooking liquor, then pass the liquor through a fine sieve and keep it for later.</p>
			<p class="body">Pick out the mussel meat from the shells and set aside about a quarter of them to make breaded mussels for the garnish.</p>
			<p class="body">Add the remaining oil to a clean pan and sweat the carrots, celery, potato and leek until tender. Add the chopped tomatoes and saffron and cook for a further 5 minutes, then add the mussel liquor and fish stock, followed by the mussel meat. Simmer for 10 minutes, then blitz in a food processor until smooth. Pass the soup through a fine sieve and season with salt and pepper.</p>
			<p class="body">Now prepare the garnish. Slice the carrot and leek on a mandolin or cut them into fine strips. For the breaded mussels, half fill a large heavy saucepan or a deep-fat fryer with vegetable oil and heat to 180°C. Dredge the mussels in the seasoned flour, then dip them into the beaten egg and coat in breadcrumbs. Deep-fry the breaded mussels in batches until they are crispy and golden.</p>
			<p class="body">Serve the soup with fried breaded mussels, strips of leek and carrot and a swirl of crème fraiche.</p>
