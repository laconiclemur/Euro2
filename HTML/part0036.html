<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0002703"><a id="pg63" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>RUSSIAN SALAD</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0002704"><em class="calibre9">Ensaladilla rusa</em> is a great starter and the star of the show whenever we make it at home. I’ve never met a Spanish person who doesn’t love it; in fact, everyone loves this salad. It tastes ten times better the next day, chilled, making it good for preparing ahead. I could eat it straight from the fridge.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0002705">Try to get small potatoes that are as similar in size as possible: you want them to cook quickly without becoming floury. Cooking them in their skins also stops them turning mushy.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0002706">It’s important that the potatoes and carrots are still warm when you mix them with the other ingredients, as this helps them to better absorb the flavour of everything.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0002707">This is a recipe that makes the most of store-cupboard ingredients: white asparagus and <em class="calibre9">piquillo</em> peppers should be from a jar, as should, dare I say it, the mayonnaise.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">FOR 4–6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002708">500g baby potatoes, unpeeled</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002709">2 medium-sized carrots, unpeeled</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002710">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002711">1 Little Gem lettuce, julienned</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002712">250g good-quality tinned tuna or bonito in olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002713">300ml mayonnaise, homemade or shop-bought</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002714">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002715">3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0002716">To finish</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002717">4 tinned white asparagus spears, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002718">3 <em class="calibre9">piquillo</em> peppers, cut into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002719">12 green olives, sliced in half</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002720">Put the potatoes into a large pan of cold salted water. Put the pan on a medium heat and bring to the boil – when bubbling, add the carrots and eggs. Remove the eggs after 10 minutes. How long you cook the carrots and potatoes will depend on what size they are – it may be that the potatoes are ready first if they are very small. What you are looking for is for them both to be nice and soft – pierce with a toothpick if you want to check.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002721">Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables to a colander to drain. Leave them to cool enough to handle, then peel off the skin with a small knife when they are still warm.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002722">Cut everything into 2cm cubes – potatoes, carrots, eggs – and put them into a large bowl with the Little Gem. Spoon the tuna and its oil into the bowl. Add the mayonnaise, salt and pepper and parsley and mix together.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002723">Spoon on to your serving dish – you want it to be almost cake-like. Then dress the salad with the white asparagus, <em class="calibre9">piquillo</em> peppers and olives.</p>
