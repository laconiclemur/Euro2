<p class="tx2"><b>We were shown this sauce of a reduced <i>soffritto</i> by Giancarlo’s cousin, Tiziana Caldesi (see picture opposite). It is known as a ‘lying sauce’ as it is similar to a meat ragù and was made to dress pasta when there was no meat available. It is a good vegetarian option that we sometimes serve if we are having a ragù. Tiziana makes a standard <i>soffritto</i> for six people, adding a big handful of parsley, and chilli to taste (no pepper), then lets it sweat over a low heat for 30 minutes. Then she adds 400 g (14 oz) tomato passata from a jar and cooks it for a further 30 minutes. It is then used to coat freshly cooked and drained short pasta such as penne, and served with a sprinkling of finely grated Parmesan.</b></p>
