<p class="toc" id="sab0003221">I come from a family that loves home cooking. Growing up in Santurtzi (Santurce) on the coast near Bilbao, an area famous for its sardines, we would occasionally go out to bars at the weekends, but <em class="calibre9">pintxos</em> (what we call tapas in Basque) are expensive and you don’t feel as satisfied or full as when you sit down to eat a proper home-cooked meal. Coming home from school or work for lunch, we’d sit down at the table and start to talk about what we were going to have for dinner. When we sat down to dinner, we’d start to talk about what we were going to eat tomorrow for lunch. It was always all about food, food, food.</p>
<p id="sab0003222" class="calibre10">My mum loved running her house and a big part of that was making sure that her family all ate well. Of course, it’s fairly normal for your mum (or maybe your dad) to make lunch and dinner, but for my mother it was about getting the best ingredients and products. They didn’t have to be expensive, it was just about selecting them with care. That’s what I do in my cooking now: it’s all about ingredients and products and finding the very best, whether it’s a leek or a tomato. Selecting your ingredients with care is a very Spanish thing. As a child, when I went shopping with my mum on Saturday mornings, she would always say things like, ‘Can I have this peach? No, not that one, that one’s a little bit bruised, can I have <em class="calibre9">that</em> one?’ Or, if we were at the fishmonger’s, choosing red mullet, she would look at the fishes’ eyes and see the one that wasn’t so fresh and say, ‘No, don’t give me that one!’ She taught me to be very picky.</p>
<p id="sab0003223" class="calibre10">When I came home from school, my mum would start to make the dinner and make up a game to keep me entertained. I’d see her preparing things, and she’d say, ‘Let’s do this,’ so I’d pick the parsley, or pod the peas or broad beans – fun jobs that weren’t dangerous. Every time my mum tasted what she was cooking, she would give me some too. That’s probably why I’ve never been scared to try anything, because that’s what my mum taught me. In our house it was normal to eat livers, brains and sweetbreads.</p>

<p class="toc" id="sab0003224"><a id="pg7" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>My family – my mum, dad, brother and grandma – ate proper meals for lunch and dinner. That didn’t mean they were really luxurious or cost a lot; my father was a builder and he would come home starving, so my mum always made sure that he was well fed. It wasn’t just a case of having one plate of food and that was it. The table would be set with plates, with bowls placed on top. The first thing we ate was always in a bowl, with a spoon – maybe it was soup, or lentils or a stew: something to warm you up. The second course would be fish or meat: something to fill you up. We might have two of my favourites, flat green bean, tomato and potato stew (see <a href="part0088.html#pg125" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>), and then braised rabbit (see <a href="part0163.html#pg222" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>). Plus salad and maybe a little <em class="calibre9">jamón</em>, and always bread. No one would really speak during the first course – except to say, ‘Pass me the bread’ – because we were all hungry. But by the second course we would start talking and asking about each other’s days – and, of course, my mum would ask everyone what they wanted to do for lunch tomorrow …</p>
