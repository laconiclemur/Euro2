<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 20%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">A</span></span><span class="italic">sk an Italian where to eat only one meal in Italy and, after recommending his mother’s house, it is more than likely he will send you to the region of Emilia-Romagna. Few foreigners know the region by name, but even those people with only a passing interest in food recognize its products. By law, Parmesan (Parmigiano-Reggiano) cheese and Prosciutto di Parma (one of Italy’s two most admired <span class="underline">prosciutti</span>) can be produced only in Emilia-Romagna. And its wealth of handmade pastas, including the famed tortellini, are admired far beyond its borders</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Balsamic vinegar originated here over a thousand years ago. Even though imitations are now made from Naples to Milan, the great balsamics—the ones that are aged for decades and are luscious enough to be sipped like liqueurs—are made only in the region</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The region’s cuisine is as complex as an intricately woven tapestry. There is a peasant kitchen, a thriving middle-class cuisine, and the highly refined traditions of the region’s nobility. This book is about five centuries of that culinary heritage</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">If only one word could describe Emilia-Romagna, it would have to be <span class="underline">rich.</span> Not rich in the sense of fat, but rich in dishes of deep, layered tastes. Even at its simplest, Emilia-Romagna’s food tastes as if it has <a id="page4"/>evolved from a long tradition. Yet there is always a spontaneity to what you eat</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Emilia-Romagna sits between Florence and Venice, to the south of Milan. The wedge-shaped region nudges its way into northern Italy from the Adriatic Sea. Its borders are formed by the Adriatic coast, the Po River and the peaks of the Apennines. The region is half mountains and half plains. Its geography is crucial to its cuisine</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">If this book were a novel, two of its main characters would be the Po River plain and the road called the Via Emilia. A large section of the plain, Italy’s largest and most fertile expanse of land, lies within Emilia-Romagna’s borders. That plain (the Padano) has made the region a major agricultural force. Its rich grazing and good land produces Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan) cheese, Parma ham and the wheat for an extraordinary variety of handmade pastas</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When the Romans built Italy’s main north-south trade route, the Via Emilia, they ran it up the entire length of Emilia-Romagna. That road, along with the east-west routes that crossed it, made Emilia-Romagna a crossroads for all of northern Italy—including her two major ports, Genoa and Venice, and their links to the worlds of the East and West. It tied the region to northern, central and eastern Europe, and to Rome and the south. Each link brought traders, visitors, and conquerors with their new foods, dining traditions and ideas. Today a superhighway parallels the Via Emilia</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The original road is Main Street to six of Emilia-Romagna’s eight provincial capitals: Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, Modena, Bologna and Forlí. Each of these cities grew up on the Via Emilia at a point where it was crossed by a major trade road out of the Apennines. The two remaining provincial capitals lie out on the Po plain. Ravenna, the ancient Roman seaport and later the western capital of the Byzantine Empire, sits on the old route from Rome to Venice. Ferrara is farther inland, on the road connecting Florence, Bologna and Ferrara with Venice</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Ferrara’s strategic placement on the banks of the Po not far from the Adriatic gave her control of northern Italy’s most important river and delta. That piece of geography helped Ferrara’s Este family create and sustain one of the most powerful and long-lived dynasties of the Renaissance. Among the legacies of the Este are invaluable written records of their feasts and foods, dishes that are still a vital part of Ferrara’s cooking today</span>.</p>
<a id="page5"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Food changes subtly and sometimes dramatically from one part of Emilia-Romagna to another. Once you are inside, you discover that each area has its own style—the elegant restraint of Parma’s cooking, the medieval flavors still dominating Ferrara’s foods, Bologna’s lustiness and complexity, the richness and slightly countrified quality of Modena’s dishes, Reggio’s refinements, Piacenza’s blending of the three regions pressing at her borders, and the underlying simplicity of Forlìs and Ravenna’s specialties</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Emilia and Romagna were created by warring Romans and Gauls. The first Etruscan and Greek settlers gradually gave way to the Gauls from the north, who were attracted by the area’s rich land and vineyards. Expanding their empire north from Rome, the Romans challenged the Gauls for possession of the region. The Gauls stopped the advancing legions south and east of Bologna. That area remained Roman, or <span class="underline">Romagna,</span> while the plains and mountains to the west and north eventually became <span class="underline">Emilia.</span> Finally Rome gained all of Emilia-Romagna and the region’s Roman settlers went on to create some of the earliest written records of the region’s foods</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Today the border between Romagna and Emilia is still elusive—I have yet to see it marked on a regional map. Everyone agrees that Romagna encompasses all of the region’s Adriatic coast, including the provinces of Forlì and Ravenna. Part of Ferrara province falls under Romagna, but not Ferrara city. Romagna also includes part of Bologna province, but stops somewhere (few agree precisely where) short of the city of Bologna. Emilia includes the provinces of Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, Modena and part of Ferrara. A portion of Bologna province and, technically, all of Bologna city are Emilian. But Bologna is the region’s capital, and the Bolognese make a strong point of being neither of Emilia nor Romagna but an entity unto themselves</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Through the centuries, Romagna generally remained under the control of forces outside the region. First it was under the rule of the Roman Empire, then of the Byzantine Empire, and finally of the church as part of the Papal State, which joined Romagna with central Italy. Local noble families periodically wrested away land and gained power, but usually they lost it again, and Romagna remained of Rome and the papacy</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">As a result, today Romagna’s food is more unified than Emilia’s, tasting more of central Italy than of the north. Certainly each area of <a id="page6"/>Romagna has its specialties and its own character, but provincial distinctions and the elaborate dishes of old court life are less prominent here than in Emilia. Food in Romagna tends to be more direct and assertive—the everyday and feast-day dishes of townspeople, farmers, and fishermen</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Emilia’s destiny was different. After the Roman Empire crumbled and local lords jousted for rule of the plains and mountains during the Dark Ages, Emilia was divided among a handful of Renaissance families</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">All of Ferrara, Modena and Reggio were ruled by the Este family from 1208 to 1598. Then Ferrara passed to the Pope, and the Este packed up six hundred wagons with three hundred years’ worth of possessions and caravanned across the Po plain to make Modena their new capital. They ruled Modena and Reggio until the mid-1800s, when their alliances with Austria took the last Este duke to Vienna and Modena and Reggio became part of unified Italy</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Parma and Piacenza went from papal possession to a duchy ruled between 1545 and 1732 by the Farnese dukes originally from Rome. They then passed to France, Austria, and finally joined the Italian unification movement. Those centuries as a center of court for some of the mightiest powers in Europe—as an annex to the 18th-century court of Louis XV, it was known as “the Athens of Italy”—gave Parma’s food its foundations of refinement and finesse</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Bologna, like Romagna, was part of the Papal State. It became a sophisticated trade center and second only to Rome in power. As the seat of Europe’s first university, founded in 1080, Bologna attracted the offspring of the continent’s nobility. Those young students came with their own retainers, bringing to Bologna new dining habits, food preferences, cooking styles and wealth. The university thrives today, and the city still bustles as an important trade center</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Bologna has three titles in Italy. She is called Bologna the Wise for her fame as a seat of learning. Bologna the Red for her red tiled roofs, russet-colored buildings and, some say, her years of Communist government. Finally, the title every Italian knows is Bologna the Fat, for the wealth of her land and table since the days of the Romans</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Aside from Emilia-Romagna’s geography and history, intangibles formed her character and are at the heart of the development of her gastronomy. Perhaps because of those thousands of years of trade, the <a id="page7"/>people of the region have an openness to the outside world and a winning graciousness with strangers. Both the Romagnoli and the Emiliani seem to have had the rare ability to take whatever was offered by their rulers, conquerors and visitors and then refashion it into something that worked for them. Frequently what was offered was meager indeed, yet the region not only survived, it thrived</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">To this keen sense of survival add an even keener sense of excellence. In Emilia-Romagna there is real joy in creating something extraordinary, whether it be a sheet of pasta dough, a vinegar, a ham or a cheese</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In embracing five hundred years of cooking in the region, this book includes dishes from every level of Emilia-Romagna’s culture. The range is broad and deep, from the stews of pasta and beans that sustained field hands and laborers to the grand gilded pies that crowded the tables of counts, dukes and princes. You will find dishes created centuries ago and modern innovations on those old themes. Famous regional specialties known throughout the world are collected here, along with rare dishes unheard-of away from their home villages. All make superb eating</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">This portrait of Emilia-Romagna begins with the Renaissance, an era that is still a vital and immediate part of the region’s food. People here talk of dining in the 1500s the way Americans mention going out to dinner last week</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The Renaissance had as its status symbols spices and sugar that were used in its banquets of many dishes. The style lingered through the 1600s. But by the mid-1700s meals in Emilia-Romagna had changed. Spices were toned down. Sweet and savory flavors that had mingled in dishes from first courses to last at Renaissance banquets parted company in the 18th century and took their places in specific parts of the menu. The foundations of modern cooking begun during the Renaissance were taking recognizable shape by the late 1700s. Meat ragù sauce over pasta, now one of Emilia-Romagna’s most typical dishes, first appears at this time. The tomato gradually loses its status as a curiosity and is accepted as an ingredient. When Napoleon conquers all of Italy for France, French influence strengthens in Emilia-Romagna</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">By the early 1800s, the scores of dishes that had made up 16th-century banquet menus for the region’s aristocrats had diminished to a mere twenty or thirty. If you were rich you ate foods with French, <a id="page8"/>Austrian, Spanish and Middle European, as well as Italian, names, and you ate meat with abandon. If you were an artisan, professor, landowner, winemaker or merchant, you ate more modest versions of those dishes, with less meat. If you were a field hand, tenant farmer or laborer, the foods of the rich were as distant and exotic as the foods of China. The mainstays of your diet were stews of beans, polenta and seasonal vegetables, with small bits of the cheapest pork cuts flavoring the pot. Meat marked the celebrations of Christmas, Easter and special occasions. Bread was of dark flours. White flour for pasta and bread was attainable for all only with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th century</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In spite of the harsh lines drawn between the classes, the region endured. It has come through centuries of invasions and occupations, internal political upheaval and social rebellion. Today everyone eats, and eats well. Today Emilia-Romagna prospers. And today, perhaps more than ever, she reaches out to strangers with her irresistible openhanded hospitality. “Come join us, come and feast,” she always seems to be saying. In that spirit, and on her behalf, with this cookbook I extend that same invitation to you all</span>.</p>
