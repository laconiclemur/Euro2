<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Veal was the meat of choice of the northern bourgeoisies, and there are many elegant recipes for it. This slow-cooked veal knuckle from the hind leg (the part that is sawed into rounds to make osso buco), with its rich marrow and gelatinous connective tissue, becomes meltingly tender and produces a sumptuous sauce. Ask the butcher to saw off the end of the bone to expose the marrow.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 whole knuckle of veal (about 3½ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 medium carrots, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons (¾ stick) butter</p>
<p class="qun">2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 head of garlic, cloves separated and peeled</p>
<p class="qun">2 thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry, fruity white wine, medium dry sherry, or port, or more if needed</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup veal or chicken stock, or more if needed (or 1 cup water plus ½ bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a large ovenproof casserole or flameproof roasting pan over medium heat. Brown the veal knuckle on all sides, then remove it. Add the onion, carrots, and butter to the pot and cook over low heat, stirring, for about 7 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, or until they soften.</p>
<p class="summary">Return the meat to the pot, along with the garlic and thyme, and season with salt and pepper. Pour in the wine and stock (or water and bouillon cube) and bring to a boil. Cover with a lid or foil and cook in a preheated 350°F oven for 2½ to 3 hours, until the meat is very tender, turning it at least once and adding a little more wine and/or stock if the liquid evaporates too quickly.</p>
<p class="summary">Take out the casserole or roasting pan and turn the oven up to 425°F. Lift out the meat, remove the sprigs of thyme, and pour the sauce and vegetables, into a saucepan. Return the meat to the empty casserole or roasting pan and cook in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until it is crisp and brown on the outside but still moist inside. Meanwhile, blend the sauce to a cream with an immersion blender, and reduce to a thick glaze over low heat.</p>
<p class="summary">Serve the meat with the sauce poured over it.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary">Instead of roasting the meat, simmer it in the casserole on the stovetop for 2½ to 3 hours. Serve it as it is, without blending the sauce.</p>
