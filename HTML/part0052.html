<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0002958">This recipe is exactly what you need when you’re hungover: it’s very naughty. Ideally, after eating it, you’d go straight back to bed.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">FOR 2</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002959">2 large potatoes</p>

<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002962">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus enough to cook the potatoes and eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002963">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0002964">1 bay leaf</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002968">Peel the potatoes and chop into chip-size pieces (don’t waste any potato trying to make them too perfect, though). Wash the peppers, then halve, deseed and cut into 1cm strips – similar in size to the potatoes. Cut the onion to the same sort of size.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002969">Into a high-sided sauté pan or similar, on a medium-low heat, put enough olive oil to just cover the potatoes (around 2cm). Fry them until golden brown (roughly 5–6 minutes) – you don’t want them to get crispy. Remove the potatoes and set aside. Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the same pan on a medium heat. Add the onions, with some salt and pepper and the bay leaf, and fry until very soft and slightly coloured. Add the peppers and continue cooking until caramelized, then add the potatoes and remove the bay leaf. The potatoes should soak up all the juices in the pan. Don’t mix with a spoon, as it will break the potatoes up, but give the pan a shake to fold everything together. Season and take off the heat.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002970">Put 1cm of olive oil into a pan on a medium heat and crack in the eggs, 2 at a time. Fry until they are crispy at the edges – I like to spoon some of the hot oil over the yolk, so that it cooks slightly but is still runny inside. I also lift up the white around the yolk four times so that the oil can better cook it. When the eggs are golden and crispy at the edges, remove them with a slotted spoon to a paper-lined plate. Season with a tablespoon of olive oil, and some salt and pepper, then cook the next 2 eggs in the same way.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002971">Place the eggs on top of the potatoes, onions and peppers. Drizzle over a final tablespoon of oil, then season with salt and pepper, smoked paprika and vinegar. Slice across the eggs so that they are ‘broken’.</p>
