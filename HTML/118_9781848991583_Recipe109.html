<p class="normal"><b>I have used porgy and fennel more than once in my demonstrations, although in very different ways, because these two ingredients work so well together. It always surprises me so few people cook with them. People tell me they find fennel’s aniseed flavor too strong, or they don’t know how to prepare fennel or don’t normally use this particular fish. That’s a shame, because porgy is very much underrated—it is tasty, sustainable and very affordable, and one is often enough for two people. So, try this delicious, refreshing recipe. It will show you just how light and pleasant this combination can be.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">4 fennel bulbs, as long as possible</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 porgy, about 1¾ pounds each, gills removed, scaled and gutted</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small red onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ tablespoon chopped dill leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 400°F and line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Cut the top one-third off the fennel bulbs and put them in the prepared dish. Peel off the first 2 layers of the remaining fennel bulbs and chop the layers roughly, then add them to the dish.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Melt the butter with the olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the fish and fry 3 to 4 minutes on each side until the skin is light golden brown and slightly crisp. (A little tip—if you’re not too sure how nonstick your pan is, cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan and put it into the hot pan before you add the butter and oil, then cook the fish. The paper will prevent the fish sticking, but it will not be hot enough to catch fire.) Season the fish with salt and pepper, then put it on top of the fennel in the baking dish. Spoon the cooking juices from the skillet over the top of the fish, then roast 12 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, to make the fennel salsa, thinly slice the remaining fennel hearts, using a mandolin if you have one. Put the slices in a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste, then toss together to combine.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> By now, the fish should be ready—insert a knife into the flesh and it should slice through without any resistance. Remove the dish from the oven and leave to rest in a warm place 2 minutes. Serve the fish from the baking dish, with the salsa, allowing people to help themselves. The top fillet will lift off the bone very easily. Next, lift off and discard the whole bone from the tail end upward, revealing the succulent fillet on the other side.</p>
