<p class="h2title">November, or <span class="scalasans">Sacrifice</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">A</span>t 4:05 in the afternoon, Kim Floresca is preparing the sauce for the abalone dish. She peels several pieces of ginger and puts the peel into a <span class="txit">taper</span>. She slices the ginger, then turns and checks a stock she put on the stove top earlier. She walks around the corner to <span class="txit">cuarto frio,</span> grabs the Thermomix, brings it back to her station, and plugs it in. She walks to the other side of the kitchen, gets a jug of mineral water, measures out the proper amount, and adds it and the ginger to the blender cup of the Thermomix, which she covers in plastic wrap. She caps the plastic with a lid and turns the machine on. As it works, she takes another <span class="txit">taper,</span> filled with enoki mushroom stems, to the small refrigerator and comes back with saucepan and whisk. Now she sprints in the other direction to the <span class="txit">plonge</span> and returns with a small colander, laying out all three items in a neat line at her station. She checks on the Thermomix, turns back to the stove, pours water into the saucepan, opens a bottle of sake, and pours some into a cup. Nico interrupts to ask her a question about the sauce he is working on, and she pauses to inspect his labor. Satisfied, she grabs a spoon, turns back to the Thermomix, turns it off, and strains the contents through the colander. The remaining juice goes into the pot. <a id="page_196"/>She drops the used colander into the dishwashing tub stationed beneath the salamander, notes that the tray is full, and carries it to the <span class="txit">plonge,</span> returning with an empty one. She then takes the pot of ginger purée, mixes it with the sake she has measured out, and puts the whole mixture on the flattop to cook. Eduard asks if she’s doing okay. She barely hears him, because by then she is on her way back to <span class="txit">cuarto frio</span> to grab another Thermomix. When she returns, she is also carrying a slab of frozen lardo wrapped in parchment. She places them at her station, turns, lifts the lid on the saucepan, and checks the contents. She whisks the ginger purée a bit, then tastes the stock, which is quietly simmering beneath its paper lid in another pot. She turns back to the slab on the counter, picks up her knife, and carefully begins to slice. The lardo is hard enough to make slicing difficult, so she turns to heat her knife on the flattop. First, however, she stirs the ginger purée again. With the knife hot, she turns back to the lardo, cutting the slab into paper-thin slices, which she sets aside. She dips her spoon into the ginger purée and tastes, then returns <a id="page_197"/>to slicing the lardo. Once she has enough, she wraps up the remainder in its parchment, then covers that with plastic wrap. Using the blade of the same knife, she bruises a handful of lemongrass bulbs, then adds them to the saucepan. After stirring it a few times, she takes the ginger purée off the heat, covers it, and takes it to the refrigerator, along with the unused lardo. She takes the slices she has just carved and dices them into cubes. She has done all this in the span of five minutes; the time is now 4:10. Oriol looks over at her and shakes his head in wonder. “You’re a machine, Kim.”</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">By November, everyone is coasting. The long months really have turned the stagiaires into a kind of machine, each person knowing exactly where he or she should be at a given time and exactly what to do. They have learned not to look at the clock when making the lentils and have developed a rich vocabulary of glances and smirks that silently communicate their frustrations and jokes. By now they have learned exactly how much work they must do to keep Eugeni’s ire in check and, conversely, how much they can get away with not doing. Everyone still makes sure to put cloths under the cutting boards, smell shellfish after opening it, and wipe down the counters obsessively. But wiping out the <span class="txit">tapers</span> before using them? Not so much. Other minor rules have also fallen by the wayside. Diego has shaved his head into a kind of flat Mohawk and, in contraindication of the rule against facial hair, has grown a soul patch; he looks like a Hare Krishna hipster. Iosu, who has moved from <span class="txit">cuarto frio</span> to the center table, where his habit of talking to himself drives Emma crazy, is openly scornful of his chefs; criticized or even just given instructions, he will smirk at Eduard and talk back, though always out of earshot. And Lucho, who has been working for more than a month now as Eugeni’s assistant on the center table—his job, he says, “is to make sure everyone has what he needs so that no one ever has to stop”—has earned himself a bit of a reputation as a delegator: there are some tasks now that, when assigned to him, he quietly refuses to do, passing them along instead to more recently arrived stagiaires. The chefs try to stem <a id="page_198"/>the decline but have only sporadic success. One morning Oriol chastises the brigade for failing to clean a cart during the past five days; Eugeni stops Frederico as he carries a plastic tray from the <span class="txit">plonge</span> in one hand, warning him that he is going to drip water on the floor. Frederico looks at the tray, then looks at the floor; both are perfectly dry. Eugeni doesn’t care. “Trays are carried in two hands,” he says, though without, perhaps, the same conviction as before. The chefs too are exhausted.</p>
<p class="indent">For some, this mild relaxation of the rules is liberating, a freedom from the rigidity and the uncomfortable sense of being always on edge that marked the early months of the <span class="txit">stage</span>. For others, it’s a disappointment. Having learned that no one appreciates his corrections and least of all his outrage when he finds foods improperly wrapped in the walk-in, Sunny has resigned himself to just getting by. “I find myself not caring or not making the extra effort because no one cares if I do,” he says. “I hope it doesn’t change me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now that the season is winding down, there are also a lot more short-term stagiaires and even casual visitors in the kitchen. Two Austrian cooks who have won an award—their prize is to spend a week working at elBulli—show up for two days but then, apparently put off by the tedious nature of the work, disappear. Cooks from other restaurants come for a few days to pick up new techniques. If they’re young and fairly inexperienced, like Ainhoa from Sant Pau and Pilar from El Celler de Can Roca, they are put on the center table to work along with the other stagiaires. But one set of visitors, the entire crew of the Japanese restaurant Shunka in Barcelona (“The best nigiri in Europe!” Ferran says of them), is treated like esteemed guests. For two days in November, they are given the full run of the kitchen and allowed to observe what they like. They stand as erect as military recruits, their hands clasped politely before them, as Oriol demonstrates the sunset-colored sheet that is pressed trout eggs and Mateu shows them how to spin sugar on a drill bit for the <span class="txit">muelle</span>. Occasionally Ferran will pop over to interrogate them, asking their opinion, for example, about the soy milk the restaurant is making. “Here, taste this,” he says, handing the head chef a slice of tofu from a package that was bought earlier that day in Barcelona. “It’s the <a id="page_199"/>best in the world.” The chef takes a bite, then nods his head politely. “Actually, there’s one other that’s better,” he says hesitantly. Even Ferran must concede to the occasional greater authority; he calls Eduard over and has him write down the name.</p>
<p class="indent">The restaurant is also populated these days by cooks who did <span class="txit">stage</span>s at elBulli in earlier years and have since gone on to hold jobs in other kitchens. With a lifetime invitation to return, they come to brush up on their skills and to see the latest innovations. Rubén García, the chef de cuisine at José Andrés’s minibar, comes for a week; Rafael Zafra, who runs the kitchen at the Hacienda Benazuza, the elBulli-affiliated hotel outside Seville, for two. Terry Giacomello, who now works at Quique Dacosta’s restaurant, has been returning for a couple of months each year since finishing his <span class="txit">stage</span> in 2005. With their uneasy status between stagiaire and chef, these visitors tend to alienate the real stagiaires, who resent their presumption (<span class="txit">This is how we did it in my time</span>) and the fact that many of them simply step out of tasks they don’t want to do. But just as the kitchen absorbs the Japanese chefs, it somehow absorbs them, too.</p>
<p class="indent">The kitchen also continues to absorb new dishes, though the pace has slowed considerably. Late in October, for example, it occurred to Eduard that if he cut a cherimoya (a custard apple with green indented skin and a creamy white interior) into thin slices, the flesh looked like crabmeat; now a dish with cherimoya and spider crab is on the menu. A new autumn cocktail, made from pomegranate seeds soaked overnight in sweet wine, is also going out. And because Ferran likes for one corner of the chocolate box always to hold something new, Mateu is working on a fantastic new candy that looks exactly like a Parisian chocolate <span class="txit">macaron</span> but yields wobblingly in the mouth—it’s actually a lime-flavored marshmallow, coated with cocoa and filled with a breath-chilling mint chocolate ganache. Although the word has no Spanish translation and does not lend itself easily to a Catalan accent, Ferran is delighted with the marshmallow. <span class="txit">“Este,”</span> he says, <span class="txit">“es el mejor</span> marshmallow <span class="txit">del mundo.”</span></p>
<p class="indent">Officially, though, the 2009 menu is closed and any dishes developed from this point on are for 2010. Oriol is now at work compiling the year’s catalogue. “It’s been a good year,” he says, “very poetic.” Flipping <a id="page_200"/>through the pages of the blue binder, he comments on its importance. “This is where ideas come from. When you sit down and go through this, you remember things that didn’t quite work out or think about other alternatives. Writing everything down is monotonous, it’s incredibly boring. But like Ferran says, you have to have monotony to have anarchy.”</p>
<p class="indent">For the moment, Oriol’s own ideas are running toward the anarchic. “Remember the chips we made this year with vanilla? They were clear, with black specks,” he says, jabbing a finger at the page. “Looking at this here makes me think, could we do them in black, with white specks? What kind of batter would we need? Or thinking about the game dishes, what if we made a game <span class="txit">macaron</span>? We could use the meat to flavor the meringue, just like we do now with the <span class="txit">bocadillo</span>. And then make an apple ganache as the filling, because fruit goes well with game. But it would be savory, not sweet.” And so he goes, turning pages that represent the better part of a year’s work, and thinking. Two days later, he has produced the <span class="txit">macaron</span>. It won’t be on the menu for at least another year, but it doesn’t matter. “At least now I’ve got the idea.”</p>
<p class="indent">The stagiaires have more practical concerns than game-flavored cookies. With the end of the season just weeks away, they are now uniformly concerned about their immediate futures. About a dozen—including Gaël, Luke, Jacobo, Nico, Diego, Gabriel, and Roger—have asked to be considered for chef de partie positions at elBulli the following year, though so far nobody has a clear idea of how many slots will be open, nor what they’ll do in the intervening six months. Javier, one of the stagiaires who replaced the three who left abruptly in the first month, has made it clear to the others that he doesn’t want to work at elBulli because he doesn’t like the food. Others too have decided that they’d like to master a new form of cooking. Andrea is one of them; although she wants to stay in Spain, she’d rather be working someplace else. She has met a chef, Paco Pérez, whose restaurant Miramar is a few miles up the coast and has one star; he’s expressed interest in hiring both her and her husband, Andrés. Andrea is thrilled by the possibility; she’s dying to stay in Spain, and Pérez, she says, “is really special. I can tell by the way he treats us.” But Andrés, who used to work in Hong Kong, is eager to <a id="page_201"/>return to Asia and is applying for jobs in Singapore. Andrea isn’t keen on the idea, but she wants to be with her husband. So she keeps hoping that Pérez will come through with the jobs before Singapore becomes an issue. He has to sponsor them for visas, but thus far he hasn’t completed the paperwork.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">With her ramrod posture, her unflagging discipline, and the long black hair that she always wears in a tightly coiled bun—even on days off—it’s easy to see that Kim is a woman with the military in her past. Indeed, her father worked for most of his career building reconnaissance computer systems for the U.S. Air Force, moving his family around several times as he was transferred from base to base. He insisted on strict discipline for his entire family. “If he said we were leaving at nine o’clock, then you were there, ready to go at 8:59,” recalls Kim. Her parents met while her mother was working at a base hospital, her relatives all have at least one member of the family in the military, and her sister enlisted right out of college. “Everybody assumed I would do the same thing,” she says. “<span class="txit">I</span> assumed I would do the same thing.”</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, while she was in high school Kim visited several recruiting offices in preparation for her presumed career. But something always something held her back. Her family never cared much about food; her mother, she says diplomatically, “makes some things well,” and her father doesn’t cook at all. They did enjoy the local cuisine during the time they were stationed in Germany, but while Kim was growing up, none of the family spent much time cooking or eating out. Still, from an early age she was fascinated with a couple of shows on the Food Network, and she clearly remembers standing in the kitchen one day with a box of cake mix, a can of whipped cream, and some chocolate sauce and narrating her actions to an imaginary television audience as she pretended to whip up a “gourmet” cake for the cameras. Much to her embarrassment—and her family’s continued delight—her father and sister were listening outside the door. That year, her dad gave her a chef’s coat for Christmas.</p>
<p class="indent">By the time Kim decided to go to culinary school, her father had <a id="page_202"/>retired from the military and was working for Hewlett-Packard and the family was living in a California town about half an hour from Lake Tahoe. She visited a school that was opening in Roseville, not too far away, and, while she was there, met the pastry chef. He was busy working on a confectionary statue of Eve (as in Adam and) that amazed Kim. “I didn’t know you could do that—express emotion in a face made of white chocolate,” she recalls. “I said right then, ‘I want to do this.’” She started classes and, when summer came around, took an externship as part of her degree at the Ritz-Carlton hotel on Amelia Island, in Florida. But she hadn’t been there more than a couple of weeks when she received word that her school, still in its first year, had closed for lack of financing. Scrambling to find another place so she wouldn’t lose her credits, she found a culinary program at American River College in Sacramento. One of her chefs from the previous school was working there at the time and convinced the administration to admit her, even though it was the middle of the year. Her new school required a daily three-hour drive in each direction, but her father’s office wasn’t far away and the two decided to carpool together. With the ingrained aversion to even potential lateness inculcated by years of military life, they would leave home at 3:30 <small>A.M.</small> and arrive in Sacramento just as the sun was coming up. More often than not, they had time to stop by a market or café one or the other of them wanted to explore. In the evening, before undertaking the return trip, they tried new restaurants. Her father had always taken his children apple picking and fishing, and those daily drives turned into another opportunity to bond over food.</p>
<p class="indent">Food wasn’t just a means of connection; it also became an arena in which she could express some of her values: the ingrained sense of discipline, the desire for competency above all else. It became, in other words, a place no less efficient than the military for proving herself. In her new classes, Kim excelled, bringing a steely exactitude to every task from turning vegetables to taking out the trash. Within a few months her chefs encouraged her to join the school’s culinary team competing in the Junior Culinary Olympics that year in Las Vegas. She took their advice, was quickly promoted to team captain, and led her team to fourth <a id="page_203"/>place—not bad for someone with only a few months of culinary training behind her.</p>
<p class="indent">When she finished school, Kim took another externship, this one at the Broadmoor, a stately old hotel in Denver, Colorado. Within a few months she had done so well that she was offered a job as a line cook. One of her colleagues at the time describes her as “the most committed and driven cook I’ve known. She really is an archetype with her laserlike focus and singularity of vision.” She was excited by the work of her chef, Rick Aco. “It was the first time that I saw dishes that weren’t made according to some old, hidebound set of rules,” she recalls. “It was where I saw what cooking can be—how it can be an expression of free will.” Noting her enthusiasm, Chef Aco introduced her to Daniel Ryan, a like-minded cook working in another Broadmoor restaurant. Within six months they were living together. “We just knew,” she says. For her part, Kim was drawn to Dan’s certainty, his drive. “He knew what he wanted and how to go about getting it,” she says. “Plus I had never met anyone who loved food as much as I did.” The two spent their time off poring over cookbooks; Thomas Keller’s <span class="txit">French Laundry Cookbook</span> was a favorite. They began planning their careers together.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">In comparison with other restaurants, the hours at elBulli are not particularly onerous. In general, the restaurant is open only five days a week, and after one of the monthly ten-day stretches, a luxurious four days off follow. Furthermore, since 2001, the restaurant has served only one meal a day. “I remember when we were doing lunch and dinner,” says former stagiaire Roberto Gónzalez. “You would finish service at one or two in the morning, and it would take you half an hour to get home. You’d have to leave at eight thirty to be back in time for mise. Half the staff wouldn’t take off their clothes at night because it saved time—you’d roll out of bed and go. It was insane.” These days, with roughly twelve hours off between the end of one workday and the start of another, the stagiaires have time between shifts to do laundry and go out for breakfast. They no longer sleep in their clothes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_204"/>But if the stagiaires have something approximating a normal work life, the same cannot be said of the restaurant’s chefs. During the six months that elBulli is open, Ferran is there practically every day and night. “This is definitely not normal,” he says with that raised finger. “How many chefs do you know who are always in their kitchen?” He has a point. Most chefs who enjoy even a modicum of Adrià’s renown spend far more time these days doing media appearances and traveling among their various restaurants than cooking. So common is their absence that the Tom Colicchios and Alain Ducasses of this world make news precisely when they go back <span class="txit">into</span> the kitchen. But Ferran realizes that a diner who spends years trying to get a reservation isn’t going to be pleased if, when she finally arrives, the chef is not in the kitchen. On the few days during the season when he has to absent himself, Ferran makes sure his staff knew why he is gone. “It’s the tenth anniversary of Sant Pau,” he says one day as he prepares to leave, referring to Carme Ruscalleda’s three-star restaurant an hour down the coast. “I wouldn’t go if it were for the prime minister. But for Carme . . .”</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran also maintains that the level of exactitude of elBulli’s cuisine requires his presence. “If not,” he says, “you lose the rhythm.” Here too he may have a point. On the day Ferran leaves for the Sant Pau celebration, Tato, who was a stagiaire the year before and has returned to refresh his skills after months working for Martín Berasategui, interrupts his lentil making at the center table to peel and eat a tangerine. Eduard catches him and calls him on it, but a few minutes later, Tato insolently puts more slices of fruit in his mouth between squeezes of the syringe. The chefs too are visibly more relaxed. Oriol, who usually delivers his wisecracks in whispered asides, is almost giddy. Even Eduard smiles more, and when a cook comments on how he seems more relaxed when Ferran is gone, he actually winks. “You think?”</p>
<p class="indent">Oriol and Eduard sacrifice the most during the season. Mateu works just as hard, and his hours are just as long, but he at least is from Roses, and at the end of each day he goes home to his family. Oriol and Eduard, however, live about an hour south of Barcelona, a three-hour drive from the restaurant. While elBulli is open, they live at the restaurant in <a id="page_205"/>a room tucked between the staff dressing room and the staff bathrooms. (Ferran says he lives at the restaurant as well, but he means it a bit more metaphorically: he and his wife, Isabel, have a comfortable home across the street that they bought from elBulli’s original owner, Marketta.) The room that Oriol and Eduard share is small and cluttered, littered with cigarette butts and furnished with little more than a couple of mattresses and a desk. The two chefs shower in the staff bathroom and get their morning coffee in the restaurant. If they eat any meals besides staff dinner, no one ever sees them do it. In summer, the breezes off the coast keep their room reasonably comfortable, but because this year the restaurant is open for the first time in the fall and early winter, the two chefs find themselves struggling to keep warm. They bring in a space heater, but it hardly suffices against temperatures that occasionally drop into the low forties. Some nights, it’s bad enough that Oriol goes into town and sleeps on Eugeni’s sofa. Eduard stays at the restaurant and shivers through the night.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s no wonder, then, that as soon as soon as the last service before a break ends, Oriol and Eduard are in the car, heading south—even if it’s two in the morning and they won’t arrive home until 5 <small>A.M.</small> When Eduard goes home, he stays with his parents, though lately he’s been going to Barcelona instead to visit his girlfriend. Oriol’s case is more difficult, as he has a four-year-old daughter and his wife, a nurse, is pregnant with their son. They have never really considered uprooting themselves to Roses, because his wife’s job is in Tarragona, as are her parents, who provide much-needed child care. Instead, Oriol spends six months away from his little girl, Julia, who doesn’t take his absence lightly. He calls home every night, but lately she’s been in a punitive mood and refuses to speak to him. One night his wife tells him that Julia woke the previous evening because she heard a noise and thought it was her daddy coming home. He runs a hand through his hair as he recounts this. Oriol wasn’t home the first time the new baby, a boy they will name after his father, kicked in the womb or when his daughter began telling everyone she met, “My brother’s name is Oriol.”</p>
<p class="indent">Living at the restaurant is not their only sacrifice. In the ten or <a id="page_206"/>fifteen years that Oriol and Eduard have worked at elBulli, Ferran has mellowed considerably, but they still bear the brunt of his anger when anything goes wrong and get little of the credit when it goes right. In exchange, they get a reasonable but not extravagant salary, the chance to work at the top of their field, and Adrià’s gratitude—Ferran frequently says that without Oriol, Eduard, and Mateu, he could not run elBulli and that he doesn’t have it in him to train a new set of chefs. Their situation is not wholly different from that of any chef de cuisine who runs the kitchen for a famous executive chef: they do the grunt work, he gets the glory. Like unsung chefs everywhere, the names of Oriol Castro and Eduard Xatruch are known to few outside the innermost culinary circles. But their loyalty—to Ferran, to elBulli—is remarkable in a profession where a young chef is expected to move on. Ferran knows it: “The idea that someone would stay for ten years, like Eduard or Oriol—that’s not going to happen anymore. Nowadays, if someone stays for a year, it’s a long time.” Asked why they do it, each shrugs with a gesture that is part embarrassment, part conviction that the interrogator wouldn’t understand. They both swear that it doesn’t bother them that their names aren’t known and, like Mateu, emphasize that they wouldn’t rather have their own restaurant or be their own boss. “This way, I’m a part of history,” Eduard says.</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of their careers, few of the stagiaires will be asked to make the kind of sacrifices that the chefs at elBulli have made. But there will still be sacrifices, many of them significant. Christmas Eves and Valentine’s Days will be permanently surrendered. Nights and weekends will go, too, making it nearly impossible to have a normal relationship, simply because their work schedules will prevent them from ever seeing their partners. Twelve hours of physical labor a day takes a toll on chefs’ bodies: herniated disks, bad knees, varicose veins—to say nothing of the psychic pressure that working under stressful conditions produces. Even after they have worked hard enough and been lucky enough to own or run their own restaurants, with their own chefs de cuisine and partie below them to take care of the daily operations, they will still bear the ultimate responsibility. They will go in on their days off when a sous <a id="page_207"/>chef calls in sick or turns up in jail and be blamed for bad reviews. Their marriages will be likelier to fail, their businesses will be likelier to go bankrupt, their chances of becoming an alcoholic will be higher by far than those of the average population.</p>
<p class="indent">Easing the sacrifice just a bit is the second family that forms in almost any restaurant kitchen. A sense of shared purpose can deepen the connection among cooks, but in its essence forms simply from proximity: fourteen hours a day spent together working, cut off from the rest of the world (no cell phones in the kitchen!) and in situations of immense stress. Both the bonds and the rivalries can be intense.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Dan’s background was very different from Kim’s. Instead of frequent moves and exposure to new cultures, he lived until age eighteen in one house in Baltimore, Maryland. Instead of a strong father figure, his mother played the pivotal role in his life; his father died when he was four. And instead of the military rigor and discipline that marked Kim’s family, Dan’s was a much looser entity. As a full-time school nurse, his mother would still be at work when he got home from school, so Dan took care of himself much of the time. Something of a loner, he didn’t get along with his brother, a few years older, who was much more sociable and into guns and other macho pursuits (he would eventually become a security cop) that didn’t interest Dan. No one had much time for or interest in meals—the family ate at McDonald’s four days a week (and, except for Dan, was overweight as a result). Still, they had lunch every Sunday at Dan’s grandmother’s house, along with a dozen or so other relatives. “It was the typical dysfunctional Italian family dinner,” he says wryly. Nevertheless, the attention his grandmother lavished on the meal was enough to provoke his first spark of culinary interest. “Sometimes I would make macaroni and cheese for when my mom got home. Or I’d marinate chicken breasts in Italian dressing and bake them.” His cooking skills weren’t highly developed or even encouraged, but that faint flicker of interest would save him.</p>
<p class="indent">Dan is a smart guy, but by his teens he was doing poorly in school <a id="page_208"/>and regularly getting into trouble outside of it—including a few run-ins with the law. But when he heard about a culinary school at the local college, he saw a way out of his downward spiral. He was accepted into the program and moved away from home to live in a dormitory. And much to everyone’s surprise, including his own, he did well, becoming a serious student. “After all the partying I had done, dorm life was tame,” he says. “And for the first time, I was really into what I was learning.”</p>
<p class="indent">When Dan finished school, he began working immediately, and eventually got a job at the Broadmoor. By then he was interested in avant-garde cuisine, and his ambitions had grown. Soon after he and Kim began dating, he told her about a restaurant he had heard of in Chicago, which was being run by an elBulli alumnus who was doing really exciting things. It wasn’t long before Dan had a job at Alinea and Kim was working at Rick Tramonto’s progressive French restaurant, Tru. Cooking at two of the best restaurants in Chicago, both were happy—especially Dan, who liked how at Alinea, the savory and pastry kitchens weren’t treated as wholly separate entities. But within eighteen months, ambition and a desire to expose themselves to other chefs and other styles of cooking spurred them to move again, this time to New York. Once there, Kim worked as a line cook at what was considered perhaps the best restaurant in the city, Per Se, while Dan moved through a series of jobs, helping open Eleven Madison Park (whose chef, Daniel Humm, would go on to win the 2010 James Beard award for best in New York), then working briefly for Daniel Boulud, before finally landing at Alain Ducasse’s ill-fated restaurant at the Essex House hotel. They had, in the end, opposite responses to the experience. Kim loved her work at Per Se, especially the restaurant’s devotion to precision and dedication to the pursuit of perfection—they even had video screens mounted so that the chefs at the French Laundry could monitor what was happening in New York. She did not, however, like living in Manhattan. Dan, on the other hand, adored the city but was unhappy with all of the jobs he took there. When they discovered they’d won yearlong scholarships from ICEX, the Spanish bureau of international commerce, that included <a id="page_209"/><span class="txit">stages</span> at elBulli, it seemed the perfect opportunity to make another change.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, they had tried before to work at elBulli. The first year, Kim was offered the position, the second year Dan was, but they never managed to coincide, and because they were committed to staying together, they declined the offers. It wasn’t until the ICEX award, which pays its fellows’ expenses as they <span class="txit">stage</span> in some of the country’s top restaurants, that they were able to coordinate joint positions: Dan in pastry, Kim in the savory kitchen. And because they wanted the full elBulli experience, they asked if they could stay on until the season ended, the last three months at their own expense. ElBulli accepted the proposal, and Kim and Dan flew to Spain in September 2008. Along with the rest of the fellows, they spent the first two weeks on an organized eating tour of the country’s best restaurants. They got to visit the gardens at Mugaritz near San Sebastián and received a lesson in transforming oysters into shimmering titanium-clad sculptures at El Poblet just north of Valencia. In Segovia’s Mesón de Cándido, they watched servers carve an entire roast suckling pig with a plate to prove its tenderness. At Marbella’s Restaurante Calima, they learned how wunderkind Dani García turns simple gazpacho into a shimmering, ruby-colored “tomato.” In short, they crisscrossed the country, dining daily in some of Spain’s most avant-garde places and some of its most traditional. At each stop, they met the chefs and, in some cases, the producers who supplied them. It was a remarkable amount of fun after all their years of hard work.</p>
<p class="indent">With the trip behind them, Kim and Dan went to work first at Mugaritz, Andoni Luis Aduriz’s two-star restaurant located in a village just outside San Sebastián. Kim in particular was enchanted with the ethos there; the chefs would regularly go out into the woods around the restaurant to forage for herbs. She also liked the fact that Andoni was so warm and approachable. Together she and Dan made a lot of friends, some of whom—Luke, Mizuho, and Begoña—would move with them to elBulli in June.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_210"/>One of the main ways that the kitchen fosters a sense of family is with the daily ritual of a shared meal: every day at 6:30 <small>P.M.</small>, the staff sits down to eat. For the stagiaires, this meal is pretty much the only food they put in their mouths during the twelve or fourteen hours they are at work. Not for them are the pyrotechnics of crisp-baked oblates and frozen foie gras. They eat carbs, and lots of them. Spaghetti with pesto, rice with rabbit, noodles with pork ribs, potato soup. It’s hearty fare, and there’s plenty of it. During the time that Diego is in the small kitchen, he takes it upon himself to step into the main kitchen after everyone is served and seated and cry, “<span class="txit">Buen provecho, señores</span>. There are leftovers for whoever wants seconds.” Inevitably, this little flourish makes the longtime staff roll their eyes, like siblings who kick one another under the table every Thanksgiving when Uncle Leo gets up to tell his famous jokes. But there’s a reason why staff dinner in restaurants is referred to as “family meal.” It is the most obvious enactment of the bond that draws a collection of cooks together, a daily ritual that, like all daily rituals, unites them while it simultaneously reinforces the social order.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="367" src="../images/f0210-01.jpg" width="550"/></p>
<p class="caption">Family meal (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_211"/>In most restaurants, family meal is haphazard. The food itself is usually prepared from whatever items the kitchen has left over from service, a method that can lead—as any cook will tell you—to some decidedly strange dishes. And although servers usually have time to sit down and eat properly, the same is not always true of the kitchen crew. If your mise isn’t done, if your fish has arrived late and still needs to be broken down, you may find yourself gulping down a few mouthfuls as you continue to work at your station. Not all restaurants operate this way; the family meals in Thomas Keller’s Napa places were so well received that they became the foundation of his popular family-style restaurant Ad Hoc. And in the United States, where Latin Americans tend to make up much of the kitchen staff, family meal can often be excellent Mexican or Ecuadoran food. But by and large, family meal is an exercise in improvisation.</p>
<p class="indent">Not at elBulli. Here not only has the process of setting up and breaking down for family meal been systematized, with its assigned seats and dedicated tasks; so has the meal itself. Every platter that feeds the staff is deliberated over, tested, researched, and documented, just as if it were a new star dish on the restaurant’s menu. The restaurant orders specifically for family meal, which means that instead of relying on the spontaneous inspiration of a cook as he throws a bunch of leftovers together in a pot, it must plan in advance what staff meals will be. And elBulli usually plans a year ahead of time. In August 2008, for example, it was already established that on August 19, 2009, the staff would be sitting down to a meal of pasta salad and pork tenderloin with teriyaki sauce—and so it did. Between the blue plastic covers of the family meal notebook are recipes for hundreds of dishes, most of them Spanish or Catalan in origin but some of them reflective of the diverse nationalities of the restaurant’s cooks, as well as the travels of its permanent staff. Thus, although there is a lot of <span class="txit">escudella</span> and artichokes with romesco, there are also chicken with mole sauce, polenta with Gorgonzola, and pork with kaffir lime leaves. In 2009, the very first family meal of the year was gazpacho (strangely made with mayonnaise) and grilled fish; the last was teriyaki ribs.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_212"/>For the past few years, Eugeni has been in charge of both preparing and documenting the family meals, and he keeps intimate track of every detail associated with them. Each dish gets its own sheet, complete with a recipe that details not only quantities and technique but problems to look out for and a photograph of how the finished dish should look. Nothing is left to chance—witness the recipe for a simple dish like grilled sardines:</p>

<p class="noindent">To clean the sardines: 4 hours before dinner, scrape off the scales, gut the fish, and remove the heads. Place on sheets of wax paper, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and return to refrigerator.</p>
<p class="indent">To make the fried garlic: 3 hours before dinner, slice the garlic thinly and fry in olive oil as if they were chips. Drain them on paper towels and set aside. Mix vinegar and the .4 oil and set aside.</p>
<p class="indent">Finishing and presentation: 1 hour before dinner light the plancha and turn to maximum heat. Bring the sardines up to room temperature. 30 minutes before: At exactly six o’clock, start searing the sardines, and, when finished, place them on the platters. Keep them warm, but be careful not to overcook them or let them dry out. At the last moment, mix the garlic chips with oil and vinegar, and drizzle sauce over each platter.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_213"/>In addition to emphasizing exact timing and delineating every step in the cooking process, Eugeni also keeps track of the cost of every family meal, noting it on separate sheets organized by day. ElBulli generally spends between 150 and 180 euros per meal—not bad when you consider it’s feeding seventy-five people. In 2009, the least expensive meal was cauliflower with béchamel and leftover chicken with store-bought mole sauce (113.25 euros total); the most expensive was spaghetti with tomato sauce and a second course of something called “Japanese Fish” (230.70 euros). Both of those numbers include a daily supply of not-very-good bread (10.80 euros), bottled water (36.00 euros), and excellent coffee (8.67 euros), which Debbie Sánchez or another member of the waitstaff makes to order.</p>
<p class="indent">An exceptional degree of quality control rules, and not all staff dishes meet with approval. Eugeni keeps track of meals that just don’t work out, in addition to maintaining a list of family meals the restaurant would like to develop (<span class="txit">cap i pota,</span> a Catalan stew made from the head and feet of pigs; moussaka; and one of Ferran’s sudden inspirations: lentils with cuttlefish). The Spanish potato salad called <span class="txit">ensaladilla rusa</span> was one of the rejects—it took too long to dice the potatoes. Oxtail stew was too expensive. Anything deep-fried was too messy. Ferran wasn’t thrilled with a polenta that went out early in the season: too hard. At the end of the season, they were still debating whether to keep it in the recipe book.</p>
<p class="indent">But the occasional failed polenta aside, Ferran is inordinately proud of elBulli’s family meal. And rightly so—it is mostly delicious food, for which the stagiaires are openly grateful. “How can you teach people about good food if you don’t feed them well?” he asks. “How can you expect them to take care of others if you don’t take care of them?” Should a visiting journalist show up around mealtime, he will be regaled with details of the meal’s extraordinariness. <span class="txit">“No es normal,”</span> Ferran says: it’s not normal that a restaurant actually orders food for its family meal; it’s not normal that several staff people dedicate their first hours of work each day to preparing the meal. Nor is it normal that the chef sits down daily with his staff to eat the same food as they. The only difference between what he eats and what the rest get—a difference that Ferran <a id="page_214"/>does not comment upon but that is obvious to anyone who watches the bar where supplemental items sometimes appear (some leftover ice cream, a few panettoni sent by an Italian admirer) is that the chef <span class="txit">always</span> gets dessert. As the cooks line up in back to be served, he quickly passes the bar, swooping up a slice or two of cake before it runs out.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">At elBulli, they had never seen anyone quite like Kim before. The restaurant has long employed a reasonable number of female stagiaires (though 2009, with its six full-season women and several part-time ones, would be something of a record), and most had proven themselves to be good workers. But Kim was different. She wasn’t just better than the other women, she was better than anyone. Not only did she work cleaner and faster than any other stagiaire—she was able to break down a mackerel in seconds, and her station was as spotless as when she began—but she was methodical in her plating and absolutely precise in her knife skills. Yet for all her obvious talent, she wasn’t arrogant: she was utterly comfortable with her lowly position in the kitchen’s hierarchy. She never bristled at being told what to do, issuing her <span class="txit">oído</span>s with an unflagging enthusiasm that would have made you think she was volunteering for a second ice cream cone rather than agreeing to lug a crate of vegetables back from the walk-in. All the chefs had respect for her, and each one independently used the highest praise they could bestow on a cook. “She’s a machine,” Ferran, Eduard, and Eugeni all marveled.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, in her work ethic she bore a certain resemblance to Eduard, who could most often be seen—chin tucked in, back erect—stoically moving from station to station as he monitored every aspect of the kitchen. Arriving as a stagiaire at elBulli when he was just seventeen after a year in culinary school, Eduard is, in Ferran’s words, the most “Bulliesque” of the chefs, for he truly grew up in its kitchen. Now twenty-nine, he plays bad cop to Oriol’s good one. Strict and often critical with the stagiaires, an attitude that derives from his role as the person ultimately responsible for ensuring that the kitchen runs properly, Eduard is highly disciplined in his own work. He expects those around him to show the <a id="page_215"/>same degree of dedication and frequently gets annoyed when they do not. But because he himself never hesitates to take on a job if it needs doing—even jumping onto the center table at times if a particular task isn’t going quickly enough—the stagiaires have respect for him. “Eduard has a shitty job, the hardest one in the restaurant,” says Nico. “But he does it really well.”</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="446" src="../images/f0215-01.jpg" width="314"/></p>
<p class="caption">Eduard Xatruch checks the evening’s menus (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Despite her similarities to Eduard, Kim gets along especially well with Oriol. More than anyone else in the kitchen, he shares her adolescent sense of humor. In the moments when Ferran is out of the kitchen, he sidles up to her and punches her amicably in the arm, before delivering a scatological joke. Inevitably, she gives him a fish-eyed look of appalled disgust before bursting into giggles. Kim likes to think of herself as one of the boys (she once confessed to being initially suspicious of Emma because the latter dresses “like such a girly girl” outside work), and her jokes, which are often filthy and sarcastic, add to that impression. <a id="page_216"/>Coupled with her tight bun and her tighter discipline, the tendency can make her seem sharp, even a little mean. For many weeks, in fact, Katie was convinced that she and Kim would never be friends. Yet beneath the tough exterior, Kim is quite warm, as given to mocking herself as others, and concerned with the welfare of those around her (she and Katie did indeed become closer). In fact, the only kitchen rule she breaks regularly is to slip other cooks a bite of food.</p>
<p class="indent">Kim’s talents were tested early in the season. Luis Arrufat, who had worked at elBulli for four years and was now chef de partie for Starters I, learned in early July that his mother was gravely ill. The restaurant offered to let him go home right away, but he wanted to stay as long as he could. At the very least, he said, he wanted to help train someone to take over his station. Although Nico had been his assistant on Starters since the first week, it was Kim who was now put in charge of it. Just weeks into her <span class="txit">stage,</span> she was moved from the center table and began learning the dishes that came out of Luis’s station. Nico was not pleased. “At the beginning,” he recalls, “I hated her. <span class="txit">I</span> was Luis’ first assistant, <span class="txit">I</span> knew all the dishes. I was, like, Who do you think you are? I was really annoyed.”</p>
<p class="indent">But Kim won him over with her attitude. She didn’t delegate, for one thing, leaving him the tedious tasks while saving the more appealing ones for herself. And she didn’t order him around; she asked. “We shared everything,” Nico says. “We were really a team.” It didn’t hurt that Nico shared Kim’s sardonic wit and her skeptical view of the world. It wasn’t uncommon to see them playfully shoving each other and joking under their breath. Within a few days, Nico started thinking that maybe she had been the right choice after all. She certainly had the organizational skills; suddenly it was her job to look over the tickets in the morning, count the number of dishes “sold,” and make sure she did sufficient mise en place to cover them. It was her job too to memorize the recipes of anywhere from eight to twelve dishes at a time, from the relatively simple shrimp in two cookings (the head and torso of the crustacean deep-fried, the tail barely poached) to the complex abalone, which was scored and grilled so it looked like a three-dimensional checkerboard and served on a bed of enoki mushrooms and carefully trimmed codium seaweed made to look <a id="page_217"/>like a small heap of <span class="txit">fideuá</span>—the Catalan paella made from noodles. “The amazing thing about her is that she’s not only watching over her own work, she’s looking after the rest of the restaurant too,” Nico says. “I have to learn to do that.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s good she was so competent, because Luis’s mother soon died and he left for the funeral, leaving Kim alone at the helm of Starters I. From the first, she performed brilliantly. Her dishes were, if anything, even more precise than Luis’s had been, and they issued from her station with regimented timing. Even when Ferran and Oriol decided, a few days into her new position, to add a new dish, tempura potatoes, to her responsibilities, she performed admirably. Actually, “decided” is too deliberate a word for a process that began with their trying to come up with something to do with the tiny speckled potatoes that had sat on the pass for a week and ended, just as service was beginning, with the exclamation “Hey, that’s good! Let’s send it out tonight!”</p>
<p class="indent">It fell to Kim to get Oriol to explain the recipe to her step by step one night around 7:30 while she frantically took notes. Before she knew it, it was time to start frying the potatoes, which were served with a spicy kimchi in an elBulli take on the classic dish of <span class="txit">patatas bravas,</span> fried potatoes with hot sauce. As she prepared the first few batches, following only the sketchy instructions hurriedly issued by Oriol, she had to check in several times with Andrea and pump her for more details about how the potatoes should be made. In the end, all of the potatoes came out fine—perfectly fried and right on time—and to look at Kim’s calm face as she prepared them, you would have thought that she was the picture of control. But to her, it felt as if she had descended into utter chaos. “That was bad,” she said with a disappointed frown. “I like to know ahead of time what I’m supposed to be doing.”</p>
<p class="indent">About ten days after she had taken over the station, Luis Arrufat returned to the restaurant. With his mother’s funeral behind him, he had thought that work would be the best cure for his grief. His return came as a complete surprise to Kim, and for a day or so there was a bit of uncomfortable jostling as the two figured out their respective roles. But Luis was tired of being a line cook and was more than happy to <a id="page_218"/>surrender his post to Kim; instead, he would be a floating chef de partie, ready to jump into any station as needed. The job at Starters I was Kim’s for the season.</p>
<p class="indent">It was gratifying news but also a little worrisome, because it meant that she was now permanently in charge. For all her competency, Kim had doubts about her abilities. For one, she didn’t always trust her own palate. Frequently she would taste a sauce she had just made, then call over a chef to tell her if it was done correctly. But she was also worried about her new role as a manager of other people. Everything in her life had taught her how to take orders. What she didn’t know was how to give them. During service, the other chefs de partie would grab stagiaires as they needed them, shoving garnishes at them and telling them what to plate when. But Kim found she had a hard time ordering people around and tended to do things herself rather than have to tell someone else to do it. At elBulli, however, there was just too much to do; for her to plate everything herself meant she wasn’t there to finish one dish or start another. “I told her she just had to be a bitch, grab people, order them around,” Nico says. “But she said, no, she prefers to work as a team.” Accustomed to solving problems by herself (a surfeit of tasks meant she just had to work harder), she was hesitant to depend on anyone else, even though she was quick to lend a hand should anyone else need help. “I’m not good at leadership,” she says simply. Yet she knew that she would one day be called upon to exercise it. Although they were working well together, she recognized that she might have to bear down on Nico one day; with his attitude and his pants bagging halfway down his backside, he didn’t always share her impeccable work ethic. What would happen then? she wondered. Would she be up to the task? And if she wasn’t, did she really have any business being chef de partie?</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">The kitchen’s second family balances, to some degree, the pressure that the restaurant puts on everyone’s first, or real, family, although the tension never completely disappears. Luca feels it acutely during his time at elBulli—his girlfriend, to whom he thinks of proposing, grows <a id="page_219"/>ever more unhappy as the months pass. It’s why Miguel Alexander, with his pregnant girlfriend waiting for him in Venezuela, decides to leave. Even Katie, so upbeat and competent, feels the tension. About two months after she and Felix become engaged and one after her mother comes to Spain to help scout reception locations, Katie decides to postpone the wedding. “It was too much,” she explains. “Working here every day, thinking about our own restaurant, and then planning a wedding on top of it all? I was going a little crazy.” The news is greeted with disappointment and a little skepticism by Felix’s family, who were looking forward to a May celebration in their hometown, but Katie is sure they made the right decision. “I feel so relieved now,” she confesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Katie is lucky that Felix is in the same industry as she; someone outside it might not have been as understanding. Yet it is probably not an accident that all of the women at elBulli either arrive with or find there partners in the same field. “Where else do you have time to meet anyone?” Katie asks. She met Felix through José Andrés’s restaurant. Begoña is dating a fellow cook at Mugaritz. Emma and Laia both find boyfriends among the cooks at elBulli. Andrea met Andrés in culinary school; they married in 2008. “It makes sense,” says Andrea. “All we do is talk about food, and who besides another cook would want to do that?” Even for those who aren’t involved with other cooks, the restaurant has played a matchmaking role. Eduard’s girlfriend is a journalist, but they met when she interviewed Ferran on a trip to Japan. Oriol’s wife, Julia, works in a hospital, but even she is connected to elBulli—they met when he got sick from some bad shellfish served at family meal and had to go to the hospital. She was the nurse who treated him.</p>
<p class="indent">For heterosexual men, the likelihood of finding a partner in the kitchen has increased with the growing number of women entering the profession. Nevertheless, the ratio of men to women in the kitchen remains highly unbalanced. Especially at the upper levels of the hierarchy, the percentage of women who are executive chefs or chefs de cuisine in the United States and Europe remains remarkably low (the U.S. Department of Labor puts it at 20.7 percent), and the percentage of world-class or, to be blunt, famous female chefs is lower still. Out <a id="page_220"/>of eighty-five three-star restaurants in the world, only five are helmed by women, and on <span class="txit">Restaurant Magazine</span>’s ranking of the 50 Best Restaurants in the world, only two women make the list. Even at the lower levels of the industry, the numbers remain troubling; although the percentage of women enrolled in all culinary schools in the United States is now almost equal to that of men, the ratio of men to women at the most prestigious school, the Culinary Institute of America, is still seven to three. People within the industry give all kinds of reasons for the disparity, from the physical difficulty of lifting heavy pots to the long hours that make a stable family life, especially with children, nearly impossible. But in these excuses, cooking is little different from surgery or airplane pilotry; they mask what is, quite simply, sexism and another source of pressure for those cooks who happen to be female. Despite, or most likely precisely because of, home cooking’s reputation as a “feminine” craft, the world of the professional cook has long excluded women; in fact, the first chefs’ guilds in Europe specifically banned women from practicing. Certainly the macho, take-no-prisoners culture of the professional kitchen doesn’t lend itself to respectful sexual equality. Nor does it consist solely of practical jokes and talking smack; it also includes serious issues of pay and promotion. When Kim was working at the Broadmoor, for example, she discovered that a male cook, with the same skill level and less experience, was earning $30 a day more than she was. She approached her chef to complain, but he stalled her. “I said, ‘This is bullshit—either you give me a raise, or I’ll walk,’” Kim recalls. “He said, ‘Well . . . ’ and I said, ‘There’s no well. I’ll walk.’” She got her raise.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the rigor with which it is run, it is hard to imagine a kitchen more open to women than elBulli. Most of the things that make up the salacious bits of the average chef memoir—the off-color humor, the hazing, the fornicating in the walk-in—simply have no place in Ferran’s restaurant (it’s hard to fit in fornication when you have to ask permission to go to the bathroom). The hours are, by industry standards, reasonable. Men and women alike strip down to their underwear in the single cramped dressing room, like professional dancers who are <a id="page_221"/>so accustomed to the proximity of each other’s bodies that they barely notice when they’re undressed. And, as Kim’s situation illustrates, the restaurant has no problem promoting talented women.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, the female stagiaires struggle with what they take to be softer prejudices. Emma has followed instructions and makes sure she comes back from a trip to the <span class="txit">plonge</span> by carrying a crate of water bottles, but when Eugeni sees her lugging that much weight, he is immediately on her, reminding the stagiaires that if something is heavy, they should get another person to help. Andrea notices that the chefs are nicer when they yell at women than at men. Katie feels that Mateu is more solicitous of her and Mizuho than he is of the male chefs. Kim notices it too. She was the object of a lot of teasing when she was promoted, thanks to the politeness with which the chefs treated her in her new role. “The other guys would imitate Oriol and Eduard whenever Kim was around,” recalls Andrea. “They were always saying in these cooing voices, ‘<span class="txit">Muy bien, Kim, muy bien</span>.’” Kim is hardly oblivious to the treatment. “Eduard was obviously brought up by a good mom,” she says. “One day Sergio started putting in his order and Eduard stopped him and said, ‘Where’s Kim? She goes first.’ It’s good manners, I guess, but please don’t single me out. I feel like all my coworkers are thinking I’m getting special treatment.”</p>
<p class="indent">All of the women at elBulli live in mortal fear of doing the one thing for which women are notoriously blamed: crying in the kitchen. Katie, Begoña, Emma, and Andrea have all done it, either at elBulli or another restaurant, but they all hate themselves for it. “Look, it’s what women do,” says Andrea. “Men yell, women cry. But it’s terrible when it happens, because it makes you look weak.” Kim alone will not allow herself to break. “There’s good and bad side to the sexism,” she says. “The bad is when women live up to their stereotypes, when you have girls on the line that are really girly. You look at them and think, ‘C’mon, did you really just cry on the line?’ But the good is that people often have lower expectations for you, so you can really show them what you can do. And in the process, you knock down their stereotypes.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_222"/>Earlier in the season, Kim, Dan, and the other cooks whose <span class="txit">stages</span> were subsidized by ICEX had spent one Sunday showing off their skills in a cooking competition and demonstrating a bit of what they had learned in the preceding months, both to each other and to the group of critics and culinary experts who made up the jury. They had been sent a list of products—all of them, from Andalusian olive oil to La Mancha purple garlic, indigenous to Spain—and were told to choose three to feature in their dish. From the moment he heard about it, Ferran had Oriol and Eduard help Kim develop her dish. She would come in early and they would do test runs, trying out ingredients, experimenting with platings. From the beginning she had wanted to do a modern take on a traditional Spanish dish, and she found herself drawn to the classic cod in green sauce. Originally she imagined a simple dish made from the loin, but under the chefs’ guidance, she found herself working with the more unusual cod tripe. The salsa verde was straightforward—parsley, olive oil, and a fragrant dose of garlic—if you didn’t count the tiny bit of Xantana. And Oriol convinced her to add, instead of the simple boiled potatoes that sometimes accompany the dish, three bacon-scented mochi, the slippery spheres made of spherified foam. On the side, as an added flourish, would go a crisp chicharrón, in this case made of cod skin rather than the pig skin that is normally used. At the morning practice sessions, they would time her (in the contest, she would have an hour to cook) and critique her presentation, and when it came time for her to depart for the competition, they loaded her with some of the restaurant’s very expensive handmade glass plates so that her dish would look as good as possible. The chefs helped Dan, Mizuho, and Ralph as well, offering them tips and supplying them with serving pieces, but it was clearly Kim, the machine, in whom they had invested. “I like all of this, and I’m flattered,” she said. “But it’s not my dish.”</p>
<p class="indent">The contest was held in the kitchen of a culinary school on the outskirts of Madrid. Most of the cooks had become friends during the first weeks of gluttonous travel, so now, even if they hadn’t worked together in the intervening eleven months, there was still an air of happy reunion, <a id="page_223"/>which helped calm nerves and reduced the rivalry among competitors. The next year’s batch of fellows had just arrived in the country, and they also were in the kitchen, helping out where they could and watching their counterparts with various degrees of awe as they wondered if they too would be able to do <span class="txit">that</span> a year from now. In gravity and tension, the competition had nothing on the Bocuse d’Or—it was far too congenial and festive for that—but still, the participants took it seriously.</p>
<p class="indent">At staggered intervals beginning at 11 <small>A.M.</small>, each of the contestants started to cook. Kim had drawn a slot in the middle of the list, so she didn’t begin until noon. She started with her mise, rapidly chopping the parsley and garlic she would need for the sauce and expertly removing the skin from her fish filets. Dan stopped by once to ask if she needed help, but she was so focused, so into herself, that she barely noticed him. She began to spherify her mochi, dropping the foam balls artfully into the alginate bath, a process that drew several impressed bystanders who had never seen the technique before. They asked her questions about it, and although she was right at the critical part of cooking her chicharrones, she managed to answer succinctly and civilly. As she fried off the skin, she moved with the same graceful efficiency that she displayed at elBulli, her eyes focused and expressionless, her movements reduced to a bare minimum. One of the new fellows, Paras Shah, who had worked with Kim briefly at Per Se, was reminded of how impressive a worker she was. “She’s so fucking awesome,” Paras said. “Honestly, there’s nobody else like her.”</p>
<p class="indent">Kim didn’t win. In fact, she didn’t even place in the top three (that honor, to the surprise of everyone at elBulli who had underestimated her, went to Mizuho, who came in third for her green tea sponge cake and green tea ice cream). But for those watching Kim, there was a moment during the competition that was far more revealing than any victory. Minutes after she had presented her dish to the jury and stood for the obligatory photo, she sprinted back to the kitchen to help Daniel with his. It was a complicated dessert with several different components. First was a cocktail made from cava and elderflower syrup, shot through the siphon so that the top layer turned to thick foam. Then came the main <a id="page_224"/>dish, in which Dan carefully interspersed torn pieces of the microwave sponge cake famously invented by Albert (chocolate, in this case), chunks of mango and passion fruit, and various creams and sauces. All told, there were about a dozen different elements, and put together on the plate they looked more like an abstract painting than dessert. One of the elements was supposed to be a small quenelle of ice cream, but the school’s freezer hadn’t been cold enough and the ice cream was too soft to serve. Dan made a fast decision to leave it out, then laid out all his plates on the counter and went down the line, delicately setting each ingredient in the right place. Maybe it was the ice cream snafu that got him off track, but it soon became clear that he was running out of time. Kim jumped in to help him plate, following him down the line, one ingredient at a time. It was just the two of them, and they were speaking English, but as he told her what to do, she responded invariably with the same enthusiastic <span class="txit">“Oído”</span> that she used at elBulli. To see them work together, you would never have guessed that they were boyfriend and girlfriend. She was just a <span class="txit">commis,</span> silently and efficiently helping her chef.</p>
<p class="indent">They are a curious couple. Against her starched appearance, he is more rumpled, his wispy hair falling unevenly over his collar and across his forehead. Whereas she is quick with a joke and often sarcastic, he is quieter, more introspective, and given to abstract thought. “He’s got all the ideas,” Kim says about Dan. “And I do all the hard work.” Yet when he talks about his feelings for her, he is more effusive. One night, when they’re out bullshitting at a bar, Luca asks Dan what he would do if Kim had to leave elBulli for some reason. Dan’s response is immediate. “I’d go with her, of course. If I cut off my arm, elBulli wouldn’t give a shit about me. But Kim will always love me.” He accepts that she is much more outgoing than he, and more popular as well. “I’m used to people loving her,” he says. “And wondering about me. They meet me and say, ‘Oh, you’re Kim’s boyfriend,’ like it’s a question.” Yet just as she did in the cold kitchen at the ICEX cooking contest, Kim defers to him on their careers. “He’s the smart one,” she says. “I’m the worker.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s why she is considering Finland. For his next job Dan is looking <a id="page_225"/>for a conceptually sophisticated challenge. He has heard a lot about Scandinavian cuisine and has fixed his interest on a restaurant in Helsinki run by chef Hans Välimäki. Kim isn’t sure she wants to move to Finland—it seems awfully far away—but she wants to support Dan, and she wants to stay with him. “We want to consolidate our relationship,” she says. “So, yes, we’re thinking about Finland.” In her voice, there is the barest tinge of doubt.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">In November, the American stagiaires, broadly defined (it was determined that Canada was close enough, and thus Emma was included in the planning, as was Luca, who had worked in the United States for several years) decide to celebrate Thanksgiving. On the actual holiday they will have to work, but they have the Sunday immediately following it off and can dedicate the day to cooking. A friend has offered her apartment for the occasion, and Katie starts drawing up a list of tasks, asking each person what he or she wanted to prepare. Sunny immediately starts plotting how to brine the turkey. Kim calls the stuffing. Dan chooses mashed and sweet potatoes; he will also make gravy. Luca wants to prepare an Italian-style apple tart. Katie, still overachieving, assigns herself a more traditional apple pie, brussels sprouts, biscuits, and creamed onions. Emma takes on some salads and vegetable sides; she will also make corn bread if she can find cornmeal. Pecan and pumpkin pies are out—no one can recall ever having seen the necessary ingredients in their Spanish supermarkets. Cranberry sauce remains a question mark; someone suggests they might be able to get Eduard to order the fruit from the Boqueria. The group invites the chefs, though all but Mateu (who promises to bring his wife and two kids) decline, out of either a desire to maintain the separation of rank or a simple preference for avoiding work-related social engagements during their meager time off.</p>
<p class="indent">The day before the dinner, some of the cooks get up early to go to the market before work. Kim had volunteered to get the turkey and bring it to the restaurant for overnight brining in the walk-in, as no one else had a refrigerator or a pot big enough. She had already established a relationship with Pedro, a poultry vendor in the Roses market, who supplies elBulli with chicken for family meal—and called him earlier in the week to request a <span class="txit">pato,</span> the biggest one they had, at least six kilos if possible. Pedro told her it wouldn’t be a problem, so she is somewhat disappointed to arrive at his stall on Saturday morning and learn that the biggest he could find was just three kilos. Still, she adapts quickly and decides they will just have to cook two. The butcher cleans the birds and wraps them for her, and Kim happily carries them back to the car. But on the whole ride up to the restaurant, something—she isn’t sure what—eats at her. <span class="txit">Pato, pato.</span> She drops the bag of fowl in the kitchen, then goes to change her clothes. The problem continues to gnaw at her. Three kilos—that’s less than seven pounds, now that she does the math. Is it possible for a full-grown turkey to weigh only seven pounds? At home the turkeys always weigh at least fifteen. Maybe Spanish turkeys are scrawnier. <span class="txit">Pato, pato, pato</span>. As she mulls it over, Oriol is in the kitchen, opening the bag she left there. Seeing its contents, he bounds up the stairs and nearly collides with her as she, having just realized her mistake, sprints out, her <a id="page_227"/>stomach sinking. “I thought you Americans ate turkey on Thanksgiving,” Oriol says. “What are you doing with a couple of ducks?”</p>

<p class="indent">Kim literally slaps her own forehead. <span class="txit">“Pavo!”</span> she cries. “Not <span class="txit">pato</span>.” She had thought her Spanish was okay, but now she has ruined Thanksgiving by getting one letter wrong. As she silently berates herself, Eduard arrives on the scene and Oriol gleefully relays the story. Kim fails to see the humor; she hates making mistakes, and this was a big one. The two chefs take pity on her. “Calm down,” Eduard says, trying not to laugh. “I’ll call Pedro.” An hour later, Pedro is at the restaurant, a turkey—<span class="txit">pavo</span>—in his arms. He picks up the ducks and, with a chuckle, drives back to the market.</p>
<p class="indent">The meal comes off without a hitch. The stagiaires arrive around 10 <small>A.M.</small>, taking over every inch of the apartment’s narrow galley kitchen and using every bowl and spoon in the place (each has brought his or her own knives). The turkey goes into the oven right on time, and the stagiaires work out a schedule for the stove’s few burners. Aitor has come with Emma but is suffering from kidney stones, so he spends the better part of the day on the sofa, where he organizes playlists on his computer. Katie rolls out a perfect pie crust, and Luca, who has brought an apron emblazoned with Hebrew words he cannot read, watches with mild fascination. Around noon, someone breaks out a bottle of cava. Emma Skypes her parents at home in Montreal and then walks around with her laptop, introducing everyone to them. Sunny insists on saying <span class="txit">“Quemo”</span> every time he passes behind someone in the narrow kitchen. Around 1 <small>P.M.</small>, Mateu calls to say he won’t be making it after all. Katie is disappointed, but his absence means that now César, the only person in Pastry who hasn’t come, can attend. (Unbeknown to Mateu, César had decided that it would be unethical of him to attend a social event with someone for whom he no longer had respect. “I don’t want to have to act normal with someone who doesn’t treat me well,” he said.) He shows up with a few bottles of good wine and another stagiaire, Gabriel, an hour later. With most of the meal in the oven, the group sits down to watch an episode of <span class="txit">Top Chef</span> in which Thomas Keller—a former boss of both Emma and Kim—is a judge. At the last moment, Mizuho, who <a id="page_228"/>has patiently waiting her turn at the oven, whips up a clafouti, though because of her accent, no one understands what she is making until it comes out of the oven. Throughout the six or so hours that they work, the stagiaires are noticeably happy, and a joyful, buzzy kind of energy fills the room. Emma puts it into words. “I’m just so glad to be <span class="txit">cooking,</span>” she said.</p>
<p class="indent">When dinner is at last ready, ten cooks sit around a table covered in platters and bowls (with extra time on their hands, a few of the stagiaires have managed to come up with some extra dishes). Sunny carves his beautifully roasted bird, and the stagiaires compliment one another on their efforts. César says he is glad to learn that American food can be good. Katie passes a platter of golden biscuits around. “This is the best Thanksgiving I’ve ever had,” she says. By then Kim has forgotten her mortification at her mistake. For just a moment, she lets herself relax and rests her head on Dan’s shoulder.</p>
