<p class="summary">When the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 left radioactive clouds over Hungary and France, they stopped production of foie gras, and Catalonia, Navarre, and the Basque Country started producing it. Now these regions make some of the best goose foie gras in the world, and innovative Spanish chefs are fond of using it.</p>
<p class="summary">Black truffles <span class="italic">(trufa)</span> are found in woodlands in northern Spain, deep in the soil around oak, hazelnut, and pine trees. About ninety percent of the crop goes to France, the rest to grand restaurants; truffles never had a place in Spanish regional cooking. When the supply of wild truffles decreased, and prices and demand abroad increased, truffle cultivation was started in areas where they never grew before, such as the forests around the town of Sarrión in southwest Aragon. Here a course on truffle cultivation given in 1987 by an agronomy engineering student, Francisco Edo Navarrete, was the initial inspiration for local people to start cultivating.</p>
<p class="summary">Locals now use truffles in their cooking. As they keep very well, cooks can use them all year round. Although cultivated truffles do not have the same powerful aroma as wild ones, they are delightful.</p>
