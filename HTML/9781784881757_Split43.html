<h1 class="chapter">sienese almond biscuits</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>A freshly baked batch of these biscuits (see <a href="9781784881757_Split43.html#page_70">picture</a>, centre) makes the house smell warm and inviting.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 36 BISCUITS</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>400 g (14 oz/4 cups) ground almonds (almond meal)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 teaspoons almond extract</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>175 g (6 oz/1½ cups) icing (confectioners’) sugar for the biscuits, plus 100 g (3½ oz/generous ¾ cup) for dusting</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon baking powder</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>175–200 g (6–7 oz) egg whites (about 4 large egg whites)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F/Gas 3) and line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Combine the ground almonds, almond extract, 175 g (6 oz/1½ cups) icing sugar and the baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Beat the egg whites in a separate clean bowl with a whisk until they form a soft foam, then add them to the almond mixture a little at a time. Stir with a large wooden spoon to form a thick paste – the mixture should be sticky but not runny. You may have a little egg white left, which you can discard. Put the extra icing sugar for dusting in a separate bowl.</p>
<p class="tx">Use 2 dessertspoons to form about 36 quenelles (raised oval shapes) by transferring the mixture between the spoons, then drop them gently into the bowl of icing sugar to coat them.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove each quenelle gently with a slotted spoon and place them on the lined baking sheet, spaced apart. Bake the biscuits for 20–25 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack before serving. They can be stored for up to 1 week in an airtight container.</p>
