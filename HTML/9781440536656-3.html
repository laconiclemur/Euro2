				<p class="noind">The word tapas usually refers to a variety of appetizers or small plates that are served in Spain at tapas bars, cafes, and restaurants. Or, they can be in the style of Spain but served in any country. But tapas also refers to many different styles of cuisine served in appetizer portions. In some cases there are family-style portions, served on one platter for individuals to help themselves.</p>
				<p class="ind">The portion sizes are smaller than ordinary recipes, since tapas are meant to be served with a lot of other tapas. So if a recipe “serves 4,” and there are a total of twelve finished hors d’oeuvres, that means you should make about five separate recipes that serve four people to mix and match if you intend to feed them satisfactorily. And portion sizes of recipes like paella, rice, or soup are smaller than they would be if you were to rely on the recipe as an entrée. These fifty tapas recipes are designed to be part of a tasting menu of a variety of different recipes. Keep that in mind if you want to feed four people for dinner!</p>
				<p class="ind">There are also recipes for drinks, including sangria, and for sweets that can be served at the end or combined to form a tapas dessert menu. So you can mix and match tastes and textures to create your own unique tapas menu. Enjoy!</p>
