<h2 class="h2b" id="page92">AÏOLI GARNI</h2>
<p class="normalla"><em>Known as the ‘golden butter’ of Provence, this is a wonderful example of the type of food that is simple to make, and by being something that is shared around a table, inspires conversation, debate and very strong opinions and breath</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla"><em>A purist would not be happy about my addition of mustard, my suggestion of using another oil apart from olive nor, I suppose, by the use of a whisk and bowl instead of the more traditional marble mortar and wooden pestle. I’m not flying in the face of tradition for the sake of it, but merely making sure that you succeed. The mustard helps emulsify the aïoli, for instance, and the whisk stops your arm falling off</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Make sure you have far too much: eating an aïoli should be done over hours</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">MAKES ENOUGH FOR ABOUT 4</span><br/>
5–10 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
Coarse sea salt<br/>
2 free-range egg yolks<br/>
1 heaped tbsp Dijon mustard<br/>
500ml (18fl oz) extra virgin olive oil, not peppery, or ½ vegetable, ½ olive</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO SERVE</span><br/>
Cooked prawns<br/>
Hard-boiled eggs<br/>
Cooked salt cod flakes<br/>
Cauliflower florets<br/>
Boiled potatoes<br/>
Artichokes<br/>
Green beans, runners<br/>
Mussels<br/>
Beetroot<br/>
Boiled carrots</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Crush the garlic with a generous pinch of salt. Scrape it into a bowl with the egg yolks, mustard and 1 tablespoon water. Whisking constantly, add the oil very slowly at first; then, as the emulsion begins, faster and faster. If the aïoli is too thick, add a little warm water.</p>
<p class="normala">Serve the aïoli on a large platter surrounded by all or some of the ingredients suggested, or a selection of crudités, or even just some good bread.</p>
