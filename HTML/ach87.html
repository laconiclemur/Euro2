<p class="author1"><span class="txit">cannelloni in due maniere</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Tasty homemade cannelloni are versatile and, because they may be prepared one day in advance, great to make when you are entertaining. Cannelloni are a terrific dish for a buffet. This recipe will prepare twenty cheese-filled and twenty meat-filled cannelloni. Serve one of each kind as an appetizer, or two of each kind as a pasta course. If you are planning to freeze the cannelloni, prepare a slightly thinner white sauce, as it will thicken while it cools.</p>
<p class="indentb">Another variation is to serve the cannelloni as a passed appetizer with cocktails. After rolling the cannelloni as described below, cut each long roll into 1-inch sections. Place them filling side down on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake in a preheated oven at 350° F, until heated through and lightly browned, about ten minutes.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Roll out the homemade pasta as instructed. Cut each long strip of pasta into pieces that are 4 inches by the width created by your pasta machine. There will be about 40 pieces. Cook the pasta in batches just until tender, about 3 minutes. Cool the cooked pasta under cold running water. Drain and lay out on a dish towel to dry.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Butter two large baking dishes. Evenly spread a thin layer of white sauce on the bottom of each dish and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_169"/><span class="red">4.</span> Place a piece of cooked pasta on a dry cloth with the short end toward you. Dust the top end of the pasta with a small amount of Parmesan cheese. Place 2 tablespoons of the spinach ricotta filling <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inch above the short end of the pasta and spread it to within <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch of either edge. Roll the pasta up toward the Parmesan-dusted edge to form a neat roll. Place each completed roll, seam side down, in one of the prepared baking dishes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> When all of the cheese-filled cannelloni are rolled and in the baking dish, top with half of the remaining white sauce. Dot <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon of the tomato sauce in the center of each cannelloni. (The cannelloni may be covered and frozen at this point. When reheating frozen cannelloni, bake at 350° F for 15 minutes, then broil to brown as described below.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Fill the remaining pasta with the meat filling, following the same procedure. Arrange in the other prepared baking dish and cover with the remaining white sauce.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese on top of both dishes of cannelloni before baking. Cook until the sauce begins to bubble, about 10 minutes. Turn on the oven broiler and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> The shape of homemade pasta that has been cut and boiled in the method used for cannelloni is called <span class="txit">fazzoletti,</span> which means “handkerchief.” Fazzoletti may also be used to prepare individual portions of an informal lasagna: Place a sheet of cooked pasta on a serving plate. Top with sauce, such as <a class="nounder" href="ach18a.html#page_34">Pan-Seared Calamari in Its Own Broth</a> or Tucci or <a class="nounder" href="ach61.html#page_122">Tropiano Ragù Sauce</a>, and lay another piece of pasta on top. Top with more sauce and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FAZZOLETTI LASAGNA MAY ALSO BE FROZEN</span>:</span> Place individual portions of this informal lasagna a few inches apart on a baking sheet and place in the freezer to set, about 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and store for up to 1 month.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Place the frozen fazzoletti in a preheated oven at 300° F and bake to soften, about 10 minutes. Increase the temperature to 350° F and cook until browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
