<h2 class="h2b" id="page82">PETITS FARCIS PROVENÇAUX</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Provençal Stuffed Vegetables</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>These little vegetables, traditionally stuffed and baked with a mixture of minced pork and all sorts of aromatic goodies, get featured on menus all over Provence. As much as I love these, this lighter variation on the classic, with courgette purée and lashings of garlic, is perhaps an even better way of letting the roasted, slightly dried flavour of the tomatoes, aubergines and courgettes come to the fore. I managed to get little round courgettes, which were spectacular in both look and taste, but you can very easily cut larger ones down to size</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>You can prepare all the vegetables well in advance and just sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and bake at the last minute</em>.</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>

100ml (3½fl oz) olive oil<br/>
Juice of 1 lemon<br/>
8 small tomatoes<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
4 baby artichokes<br/>
2 round courgettes<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) Provençal Breadcrumbs (<em><a href="chapter_001i.html#page31">see here</a></em>)<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) Parmesan, freshly grated</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00a">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">STUFFING</span><br/>
1 onion, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped<br/>
3 tbsp olive oil<br/>
1 large courgette<br/>
1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO SERVE</span><br/>
800g (1lb 12oz) recipe <em>Cooked Tomato Sauce</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006c.html#page167">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the spiky bits at the top of the aubergines and cut them in half lengthways. Crisscross the flesh side and brush them with 6 tablespoons of olive oil and half the lemon juice.</p>
<p class="normala">Slice a sliver off the bottom of the tomatoes so they sit flat and about a quarter off the top, using a serrated knife. Put them on a tray with the aubergines, drizzle with a little olive oil, season well with salt and black pepper and bake for 25 minutes, removing the tomatoes after 10. The aubergines should be totally soft inside.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the tough outer leaves of the artichokes one by one until you get to the white centre. Trim the base to remove the bottoms of the green leaves and peel the tough outer layer of the stalk. Cook these at a brisk simmer in salted water with the remaining lemon juice for about 20 minutes until you can insert the blade of a small knife easily into the base of the artichoke. Leave these to cool in their own liquid, then halve and remove the chokes.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut the round courgettes into six wedges and blanch them in plenty of boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Refresh them quickly in iced water then drain and remove them as soon as they are cold. Remove the seedy centres (put these with the courgette for the stuffing) and reserve.</p>
<p class="normala">To make the stuffing sweat the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 5 minutes without colouring. Chop the courgette and seedy part from the round courgettes finely, then add to the pan. Cook this over a high heat for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently until the courgette is completely soft. Purée this mixture in the food processor with the basil leaves until fine. Season well with salt and pepper and reserve.</p>
<p class="normala">Spread some of the mixture over the aubergines, artichokes and courgette wedges. Lift the lids off the tomatoes and put a little on them, then put the tops back on. Sprinkle all with the breadcrumbs and Parmesan, then bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven until the crumbs are crisp. Serve with the hot tomato sauce.</p>
