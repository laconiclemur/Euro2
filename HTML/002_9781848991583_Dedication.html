<p class="tab" style="font-size:85%;">This book is dedicated to two very special and important people—my wife, Claire, and my son, Antoine. Without them in my life, and their tremendous support, I would not be able to do what I do. They both love food, they have endless patience and they are fun to be with. They also understand what I do for living, which makes it so much easier for me when I am so often at work. So this cookbook is for you guys, with all my love—always.</p>
