<p class="tx2"><b>If you can, find Italian sausages to give this sauce a more genuine Tuscan taste; however, we frequently make it with good-quality English ones, as long as the meat is coarsely ground and they are not stuffed with rusk. Italian sausages are made with 100 per cent meat, have a good fat content and are flavoured with salt and garlic, and are often used in Italian recipes as sausage meat or instead of minced meat. If you do find them you may not need any extra garlic or salt in the recipe. This recipe comes from Raffaella Cecchelli who runs the smallest osteria in Italy called La Tana dei Brillo Parlante in the stunningly pretty town of Massa Marittima. In the photo we have used fresh papperdele, but this sauce is also ideal with penne, fusilli or rigatoni dried pasta.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>300 g (10½ oz) cavolo nero (or other cabbage), washed, tough stems removed and leaves roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 good-quality (over 90% meat) pork sausages</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 fat garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>fresh red chilli, sliced, to taste, or ¼ teaspoon dried chilli flakes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>480 g (17 oz) dried pasta</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) double (heavy) cream (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the cavolo nero and cook for 5–10 minutes until soft. Drain well and set aside. When cool enough to touch, cut the leaves into shreds.</p>
<p class="tx">Make a shallow incision along the length of the sausages with a knife and peel away the skin. Discard the skins and crumble the meat into a large frying pan, then add the oil, garlic and chilli. Put the pan over a medium heat and cook until the sausage meat is lightly browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions (see for how to <a href="9781784881757_Split23.html#page_41">cook dried pasta</a>) and time it so the pasta will be just cooked when the sauce is ready.</p>
<p class="tx">Add the white wine to the sausage mixture in the frying pan and allow this to evaporate for around 5 minutes, then add the shredded cavolo nero and stir through. Pour in the cream, if using, bring the sauce to a gentle boil and taste for seasoning (sometimes there is no need add more salt if the sausages are already salty). Stir hot, drained pasta into the sauce and serve straight away with the grated Parmesan.</p>
