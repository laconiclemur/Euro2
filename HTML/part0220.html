<p class="toc" id="sab0001796">In the same way that my mum used to make sure she got the freshest fish and ripest fruit when shopping at the market, finding the best-quality ingredients is very important to me. I have built up a number of trusted suppliers that I use. Most, though not all, of these companies only supply wholesale, but I’d like to mention them briefly – I’ve also included a list of shops and websites where you can find many of the ingredients mentioned in the recipes in this book.</p>
<p class="calibre10" id="sab0001797">Wherever you live, it’s important to shop from companies or people you trust, if you can, and to build up a relationship with them. Then, when you need to find something slightly out of the ordinary, you can ask them to help you out, as I do with my suppliers.</p>

<p class="toc" id="sab0001799">I’ve been working with Brindisa for the last sixteen years; they are friends of mine and we are very supportive of each other. They were the first company to introduce many Spanish products to the UK, and everything they sell is good quality.</p>
<h5 class="suppliers_bhead" id="sab0001800">MASH PURVEYORS (<em class="calibre9">wholesale; retail at New Covent Garden Market, or online, in London, from <a href="http://farmdrop.co.uk" class="pcalibre calibre3">farmdrop.co.uk</a>, selected produce only)</em></h5>
<p class="toc" id="sab0001801">Dating back over 150 years, Mash supply fruit and vegetables to top UK restaurants. They come to see me once a month with a small box of stuff and they always have something I’ve never seen before – finger limes from Australia, say – which teaches me about new ingredients. Their produce is very fresh, good value and they’re lovely people to deal with.</p>

<p class="toc" id="sab0001808">A very small supplier, Maurice is English but grew up in France and travels between London, France and Spain a lot. He is one of the best fresh suppliers I’ve ever met and has incredible offal, meat and vegetables.</p>

<h5 class="suppliers_bhead" id="sab0001811">BASCO <em class="calibre9">(wholesale and retail, <a href="http://bascofinefoods.com" class="pcalibre calibre3">bascofinefoods.com</a>)</em></h5>
