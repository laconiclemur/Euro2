</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Northern Spain facing the Atlantic and the Cantabrian Sea is a</span> wet “green” land of lush wooded mountains and vast pastures where cows graze. It is dairy country. They make cheese and milk desserts—custards, flans, fried cream, cheesecake, and rice pudding. Recently, indigenous breeds of cattle that had been neglected in favor of good milk producers have begun to be raised again. Apples and pears, walnuts, hazelnuts, and chestnuts grow here. The mountain forests have the widest variety of game, including deer and wild boar, rabbits, hares, and birds. The rivers that rush down the mountains are full of trout, salmon, and eels. The coast is dotted with fishing ports and villages where, despite the continuing depletion of fish stock, fishermen bring in a huge variety of fish and seafood—theirs are the best mollusks and crustaceans in Europe.</p>
<p class="para">In this part of Spain, the peasantry was always poor but self-contained. They were tenant farmers and sharecroppers (<span class="italic">foreros</span>) who paid rent to the Church and the nobility who had owned the land since the early Middle Ages. In the nineteenth century, Church-held lands were expropriated by the state and became common lands. Smallholdings, small farms (<span class="italic">minifundios</span>) with little stone houses, each with its vegetable garden and grapevine trellises, are dotted around the mountains and valleys. Until very recently, every family kept one or two pigs, a solitary cow for milk and cheese, and chickens for eggs. They grew corn and rye alongside beans and potatoes, cabbages, turnips and carrots, leeks, peas, and fava beans. They cooked on the open hearth. For warmth in winter, it was usual for animals to sleep downstairs in the farmhouse while the family slept upstairs. In the northern regions, peasant families were known to look after their livestock with a kind of reverence. Pío Baroja, the Basque writer and radical Republican, wrote that in order to live well there, one had to be either a priest or a cow.</p>
<p class="para">Transport was difficult over the high mountains, and rural life was hard. Most farms were too small to sustain more than one family. In Asturias, the Basque Provinces, and Catalonia, small farmsteads were passed to the eldest male on his marriage. In Navarre, parents chose the heir regardless of age or gender, while in León, peasants practiced equal inheritance. It was the custom for one of the remaining children to enter the Church, and another to join the army, and then the others would leave. In the past, the young emigrated in droves to the Americas. More recently, it was to France, Switzerland, and Germany. Nowadays young people can find work in their own cities, and emigrants are coming back.</p>
<p class="para">The valley of the Ebro River, which cuts through the mountains of Navarre, La Rioja, and Aragon, has brought Mediterranean fruit and vegetables and Mediterranean styles of cooking, including the use of olive oil, to these landlocked northern regions. Cultural unity was the result of the pilgrim routes that run through all the northern regions to the shrine of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. After the relics of the saint were reputedly found there in the ninth century, Santiago became a place of pilgrimage as important as Rome and Jerusalem. For a long time, the French were the main pilgrims, and settlers on the pilgrimage routes. That is one reason the north of Spain became early on a zone of French influence. In the nineteenth century, French haute cuisine was adopted by the newly rich mining and industrial bourgeoisie and by the <span class="italic">indianos,</span> as the returning emigrants grown rich in the American colonies were called. That is why you find crepelike pancakes, béchamel sauces, quichelike tarts, fried cream, flans, and <span class="italic">crema pastelera</span> there.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p088.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">The stream of pilgrims to Santiago encouraged the building of churches, cathedrals, and monasteries along the way. The clergy were powerful landlords and had an important influence on what peasants grew. The priests and monks who traveled to the Americas with their religious orders were the first to bring back corn, potatoes, beans, and peppers when they were recalled to Spain in the sixteenth century, and these became local staples. The north is known as the zone of heartwarming bean and potato soups and stews.</p>
<p class="para">Whereas wine has always been the drink of the Mediterranean coast, beer and cider were the traditional drinks on the Atlantic coast until a decade or so ago, when fine wines started to be produced there.</p>
<p class="h">GALICIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Galicia has its own language, which is similar to Portuguese, and is proud of its Celtic ancestry (they play bagpipes at events and festivals). Separated from the rest of Spain by high mountains, it was entirely isolated until recently. It was also the poorest region, and the only way out of poverty was emigration. That is why Galician dishes—boiled octopus (page 311), <span class="italic">caldo gallego</span> (page 182), and empanadas, large crusty pies—are among the most common dishes in cities all over Spain and as far away as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba, where Galician immigrants opened restaurants and bars. Now many of them are coming back, as life has changed with tourism. In cafés in Santiago, I heard groups of old men speaking with Latin American accents. They were there on holiday; their sons had returned there to work. Many, especially those from Argentina, have opened <span class="italic">churrasquerías</span> (steak houses). The meat, fabulous veal and beef from the indigenous blond <span class="italic">rubia gallega</span> cattle, is tender, juicy, marbled with fat, and full of flavor. Galicians have also brought back the indigenous Celtic pig, which looks a bit like a wild boar. The enormous succulent capons of Vilalba, which are fed on boiled corn, wheat, and potatoes or on chestnuts soaked in milk or wine, appear at markets all over Spain at Christmas time.</p>
<p class="para">For centuries the cities of Galicia were under the control of bishops, and the countryside was shared by the cathedrals, the abbeys, and the secular aristocracy. Together with Asturias, it was the region where peasants were more completely under the dominion of their landlords than elsewhere in the north. The rural population lived isolated in the hills and mountains in tiny farmsteads. They rented the land and owned the houses, which they built, and gave part of their produce to their landlord in payment of the rent. Families divided their land among all their children into ever smaller holdings.</p>
<p class="para">Galicia, Asturias, Murcia, and the Canary Islands are the only regions in Spain today where corn is grown for human consumption as well as for animal fodder. In Galicia they make bread with cornmeal. Potatoes are the traditional staple, and apples and chestnuts are also used as a substitute for vegetables. The farmers give turnips to their pigs and eat the green tops. The green chile peppers from around the town of Padrón, called <span class="italic">pimientos del Padrón,</span> sweet but occasionally burning hot, are served in bars all over Spain, fried and sprinkled with coarse salt. Families who kept a pig had to cure the hams and other charcuterie indoors around the fireplace because of the wet weather (attics were damp). That is why the ham and the lard they use in some of their dishes give them a peculiar strong smoky flavor.</p>
<p class="para">The Galician coast is known as the Costa del Marisco, the Seafood Coast, because of its magnificent seafood. Vigo is the largest fishing port in Europe, and Galicia has the largest fishing fleet. It also has shellfish farming and seafood processing industries. <span class="italic">Pulpo a la feria</span> (page 311), boiled octopus dressed with olive oil and <span class="italic">pimentón</span> and served with boiled potatoes, is Galicia’s festive signature dish. The scallop shell is the symbol of Santiago de Compostela. Shells are encrusted into the ground marking the Pilgrims’ Way, and a relief in the shape of the shell is at the entrance of the great cathedral where the relics of the apostle Saint James are buried.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p090.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">The region is known for its almond <span class="italic">tarta de Santiago</span> (page 549), its <span class="italic">marrons glacés,</span> and its cow’s-milk cheeses, which are unusual in Spain. Most notable are the soft, creamy, mild-tasting Tetilla (its name means “nipple,” and it is shaped like a woman’s breast); San Simón, the strongly flavored smoked version; Arzúa-Ulloa; and Cebrerio. The Rías Baixas, an area of breathtakingly beautiful estuaries and fjords, produces some of the best white wines of Spain. The prestigious Albariños, crisp, dry, fresh, fruity, and aromatic, are made from Albariño grapes, which were brought to the region in the twelfth century by Cistercian monks from the Rhine and Moselle Valleys. The Monterei, Ribeiro, Rías Baixas, Ribeira Sacra, and Valdeoras wines also use local grape varieties. Ribeiro is the most popular with Galicians, the one that evokes nostalgic memories when they leave their Galicia homeland. The vineyards of the red Ribeiro wines belonged long ago to the Jews of Ribadavia, a former capital of Galicia. In one of their fiestas, they celebrate these Jewish roots by reenacting a Jewish wedding in costumes of the time. Orujo is a spirit distilled from the residue of crushed grapes. <span class="italic">Queimada</span> is a hot drink made by flaming orujo with lemon peel, cinnamon, sugar, and sometimes coffee beans in an earthenware bowl. The ritual preparation is said to have pagan origins and to keep away evil spirits. They believed in witches here, and they still sell amulets to protect you against evil.</p>
<p class="h">ASTURIAS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">According to legend, in 718, the Virgin Mary appeared in a cave at the top of a high mountain in the Asturian village of Covadonga, where the local leader, Pelayo, was taking refuge from the attacking Moors. She gave him a wooden cross that he used to fight off the Muslim armies, and he was crowned king of the first Christian kingdom of Spain. Asturias became a refuge for Christian nobility escaping Muslim occupation of the Iberian peninsula. In recognition of the place where the Reconquista began and of the role played by the nobles in the centuries-long war, the heir to the Spanish crown today has the title of Prince of Asturias, and Asturias is a principality.</p>
<p class="para">This sensationally beautiful green and misty land of rugged towering mountains, fast-flowing rivers, and lakes is dotted with little farms (<span class="italic">caserías</span>) and apple orchards. It is renowned for its wide variety of beans, in particular for the large white ones called <span class="italic">fabes,</span> which go into the famous <span class="italic">fabada</span> (page 489). The region is also known for apple tarts, apple cakes, apple pancakes, and apple puddings, as well as for apple cider that is hard, dry, and still. In the cider houses, it is poured from on high so that it aerates as it splashes into glasses—and onto the floor. Cider is used for cooking fish and chicken and in desserts. Asturias is also a region of walnuts and walnut cakes. Corn is used to make bread and <span class="italic">tortos,</span> which are like deep-fried small Mexican tortillas. There are also thicker <span class="italic">tortos</span> that are cooked over a wood fire, and a creamy polenta called <span class="italic">fariñes</span> (page 481).</p>
<p class="para">You see cattle, sheep, and goats grazing on farmsteads and in the high mountain range Picos de Europa, now a national park. Not long ago, foreign breeds of cows that produced lots of milk predominated; today the indigenous red Asturianas de la Montaña are raised for their meat. Game birds, especially woodcock (<span class="italic">becada</span>), are delicacies, and wild boar and deer are hunted. The wide variety of fish and seafood caught along the rugged coast is a splendid part of the local gastronomy. Hake and monkfish are favorites, as are crab and sea urchin. Salmon fishing in its many rivers makes Asturias the largest salmon-producing region of Spain.</p>
<p class="para">In 1830, iron and coal were found, and mining and heavy industry caused a mini industrial revolution. At the same time, still-jobless young men left for Latin America. Many returned having made their fortunes. The exotic colorful Mexican-style colonial mansions they built, with domes and towers, pillars and balconies, are evident today in elegant cities, on mountainsides, and along the seacoasts. A palm tree in the front garden signifies that the original owner was a returnee from Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, or Venezuela. The <span class="italic">indianos,</span> as these overseas entrepreneurs were called, also adopted the French cuisine that was then fashionable with the local nobility and the new industrial bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p092.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">Asturias is the European region that offers the widest range of cheeses, and it is known as el Pais de los Quesos (the Land of Cheeses). Cow’s, sheep’s, and goat’s milk are all used, sometimes on their own, sometimes in combination. The most famous cheese is the strong-tasting blue Cabrales, traditionally matured in mountain caves. Notable others are Los Beyos, Gamoneú, Peñamellera, Picón Bejes-Tresviso, and Afuega’l Pitu. But Asturias is the only region of Spain that does not produce wine.</p>
<p class="h">CANTABRIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Tiny Cantabria has had a special relationship with powerful Castile ever since it sent men to help King Ferdinand III conquer Córdoba and Seville in 1236. The capital, Santander, became Castile’s way to the sea for its wool exports to northern Europe and for its trade with the New World. Because of its privileged trading position, it had early access to products such as olive oil from the south and the Mediterranean, which its neighbors did not have. In the nineteenth century, Santander, a port on the beautiful Costa Esmeralda (Emerald Coast), became the summer resort of the royals, which explains why some dishes have a touch of “class,” and why olive oil has long been used for cooking instead of the traditional lard.</p>
<p class="para">In the small mountain communities in the region that is known as La Montaña because of the steep Cantabrian mountain range, families kept a few cows, sheep, and goats. The cattle were looked after jointly by cowherds, while villagers took turns looking after one another’s sheep and goats. Nowadays tourism has become more important than agriculture. In the valleys where grapevines and wheat, chickpeas, potatoes, and cabbages once grew, many fields have been given over to cattle grazing. The young pink meat of the indigenous breeds makes for splendid grills and for stews with beans and potatoes, as do venison and the meat of wild boar. It is a region rich in wild things: berries, chestnuts, walnuts, edible flowers, and herbs. On the coast, fish and seafood are cooked in simple ways, and salmon, trout, and eels are available from the rivers that fall from the mountains straight into the sea.</p>
<p class="para">Like Asturias, Cantabria is an artisan cheese paradise, with a variety of cheeses. The most well known are the creamy blue Picón Bejes-Tresviso from a blend of cow’s and sheep’s milk, the fresh buttery cow’s-milk Cantabria and Pasiego, the smoked Tresviso from Áliva, and the mild or smoked Liébana. Cóbreces is made with cow’s milk by the Cistercian nuns of the monastery of the same name.</p>
<p class="para">Apple cider is the traditional drink. The region also produces Chacolí, a light acidy white wine, and the sweet red Tostadillo. The region is famous for its canned red peppers (<span class="italic">pimientos de Isla</span>) and its anchovies preserved in salt or in oil.</p>
<p class="h">THE BASQUE COUNTRY</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">San Sebastián has for some years now been a prime destination of food lovers from all over the world as the center with the greatest concentration of trailblazing Michelin-starred chefs. Other gastronomic attractions are the lively bars offering both traditional and modern tapas—here called <span class="italic">pintxos</span>—and the famous men-only gastronomic societies, where members take turns cooking and vie to outdo one another. It is here that Spanish <span class="italic">nueva cocina</span> was born. In the 1970s, top restaurants only served French haute cuisine. They had been doing so since the late nineteenth century, when the beautiful seaside town was adopted as a retreat by Queen Regent Maria Christina and became the fashionable belle époque resort of the Spanish upper classes. After the discovery of iron and the development of heavy industries in the region, a wealthy Basque bourgeoisie that could afford expensive restaurants emerged. There was also an old aristocracy whose ancestors had been ennobled by the kings of Castile in recompense for helping them in the Reconquista and the conquest of the New World. French cooks found employment here when they came in large numbers after the French Revolution. Today, Spanish Basques also share dishes with the French Basques on the other side of the border, and they speak French as well as their own Basque language, Euskara.</p>
<p class="para">When Paul Bocuse, the godfather of French nouvelle cuisine, came to speak at a conference in Madrid in 1976, he invited two young Basque chefs, Juan Mari Arzak and Pedro Subijana, to attend a course with him in Lyon. Back in San Sebastián, Arzak and Subijana, along with a group of enthusiastic chefs, began to develop <span class="italic">nueva cocina vasca,</span> Basque nouvelle cuisine. It was the start of what was to become a national movement to update traditional dishes and create new ones based on regional products, and eventually the first Spanish <span class="italic">alta cocina</span> (haute cuisine).</p>
<p class="para">Basque culinary roots go back to the time before steel mills, factories, banking, and tourism enticed people away from the land, to when the mountain region was a world of farmers, shepherds, and fishermen, and when, as the Catalan traveler Mañe y Flaqué wrote one hundred and fifty years ago, “they look[ed] after their animals as if they were members of the family.” Rural life has not entirely disappeared. Capons and turkeys are raised for festive occasions, the indigenous cattle for both beef and milk. Peas, green beans, and cauliflower are traditional vegetables still grown. Leeks and potatoes have a special place in the diet. The red bean of Tolosa is a favorite dried bean, and the white <span class="italic">pocha</span> bean is harvested very young and cooked fresh. At least thirty varieties of wild mushrooms can be found in fields and woodlands. The pickled spicy green <span class="italic">guindilla</span> peppers of Ibarra are served as tapas, and the elongated peppers from Guernica are used in many dishes including the famous <span class="italic">piperada</span> (page 198). Many Basque dishes including <span class="italic">piperada,</span> squid cooked in its ink (page 307), and <span class="italic">gâteau Basque,</span> are similar to those of their neighbors in Navarre and La Rioja.</p>
<p class="para">More than anything, Basques love fish and seafood. Life on the Cantabrian coast was once all about fishing. Men went out in their boats at night, their women ran to meet them on the beach in the morning with baskets on their heads, and they went off to sell the catch at the market. For centuries, fishermen went out on the high seas for long periods to catch whales and cod, which they dried and salted on the boats. They fetched the salt from salt pans in Cádiz. Now there is large-scale commercialization and mechanization of the fishing industry and small fishing fleets are depleted, but fish and seafood are appreciated more than ever, as are tiny elvers from the rivers.</p>
<p class="para">Local wines are the slightly acidic white Txacolí, or Chacolí, which is good with seafood and as an aperitif, and the sparkling red Rioja Alavesa. Cider, the traditional Basque drink, is sweeter and fizzier than Galician cider. Idiazabal, the great Basque sheep’s-milk cheese, is buttery, with an intense piquant, slightly acidic flavor. Shepherds used to make it when they grazed their sheep on the mountains and lived in small huts nearby during spring and summer. Their Gaztazzara is a strong-tasting, spreadable sheep’s-milk cheese.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p095.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">The Basque language is said to be the oldest in Europe, and DNA tests have confirmed that Basques are descendants of a race that had inhabited the Western Pyrenees along the Bay of Biscay since ancient times. The Basques sought autonomy from Spain in the nineteenth century, but the separatist movement was crushed during the civil war. It was rekindled after Franco’s death, and there are still militant separatists who campaign for complete independence.</p>
<p class="para">Basques are as passionate about food as they are about politics and music. Theirs is a society of cooks and gourmets and of singers, and they sing lyrical Basque folk songs. The members of a men’s gastronomic society where I was a guest have their own choir.</p>
<p class="h">NAVARRE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The landscape in Navarre ranges from the misty wet Pyrenees, with vast forests of pine, chestnut, and hazelnut trees, to meadows with sheep and cattle grazing on their slopes, the desertlike Bardenas Reales near Tudela, and river valleys, vineyards, orchards, olive groves, and vegetable gardens in the wide Ebro Valley. There, irrigation systems originally installed by the Arabs allow the land to produce a succession of crops each year, including sugar beets and a huge variety of vegetables. The region is famous for its asparagus, artichoke, cardoon, and borage dishes and for the small fresh white beans called <span class="italic">pochas.</span></p>
<p class="para">The little pointed red peppers of Lodosa in southwest Navarre called <span class="italic">pimientos del piquillo,</span> which we can now get in cans and jars, roasted and peeled, have long been popular in tapas bars and restaurants all over Spain, usually stuffed with fish or seafood or with ground pork.</p>
<p class="para">Navarre has no coast, but the rivers have trout and salmon. The region shares produce and dishes with neighboring La Rioja and Aragon. Many are an exciting mix of Mediterranean, French, and Arab influences.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p096.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">Navarre, called Pamplona at the time, was inhabited by Basque tribes when Muslims conquered the Ebro Valley in 714. In 824, a Basque chieftain named Iñigo Aritza was made king of Pamplona, which later became the kingdom of Navarre. The Christian kingdom coexisted with the small Muslim <span class="italic">taifa</span> kingdoms of Zaragoza and Tudela. Navarre passed by marriage to the counts of Champagne and then to the French crown in 1305, and it remained, on and off, under a French king until it was annexed by Castile in 1515. Basque and French are spoken here along with Castilian Spanish.</p>
<p class="para">There are more heraldic crests and coats of arms on the stone houses in Navarre than in any other part of Spain. During the heyday of the kingdom, twenty percent of the population was of noble family. At the turn of the twentieth century, many wealthy <span class="italic">indianos</span> returned from the Americas to their ancestral villages, bringing new wealth to the region. Navarre’s noble heritage is reflected in its refined cooking. Game braised in rich wine sauces, sometimes containing chocolate (see page 374), is common in mountain villages. There is wild boar, rabbit, and hare, and birds such as quail, partridge, and pigeon. The veal from local calves varies from pink to red, with a fine marbling of fat, and makes for splendid grilled dishes cooked over charcoal embers and heartwarming mountain stews. The region is also famous for lamb and goat: <span class="italic">chuletitas,</span> baby lamb chops, and roast suckling lamb are local specialties. Pork, both fresh and cured, is popular. Local sausages include <span class="italic">la chistorra</span> and a chorizo of Pamplona made with a mix of beef and pork. The <span class="italic">longaniza</span> of Navarre is made of pancetta. Newer products are duck foie gras and duck confit.</p>
<p class="para">Navarre produces two great cheeses with sheep’s milk: the soft, aromatic, slightly sharp and piquant Roncal, and a strong-tasting aged or smoked Idiazabal that is similar to the Basque version. Navarre wines are like those of La Rioja, made with similar grapes and similar methods of production; the rosés are delightful. Pacharán is a liqueur made by macerating sloe berries and coffee beans in an anise-flavored spirit.</p>
<p class="h">LA RIOJA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">La Rioja, the great wine region of Spain, is a land of rolling hills and valleys surrounded by mountains, with a climate that varies from cool and wet to warm and humid to dry. La Rioja is still all about wine. Towns are packed with <span class="italic">bodegas</span> (wineries), some venerable and aristocratic, others small and family-run, and some corporate and industrial; a few were built by world-famous architects. The Romans made wine here, then the local monks took it up. Old monasteries abound in the mountains and forests. Some have been converted into hotels, a few into wineries. It is said that the Castilian language was born in one of the oldest monasteries, Yuso, where the first texts written in an early form of Castilian were found. There is a continuous history of Christianity in the area that flourished even through Muslim rule, and the pilgrims’ route to Santiago passes through. It was a place of settlement for knights and nobles. They formed a wine nobility that has left many small palaces and mansions in the honey-colored wine-making hamlets. You see noble heraldic shields everywhere, even on village houses.</p>
<p class="para">Much of the broad Ebro Valley and the valleys of six of its tributaries, including the river Oja, from which La Rioja got its name, are covered with vineyards. The Rioja DOC includes an area that stretches into parts of the Basque Country and Navarre. Until a little over fifteen years ago—before many other regions started producing really good wines—people all over Spain knew only Rioja apart from their own local wine. La Rioja became prominent after phylloxera devastated the French vineyards in the second half of the nineteenth century and vintners from Bordeaux came to plant grapes free of the disease and to make their wines there. For years, French Cabernet and Merlot grapes were grown in La Rioja. When phylloxera destroyed the Spanish vineyards too, and French and Spanish vineyards were replanted with phylloxera-resistant rootstocks from America, the French went back home and the Riojans went back to their indigenous Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo, Graciano, and Viura grapes. But they kept the French ways of vineyard management and wine-making techniques, including the aging of wine in oak barrels. They have now gone further and adopted new technology. Winemakers used to buy their grapes from farmers, but now they have their own vineyards. While La Rioja is known for its excellent aged red wines, it also has good whites and rosés, as well as brandies and liqueurs.</p>
<p class="para">As with all fine wine areas, La Rioja is also a gastronomic region. <span class="italic">Bodegas</span> offer both traditional and innovative tapas to accompany wine tastings. Grand restaurants serve innovative cuisine; family-run inns and unpretentious traditional <span class="italic">casas de comidas</span> (literally, eating houses) offer home cooking. Riojan home cooking has much in common with that of neighboring Navarre, Aragon, and León. It is simpler than that of many other regions and relies on the quality of the local produce. In the valleys and plains of the river Ebro and its tributaries, there are extensive wheat fields and potato and sugar beet plantations, as well as olive tree groves. Peaches, pears, and cherries grow. Market gardens are full of vegetables, including artichokes, asparagus, cardoons, borage, Swiss chard, eggplant, and zucchini. Small and fiery red chile peppers, <span class="italic">alegrías riojanas,</span> add a piquant flavor to many dishes. Mediterranean-style cooking with olive oil coexists with French ways of cooking with butter and cream and thickening soups and sauces with roux. As you would expect, there is a lot of cooking with wine and brandy: desserts are often fruits poached in wine. And pastries are made with walnuts or almonds.</p>
<p class="para">The mountains of La Rioja have their own separate food culture. Pigs are kept. All kinds of cured products—a delicious sweet blood sausage made with rice, chorizo, and salami-like <span class="italic">salchichón</span>—go into stews rich with red beans and the mottled <span class="italic">caparrones,</span> which are like borlotti beans. Wild boar, deer, partridge, hare, and quail are hunted in the woodlands. Sheep, goats, and cattle graze on the hillsides. A favorite way of cooking meat—especially baby lamb chops, <span class="italic">chuletitas,</span> and large T-bone steaks, <span class="italic">chuletones</span>—is grilling it over smoldering grapevine prunings. Lamb and goat are spit-roasted. Potatoes and wild mushrooms are common garnishes. Trout and salt cod are popular. Riojans serve their fresh salty, slightly acidic Camerano goat cheese as a tapa with caramelized onions.</p>
<p class="h">ARAGON</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">When the Kingdom of Aragon was united with Catalonia through the marriage of the count of Barcelona to Petronila of Aragon in 1137, the joint Crown went on to acquire eastern Spain and a whole empire in the Mediterranean. It is a beautiful story that is told in the Catalan section, on page 102. In 1469, the union of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile brought the two most powerful kingdoms of the peninsula together and led to the creation of a united Spain.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p099.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">In this large, landlocked area, which ranges from mountain glaciers and forests to rich pasturelands, arid desert steppes, and verdant river valleys, there are at least two major Aragonese food cultures. One is typical of the fertile valley of the Ebro River that cuts through the mountains. It is a cosmopolitan Mediterranean style that makes much use of vegetables, fruits, and olive oil. Wheat, barley, and rye are important crops. Olives from lower Aragon are used to produce sweet, fruity, and aromatic extra virgin oils. Market gardens provide peppers, tomatoes, green and white beans, zucchini, sweet onions, asparagus, cardoons, and borage. The fruits of Aragon—plums, pears, apples, cherries, and especially peaches—are much admired throughout Spain. Rivers provide freshwater crab, and crayfish, trout, and salmon. Among Aragonese sweets are peaches in wine (page 527) and candied and chocolate-covered fruit.</p>
<p class="para">The white truffles that once abounded in the wild are now being farmed. Some of the local dishes testify to the tastes of the Muslims who were allowed to stay on as Moriscos (Christian converts) until the seventeenth century, to irrigate the land and nurture the fruits and vegetables. The northern part of the region is on the border with France, and some dishes have a French touch and make use of butter and cream.</p>
<p class="para">Game, meat, cured pork, and cheese belong to the food culture of the mountains, where cattle, sheep, and goats graze in lush pastures. Lamb is the traditional meat, and popular dishes such as <span class="italic">migas,</span> made with bread crumbs, remind you of the old transhumant life of shepherds. Teruel, in southern Aragon, is renowned for its pork products from indigenous pigs. The hams are cured with very little salt and have a delicate flavor and creamy fat. The blood sausage is made with rice and onions. Partridge, quail, rabbit and hare, and big game like deer and wild boar are hunted. Not many cheeses are made here. Their creamy Tronchón, a mix of sheep’s milk and goat’s milk, was mentioned in Cervantes’s <span class="italic">Don Quixote.</span></p>
<p class="para">Aragon is an old wine-producing land. In the past, much of its traditional harsh, highly alcoholic wines went to France for blending, but the region is now producing some fine reds, whites, and rosés with native and foreign grape varieties. Its Cariñena and Somontano have been reborn. And Aragon also makes fruit liqueurs and brandies with berries, cherries, and nuts.</p>
