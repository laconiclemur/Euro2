<h2 class="h2" id="app02"><a id="page_455"/>THE SPANISH PANTRY</h2>
<p class="noindent">While many of the recipes in this book can be prepared with simple supermarket ingredients, there are some flavors particular to Spain that will render the dishes authentic and extra special. Luckily, most of the ingredients you’ll find described here—Spanish paprika, chorizo, serrano ham, sherry vinegar, and Spanish olive oil—are becoming easier to find at specialty markets. For others, see “Sources” on <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a> for mail-order information.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>ALMONDS:</strong></span> Almonds show up in myriad Spanish dishes from tapas to desserts. Good-quality regular ones will do fine in recipes that call for a small amount. For dishes that feature almonds prominently, it’s worth seeking out the remarkable marcona almonds grown along Spain’s Mediterranean coast. Flat, almost round, with a sort of crunch and a complex nuttiness, marconas are positively habit forming. You can find them at specialty food stores, such as Whole Foods or see “Sources” (<a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>).</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>ANCHOVIES:</strong></span> Salt curing fish has been a major industry in Spain since Roman times, and anchovies remain something of an addiction there—particularly the fatty, silky anchovy fillets cured in L’Escala in Catalonia or in the Basque portion of the Cantabrian coast. Look for good Spanish anchovies at better markets or order them by mail (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>). Some brands of imported Italian oil-packed anchovies are also outstanding. If supermarket anchovies are your only option, taste them before using; if they seem too salty, soak them in milk for about 30 minutes, then drain and rinse them, and toss with a little olive oil. If you’re not going to use the anchovies right away, cover them with olive oil. I don’t recommend using salt-packed anchovies—they <a id="page_456"/>are too much of a bother to clean.</p>
<p class="indent">The mild-flavored white Spanish anchovies called <em>boquerones,</em> which are cured in vinegar rather than in salt, are another treat. Ditto fresh anchovies. If you spot them at a fish market, grab them. Rinse the fish thoroughly and clean them as you would sardines (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_53">page 53</a>) but without boning. Cook fresh anchovies gently in olive oil, using the Fresh Sardines with Garlic and Parsley recipe (<a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_200">page 200</a>) as your blueprint.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>BEANS, CHICKPEAS &amp; LENTILS:</strong></span> Spanish dried beans and chickpeas are exceptional—creamy, firm, and supremely flavorful when cooked. Yes, they are expensive and must be ordered by mail (see “Sources,” <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>), but once you taste them it’s hard to go back to the supermarket variety. Try the big white beans called <em>judiones</em> or the Asturian <em>fabes de la granja,</em> which are so essential for making <em>fabada</em> (<a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_305">page 305</a>). Otherwise, I recommend seeking out good-quality organic dried beans and chickpeas. For canned beans and chickpeas, I like Goya’s. (You’ll find more about Spanish beans on <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_306">page 306</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Lentils in Spain come in several varieties, including the flat <em>castellanas,</em> which become creamy when cooked, and the small firm <em>pardinas</em>. Imported pardinas are super dried and need to be soaked overnight, but Goya’s <em>pardina</em> lentils don’t really need soaking, despite what the package says. French du Puy lentils are another good choice when you want firm cooked lentils.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>BREAD:</strong></span> From gazpachos to stews to sauces, many Spanish dishes are thickened with bread. When bread doesn’t go into a dish, it usually accompanies it. Look for good country loaves from a bakery. You want one with a rather dense crumb. For most of the canapé recipes in this book a good-quality French baguette will do just fine.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>CHEESE:</strong></span> Thankfully, markets in the United States are carrying more and more Spanish cheese, even if Manchego remains the most common kind. In recipes that call for aged Manchego, Parmesan or Romano can be substituted. (For information about specific Spanish cheeses see <a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_171">page 171</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>CHILES:</strong></span> <em>Spicy</em> isn’t a word one associates with Spanish cuisine, but mild, fleshy dried peppers are frequently used to add flavor and color to dishes. Spanish dried red pepper varieties include the dark, roundish ñoras, <em>romesco</em> peppers, and <em>pimientos choriceros.</em> Ñora peppers can be mail ordered (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>), or you can substitute dried ancho or New Mexico chiles, although the latter have quite tough skins. Pieces of small dried red guindilla peppers often impart a subtle accent of heat to garlicky dishes sautéed in olive oil, such as Sizzling Garlic Shrimp (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_49">page 49</a>). Mexican arbol chiles are a good stand-in. Mild green guindilla peppers packed in vinegar make an addictive Basque pickle and are essential to the briny skewer called the Gilda (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_26">page 26</a>); they are carried by Spanish markets (see “Sources,” <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>).</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>CHORIZO &amp; OTHER SAUSAGES:</strong></span> Chorizo is one of Spain’s most famous comestibles, a fabulous brick-colored sausage prepared with slight variations in various parts of the country. Normally, chorizo is made with pork (although venison or wild boar versions are also common), fat, and <em>pimentón,</em> which lends it its characteristic color and smokiness. In this country, chorizo comes in three varieties. Fully cured, dry chorizo, with a texture similar to pepperoni, is best for slicing and eating uncooked (the Palacios brand imported from Spain is excellent). <a id="page_457"/>Semicured, fully cooked soft chorizo, with a consistency similar to kielbasa, is what I recommend in most recipes. Fresh chorizo is raw, uncooked sausage, usually Mexican. While you shouldn’t substitute fresh chorizo for semi-cured, dry chorizo can be used in its place if this is all you can locate. If possible, use chorizo labeled Spanish or Spanish style; otherwise, use another type, such as the Goya brand, which is quite adequate and relatively easy to find. All the recipes in this book call for sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage.</p>
<p class="indent">Blood sausage (<em>morcilla</em>) has a wonderfully earthy flavor that is adored in Spain. <em>Morcilla</em> comes in two varieties: <em>morcilla de Burgos,</em> with rice; and <em>morcilla de cebolla,</em> with onions, which is the kind called for in this book. Spanish <em>morcilla</em> can be mail ordered (see “Sources,” <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>), or you can use another blood sausage, such as <em>boudin noir.</em></p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>HAM:</strong></span> Spanish cured ham is one of the world’s greatest ingredients. While the amazing ham from the <em>ibérico</em> pig is still unavailable in the United States at the time of publication, <em>jamón serrano</em> is becoming quite common at specialty food stores. For cooking, Italian prosciutto may be substituted. (For more about Spanish ham, see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_237">page 237</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>OLIVES:</strong></span> Spain boasts a huge range of table olives, yet the choice in America remains quite limited. The variety most commonly found are the fat, green manzanillas. They are sold loose or in jars or cans. Manzanilla olives stuffed with pimientos or anchovies are delicious. You might also be able to find the small, delicate greenish-brown jarred arbequina olives. Otherwise, use Mediterranean olives, such as the black niçoise or Gaeta olives; and green olives like Napflion, picholine, or lucque. Fat purple-black Greek olives, like kalamatas, don’t taste particularly Spanish.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>OLIVE OILS:</strong></span> Spain is the world’s largest producer of olive oil (see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#page_126">page 126</a> for more). And its varieties are reaching American markets in ever-increasing amounts. How to chose? First, determine your needs: sautéing, dressing a salad, baking, deep-frying, and/or drizzling on dishes as a garnish. For basic cooking needs, like sautéing, go with a tasty but inexpensive Spanish or Spanish-style extra-virgin oil, such as the Borges, Carbonell, or Goya brands. For deep-frying, many of the sturdier, inexpensive extra-virgin oils are perfectly fine. If you’re unsure, look for an oil simply labeled “olive oil” (without the words <em>virgin</em> or <em>extra-virgin</em>) or dilute extra-virgin olive oil with a vegetable oil such as canola; 60 percent olive oil and 40 percent vegetable oil is a good proportion.</p>
<p class="indent">In dishes where the particular flavor of olive oil is integral to the overall taste (in recipes calling for fragrant extra-virgin olive oil), make an effort to use a fine, fruity extra-virgin. Often, these will be delicate oils, not suitable for cooking, especially at high temperatures. Some of the bottles you’ll find in American markets will specify a particular olive varietal, such as the Catalan arbequina or Andalusian hojiblanca. Among the boutique olive oils available in the States that I especially like are Gasull, Soler Romero, Nuñez de Prado, Columela, and Siurana. But I urge you to experiment with different kinds to discover the range and flavor nuances of Spanish olive oils for yourself. Fine, delicate olive oils are best stored in a cool dark place.</p>
<p class="indent">The words <em>light</em> or <em>extra-light</em> on a bottle refer to the oil’s color and mildness of flavor. These are usually neutral-flavored, light-textured oils made with an extremely fine filtration process. I call for light oil in dishes where I don’t want a pronounced olive oil flavor; if you don’t have a bottle on hand, you can always blend extra-virgin oil with some canola or peanut oil.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_458"/><span class="blue"><strong>PAPRIKA:</strong></span> Smoked paprika (<em>pimentón de la Vera</em>) from Extremadura is one of the small glories of Spanish cuisine, imparting a special color and dusky earthiness to a great number of dishes. <em>Pimentón de la Vera</em> comes in three categories: <em>dulce,</em> or sweet; <em>agridulce,</em> or bittersweet; and <em>picante,</em> or hot. Because <em>pimentón dulce</em> is the easiest to find, this is what I suggest in most recipes. If you come across <em>pimentón picante,</em> buy that, too, and use it in dishes to add both smoke and heat. La Chinata <em>pimentón,</em> sold in red tins, is my favorite brand. Sweet unsmoked paprika (normally from Murcia) is likewise used widely in Spanish cuisine. As <em>pimentón de la Vera</em> has a very distinctive smoky aroma, don’t substitute it in recipes that call for unsmoked paprika. If you can’t find <em>pimentón,</em> use regular paprika. (To learn more about <em>pimentón de la Vera,</em> see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_84">page 84</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>PEPPERS:</strong></span> When buying fresh bell peppers, look for ones that are fleshy and deep colored—the redder the sweeter. Some recipes call for Italian (frying) peppers, which are pale green and have delicate skins. You should be able to find them easily at most markets. Piquillo peppers are the extraordinary, small pointy red peppers from Navarra. They are roasted over wood fires and packed in jars or cans, either slivered or whole. As demand for piquillo peppers grows, more and more specialty food stores are carrying them. Peppers from Lodosa (you’ll see it on the label) are best. (For more about piquillo peppers, see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_34">page 34</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>RICE:</strong></span> For paellas and other rice dishes, Spanish cooks normally rely on short- to medium-grain varieties grown in Valencia and Alicante. Such boutique Spanish rices as bomba can be found at some specialty markets or by mail order (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>), or you can use good-quality imported risotto rice, such as vialone nano or arborio. Long-grained rice is not very common in Spain. (For more about rice, see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_339">page 339</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>SAFFRON:</strong></span> Saffron is the gold of Spanish cuisine—and priced accordingly. However, if you choose saffron well and treat it right, a little goes along way. Some of the world’s best saffron is grown in La Mancha; Iranian saffron is excellent too. Buy saffron in threads rather than powdered, from a good producer, and keep it in a tightly closed container in a dry place away from sunlight.</p>
<p class="indent">Good saffron threads should be brittle; if yours seem limp or a little damp, wrap a pinch of saffron in a flat packet of aluminum foil and toast it in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 45 seconds per side. To extract maximum color and flavor from saffron, pulverize it into a powder with a mortar using a pestle (or crush it in a small cup with the back of a wooden spoon). Then, steep the saffron in a little very hot liquid for several minutes. You can always just crumble a few threads into the cooking liquid, but the results aren’t quite the same.</p>
<p class="indent">For the saffron measures in this book:</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• A large pinch is a scant ¼ teaspoon of crumbled loosely packed threads</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• A medium-size pinch is about ⅛ teaspoon</p>
<p class="bulletlist">• A small pinch is 8 to 10 threads</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>SALT:</strong></span> As a basic seasoning I recommend coarse salt, either kosher or sea. For sprinkling over finished dishes—even desserts—to create a textural accent, Spanish chefs love the flaky sea salt called Maldon. This salt is actually British; it comes in fabulous flat crunchy light flakes. Maldon salt is a bargain compared to the fancy French <em>fleur de sel</em> and can be found at such specialty food stores as Williams-Sonoma. Don’t miss it.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_459"/><span class="blue"><strong>SHERRY FOR COOKING:</strong></span> Most recipes in this book that include sherry call for dry (fino) sherry. While cooking sherry doesn’t need to be extra special, I don’t recommend cooking with sherry you wouldn’t want to drink (the same goes for cooking wine). If you happen to have some dry oloroso or amontillado on hand, you are welcome to use those in the recipes. Avoid cheap sweet sherries. (For more about sherry, see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_58">page 58</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>SQUID INK:</strong></span> Dishes tinted black with squid ink are dramatic and memorable. While extracting your own ink from squid is a bother, the packaged squid ink available at some better fish stores or by mail makes life much easier. Usually squid ink comes in four-gram clear plastic packages (.14 ounce). If the squid ink inside the package looks congealed, warm the package in a bowl of very hot water before opening it, then scrape the ink out with the tip of a dinner knife or a tiny coffee spoon. Packaged squid ink is inexpensive and keeps forever. I suggest buying more than you need to keep some for later. I store squid ink in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>CANNED TUNA:</strong></span> Even Michelin-starred chefs in Spain are hooked on canned tuna. When you taste top-grade Spanish <em>ventresca</em> (tuna belly), you’ll understand why. For the recipes in this book, look for canned tuna imported from Spain or Italy in specialty food stores or order Spanish tuna by mail (the Ortiz brand is excellent). Otherwise, use better-grade domestic tuna, such as Bumble Bee <em>tonno</em> in olive oil, Cento solid-pack light tuna, or Genovo light <em>tonno.</em> (For more about canned tuna, see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#page_114">page 114</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VINEGAR:</strong></span> Sherry, red, and white wine vinegars are all used in Spanish cooking. When buying sherry vinegar look for one labeled <em>reserva</em> (aged); some bottles will even indicate the number of years the vinegar has been aged (for more about sherry vinegar, see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#page_128">page 128</a>). For red wine vinegar, I recommend seeking out a good imported kind, especially when making sauces and salads. White wine vinegar in Spain is aromatic and mild; if yours is very sharp, use less or combine it with a little rice vinegar. Syrupy aged balsamic vinegar from Modena has become very popular among Spanish chefs, especially for drizzling over dishes before serving. True Modenese <em>aceto balsamico</em> is beautifully viscous, complex, and concentrated, a product drastically different from supermarket-style imitations. I strongly recommend investing in a bottle of the real stuff, to be used sparingly. However, you can reduce thin balsamic vinegar to achieve the syrupy consistency called for in the recipes here.</p>
