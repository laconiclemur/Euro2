<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ONION MARMALADE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">6⅔ cups halved and thinly sliced large white onions</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups dry white wine</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 thyme sprig</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 150°F. Put the rabbit legs on a baking sheet, season with salt and pepper, drizzle with the oill and scatter the thyme over, then cover with parchment paper. Cook overnight, or at least 10 hours. The next day, remove the baking sheet from the oven and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Turn the oven up to 315°F. Put the pearl onions and scallions on a baking sheet, brush with oil and roast 20 minutes. Remove the scallions and leave to one side, then roast the pearl onions 25 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and leave to one side, then turn the oven down to 150°F.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put the rabbit tenderloins on a baking sheet, season with salt and bake 12 minutes so they remain soft, then leave to one side. Take the leg meat off the bone and put in a large bowl. Strain the cooking juices through a fine strainer into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium and simmer 10 minutes, or until the liquid reduces by two-thirds. Shred the leg meat using forks, then stir in the parsley and reduced liquid.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> To assemble the terrine, use plastic wrap to line the bottom and sides of a 10- x 4- x 3-inch terrine, letting it hang over the sides. Cover the bottom with some of the rabbit leg mixture, then lay the pearl onions along the middle of the terrine at regular intervals. Cover with more of the rabbit leg mixture, then lay half of the tenderloins side by side along the middle. Put half the scallions on each side of the tenderloins and cover with more rabbit leg mixture. Repeat with the remaining tenderloins and scallions, then cover with the remaining rabbit leg mixture. Fold the plastic wrap over the terrine to cover completely, then put 2¼ to 2½ pounds of weights, such as a small bag of sugar wrapped in plastic wrap, on top. Leave in the refrigerator to chill at least 10 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> To make the onion marmalade, put the oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook slowly 15 minutes, or until soft, but not colored. Meanwhile, dissolve the sugar in the cider vinegar in a nonmetallic bowl. Add the vinegar solution to the pan with the wine, balsamic vinegar and thyme. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium and cook 15 minutes longer, stirring occasionally, then turn the heat down to medium and cook 10 minutes longer, or until the liquid becomes thick and syrupy. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the syrup to cool completely, then remove and discard the thyme and spoon the marmalade into a sterilized jar and seal. Serve the terrine with the onion marmalade. The marmalade can be stored in the refrigerator up to 2 months.</p>
