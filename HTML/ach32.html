<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ribollita</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="txit">Ribollita</span> means “reboiled” and describes a hearty traditional soup that is usually cooked over two or three days. In this recipe, Gianni has devised a short cooking method that still achieves the rich flavor attained by many hours of simmering.</p>
<p class="indent">The recipe calls for black cabbage, which is shaped like romaine lettuce, when it is in season. However, it may not be as widely available in America as it is in Italy, so we recommend Savoy cabbage, which has a short growing season but can be found in supermarkets here. If you cannot find either of these, use very thinly sliced tender green cabbage. (Do not use red cabbage, which has a strong flavor that tends to overpower the other vegetables in this soup.)</p>
<p class="indentb">In Italy ribollita has a thick consistency, closely resembling a vegetable stew. If you prefer a soupier dish, add more broth as desired. Top each serving with a wedge of sweet red onion.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_63"/><span class="red">1.</span> Air-dry the bread cubes overnight, or place them on a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 300° F, stirring occasionally, until dry but not brown, about 20 minutes. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Place the celery, carrots, onions, garlic, and olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot set over medium heat. Cook the vegetables until softened but not browned, about 15 minutes. Stir in the Swiss chard and cabbage, and cook to wilt slightly, about 1 minute. Add the parsley, sage, thyme, cheese rind, if using, and tomatoes. Simmer gently until the Swiss chard leaves have completely wilted, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken broth and the beans. Cover the pot, with the lid slightly askew. Slowly bring the soup to a boil and then simmer gently until the cabbage and chard are tender, about 20 minutes. The soup may be prepared up to this point and allowed to cool to room temperature for a few hours before reheating and serving.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Just before serving, add the bread cubes. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the cheese rind, if using. Spoon the soup into bowls, and drizzle some extra virgin olive oil on top of each bowl. Serve immediately.</p>
