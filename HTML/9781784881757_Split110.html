<p class="tx2"><b>Elena Rosini lives in a little second-floor flat in an old building in the heart of Siena. She works every day and likes to cook good, simple food for her and her partner. You can see the care she takes and that she cooks with love as she constantly tastes and adjusts the recipe.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>We visited Elena in summer and she showed us how to stuff and cook round courgettes (zucchini) and large tomatoes. However, she told us that throughout the year, from the first courgettes to summer aubergines (eggplants), autumn mushrooms and winter pumpkins (squash), there will be a way to stuff them. You can serve them at room temperature or hot, for summer or winter accordingly and, once cold, they reheat really well for a quick meal. Cooking them partially under foil stops them drying out and intensifies the flavour.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>8 large portobello mushrooms or 4 red (bell) peppers, halved, cored and seeds removed</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE SOFFRITTO</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small carrot, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 celery stalk and a few leaves, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of parsley, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE FILLING</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 garlic clove, peeled and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 g (1 lb 2 oz) minced (ground) meat (such as pork, beef, turkey or chicken)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan or Pecorino</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 egg</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Make the <i>soffritto</i> using the carrot, onion, celery and parsley together with the oil and some salt and pepper for 10–15 minutes over a low heat until soft (see <a href="9781784881757_Split11.html#page_28">soffritto</a>). If using mushrooms, finely chop the stalks and add to the <i>soffritto</i>.</p>
<p class="tx">To make the filling, heat the oil with the garlic and add a pinch of salt and pepper. Remove the <i>soffritto</i> from the heat and put it into a bowl with the minced meat, cheese, egg and a little more seasoning. Stir to combine.</p>
<p class="tx">Fill the mushroom or peppers with the filling mixture and lay them in an ovenproof dish. (Any leftover mixture can be made into patties and cooked alongside the vegetables). Drizzle over the remaining olive oil and pour in 100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) water around the vegetables. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to cook for around 15 minutes or until the meat is golden brown and the vegetables are cooked through. Serve with sautéed greens or any of the salads from <a href="9781784881757_Split54.html#page_87">sardine, borlotti &amp; celery salad</a> to <a href="9781784881757_Split56.html#page_91">farro, courgette, mint &amp; walnut salad</a>.</p>
