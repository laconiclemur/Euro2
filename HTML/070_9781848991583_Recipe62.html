<p class="normal"><b>I think rutabaga has been ignored for too long, but I feel it’s making a bit of a comeback. It certainly makes a great warming winter soup, which goes brilliantly with the sliced caramelized chestnuts.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 55 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 rutabaga, about 14 ounces total weight, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 butternut squash, about 1 pound</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 ounces total weight, peeled, seeded and diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small onion, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 cups Vegetable Stock (see <a href="010_9781848991583_Recipe4.html">page 17</a>), plus extra for thinning, if necessary</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespooons whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespooons whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup cooked whole chestnuts</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 400°F. Put the rutabaga in a roasting pan, drizzle the olive oil over and season with a little salt and pepper. Roast 5 minutes, then add the squash, stir to coat in the oil and continue roasting 7 to 10 minutes longer until the vegetables are just beginning to color around the edges but are not cooked through. Remove from the pan from the oven and drain the rutabaga and squash on paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Add half the butter and the onion and cook 3 to 4 minutes until it is just soft, but not colored. Add the roasted rutabaga and squash to the pan and toss together, then pour in the stock, cream and milk and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat down to low and simmer about 30 minutes, uncovered, until the vegetables are very soft. The soup must not boil or the cream will curdle.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> While the soup is cooking, make the caramelized chestnuts. Melt the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. When it is foaming, add the chestnuts and sugar and cook 3 to 4 minutes, turning the chestnuts over once, until they start to caramelize, but take care they don’t burn. Tip the chestnuts onto parchment paper and leave to cool and become crisp, then then roughly slice them.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> When the soup is ready, ladle it into a blender and blend until smooth. You might have to do this in batches, depending on the size of your blender. Pass the soup through a fine strainer into the cleaned pan; it should be very creamy and velvety. Season with salt and pepper to taste and warm the soup through. If you think it is a little thick, add some more stock. Serve drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and topped with the caramelized chestnuts.</p>
