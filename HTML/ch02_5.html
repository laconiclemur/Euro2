<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list11"><a id="pg34"/>PESCAÍTO FRITO</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">FRIED FISH</h2>
<p class="chap-opener1">The Spanish <span class="bold-italic">fritura</span> (a plate of fried food) is very delicate – crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. There is nothing better than fresh fried fish but it can be tricky to get right as there are so many variables: the freshness of the fish, the size of the pieces, the flour, the oil, the temperature, the cooking time, the draining… The reason why fried fish is so bloody good in southern Spain is purely because they have mastered this technique through sheer hard work and experience. And now I will tell you the secrets.</p>
<p class="chap-opener-indent">The perfect <span class="bold-italic">fritura</span> should have a mix of fish – I like to use squid, prawns and then some other small fish such as anchovies or whitebait. I wouldn’t recommend using anything bigger than 10 cm long.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 10 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 5 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 KG MIXED FISH, SUCH AS SQUID [FRESH OR FROZEN], WHITEBAIT, SPRATS, ANCHOVIES AND PRAWNS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">150 G SEVILLIAN FLOUR [COARSEWHEAT FLOUR], SUPERFINE SEMOLINA OR CHICKPEA FLOUR [SEE <a href="#note2">HERE</a>]</p>
<p class="recipe-list">MILD OLIVE OIL OR VEGETABLE OIL FOR FRYING</p>
<p class="recipe-list">SALT</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 LEMON, QUARTERED [OPTIONAL] ALIOLI, TO SERVE [SEE <a href="#pg44">HERE</a>]</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> If you are using frozen squid, always buy whole squid and let it thaw before cutting into rings yourself (chopped frozen squid tends to contain preservatives). If you are using fresh squid ask your fishmonger to clean it for you. Cut the body into rings and the tentacles into bite-sized pieces. Rinse the other fish in cold water and pat dry.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Spread the flour out in a shallow dish and start coating the squid rings, tentacles and fish. Make sure none of the pieces are stuck together and are completely covered with the flour – use more if necessary.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg36"/><span class="no">3</span> Heat the oil in a large deep-sided pan until a cube of day-old bread dropped into it turns golden brown in 20–30 seconds. Alternatively heat a deep fryer to 190°C. One of the biggest issues when frying in a pan is that the temperature of the oil can drop quickly, which means you won’t get that nice crispness on the outside. To avoid this, keep the oil as hot as you can and cook the fish in batches.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Put the floured fish pieces in the oil and fry for 1–1½ minutes, depending on the size. Stir carefully so that the pieces don’t get stuck together and turn so that they brown on all sides. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and toss them in a bowl with some salt. You can drain on kitchen paper but this will make them soggier as any contact with a solid surface will make the steam escaping from inside of the fish condense and will be absorbed by the fried flour.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Serve immediately with alioli and lemon wedges (although I’m a purist and prefer my <i>fritura</i> without lemon).</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="note2">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Coarse wheat flour, semolina flour or chickpea flour are all perfect for this recipe as they create an airy film around the fish, which allows the steam to escape, resulting in a crisper coating.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">CLAMS WITH GARLIC AND PARSLEY</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">I love clams – well – I love shellfish in all its incarnations. A lot of Spanish cooking is about the quality and freshness of the ingredients and as the sea surrounds our peninsula, shellfish features heavily. We tend to do very little to it, except treat it with the respect it deserves. Garlic and parsley are classic shellfish flavourings and are all it takes to create a star dish.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4–5 AS A TAPA</p>

<p class="recipe-list">150 ML WHITE WINE [I LIKE TO USE SOMETHING FRUITY – IT GOES WELL WITH THE FINISHED DISH TOO]</p>
<p class="recipe-list">SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Start by soaking the clams in cold water for about 20 minutes to allow them to release any sand trapped in their shells. Rinse thoroughly under cold water and discard any that are open, broken or that don’t close firmly when tapped.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Put the oil in a large frying pan (wide enough to hold all the clams) and add the garlic and chillies. Place over a high heat and start frying from cold, until light golden. Add the chopped parsley, flour, salt and pepper and stir for 1 minute.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Pour in the white wine and stir vigorously so that the flour and wine are well combined. Add the cleaned clams, sauté a couple of times and cover with a lid for 2 minutes. Remove the lid and sauté a couple more times. By this time all the clams should have opened, if not, cover and cook for another minute. Discard any clams that refuse to open and serve immediately with lots of fresh bread to mop up the sauce.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">You may have picked up by now that the Spanish can sit and chat for hours while eating – we call this ‘sobremesa’. Whether seated round a table or propped up at a tapas bar, it’s a cultural and social thing for us. The great thing about clams is that they take longer to eat than to cook and are perfect for chatty, social occasions.</p>

If you don’t want to flambé the sherry don’t worry, just cook for 1 minute so that the alcohol evaporates. Add the cleaned clams to the pan, turn up the heat and shake the pan vigorously, tossing the clams a couple of times. Season to taste and stir in the parsley, cover with a lid and cook for 2–3 minutes until the clams are fully opened (throw away any that remain closed). Stir again before serving with lots of fresh bread to soak up the sauce.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1" id="note3">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Fino (which translates as refined) is the driest of all sherry varieties and should be drunk cold. This delicate sherry doesn’t keep well after the bottle is opened, so make the best use of it.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">PRAWNS WITH GARLIC</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">You’ll find this dish in pretty much every tapas bar in every coastal town in Spain, as well as in all the major cities. We love our fish and shellfish so much that the capital, Madrid (which is in the middle of mainland Spain), is a major fresh fish importer, second only to Tokyo. There are two ways of preparing this dish, depending on whether or not you want to peel the prawns before cooking. Traditionally this would be cooked in a flameproof terracotta dish, in which you then serve the prawns – if you don’t have one you can use an ordinary frying pan and leave the heads and shells on. I love these either way.</p>

Take care not to burn yourself as the oil and the terracotta will stay hot for several minutes.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">GRIDDLED PRAWNS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">‘A la plancha’ is more of a technique than a recipe – you can cook anything this way, from pork chops, to langoustines, to asparagus.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 2</p>

<p class="recipe-list">1 LEMON WEDGE [OPTIONAL]</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Cooking a la plancha at home requires an extremely hot pan, as hot as it can get. Place a large heavy-based frying pan over a high heat. While the pan is heating up sprinkle the rock salt over the surface. When the pan is searing hot, place the prawns on top of the salt.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Mix the garlic, parsley and olive oil in a bowl.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> After 2 minutes, drizzle the prawns with the garlic and parsley oil and turn them over. Because the pan is so hot the oil will immediately smoke a lot, but this will give the distinctive aroma of the plancha style of cooking. Cook the prawns for another minute or two, depending on the size.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> If you like, squeeze over some lemon juice before transferring to a plate – although I have to say I prefer these just as they are.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Call me a purist but I prefer not to put anything on these – even lemon juice. The thing about lemon juice is that to me it has become a bit like dolloping ketchup, mayonnaise or chilli oil all over your food. I like to taste the pure flavour of what I’ve just cooked. Otherwise everything sort of starts to taste the same.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">There are two techniques for cooking a la plancha: prawns cooked in their shells are cooked over a generous amount of rock salt so that the shellfish are hardly in full contact with the pan itself. When cooking a scallop, a razor clam or simply a lamb cutlet, the seasoning would be on the food and not on the pan, allowing the ingredient to caramelize properly.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list16">ALIOLI</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">GARLIC MAYONNAISE</h2>
<p class="chap-opener1">I’m not sure whether you would call this a sauce or a dip but this garlicky mayonnaise is a real favourite in Spain, particularly along the eastern Mediterranean coast, where it is traditionally from. As well as being delicious for dipping bread, alioli goes brilliantly well with many fish dishes, including Pescaito Frito (<a href="#pg34">here</a>) and Fideua (<a href="ch07.html#pg175">here</a>). Its intense garlicky flavour is what makes it so addictive – as anyone knows, our love affair with garlic is profound. Over the years I have developed and perfected three different ways of making alioli, depending on how I want to use it.</p>
<p class="chap-opener-indent">Before we start, I’d like to point out that in my opinion the best alioli – and I’ve made a few in my time – is made with a Spanish olive oil produced from Arbequina olives. It is smooth and full of fresh fruit aromas as well as a little astringent.</p>

<p class="chap-opener">In Spain we have been fishing and eating cod for centuries and it is probably the fish that I have cooked and eaten the most throughout my life.

It can handle strong, robust flavours too, such as this ratatouille-like sauce.</p>

<p class="recipe-head1" id="note4">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">In Spain ‘bacalao’ refers to both fresh cod and cured or salted cod, and for me (and most Spaniards) salted cod probably has the edge over fresh cod in terms of flavour. I’ve been eating cod since I was a child and I have noticed that the flavour has changed – it has less character than before. More and more people are eating cod and when it is farmed (as opposed to wild) it just doesn’t taste as good. If you want to recapture some of that intensity of flavour, I recommend you try my trick of salting the cod to dehydrate it slightly. Always use good-quality sea salt (never table salt) and make sure you rinse and pat dry the fish afterwards. Go on – try it and you will feel and taste the difference.</p>
<p class="recipe-para">You can also make this dish using salt cod. First rinse the cod well under cold water and then leave to soak in a large bowl of cold water in the fridge for at least 24 hours. You’ll need to change the water at least three times in this time. Once the fish has been soaked, rinsed and patted dry, it is ready to use as above.</p>

Remove the pan from the heat to let the oil cool slightly, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Add the cod fillets – they will fry at the beginning but will very quickly stop bubbling. The idea is to cook the loins in the infused oil at a very low temperature – like a confit. You will start to notice some liquid being released from the fish – this will form the base of our sauce and will be used to create an emulsion with the infused oil (like a mayonnaise). After 10 minutes reduce the heat to low, return the pan to the heat and let the cod cook, without letting it bubble, for 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg56"/><span class="no">4</span> To make the sauce, the easiest way is to remove the cod from the pan carefully and set aside. Use a large spoon to scoop out as much oil as possible from the pan; keep this oil to one side. Use a whisk or the bottom of a sieve (the tiny holes create good friction) to vigorously stir the juices in the bottom of the pan and gradually pour back in the oil that you removed, until the pil pil sauce is formed – it should start to look a bit like mayonnaise. You can also do this with the cod loins still in the pan – just scoop out the oil as before but shake the pan carefully but constantly (so as not to break up the fish) while pouring in the oil a little at a time.</p>
