<p class="author1"><span class="txit">vegetali arrostito</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My mother created this recipe a few years ago after noticing that almost every cooking show and food magazine was featuring recipes for roasted vegetables. “I decided to try my own version,” says Joan. “I mixed together my favorite vegetables—potatoes, butternut squash, zucchini, carrots—and cooked the firm ones first, adding the softer ones later so they retained their shapes and fresh flavors. The marinara sauce and balsamic vinegar nicely accent this dish.” Serve with grilled chicken or fish.</p>
