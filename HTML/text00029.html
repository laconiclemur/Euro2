</h1>
<p class="pf">A piece of me died when I visited the school of my childhood a couple of years ago, the school I attended from grade one to high school graduation. Oh, the new school is lovely, efficient, and modern, and so much more attuned to the needs of today’s students. But I missed the old one.</p>
<p>In the school of my youth, there were three round windows in each classroom’s art deco wooden door. The windows were positioned one above the other, so that even the shortest child could peer in from the lowest window. Those windows appear in my dreams from time to time. The hallway floors were of a solid material, not asphalt tiles, and they were polished to a bright sheen. At the beginning of the school year, the whole school smelled of wax and fresh varnish.</p>
<p>On the first level at the end of one hallway was the first-grade room with its faint smell of crayons, paper, and tempera paints mixed with the mint of white wintergreen–flavored library paste. Some kids used to eat the library paste. I never did. The ceilings were high and the huge double-hung windows could be opened to let in fresh air.</p>
<p>For all of my twelve years at the Lincoln School in Floodwood, Adelaide Orr was the fourth-grade teacher. She had a barrel-like stature with skinny legs and hair pulled back into a bun. The bad boys used to chant a naughty rhyme about her: “Old Lady Orr, shit on the floor and wiped her ass on the knob of the door.” I wonder if she ever knew about that little jingle. I could never repeat it myself; in fact, it was hard even to write it down—but it is a part of history. I had trouble visualizing the scene.</p>
<p>There was one especially outstanding teacher at the Floodwood School—Tom Riley. He was tall and bony and combed his charcoal-gray hair straight back. He wore big thick glasses that sat on his long, straight nose and magnified his eyes</p>
<p>Mr. Riley was my favorite teacher. Not because he was especially nice to me, but because I really learned a lot from him. He taught chemistry and physics and explained things so clearly that I could really visualize what he was saying. The laws of physics seemed so sensible after he explained them.</p>
<p>“For every force, there is an equal and opposite force,” he’d practically shout. Then he went on to explain how you could balance any two bodies on a teeter-totter by placing the heavier one nearer the center.</p>

<p>I remember memorizing the periodic table. Not because I was supposed to, but because it hung in the front of the classroom—a large poster with colorful squared-off blocks, each with the symbol of all the elements from which the entire world is made.</p>
<p>“Oxygen (O) loves hydrogen (H), so much that one oxygen can connect with two hydrogens to make water,” he said. “So the formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>
O.” I pictured oxygen holding hands with two hydrogens as they walked down a path.</p>
<p>The whole school had only one movie projector and it seemed it was never working the way it should. <i>Call Riley!</i>
 Mr. Riley would come into the classroom and do something to the projector, and would always make it work.</p>
<p>The Rileys were staunch Catholics. His wife, Del, was proud of her heritage and could trace her relations back to the Revolutionary War. She was, in fact, a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her husband, however, never bothered to trace his heritage. In his words, “Hell, they probably hung half of them!”</p>
<p>The school had a gymnasium where all our important gatherings were held, as well as basketball games, plays, and even graduation ceremonies. In the winter our physical education classes were held in that gym. The room had huge pillars at least three feet in diameter. One day we were playing a game called “crack the whip,” and I was at the end of the “whip.” You were supposed to hang on tight to the next player. I went flying into one of those pillars, and instead of cracking the whip, I cracked my collarbone!</p>
<p>Thinking of that gymnasium and the stage brings back the memory of the tragic death of one of my classmates in a hunting accident. It was traumatic because it was the first time I had experienced the death of somebody I knew well. I was probably in fifth grade. His funeral was held in the gymnasium. The old gym shows up often in my dreams. The hymn “My Faith Looks Up to Thee” always conjures up the deep emotion of this first loss of a friend in a terrible accident.</p>
<p>There was also the home economics classroom, which was the site of the 4-H demonstration competitions every summer. The room held the faint smell of onions, spices, and cooking, though the kitchen was always sparkling clean and had that “neat and put away” look to it.</p>
<p>The school in those days didn’t have a parking lot for anything but the half dozen big yellow buses that backed up side by side to load and unload kids. Kids didn’t have cars until many years later. Those who lived in town walked to school and us country kids rode the bus. If I missed the bus I had to walk four miles along back roads to get home. This didn’t happen often. But when it did, there were always interesting things to see along the way. I’d walk along Highway 8 across the bridge over the St. Louis River, past the Tahjas’ farm, then to the corner and past the Dahlbackas’ place. Then, past the Jensens’ and on to the next corner. To the right there was the Matalamakis’ farm, then on the other side of the road the Baileys’ farm. After that it was about another three-quarters of a mile to an intersection that we called “four corners.” A family of skunks lived in that stretch, and I had to be careful not to disturb them.</p>
<p>Four corners was often the place where the big yellow school bus picked us up when the roads were muddy. Spring air. I loved the smell of wet mud, the aroma of new leaves on the poplar trees—and the unmistakable aroma of new buds on the balsams. One mile more to get home and sometimes I’d just drag myself along enjoying the countryside. I’d walk to the “blueberry corner” remembering the fall when the blueberries were so abundant that we could “milk” them into our pails. Then on to Faegre’s corner, and I’d at last turn down onto our driveway—the quarter mile rimmed by the very pine trees that Isä had planted. It was at this corner that I could smell when Mummy had baked bread. Ahh, the aroma!</p>

<p>When the school bus dropped us off at that corner, at the end of that driveway, the aroma of fresh-baked bread gave us the incentive to run home. There on the counter of the kitchen would be the fat, round loaves, propped up against each other as they cooled. Mummy would order us to hold off on the bread until suppertime, or else we wouldn’t have an appetite. On more than one occasion we would dig a hole through the back crust of a loaf and pull out the warm puffs of bread until the loaf was nothing but a buttered shell.</p>
