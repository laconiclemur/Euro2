<p class="noindent">Stopping on a small hilltop to rest, I suddenly got the feeling that I had been at this same place before. I could swear that the bare rocks I was sitting on had exactly the same pattern as the ones I had stopped by three days (and half a dozen blisters) ago. The landscape also looked familiar. From where I was sitting, I could see green moors, dotted with white bog cotton and long stretches of red heather, framed by a mountain ridge that looked like a row of falling dominos. A deep, calm tiredness penetrated my body. Through my drooping eyelids I could see a small group of grouse landing near some juniper bushes less than two hundred feet from me. I leaned back and fell asleep in the warm, soft light of the August sun.</p>
<p class="indent">In the wilderness of the Norwegian highlands, life is different. Time does not stand still, but it does move with a different pace from the rest of the world. I had walked for nearly three days and met only two other people. Walking westward, I had seen the landscape slowly change, <a id="page_204"/>snow-capped mountains appearing and disappearing in the distance to the north and south of me, sometimes pointed and dramatic, sometimes just soft curves of gray without anything to fix one’s eye on. At times, the landscape seemed oddly familiar, like a <em>déjà vu,</em> in which the landscape of my mind was merging with the physical landscape.</p>
<p class="indent">I was in my own company but not lonely. On the first, windy night, I had tented in a level between two small hilltops, clearly a popular spot. The grass bore marks that a deer or some other wild animal had slept there before me. In the morning, I awoke to find that a local fox had marked his territorial demands, and displeasure with my company, just outside the tent. The second night, I had camped in one of the old unmanned log cabins that have been set up to accommodate travelers. I shared the small cabin with a hunter and his dog. In the evening we ate supper together. When I woke the next morning, he had already departed, leaving me a grouse from his rich catch. It was still in its plumage, and looked almost alive, as if it were just resting on the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Here on the hilltop, the noisy flight of grouse woke me from my slumber. While I had slept, the sun had crept considerably lower on the horizon. I decided not to walk any farther that day and set up camp for the night while it was still light. Summer fades quickly in late August; the days were getting shorter and there was a cool current in the air, signaling that autumn was right around the corner.</p>
<p class="indent">I set up my tent, plucked the grouse, and went over to the juniper bushes where the flock of grouse had been feasting. Juniper is a favorite of grouse, and nearly all the ripe berries had been picked by the hungry visitors. Only the green unripe berries of next year were left, but after a careful search of the lowest sprigs I managed to find a small handful of ripe violet fruit that the grouse had not had time to harvest before their departure.</p>
<p class="indent">I cooked the grouse on my old camp stove, using nothing but butter, salt and pepper, and the juniper berries. It certainly shouldn’t have been the best grouse I had ever eaten: When cooked right, grouse can be wonderfully tender and juicy; this one, however, was definitely tough and more than a little dry. Juniper berries can be overpowering, and my berries were far too much; I should have used only half, perhaps a third of what I did. And, to properly enjoy grouse, with its strong yet sophisticated flavor, one should serve it with fine wine and some hearty vegetables such as Brussels sprouts or rutabaga; I had only stale bread, marsh water, and a little cheap whiskey.</p>
<p class="indent">But somehow it was the best grouse I had ever tasted. There and then on that hilltop overlooking nothing but the soft green, white, and red landscape, it was perfect. After I had sopped up the last cooking juices from the pan, and finished the last drop of whiskey, I sat back and watched the sun set. And for a very long while I thought of nothing.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS A DISH INSPIRED BY EYVIND HELLSTRØM, THE CHEF-OWNER OF OSLO’S RESTAURANT BAGATELLE. IF YOU CANNOT FIND GROUSE, YOU CAN USE PARTRIDGE OR PHEASANT (SEE <a class="nounder" href="source.html#page_294">MAIL-ORDER SOURCES</a>).</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 2 AS A MAIN COURSE, 4 AS AN APPETIZER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 grouse (see headnote)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 juniper berries, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped shallots</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups boiling water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup finely chopped celeriac</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup finely chopped carrot</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium pears, such as Anjou, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound wild mushrooms, trimmed, cleaned, and cut into 1½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 teaspoons red currant jelly or preserves</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">With a sharp knife, cut off the whole breast section of each bird. Cut the legs, thighs, and carcasses into smaller pieces. Season the breasts with the juniper and salt and pepper and set aside at room temperature for 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">To make the sauce, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small pot over medium heat until it bubbles energetically. Sauté 2 tablespoons of shallots and half the garlic for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chopped pieces of grouse and sauté for 3 minutes. Add the boiling water, bay leaf, peppercorns, celeriac, and carrot, bring to a boil, and with a spoon, skim off the foam that has gathered on the surface. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain into a small saucepan and reduce to ⅓ cup. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In an ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the grouse breasts skin side down and cook for 6 minutes, turning every now and then. Transfer the pan to the middle of the oven and cook for 12 to 15 minutes (8 to 10 minutes if deboned), until the interior temperature reaches 140°F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">While the grouse are resting, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pears and rosemary and cook, stirring <a id="page_207"/>occasionally, for 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside, covered to keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in the same skillet, over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and the remaining shallots and garlic and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender. Season liberally with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the chives before serving.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Just before serving, bring the reduced stock to a boil. Stir in the mustard, red currant jelly, and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Season with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cut the breasts from the bone, slice them, and place them on warm plates. Add the pears and mushrooms, pour the sauce over the grouse breasts, and serve.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Grouse has delicious but very lean meat, and if you overcook it, it becomes very tough. The best way to prevent this is to cook the grouse breast on the bone, which helps keep the meat juicy. Use an instant-read thermometer for the best result.</p>
<p class="noindentt">You need to get whole grouse in order to make the delicious stock-based sauce. If you would like to use more of the bird, you could cook the legs in duck fat for 2 hours at 200°F to make delicious grouse confit.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4 TO 6</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 4-pound free-range chicken</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chopped dill, plus 1 large bunch fresh dill</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 to 6 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, thoroughly washed and cut into 2-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 garlic cloves, unpeeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups chicken stock</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh dill for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Lemon wedges and grated lemon zest for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the chicken with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine the butter and chopped dill. Rub the chicken with about 2 tablespoons of the dill butter. Carefully lift up the skin from the chicken breasts at the cavity, using your fingers or a blunt knife to loosen the skin; be careful not to tear it. Insert about 1 tablespoon of the dill butter under the breast skin and make sure that the skin covers the meat afterward. Refrigerate the remaining butter. Fill the cavity of the chicken with the lemon quarters and the bunch of dill.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the chicken breast side up on a V-shaped rack in a roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on the middle oven rack and cook the chicken for 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Remove the chicken from the oven and rub with about 1 tablespoon of the dill butter, holding the butter in your fingers. When most of the butter has melted and you are at risk of burning your fingers, place the remaining lump on the breast of the chicken.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Fill the pan with the leeks, potatoes, and garlic and add the chicken stock. Turn the chicken breast side down and place it in the roasting pan. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Return the roasting pan to the oven and roast for 50 to 60 more minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Test for <a id="page_209"/>doneness by piercing it with a sharp knife at the thickest part of the thigh; the juices should run clear. (If there is any trace of pink in the juices, return the chicken to the oven.) Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let it rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Check the potatoes for doneness. If they are still firm, increase the oven temperature to 400°F and continue baking until the potatoes are nice and tender. Squeeze the garlic out of their skins. Leave the roasting pan in the oven with the heat turned off.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the potatoes, leeks, and garlic to a serving platter. Carve the chicken at the table (discard the lemon and dill inside the cavity).</p>
<p class="noindentt">Garnish with dill and lemon wedges and sprinkle lemon zest on top.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dill is one of Scandinavia’s favorite herbs, one that grows willingly in the cool Nordic climate. Historically, it has been important in traditional herbal medicine; dill water was used to soothe children. In fact, the name <em>dill</em> is of Nordic origin, <em>dilla</em> meaning “to lull” in Old Norse.</p>
<p class="noindentt">When I made this dish on <em>New Scandinavian Cooking,</em> we were on a farm in Lom, in the highlands, a region often referred to as the Provence of Norway. The dill grown on the farm was so good that I ate it on or with everything I put in my mouth.</p>

Serve with bread to sop up the cooking juices.</p>

<p class="noindent">Chicken is popular in Scandinavia, but today preparations do not differ much from those found in other northern European and American cuisines. If we go back in time, however, we find some unique spicy chicken dishes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">This recipe is taken from a medieval cookbook discovered in Iceland, and probably dates back to the fourteenth century. The book is really nothing more than a manuscript with helpful hints and very few directions, and I have adapted the recipe considerably for modern cooking methods.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The inclusion of saffron and cinnamon indicates that this was food for the wealthy—and is a reminder of how international the Scandinavian elite was in its orientation. Since the easiest way to travel was by sea, it was often easier to travel between remote ports in different countries than to go inland.</p>
