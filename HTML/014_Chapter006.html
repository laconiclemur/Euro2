  <p class="h3">Red Fruit Sauce (Rød fruktsaus)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Red fruit sauce is the crowning glory to mousse, puddings, and rice-cream. Make it from currant, cherry, strawberry, or raspberry juice—they are all delicious.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) juice of your choice</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. potato flour</p>

  <p class="ing">Sugar if needed</p>

  <p class="ingl">Cold water</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring juice to a boil. Meanwhile dissolve potato flour with a little water. Remove juice from heat and slowly add the potato flour thickening, stirring constantly to assure its smoothness. Bring quickly to a boil and remove from heat. If cooking period is prolonged the sauce may become thin or even elastic. The sauce should be smooth and not too thick. Pour sauce into a pitcher or other suitable container and sprinkle a little sugar over the top to prevent film from forming. Chill.</p>

  <p class="h3">Rich Vanilla Sauce (Fin vaniljesaus)</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Most homes used two types of vanilla sauce,</span> fin <span class="italic">(rich), which was reserved for birthdays, special holidays, and guests; and</span> hverdags, <span class="italic">everyday, vanilla sauce.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">½ vanilla bean, sliced lengthwise</p>

  <p class="ing">3 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) light cream</p>

  <p class="ing">2–3 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. vanilla sugar or extract</p>

  <p class="ingl">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place the split vanilla bean in a heavy saucepan and pour in cream. Bring the cream to a boil over moderate heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand approximately 10–15 minutes so the sauce will absorb the flavor of the vanilla bean. Remove the bean. Using a wire whisk, in a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together and add to the cream. Put the sauce over low heat until it thickens, while stirring. Remove from heat and stir from <a id="page_37"/>time to time as it cools. Add additional sugar to taste. Whip the cream and add just before serving. Serve with baked apples, chocolate pudding, or fruit desserts or pies.</p>
