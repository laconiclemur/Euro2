<p class="noindent">The Spanish seafood experience goes something like this: You enter a nautically themed dining room swathed in dark, gleaming wood and make your way to an open-air terrace overlooking a working harbor. Around you, men in striped shirts are sucking the sweet, briny juices from shrimp heads. Platters of salt-grilled whole fish, piles of saucy clams, and kettles of seafood stews are rushed out of the kitchen, landing on tables occupied by large, unruly families. Finally, the proprietor approaches your table. He carries himself with the gravitas of a heart surgeon—discussing your order as if your entire well-being depended on it. A few seafood <em>croquetas</em> and bacalao fritters to start—check. Half a dozen <em>almejas de Carril,</em> the astronomically expensive Galician clams, eaten raw without as much as a squeeze of lemon—double check. Do <a id="page_186"/>you want your <em>camarones</em>—translucent shrimp, heads and all—boiled or <em>a la plancha?</em> Alas, the kitchen just ran out of turbot. A butterflied sole grilled over a wood fire instead? You nod yes to all, knowing that you might have to wager your inheritance on this meal.</p>
<p class="indent">It doesn’t matter. Side orders? Nah. At the best Spanish seafood restaurants, there’s no room for side dishes or garnishes; no elaborate sauces; no frills. What you get is an austerely elegant meal of sublime <em>materia prima,</em> possibly a glass of brandy on the house, and a Havana <em>puro,</em> if you happen to smoke.</p>
<p class="indent">A peninsula flanked by the Atlantic, Cantabrian, and Mediterranean seas, Spain boasts more than 3,000 miles of coastline and some of the world’s most prodigious fishing fleets. What comes out of its waters is so extraordinary, and treated by cooks with such savvy and care, that at times it seems like all my travels in Spain can be summed up as a collage of great seafood meals. I close my eyes, thinking of a <em>chiringuito</em> (a seafood shack) on an Andalusian beach: the dime-size purple-shelled clams called <em>coquinas,</em> the salty pungency of the air, the crunch of fried baby squid. Then my thoughts turn to Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Three things draw visitors to this sherry-producing Andalusian town where the Guadalquivir river empties into the Atlantic. One is manzanilla, the queen of dry sherries, with a unique salty tang. Two is <em>langostinos,</em> the fat, succulent prawns that rank among the country’s most sought-after crustaceans. Three is the chance to savor the two together at sunset at one of the restaurants on the water’s edge, watching the blazing red sun slowly sink into the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="indent">Galicia conjures up images of grilled sardines with new potatoes, wooden boards of sliced octopus dusted with paprika, glasses of fresh albariño, and mounds of <em>percebes,</em> or goose barnacles, which look like strange prehistoric claws and explode with warm marine juices when you break them apart. A Basque seafood repast revolves <a id="page_187"/>around line-caught hake in a delicate <em>salsa verde, kokotxas</em> (hake cheeks) fried in the lightest of batters, anchovies bathed in garlicky olive oil, and—always—a magnificent whole grilled turbot. Say Valencia and Catalonia, and I imagine the messy fishermen’s stews called <em>suquets</em> and seafood bobbing in kettles of terra-cotta-colored <em>romesco,</em> a sauce so delicious one could happily drown in it.</p>
<p class="indent">Wherever you go in Spain, you find bacalao—salted dried cod—recipes for which could fill many volumes. Modern Spanish cooks may be fanatical about freshness, yet it was preserved fish—anchovies, salt cod, cured tuna, and the various <em>escabeches</em>—that formed the backbone of the country’s traditional diet. Today these flavors are as sought after as ever.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to seafood, sophisticated simplicity is the mantra in contemporary Spanish kitchens. Rather than waste time on complicated constructions and fancy garnishes, Spanish chefs are pushing the envelope by devising novel techniques designed to bring out the fish’s flavor and texture. Delicate hake might be submerged in olive oil and poached at a radically low temperature, emerging from the pan moister than any fish you’ve tasted before. Bacalao, which can overcook and toughen in a nanosecond, could be poached <em>al vacío</em> (vacuum-packed) in a high-tech bain-marie, so that it has all the succulence of fresh fish. Sauces may be thickened with flavorless, colorless agar-agar (Asian gelatin), whipped into diaphanous foams and “airs,” or reimagined as infused broths or gelées.</p>
<p class="indent">From robust fish and potato dishes traditionally prepared aboard trawlers, to kettles of shellfish flavored with garlic and olive oil, to quick but sophisticated modern creations, the recipes in this chapter are a seafood lover’s delight.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">ROAST COD IN RED BELL PEPPER BROTH</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BACALAO EN CALDO DE PIMIENTOS ASADOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This is my take on a fetching dish I tasted at Kukuarri, a restaurant in San Sebastián that belongs to the empire of Michelin three-star Basque chef Martin Berasategui. There, it was prepared with a beautifully moist loin of salt cod, but fresh cod makes a better substitute than the dried-out bacalao most commonly available in the States. The flavors here are minimalist and memorable: a great piece of fish and a grilled scallion spear afloat in a rust-colored broth infused with broiled red peppers. The recipe calls for straining out the peppers, but if you like you can add some to the broth. Or, toss the peppers with some sherry vinegar and good olive oil and use them on sandwiches or grilled chicken or fish. The pepper broth can be prepared ahead and reheated.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 small dried pimiento choricero or ancho chile, stemmed and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut in half lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the vegetables</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 fat scallions, trimmed, with 2½ inches of green</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>) or store-bought fish stock, or 1½ cups bottled clam juice diluted with ½ cup water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of sugar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 thick skinless cod fillets (each about 1 inch thick; about 2 pounds total)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the <em>pimiento choricero</em> in a small bowl, add very hot water to cover, and let soak while you broil the red peppers and scallions.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Arrange the red peppers on a broiler pan lined with aluminum foil and brush lightly with olive oil. Broil the peppers until they are soft and charred, about 12 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand for 15 minutes (leave the broiler turned on). While the peppers are standing, place the scallions on the broiler pan, brush them lightly with olive oil, and broil until soft and lightly charred, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the scallions to a plate and set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Peel the broiled peppers and chop them coarsely. Drain the <em>pimiento choricero.</em> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until limp but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add the <a id="page_189"/><em>pimiento choricero</em> and red peppers and stir for 1 minute. Add the fish stock and bring to a simmer. Add the vinegar and sugar, cover the saucepan, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes to infuse the broth. Taste for seasoning, adding more sugar as necessary. Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine sieve, pressing on the peppers to extract as much liquid as possible. Puree ½ cup of the strained peppers in a blender with a little of the strained broth. Stir the pureed pepper mixture into the remaining strained broth. Save the rest of the strained peppers for another use. The pepper broth can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 1 day.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 500°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Place the parsley and garlic in a mini food processor and finely chop them. Scrape the parsley mixture into a small bowl and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season the cod generously with salt. Arrange the cod on a small oiled baking sheet and spread some of the parsley mixture on top of each fillet. Bake the cod until it just flakes when prodded with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> While the cod is baking, reheat the pepper broth. To serve, place each cod fillet in a shallow soup plate with a grilled scallion and pour about ½ cup of the pepper broth around it. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3a">MALLORCAN BRAISED GROUPER</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>AMFOS A LA MALLORQUINA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Those seeking truly authentic Mallorcan cuisine, uncorrupted by the tastes of the northern European tourists who descend on the island in droves, should head to Es Baluard restaurant in Palma. Here, chef Joan Torrens lovingly preserves old recipes, modernizing them slightly but always staying true to the vibrant simplicity of the local traditions. One of his signature dishes is this fish, slowly braised in the oven on a bed of potatoes and capped with a mouthwatering ragout of red and yellow bell peppers, tomatoes, and chard. Currants and pine nuts, which are used liberally in Joan’s kitchen, add the Moorish accent characteristic of Mallorcan cuisine. In fact, the dish brings to mind the food of Sicily—another cuisine that melds <a id="page_190"/>Mediterranean and Arab flavors to seductive effect. The recipe is a bit more involved than just plonking fish in the oven, but the result is a marvelous one-dish meal that requires nothing more than a salad of peppery greens.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling over the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size white onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 medium-size garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 roasted red bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut into strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 roasted yellow bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut into strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large vine-ripened tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ cups chopped Swiss chard (leaves only)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size bunch flat-leaf parsley (leaves only), chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dried currants</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 thick grouper steaks (about 2 pounds total; see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#ch07_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large Yukon Gold potatoes (about 2 pounds total), boiled and sliced ¼ inch thick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup pine nuts</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add the paprika and red pepper flakes and stir for a few seconds. Add the roasted red and yellow peppers and the tomatoes, increase the heat to medium, and cook until the tomatoes begin to release their juice, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chard and parsley and cook, stirring, just until they wilt. Add the bay leaf, wine, and currants and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are softened and the flavors blended, 5 to 7 minutes. The vegetable mixture can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, for 1 day.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Rub the fish steaks generously with salt and black pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dust the fish lightly with flour, add it to the skillet, and sear for about 30 seconds on each side. Transfer the fish steaks to a plate.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Set out an earthenware casserole or a deep ceramic or glass baking dish in which the fish steaks will fit snugly in a single layer. Arrange the potato slices in the casserole in one layer, overlapping them slightly. Sprinkle salt on the potatoes, then arrange the fish on top.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Remove the bay leaf from the vegetable mixture and discard it. Season the vegetable mixture with salt to taste, then spoon it evenly over the fish, along with its pan juices. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables and sprinkle with pine nuts. Bake the fish steaks until they are very tender, 45 to 50 minutes depending on their thickness. Let the fish and vegetables cool for about 10 minutes, then serve straight from the casserole. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch07_note1"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If grouper is unavailable, you can substitute another firm saltwater fish, such as monkfish, mahimahi, or halibut. If you want to use fillets, they need to be thick; reduce the baking time by about 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_191"/><span class="green-1">BASQUE HAKE &amp; CLAMS IN SALSA VERDE</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MERLUZA CON ALMEJAS EN SALSA VERDE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever Basques talk about food—which is pretty much all the time—the conversation always turns to <em>merluza</em> (hake) in <em>salsa verde,</em> perhaps the most iconic dish in the País Vasco. Which restaurant has the most definitive version? Which stall at the fish market offers the freshest <em>merluza,</em> a mild, delicate fish in the cod family? Should you add flour to thicken the parsley-flecked sauce or let the natural gelatin in the fish’s skin do the job?</p>
<p class="indent">Line-caught <em>merluza</em> is the pride of Basque fishermen. <em>Salsa verde</em> makes the perfect foil for it and the clams, both of which need to be handled gently. It’s a soupy sauce that allows the seafood to cook at a low temperature, preserving its moistness. While <em>salsa verde</em> is distinctive, its flavor doesn’t overpower the fine taste of the fish. <em>Merluza</em>—called either hake or by its Spanish name—is becoming increasingly available in the States. If you can’t find it, use another delicate but not overly flaky fish, such as cod, scrod, or sea bass.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 hake, cod, or sea bass fillets (each about 1 inch thick and 6 ounces), preferably with the skin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>) or store-bought fish stock, or ⅔ cup bottled clam juice diluted with ⅓ cup water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 small littleneck clams, scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup frozen baby peas, thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Crusty bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the fish with salt and white pepper and let stand for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or a deep, heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Dust the fish very lightly with flour and cook it for 30 seconds on each side. Transfer the fish to a plate. Add the garlic and half of the parsley to the <em>cazuela.</em> Cook, stirring, until the garlic is very fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the 2 teaspoons flour and stir for another 30 seconds. Add the wine and the fish stock, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook the sauce, stirring, until it thickens a little, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Return the fish to the <em>cazuela.</em> If the fillets have skin, arrange them skin side down. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes. Using a spatula, turn the fish over, then add the clams and peas. Cover the <em>cazuela</em> and cook, shaking the <em>cazuela,</em> until the fish just flakes when prodded with a fork and the clams open, 4 to 7 minutes more. Stir in the remaining <a id="page_192"/>parsley. Taste the sauce for seasoning, adding salt and/or white pepper as necessary. You can serve the dish straight from the <em>cazuela</em> or transfer it to a deep serving dish. Serve with bread to sop up the sauce. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">A BASQUE SEAFOOD EPIPHANY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Gastronomy to the Basques is what love is to the French and soccer to the Brazilians—a subject that permeates every nook and cranny of the collective unconscious. Basque cuisine is dense with tradition, wedded to both the land and the sea. Think pure, singular flavors and an extreme level of ingredient worship. From the misty slopes come farmhouse cheeses such as Idiazábal, iridescent-green peas, and an amazing profusion of mushrooms. The Cantabrian sea yields pristine langoustines, tender-fleshed hake, anchovies, and the sweetest, tiniest <em>chipirones,</em> or baby squid. From a nation whose navigating and fishing skills took them to Newfoundland’s Grand Banks possibly even before Columbus discovered America, Basques take fish fetishism to a whole new level. Here markets display the day’s catch—sea bream, bonito, sole, turbot—arranged on faux sea shells in theatrically illuminated marine still lifes. Here, every kindergartner knows that a hake (line-caught, of course) cooked above a precise temperature is ruined forever.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“The only way we ate fish was off the boat,” says my friend Manu. “Next day we threw it out because for us it wasn’t fresh.” Manu, who is the son of a hake fisherman and is married to chef Elena Arzak, is explaining all this at Kaia. A venerable seafood mecca in the fishing village of Getaria, Kaia has a fetching view of the tangle of boats in the harbor below as well as its own live fish tanks. The great French chef Michel Bras called Kaia’s <em>cigalas</em> (langoustines) the world’s greatest ingredient. I agree, prying their exquisite, pearlescent flesh from the shells. Fresh anchovies caught just minutes ago land on the table gently sautéed in a puddle of delicate olive oil. Tasting a little like oysters but meatier, <em>kokotxas</em>—the much-venerated hake’s cheeks—are flash fried in the lightest of egg batters to just seal in their delicate succulence. “This food might seem simple,” Manu muses, “but preparing it perfectly takes immense skill.” Then he stops talking, picking out tender nuggets of flesh from the head of a majestic grilled turbot.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">ROASTED HALIBUT ON A BED OF POTATOES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>“MERLUZA” AL HORNO CON PATATAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s a recipe from Xavier Franco, a Barcelona chef who truly understands fish. This one is <a id="page_193"/>Xavier’s slightly tweaked version of a popular Basque dish that dresses fish with a <em>refrito</em> of fried garlic, chile, good olive oil, and vinegar. The fish comes out delightfully tangy and savory, with the sliced potato layer soaking up all the yummy juices. Because the <em>merluza</em> (hake) called for in the original recipe isn’t easy to find, I substitute halibut. Other firm white-fleshed fish, such as sea bass, turbot, or tilefish, will also work. So will salmon; it isn’t particularly Spanish but it <em>is</em> incredibly good when prepared this way.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 skinless halibut fillets (each about 8 ounces)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ⅓ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small dried red chile, such as arbol, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 500°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the halibut with salt and pepper and let stand while you prepare the potatoes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a saucepan. Add salted water to cover by 2 inches and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until they just begin to feel tender when pierced with a skewer, 25 minutes or longer depending on their size. Do not overcook. Drain the potatoes and let cool enough to handle, then, using an oiled knife, cut them into slices between ¼- and ⅛ inch thick. Generously coat a 10-inch ovenproof skillet with olive oil (a cast-iron skillet is ideal or use a similar-size baking pan). Arrange the potatoes in a slightly overlapping layer on the bottom. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place ⅓ cup olive oil and the garlic in a small skillet and heat over medium-low heat until the oil simmers and the garlic just begins to take on color, about 2 minutes. Add the chile and stir for 15 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic and chile to a bowl. Add the vinegar to the skillet and <em>immediately</em> cover it, as the oil will splatter. Cook, covered, for the flavors to blend, 2 minutes, turn off the heat, and let stand until the oil stops popping against the lid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Pour some of the vinaigrette over the potatoes and scatter some of the fried garlic and chile over them. Arrange the halibut fillets on the potatoes, pour the remaining vinaigrette on top, and scatter the remaining garlic and chile over them. Bake the fish until it just flakes when tested with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes depending on the thickness. Sprinkle the parsley on top and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>RAPE GRATINADO CON ALLIOLI DE BERENJENAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This lovely ultra-Mediterranean recipe comes by way of my favorite Mallorcan chef, Joan Torrens. Although he uses salt cod loin, monkfish also makes an excellent choice. The fish is gratinéed after roasting under a hat of smoky grilled eggplant <em>allioli,</em> then served with a compote of yellow bell peppers. Spinach with Raisins and Pine Nuts (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_388">page 388</a>) would add a splash of green to the <a id="page_194"/>presentation. If you like, both the <em>allioli</em> and the peppers can be prepared ahead.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size ripe yellow bell peppers, cored, seeded, quartered, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 monkfish fillets (each about 1 inch thick and 8 ounces), trimmed of all membranes and gray bits</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, rub the monkfish with salt, brush it generously with olive oil, and let stand for 10 minutes. Place the fish on a baking sheet and bake until it is cooked through and feels firm to the touch, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Change the oven setting to broil.

<p class="noindent">Charring the eggplant right on a gas flame gives it an extra smokiness. However, you can also cook the whole eggplant under a broiler until soft and charred, about seven minutes per side. If cooking the eggplant directly over the flame, watch out for flare-ups.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place a small flameproof rack, such as the rack from a toaster oven, directly over a gas burner and set the heat to medium.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SALMON CON HABAS Y HINOJO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">If I had my way, I’d salt bake every fish and meat known to man, so outstanding are the results. In this recipe—adapted from Spain’s great chef, Juan Mari Arzak—you spread a salt crust on the skin of the salmon, then remove the skin after the fish is broiled. The fish skin protects the salmon from being over exposed to the heat. Serving the fish with a refreshing warm vinaigrette of fava beans, citrus, and fennel makes for a ravishingly pretty presentation. Fava bean salad is also delicious with white-fleshed fish, such as sea bass, and is great cold over poached or steamed salmon. For best results, Arzak recommends using wild salmon.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 cup shelled fresh fava beans (about 1½ pounds unshelled), or 1 cup shelled soybeans (edamame), thawed if frozen</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced fresh fennel, plus 1 to 2 tablespoons torn fennel fronds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size shallot, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grated zest of 1 lemon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup coarse salt (kosher or sea), plus salt for the vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg white, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 salmon fillets, preferably wild (each 6 to 7 ounces), with their skin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup coarsely chopped roasted cashews</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add the fava beans and cook until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the fava beans in a colander, then place it under cold running water until the fava beans are cool enough to handle. Gently peel the skins off the beans and set the beans aside. (If you are using soybeans, there is no need to peel them.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the fennel, shallot, and lemon zest in a medium-size bowl and toss to mix. Add the vinegar, lemon juice, and olive oil and whisk to combine. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper to taste. Let the vinaigrette stand for 1 hour or longer for the flavors to develop.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler and oil a broiling pan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the ⅓ cup salt and the egg white in a bowl and stir until a paste forms, adding a little water if necessary. Place the salmon on the broiling pan, skin side up, and spread the salt paste over the skin. Broil the salmon about 5 inches away from the heat until just cooked though, about 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> While the fish is baking, heat the vinaigrette in <a id="page_197"/>a small saucepan or in a microwave oven until warm but not piping hot, about 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Let the salmon cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a small spatula, remove and discard the salt and skin, wiping off any salt that clings to the fish. Place the fish on dinner plates. Stir the fava beans, cashews, chives, and fennel fronds into the vinaigrette and spoon some over each salmon fillet. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">NIFTY TRICKS: COOKING IN A BAG, THE NEW WAY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The method known as <em>al vacío</em> in Spain and <em>sous vide</em> in France is all the rage in Spanish kitchens. This technique entails poaching fish, meat, or vegetables vacuum-packed in a plastic bag. The results are miraculous: an ingredient that has a startlingly voluptuous texture and a vibrantly natural taste. Unlike poaching directly in water, the method intensifies, rather than leaches away, the flavor. Like poaching in olive oil, the method is carried out at very low temperatures (normally 145°F or below). At such temperatures, ingredients like a whole leg of baby lamb or a suckling pig can be cooked for as long as thirty-six hours and come out supple-textured yet meltingly soft. Joan Roca, the endlessly inventive Catalan chef at El Celler de Can Roca, one of Spain’s most innovative restaurants, is so obsessed with this method that he invented a poaching device called a Roner. A futuristic bain-marie that looks like a stainless steel drawer and cooks at highly controlled, precise temperatures, the Roner was inspired by a similar device used in medical labs for cooking vaccines. Call it science-fiction cuisine!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_196"/>ARZAK AND NEW BASQUE CUISINE</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The Spanish food revolution began in the late 1970s, in San Sebastián, when a group of Basque chefs set out to modernize their sturdy bourgeois cooking. Inspired by the nouvelle cuisine movement across the border in France, they came up with <em>nueva cocina vasca,</em> an inventive, light style, radically original in form but solidly Basque in substance: traditional ingredients reconfigured into new dishes; forgotten recipes reimagined without flour or cream. In just a few years the movement swept across Spain and became the nation’s default haute cuisine, paving the way for Ferran Adrià’s innovations. Everyone from this group went on to stardom: Pedro Subijana, the chef at Michelin two-star Akelarre; Karlos Arguiñano, Spain’s answer to Emeril Lagasse. But the name Juan Mari Arzak—the man who in 1989 gave the country one of its earliest three-star Michelin restaurants—is mythical.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Arzak presides over his namesake restaurant in San Sebastián, a bastion of Basque <em>alta cocina</em> that started life more than a century ago as his grandmother’s roadside <em>taberna</em>. Arzak is larger than life, quick to laugh, and possesses the high energy and common touch of a great politician. Though he hobnobs with royalty and celebrities (Spain’s royal family are his fans), he insists that his most important clients and critics are the local farmers and fishermen who save up for a Sunday lunch. Can a visionary three-star Michelin restaurant be populist? Arzak is. Young couples in T-shirts mingle with Armani’ed bankers in the cozy dining room attended by matronly waitresses. The food is as experimental as any in Spain—Juan Mari’s co-chef is his forward-thinking daughter, Elena—yet it delivers the sort of visceral pleasure one associates with small back-road bistros.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">One of the signature dishes, pumpkin and squid ravioli, arrives hidden beneath a murky black squid ink gelée that dissolves under a stream of warm broth poured tableside to reveal the Day-Glo orange disks underneath. The stunt is visually riveting, but what lingers is the sweet, earthy intensity of the pumpkin and squid broth. Another conceptual joke is a lamb chop concealed in a tissue-thin layer of <em>café con leche</em> (which has been baked between two Silpat pan liners) that gradually melts into the pan juices. Along with the punch line, one can savor this planet’s loveliest, rosiest piece of meat. Oysters and potato confit arrive at the table in a gauzy, crinkled veil of rice cellophane. <em>Morcilla</em> (blood sausage) and apples are trapped between slices of extravagantly colorful tropical fruit called pitahaya. And yet for all the magic tricks and technical somersaults, Arzak’s food somehow remains as soulfully Basque as <em>bacalao al pil-pil</em> (salt cod in a garlic emulsion). There’s no other chef on earth who can pull this off.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">PAVIA SOLDIERS</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOLDADITOS DE PAVIA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Impeccably crisp fried salt cod in a light batter is a fixture at tapas bars in Andalusia and Madrid, the sort of dish on which an establishment’s reputation rests. I’ve been enjoying it for years, but the name had always puzzled me. What could be the connection between bacalao and the 1525 battle of Pavia (a Lombardian town) in which the soldiers of the Spanish king Carlos V defeated the French? When I asked food historian and critic José Carlos Capel about this, first he explained that the name refers not to the battle but to the Pavia hussars, a nineteenth-century Spanish regiment. Originally, cod that was fried in its saffron-hued batter was decorated with strips of red peppers and resembled their regiment’s uniforms. Cooks abandoned the pepper decoration a long time ago, but the name stuck.</p>
<p class="indent">While we were on the subject, Capel cautioned that the success of <em>soldaditos de Pavia</em> depends on good olive oil brought to the right temperature and nice moist pieces of salt cod. If you find thick, stellar-quality bacalao, by all means use it, soaking it as directed on <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_199">page 199</a> (it will take at least twenty-four hours). Otherwise, liberally seasoned fresh cod works fine. Serve <em>soldaditos</em> as a tapa or as a light main course with a green salad. If you use the same batter with shrimp, you’ll have <em>gambas en gabardina</em> (shrimp in gabardine), another delicious and wildly popular dish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound best-quality salt cod, soaked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_199">page 199</a>) and drained, or 1 pound skinless fresh cod or scrod fillets, cut crosswise into 1½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh lemon juice, for sprinkling on the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon baking powder</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup chilled club soda or seltzer</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, separated</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for frying the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar, steeped in 2 tablespoons very hot water, and cooled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Lemon wedges (optional), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> If using fresh cod, pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels and sprinkle it generously with salt. Rub the fish with lemon juice and just a little paprika, cover it with plastic wrap, and let stand while you prepare the batter.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the 1 cup flour, the baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt in a large bowl and whisk to mix. Add the club soda, the egg yolk, the 2 tablespoons olive oil, and the saffron and whisk until the batter is completely smooth. Let the batter stand for 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the egg white in a small bowl and whisk until frothy, then whisk it into the batter. Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate. Lightly dip the cod in the flour, shaking off the excess.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Line a small rack with a double layer of paper towels and set it over a baking sheet. Pour olive oil to a depth of 1½ inches in a deep, heavy saucepan and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F; when hot, a piece of batter placed in the oil will puff on contact. Using a fork, dip a piece of fish in the batter until well coated, thoroughly shake off the excess, and place the fish in the hot oil. Dip 3 or 4 more pieces of fish into the batter, and then place them in the oil. Fry the fish until it is golden brown, crisp, and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried fish to the rack to drain. Repeat with the remaining fish, then serve at once, with lemon, if desired. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 OR 5 AS A TAPA, 2 OR 3 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_198"/>SALT COD WORSHIP</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">As much as the Spanish revere fresh seafood, it’s the salted, dried Nordic fish that they regard as a kind of totem. Which is why one day I found myself hurrying down a narrow street in Bilbao, looking for Alberdi, the temple to that most esteemed local ingredient: bacalao. In the restaurant’s kitchen, the chef and owner, Oscar Alberdi, stood towering over the stove. He placed a pristine, fleshy slab of desalted cod in warm garlicky olive oil and started gently shaking the earthenware <em>cazuela</em>. Through some strange alchemy, the gelatin in the fish’s skin began to emulsify with the oil, forming a smooth lemon-hued sauce. This was <em>bacalao al pil-pil,</em> the most famous Basque dish (its name is a typically onomatopoeic Basque term for the splashing of codfish in oil). Over lunch, which included <em>porrusalda</em> (leek, bacalao, and potato chowder), <em>bacalao al pil-pil,</em> and <em>bacalao a la vizcaína</em> (with a sweet-spicy sauce of dried peppers and sautéed onions), Oscar and I reviewed the bacalao lore.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">It was the Vikings who discovered how to air-dry cod. But medieval Basques perfected the method by applying the salt-curing techniques they had previously employed for whale meat, making the cod last longer and taste better. In search of cod banks, the Basques ventured as far as Newfoundland most probably before Columbus stumbled on the Americas. Perhaps the world’s earliest venture capitalists, the Basques turned the bacalao trade into a huge global business, aided by Catholicism, with its endless litany of meatless days. The practical need for preserving fish is long gone. But bacalao remains as vital to Spanish cooking as ever, eaten often at home (especially during Lent) and proudly served up at avant-garde Michelin-starred restaurants, where it’s likely to be poached in olive oil or <em>al vacío</em> (vacuum-packed) at a very low temperature. Cooked with care, desalted reconstituted bacalao is a treat: moist, plump, and falling apart in big, luxurious flakes.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Once abundant and cheap, these days good bacalao can cost more than fresh fish. This is not unreasonable when you consider that the best salt cod has all the succulence of fresh cod, plus that faint saline smack and a slightly gelatinous, supple texture the Spanish adore. All over Spain, but especially in Catalonia and the Basque Country, numerous bacalao shops display vast arrays of different grades and cuts, from the cheaper tail end and trimmings, to the pricey fat loin, to cheeks, and even innards. The most prized bacalao comes from Scandinavia. “The bacalao I buy could be Norwegian, fished by Icelanders on the Faeroe Islands,” Oscar said. “Exact provenance isn’t important. What matters is the quality of the salt and the precision of the curing techniques, such as the right temperature and humidity.”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Alas, it’s all but impossible to find bacalao of this quality in the United States. And because most of the codfish recipes in this book rely on fish that should be fleshy and moist, well-seasoned fresh cod is a better choice than the thin, desiccated bacalao readily available here. However, if you find thick, top-quality bacalao, do use it for the cod recipes in this chapter. Fresh fish is great but bacalao is, well, a world unto itself.</p>
<p class="box-title1">HANDLING AND COOKING SALT COD</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>CHOOSING</strong></span></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The best places to look for top-grade bacalao are Italian and Portuguese markets and fishmongers; choice bacalao loin can also be mail ordered from <a class="nounder" href="http://www.tienda.com">Tienda.com</a>. When buying bacalao, look for thick, white, supple, boneless pieces that don’t appear overly desiccated. Ideally, the pieces should <a id="page_199"/>be at least ¾ inch thick. Goya bacalao packed in plastic bags—get one labeled codfish, not pollock—is quite reliable, easy to find, and doesn’t require more than twenty-four hours of soaking.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>DESALTING</strong></span></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Depending on the grade of the fish and the salting method used, bacalao can take anywhere from twenty-four hours to two days to desalt properly. To desalt bacalao, place it in a wide bowl, add cold water to cover by two inches, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator. Let soak for twenty-four hours, changing the water four or five times. If the fish still seems too salty after twenty-four hours, soak it longer, continuing to change the water.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The best way to tell if it’s ready is to break off a small piece and taste it (the fish is fully cured and perfectly safe to eat). It should taste pleasantly salty but not overly so. If the salt cod still seems overly salty to you and you don’t have the patience to soak it longer, you can cook it in milk instead of water to draw out some of the salt.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>COOKING</strong></span></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">It is important to cook salt cod very gently; otherwise it becomes tough and rubbery. To cook, place the drained fish in a wide saucepan, add fresh water to cover by two inches, and bring the water to a simmer over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a simmer (do not allow it to boil), reduce the heat to very low and simmer the fish for one minute. Take the saucepan off the heat, cover, and let the salt cod stand in the liquid for about twenty minutes, or slightly longer for thicker fillets. The fish is ready when it flakes easily when prodded with the tip of a knife. Drain the fish and, using tweezers, pick out any small bones. Then proceed with the instructions in the individual recipes. If the recipe calls for the fish to be flaked, pick out more bones and tough bits from the salt cod as you flake it.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SARDINAS AL AJO Y PEREJIL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the Basques’ favorite ways to treat just-caught anchovies is to butterfly them, then gently cook them in fragrant olive oil that, with the addition of garlic and parsley, turns into a delectable sauce. During the anchovy season in May, you can enjoy the small fish prepared this way at humble tapas bars and fancy restaurants alike. Here in the States, if you can find fresh anchovies—and don’t mind cleaning them—by all means use them in this recipe (you’ll need about one pound). Sardines are equally delicious prepared this way. I describe how to clean them, but if you prefer, ask the fishmonger to clean, bone, and butterfly the sardines for you. The secret to keeping the flesh of the fish nicely moist is not letting the temperature of the oil rise to the point where it shrivels the skin. If you like an acidic kick, add a splash of white wine vinegar or lemon juice to the oil once you turn off the heat.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 smallish fresh sardines (about 1 pound)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil (do not use an assertive peppery oil)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Crusty bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> To clean and bone the sardines, remove the scales from the fish by gently scraping them with a small dull knife under cold running water. Cut off and discard the heads, then, using a small sharp knife, carefully make a slit along the bellies. Gut and clean the fish under cold running water. Grab the top of the spine of a sardine and pull it out quickly, trying not to remove too much of the flesh around it. Butterfly the sardine by opening it up like a book. If you feel small bones, trim the sides of the fillets. Repeat with the remaining sardines. Rinse the sardines under cold running water, pat them dry with paper towels and lightly sprinkle salt over them.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat for about 30 seconds. Add the sardines and cook until they just turn opaque, 30 to 45 seconds per side. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the sardines to a rimmed serving dish. Add the garlic to the olive oil and stir until it is very fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Stir in the parsley and cook for about 15 seconds, then pour the olive oil over the sardines. Serve at once with bread to mop up the garlic oil. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A TAPA, 2 OR 3 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Salt-Baked Sea Bass with Tomato Vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the great pleasures of eating at seafood restaurants in coastal Spain is watching the waiters rush to and fro ceremoniously bearing platters of whole fish baked in an armor of sea salt to be filleted with great pomp at the table. Quintessentially Mediterranean, this method of cooking seals in the fish’s sweet flavor. And, since the salt crust is removed at serving time, the fish isn’t salty in the least. The warm cherry tomato vinaigrette is the perfect accompaniment.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large egg whites, lightly beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 whole sea bass (about 2 pounds), cleaned and scaled (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#ch07_note2">Note</a>)</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly coat the paper with olive oil. Place the salt and egg whites in a large bowl and stir until evenly moistened. The paste should just hold together. If it doesn’t, sprinkle in a little water. Place the fish on the prepared baking sheet and fill the cavity with the smashed garlic, parsley sprigs, and lemon slices. Pat the salt mixture all over the top and sides of the fish to completely cover it. Bake the fish until cooked through, about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, heat 2½ teaspoons olive oil in a small skillet over low heat. Add the saffron and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shallot and minced garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and cook just until the tomatoes begin to break down, about 3 minutes longer. Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the vinegar and chopped parsley and season with pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_202"/><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> To serve, using a wooden spoon, tap the salt crust to crack it and lift it off the fish in large pieces.

<h3 class="h3a">SWORDFISH WITH THYME-SCENTED ASPARAGUS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PESCADO A LA BRASA CON ESPARRAGOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The scents of honey, orange, and thyme instantly evoke the Mediterranean. This easy, lyrical recipe is from Saüc, one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona. The owner, Xavier Franco, prepares it with gorgeous loins of monkfish. It’s hard in this country to find monkfish that’s high-quality enough to be so simply grilled, so I’ve substituted swordfish. (Grilled or seared scallops or shrimp would also be delicious prepared this way.) The drizzle of fruity olive oil and sprinkling of salt at the end may seem like an afterthought, but their effect is transformational—so get out your best olive oil and flaky sea salt. The amount of honey needed will depend on the tartness of the oranges. Start with a tablespoon and add more until you get a nice balance of sweet and tart.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 swordfish steaks (each about 1 inch thick and 6 ounces)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup fresh orange juice (from 4 to 6 oranges)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2½ tablespoons floral honey, such as orange blossom honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds thin asparagus, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>), store-bought fish stock, or bottled clam juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the swordfish with salt and pepper, brush it generously with olive oil, and let stand until ready to use.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the orange and lemon juices in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until reduced to ⅓ cup, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, whisk in 1 teaspoon of the honey, and taste the orange sauce; it should be nicely sweet and tart. If it is too tart, add more honey. Let the sauce cook for another minute. Season the sauce with salt to taste and keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Light the grill and preheat it to high or preheat the broiler.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">GRILLED TUNA WITH SALMOREJO SAUCE</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ATUN A LA BRASA CON SALMOREJO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The restaurant La Montería is one of Madrid’s great little gems. In the bar section up front, for just a few euros you can indulge in delicacies like crisp-fried sweetbreads and a swooningly good warm partridge salad. In the back, there is a small bistro, for which my friend Miguel dreams up simple but surprisingly creative dishes. Miguel’s Andalusian roots show in this tuna dish with its refreshing <em>salmorejo</em> sauce, a sort of dense gazpacho, and the earthy accent of frizzled leeks. Miguel uses the luxurious <em>ventresca,</em> or bonito belly, but regular tuna is also delicious prepared this way. The sauce is best when made in advance so the flavor can ripen—plan accordingly.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SALMOREJO SAUCE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound (2 to 3) beautiful ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slices day-old sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup diced Italian (frying) pepper, or green bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped red onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE TUNA AND LEEKS:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup olive oil, plus more for brushing the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size leeks, white and some tender green parts, trimmed and cut into 2-inch-long julienne</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tuna steaks (each about 5 ounces)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the <em>salmorejo</em> sauce: Place the tomatoes in a sieve or colander and let drain for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the bread in a small bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain the bread and squeeze out the excess liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the soaked bread and drained tomatoes and the Italian pepper, onion, and garlic in a food processor and process until smooth. With the motor <a id="page_204"/>running, drizzle the olive oil through the feed tube. Push the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl, pressing on it with the back of a large spoon and scraping the bottom of the sieve (or puree the sauce in a blender). Add the vinegar and stir to mix. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and black pepper to taste and more vinegar if desired. Let the sauce stand for at least 2 hours at room temperature for the flavors to develop. (The <em>salmorejo</em> sauce can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days. Let it return to room temperature before serving.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Prepare the tuna and leeks: Heat the ½ cup olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat until it shimmers; when hot, a piece of leek will sizzle on contact. Working in two batches, cook the leeks, stirring, until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the leeks to paper towels to drain. Lightly sprinkle the leeks with salt and set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Light the grill and preheat it to high or preheat a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Rub the tuna steaks with salt and black pepper and brush with a little olive oil. Grill the tuna steaks until nicely charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Slice the tuna into medium-thick slices.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To serve, divide the <em>salmorejo</em> sauce among 6 small bowls or egg cups. Place each bowl of sauce in the center of a dinner plate. Fan the tuna slices out around the bowls of sauce and top them with some frizzled leeks. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3a">MEDITERRANEAN FISH IN ZUCCHINI JACKETS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PESCADO EN CAMISA DE CALABACIN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Adapted from a dish served at a country restaurant near Valencia, this zucchini-wrapped fish with a black olive vinaigrette is as virtuous as it is delicious. And it’s easy, to boot. In Valencia, it’s made with the firm-fleshed <em>pez limón</em> (a kind of amberjack), but many other fish—sea bass, pompano, sole—work well in this preparation. Choose the longest zucchini you can find, so that the slices can wrap comfortably around the fish fillets.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_205"/><strong>FOR THE VINAIGRETTE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped pitted black olives, such as niçoise or Gaeta</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained and minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 scallion, white and some green parts, trimmed and minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon grated lemon zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE FISH:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 long zucchini</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 skinless pompano, sole, or sea bass fillets (each 6 to 7 ounces)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the vinaigrette: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until they soften a little but still hold their shape, about 2 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes to a bowl and stir in the olives, anchovies, scallion, lemon zest, vinegar, and lemon juice. Slowly, whisk in the remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil. Season the tomato vinaigrette with salt and pepper to taste and let stand for at least 30 minutes so the flavors can meld.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the fish: Using a vegetable peeler, slice the zucchini lengthwise into paper-thin slices. Season the fish with salt and pepper and lightly sprinkle with lemon juice. Lay some of the zucchini slices vertically on a work surface. Center a fish fillet crosswise near the top of the row of zucchini and roll it over to wrap it in the slices. Repeat with the remaining fish and zucchini (you may not need all of the zucchini).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Pour water to a depth of 2 inches into a wide steamer and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. If you don’t have a wide Chinese-style steamer, you can steam the fish on a rack set over a large skillet. Place the zucchini-wrapped fish in the steamer or on the rack, seam side down. Cover the steamer or skillet and steam until the zucchini is bright green and the fish is opaque throughout, 7 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish. To check for doneness, you can lift up a zucchini slice and prod the fish with the tip of a knife.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Using a slotted spatula, carefully transfer the zucchini-wrapped fish fillets to plates, gently shaking off the excess moisture. Let the fish cool for about 5 minutes. Add the parsley to the tomato vinaigrette and whisk to recombine. Decoratively dab some of the vinaigrette on top of each portion of fish and pass the rest in a bowl. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PESCADO AL HORNO CON ROMESCO Y PATATAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Can Sole, a famous old seafood restaurant in Barcelona’s fishermen’s quarter, has the world’s <a id="page_206"/>grumpiest service, but I forgive them. Their bacalao croquettes set the gold standard, and the anchovies are supremely fat and buttery. As for the salt cod, which is baked over potatoes in <em>romesco</em> sauce and gratinéed with garlic mayonnaise—it’s nothing short of a masterpiece. This is my approximation of Can Sole’s recipe, using well-seasoned fresh scrod in lieu of bacalao. The <em>romesco,</em> potatoes, and <em>allioli</em> can be made ahead, so all you have to do is bake the dish right before serving. The one-dish meal is so perfect for a large dinner party I’ve given amounts that will feed a crowd. You can easily make less, saving the rest of the <em>romesco</em> sauce for later.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE ROMESCO SAUCE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 dried ñora peppers, or 2 dried ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded, and torn into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 sun-dried tomatoes, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups boiling Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>), store-bought fish stock, or 1 cup bottled clam juice diluted with ½ cup water, plus more for thinning the sauce, if necessary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 slices (½ inch thick) baguette</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 large garlic cloves, cut in half crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup blanched almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup hazelnuts, toasted (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>) and skinned</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups chopped ripe tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of cayenne</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE POTATOES AND FISH:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds large Yukon Gold potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ pounds fish fillets (about ¾ inch thick), such as scrod, cod, haddock, or halibut, cut into serving portions</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the <em>romesco</em> sauce: Place the ñora peppers and sun-dried tomatoes in a small heatproof bowl. Add 1½ cups of the fish stock and let soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Transfer the ñora peppers and tomatoes with their soaking liquid to a blender and finely puree them, then set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until almost smoking. Add the bread and garlic and cook until deep golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bread and the garlic to a bowl. Add the almonds and hazelnuts to the skillet and cook until the nuts are golden, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting the heat so the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the nuts to the bowl with the bread and garlic.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Spoon about 4 teaspoons of the garlicky oil into a medium-size skillet and heat over medium heat (set aside the remaining garlicky oil). Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook until thickened and reduced, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Add the paprika and cayenne and stir for a few seconds. Let the tomato mixture cool a little.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Break the fried bread into pieces and place them in a food processor along with the fried garlic and nuts, and process until finely ground. Add the <a id="page_207"/>tomato and onion mixture, the pureed ñora pepper mixture, 1 tablespoon of the garlicky oil, and ¼ cup water to the processor bowl. Puree until completely smooth. Scrape the <em>romesco</em> sauce into a bowl and stir in the vinegar. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste and add a little more vinegar, if desired. The sauce can be used right away but is best when prepared a day ahead so the flavors can develop (store, covered, in the refrigerator). Discard the remaining garlicky oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Prepare the potatoes and fish: Place the potatoes in a saucepan, add salted water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until they just begin to feel tender when pierced with a skewer, about 30 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain the potatoes and let cool enough to handle. If making ahead, wrap in plastic and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Use an oiled knife to cut the potatoes into slices ¼ inch thick.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> When ready to assemble the dish, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the <em>romesco</em> sauce and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the sauce, stirring, until it is fragrant and turns a shade or two darker, 2 to 3 minutes. If the sauce seems too thick to bake the fish in, thin it with a little fish stock or water. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> Set out a deep, attractive, flameproof baking dish that can hold the fish in a single layer. Spoon some of the <em>romesco</em> sauce into the dish and arrange the potato slices on top in a single layer, overlapping them slightly. Season the fish generously with salt and black pepper, then arrange it on top of the potatoes. Spoon the remaining <em>romesco</em> sauce evenly over the fish. Bake until the sauce is very hot and the fish just begins to flake, 12 to 15 minutes or slightly longer depending on the kind of fish. Do not over-cook.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">9.</span></strong> Change the oven setting to broil. Remove the fish from the oven and spread the <em>allioli</em> evenly over the top.

<h3 class="h3a">BASQUE FISHERMEN’S STEW</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MARMITAKO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Like Catalan <em>suquet,</em> American cod chowder, or Marseille’s bouillabaisse, <em>marmitako</em> is a classic fishermen’s stew. Traditionally prepared on makeshift stoves aboard tuna boats on the icy Bay of Biscay, <em>marmitako</em> consisted of the day’s catch combined with sturdy shipboard provisions like potatoes, onions, and <em>pimientos choriceros,</em> the region’s smoky-sweet, fleshy dried peppers. (Before these ingredients were brought from the Americas, <em>marmitako</em> consisted of tuna, water, pork fat, and stale bread.) The name is from <em>marmitekua,</em> or <em>marmita,</em> the stew pot used for cooking the fish. Luis Irízar, the legendary Basque cooking teacher who gave me this recipe, insists that the secret to a good <em>marmitako</em> is “breaking” rather <a id="page_208"/>than cutting the potatoes, so that they release more starch and properly thicken the stew. <em>Pimientos choriceros</em> or the Spanish ñora peppers are available through some mail-order sources (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>), or you can substitute ancho chiles. Sun-dried tomatoes aren’t traditional in <em>marmitako,</em> but I add them for extra depth of flavor. Like any Spanish stew, this one is delicious served with grilled or toasted country bread.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 dried pimientos choriceros, ñora peppers, or ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded, and torn into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 plump sun-dried tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small white onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 3 cups Fish Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_108">page 108</a>) or store-bought fish stock, or 2 cups bottled clam juice diluted with 1 cup water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds boneless bonito or bluefin tuna, cut into 1-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grilled or toasted dense country bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Soak the <em>pimientos choriceros</em> and sun-dried tomatoes in 1 cup very hot water until soft, about 30 minutes. Using a blender, puree the <em>pimientos</em> and tomatoes with their soaking liquid. Set the tomato-chile paste aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into irregular chunks by inserting the tip of a small sharp knife into a potato and twisting it until a 1½-inch chunk comes out. Repeat until the entire potato is cut up, then continue with the remaining potatoes. Set them aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy 4- to 5-quart saucepan. Add the onion and the red and green peppers and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Cover the saucepan, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the peppers are very soft, 10 to 12 minutes longer, stirring once or twice. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes and potatoes and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Add the reserved tomato-chile paste, the wine, and 2½ cups of the fish stock, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil, skimming. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, partially covered, until the potatoes are very tender and some are just beginning to fall apart, about 30 minutes. If the sauce seems too thick, add some or all of the remaining ½ cup fish stock and return the sauce to a simmer. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Rub the tuna cubes gently with salt and add them to the sauce. Cook, shaking the pot gently, until the fish is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with parsley, and serve in soup bowls with bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_209"/>SPAIN’S BEST CATCH</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">With its Mediterranean and Cantabrian coasts, Spain boasts some of the world’s greatest fish. Here are some that you will encounter.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>ANCHOAS</strong></span> (anchovies), members of the <em>pescado azul</em> (bluefish) family, are difficult to find fresh in the States. If you see them, grab them! Fresh anchovies are heavenly butterflied (if you can stand all the work) and sautéed very gently in olive oil with plenty of garlic. They are also a treat rolled in coarse flour and fried.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>ANGULAS</strong></span> (elvers) are the ultimate Basque delicacy, more revered than, and just as expensive as, caviar. The baby eels are tiny, like short, skinny linguine strands. They’re normally cooked for mere seconds in garlicky olive oil. You may find them to be an acquired taste, but don’t tell that to the Basques.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>ATUN</strong></span> (tuna) in Spain usually refers to the red-fleshed bluefin tuna. The best catch is <em>atún de almadraba,</em> trapped off the Andalusian coast (near Cape Trafalgar) in a vast network of nets (<em>almadraba</em>) suspended from buoys, a fishing method that goes back at least two thousand years.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>BESUGO</strong></span> (red bream), <em>dorada</em> (gilthead bream), and their numerous cousins, make up the sea bream family, much appreciated in Spain. Baked <em>besugo</em> is a typical Christmas Eve dish in Madrid; <em>dorada</em> is great baked in salt. Porgy or red snapper make fine substitutes.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>BONITO</strong></span> (albacore) from the Cantabrian sea is the mainstay of the Spanish canning industry. But its ivory flesh is also wonderful fresh, particularly the <em>ventresca,</em> the wildly expensive buttery part around the belly.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>LENGUADO</strong></span> (Dover sole), the best of which comes from the Bay of Biscay, is a much-loved flatfish with sweet, moist flesh. At good seafood restaurants, <em>lenguado</em> is likely to be small and served whole <em>a la espalda:</em> butterflied, grilled on the <em>parrilla,</em> and presented on its back, drizzled with lemon juice and olive oil.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>LUBINA</strong></span> (sea bass) is the aristocrat of the fish world: Lean, firm, stark white, it’s beautiful as a fillet and even better when roasted whole, either in salt (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_201">page 201</a>) or on a bed of sliced lemons. Even if I just want a fillet, I prefer buying a whole fish and having the fishmonger bone it; this way I know it’s perfectly fresh. Don’t substitute Chilean sea bass, which is in danger of being overfished and should be avoided.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>MERLUZA</strong></span> (European hake) is Spain’s <em>numero uno</em> favorite, especially prized when line caught. Sweet, snow-white, delicate yet not mushy, it’s prepared most classically in <em>salsa verde</em> (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_191">page 191</a>) but it’s also great baked, fried in an egg batter, or gently sautéed at a low temperature, covered in olive oil. You can find hake at some better fish stores, as well as at Korean fish markets, although it won’t match the flavor of Spanish <em>merluza</em>. Or, substitute cod or scrod.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>RAPE</strong></span> (monkfish) is hugely popular along Spain’s Mediterranean shores. Known as poor man’s lobster, it has a firm flesh that stands up well to roasting and doesn’t fall apart when cooked in traditional soupy stews, such as <em>suquet</em>. Its gelatinous tail and big, ugly head add oomph and body to many a fish stock.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>RODABALLO</strong></span> (turbot) is a deepwater flatfish that reigns supreme on Spain’s northern coast, from the Basque Country to Galicia. Sweet, meaty, and wonderfully rich, it tastes like halibut from the fourth dimension. <em>Rodaballo</em> is divine when grilled whole, Basque style, finished with a vinegar glaze that offsets its richness.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ROMESCO DE PEIX</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">There are as many <em>romesco</em> sauces as there are cooks, each tailored to the particular food with which it’s served. The principal ingredients—dried ñora pepper, fried bread and garlic, nuts, and tomatoes—may be consistent, but their proportions and the other ingredients vary, resulting in a wealth of different nuances. This recipe for the sauce, based on one by David Solé i Torné, the great <em>romesco</em> specialist from Tarragona, makes a brothy one, perfect for a mixed seafood extravaganza. Roasted tomatoes produce a flavor that’s deep and concentrated, while the unexpected use of grated chocolate lends an intriguing touch, subtly adding even more depth.</p>
<p class="indent">This version features monkfish, clams, squid, and, for a rustic touch, unpeeled shrimp. Dig in with your fingers and mop up all the delicious sauce with crusty bread. And feel free to vary the assortment of seafood—mussels, different types of fish, and lobster would all be good choices.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the <em>romesco</em> sauce: Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the tomatoes and 6 of the garlic cloves in a roasting pan, sprinkle them with salt, and drizzle olive oil over them. Bake until soft and lightly charred, about 40 minutes. Let the tomatoes and garlic cool slightly, reserving any juices in the pan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the tomatoes are baking, place the ñora peppers in a small bowl. Add 1 cup very hot water and let soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Transfer the peppers and their soaking liquid to a blender and finely puree them, then set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat 5 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until almost smoking. Add the bread and the remaining 6 garlic cloves and cook until deep golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bread and garlic to a <a id="page_213"/>bowl. Add the almonds to the skillet and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting the heat so the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the almonds to the bowl with the bread and garlic. Set the skillet aside; you’ll use some of the cooking oil in the <em>romesco</em> sauce.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Break the fried bread into pieces and place them in a food processor, along with the fried garlic and almonds, and process until finely ground. Add the roasted tomatoes and garlic and any juices from the roasting pan, the pureed ñora peppers, 2 tablespoons of the garlic frying oil, the remaining ⅓ cup of wine, the ¼ cup parsley, the paprika, and red pepper flakes (start with a small pinch and add more if you’d like your sauce a little hotter) to the processor bowl. Puree until completely smooth. You can finish making the <em>romesco</em> sauce right away, but it is best when prepared 1 day ahead up to this stage so that the flavors can develop. Store, covered, in the refrigerator. Discard the remaining garlicky oil in the skillet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy, attractive, 4- to 5-quart casserole over medium heat. Add the <em>romesco</em> sauce and bring to a simmer. Add the chocolate, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring, until the sauce is fragrant and turns a shade or two darker, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the casserole so the chocolate doesn’t stick. Add another ⅓ cup wine and 1½ cups of the fish stock, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, to blend the flavors, about 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and black pepper as necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Prepare the seafood: Season the monkfish generously with salt and add it to the simmering <em>romesco</em> sauce, adding a little more fish stock if the sauce doesn’t seem liquid enough. Simmer the fish until almost cooked through, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> While the fish is simmering, heat the wine in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the clams, cover the pot, and cook the clams until they open, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">9.</span></strong> When the monkfish has cooked for 5 minutes, add the squid to the <em>romesco</em> sauce and cook for 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Check the fish; if it hasn’t completely cooked, simmer it for a few more minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">10.</span></strong> Discard any clams that haven’t opened, then gently stir the clams and their cooking liquid into the <em>romesco</em> sauce. If you’d like the sauce to be soupier, add a little more fish stock. Sprinkle parsley on top and serve with bread for dunking.

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_211"/>TARRAGONA: RUINS AND ROMESCO</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The coastal Mediterranean city of Tarragona, some sixty miles southwest of Barcelona, has many things to recommend it to a visitor. Formerly the principal outpost of the Roman empire on the Iberian peninsula, Tarragona is a trove of Roman ruins, among them a handsome amphitheater, a beautifully preserved aqueduct, and imposing stone walls. Tarragona also has a very fine Romanesque-Gothic cathedral, pretty beaches, and a quaint old fishermen’s quarter called El Serallo. The city’s principal attraction, however, is gastronomic. I’m talking about <em>romesco,</em> a ruddy, nutty, garlicky sauce that flourishes here as something of an edible life force. “I don’t think there are many cities that have, in addition to an incomparable past, a splendorous present and a uniquely beautiful location, a sauce of their own,” wrote Catalan writer and gastronome Josep Pla.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">To learn more, I booked a table at a Tarragona restaurant called Barquet. Its <em>romesco</em>-obsessed owner, David Solé i Torné, features the sauce in practically every dish and has even written a book on the subject. David believes that the etymological roots of <em>romesco</em> lie in the medieval mozarabic word <em>rumiskal</em>, which means “to mix things together.” Originally, the term described some kind of fish stew, but it gradually evolved to refer to this uber-Mediterranean sauce. Some of <em>romesco’s</em> defining ingredients—mortar-pounded garlic, nuts, and sometimes bread—feature in scores of medieval Catalan recipes and continue to form the base for another famed Catalan sauce, the <em>picada</em>. What changed the <em>romesco</em> forever was the introduction of tomatoes and peppers from the New World. Today most versions include the mild, fleshy dried chiles called <em>pebrots de romesco,</em> fried almonds and/or hazelnuts, always garlic, sometimes tomatoes and bell peppers, and often vinegar and olive oil. <em>Romesco,</em> David explains, functions in two different ways. One is as a hot soupy stew base for fish (classically monkfish). This is the traditional celebratory <em>romesco de peix</em>—also known as <em>romescada</em>—the stuff of countless fishermen’s fiestas. The other <em>romesco</em> is an <em>aliño,</em> a cold table sauce that can dress raw vegetables and greens, boiled potatoes, fried rabbit, cold meat, egg tortillas . . . in short, just about anything.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">According to David, <em>romesco</em> comes in infinite versions. My meal at Barquet was perfect proof of its versatility. An impeccable salad of white asparagus, shaved mushrooms, and bitterish endive was dabbed with a <em>romesco</em> that was sprightly and sharp, with a pronounced taste of raw garlic and toasted hazelnuts. In the next dish, plump snails, the sauce was rounder and sweeter, featuring, this time, poached garlic, lots of tomatoes, nuts, and a touch of sugar. For the classic hot <em>romesco</em> stew of monkfish and potatoes, the <em>romesco</em> base of fried chiles, onion, almonds, and bread was diluted with strong white wine and fish stock, giving it an entirely different character. Up next was an <em>arroz meloso</em> (soupy rice in a paella pan) made with tuna, squid, and a <em>romesco</em>-based broth (David’s own invention, of which he seemed especially proud). How about a dessert <em>romesco</em>? I proposed. David chuckled and promised to work on it.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_212"/>THE ETHEREAL ANDALUSIAN FISH FRY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Every time I approach the Andalusian port cities of Cádiz or Málaga, my pulse quickens in anticipation of a meal from a <em>freiduría,</em> a fry shop specializing in fish. The best ones are holes-in-the-wall suffused with the aroma of seafood and olive oil. Gripped by indecision, I’m likely to idle by the counter. What will it be? A dozen thimble-size <em>puntillitas</em> (baby squid), a lacy pile of minuscule whitebait, a tangy <em>cazón en adobo</em> (marinated dog-fish)? Or perhaps something larger and a little more noble—say, a <em>pijota</em> (small hake)? Inevitably, I settle for a <em>variado</em> (an assortment). Then, salivating, I tote my paper-swaddled booty to the nearest outdoor café on a palm-fringed plaza. A glass of icy, dry fino sherry in front of me, finally I dig in. The fish tastes of the sea and good olive oil; light, crunchy, and utterly greaseless. I order more sherry, wistful that it will be a long time before I eat fried fish like this again.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The world’s largest producers of olive oil, Andalusians have been frying for centuries. Under the Moors (those great cultivators of olive trees), the region had so many stalls selling deep-fried Moorish pastries and fish on the coast that strict laws had to be passed regulating the number of the locales and the quality of their wares. Today, frying fish is an Andalusian birthright.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Though batter is used in some dishes, the essential Andalusian fish fry is simplicity itself: just freshly caught fish, salt, flour, and oil. Of course, there are secrets. Number one: the flour, which is coarsely milled and yellowish and sold in Spain as <em>harina para freír,</em> flour for frying. It’s not available in the States, but semolina, either coarse or medium fine, is just right instead. Mixing all-purpose flour and coarse cornmeal is also an option, even if the corn gives fried fish an inflection of the American South. The dredging technique is likewise noteworthy. Andalusian <em>fritura</em> maestros place lots of flour in a deep bowl and set a sieve over it. In a scooping motion, they dip the fish deep into the flour, then shake off the excess in the sieve. It’s best if the fish is a little moist, so the flour sticks better.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Now, the oil. The notion that extra-virgin olive oil has a low smoke point and is therefore unsuitable (or even unhealthy) for frying is a bit of a myth. It all depends on the specific variety. While you’d never use the delicate Catalan arbequina oil to fry, stable extra-virgin oils such as picual or cornicabra produce the world’s best fried food. Miguel Palomo of Alhucemas, a restaurant legendary for its <em>frituras,</em> insists that using top-grade extra-virgin olive oil is the only way to fry fish. If cost is of concern (you’ll need three to four cups for the job), go with oil labeled virgin or simply olive oil. Me? I normally fry in two parts Goya extra-virgin and one part peanut oil. For the fish to come out crisp and greaseless the oil needs to be at least 360°F but not higher than 375°F, so keep a thermometer handy. A deep, snug saucepan is best for the job, and it should never be overcrowded with fish.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">But which fish? Andalusians will fry anything that swims, but the best choice for a mixed fry is this: very small fish, like fresh anchovies, tiny smelts, or minuscule whitebait (look for these at Chinese markets). Slightly bigger whole gutted and cleaned saltwater fish, such as red mullet, baby flounder, and small red snapper or whiting. Chunks of <em>cazón en adobo</em> (marinated dogfish or shark). And squid—preferably tiny and whole, but larger ones can be cut into rings.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Accompaniments? Andalusians normally serve <em>nada,</em> not even lemons (asking for <em>limón</em> implies that the fish isn’t quite fresh). But feel free to offer a simple green salad dressed with lemon and olive oil. To drink: ice-cold beer, fino sherry, or a light young white wine. Pure heaven.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">ANDALUSIAN FISH FRY</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PESCADO FRITO A LA ANDALUZA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">What you’ll find here is less a specific recipe than a general technique for frying fish the way Andalusians do. You can use several different kinds of fish for a mixed fry or just fry up one kind of seafood or fish. Calamari, for instance, comes out spectacular when prepared this way, as do tiny <a id="page_214"/>fish, like whitebait and smelts; they’re terrific as a tapa. For slightly larger whole fish, I love small snapper, baby flounder, and small whiting, but you can use whatever looks good and fresh at the fish market. Fillets and small, thin fish steaks are fine too, as long as they are not too flaky or thin. And don’t miss the <em>cazón en adobo</em> (marinated shark), either as part of the mixed fry assortment here or on its own. The amounts I’ve given make a mixed fish fry for four, but again, be flexible with the choice and quantity of fish. When frying, I like to start with the squid and tiny fish, so guests have something to nibble on while the larger fish cooks. For more about Andalusian fish fries, see the box on <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_212">page 212</a>.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SHARK IN ADOBO:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound boneless shark or swordfish, cut into 1¼-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ teaspoons dried oregano</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅛ teaspoon cayenne</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons best-quality white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon dry white wine (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE REST OF THE FISH FRY:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound cleaned squid</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ounces whitebait (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 fresh anchovies or very small smelts, gutted and cleaned</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 small whole fish (each 6 to 8 ounces), such as baby flounder, red mullet, red or white snapper, or whiting, scaled, gutted, and cleaned, heads removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 cups olive oil (not extra-virgin) for frying</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 cups semolina, preferably medium or coarse ground (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#ch07_note3">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Lemon wedges and/or Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>), for serving (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the shark in adobo: Place the shark in a bowl and rub it generously with salt. Place the garlic, paprika, cumin, oregano, cayenne, vinegar, and wine, if using, in a small bowl and stir to mix. Pour this marinade over the shark and toss to coat evenly. Refrigerate the shark for 4 to 6 hours, tossing occasionally. Let the shark come to room temperature before cooking. Using paper towels, blot the excess marinade off the shark before coating it with flour to fry.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the rest of the fish fry: Using paper towels, thoroughly blot the excess moisture off the squid (otherwise it will splatter like crazy when fried). Cut the squid bodies into rings about ⅓ inch wide. Cut any large tentacles in half. Rub the squid generously with salt and set it aside. Rub the white-bait, if using, with salt and set it aside separately.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Rinse the anchovies and the larger whole fish under cold running water and gently shake off the excess water. Place the fish on a baking sheet or a large platter and rub generously with salt (unlike <a id="page_215"/>squid, it’s best if the fish is left slightly wet, so the flour adheres better).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Line a rack with a double thickness of paper towels and set it over a large baking sheet. Pour olive oil to a depth of 2 inches in a deep saucepan, or a small wok about 10 inches in diameter, and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F. While the oil is heating, place the semolina in a deep bowl. Place half of the squid in the semolina, scooping under the squid and piling the semolina on top. Set a fine sieve over the bowl of semolina, place the floured squid in the sieve, and gently shake the sieve, letting the excess semolina fall back into the bowl. When the oil reaches 360°F, add the squid to the pan, standing back in case it splatters. Fry the squid until golden, crisp, and tender, about 3 minutes, adjusting the heat so that the oil doesn’t burn, and turning the squid once or twice. While the first batch of squid is frying, flour the remaining squid. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried squid to the paper towels to drain. Let the oil return to 360°F (a few seconds) before adding the second batch of squid. Once all the squid is drained, place it on a baking sheet and put it in the oven to keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Flour and fry the remaining fish, preferably in the following order: whitebait, 3 to 4 minutes per batch; anchovies or smelts, 3 to 6 minutes per batch, depending on their size; the marinated shark, 2 to 3 minutes per side; and, finally, the larger whole fish, about 4 minutes per side. As you fry, don’t overcrowd the pan, let the oil reheat briefly before adding each new batch of fish, and adjust the temperature so that it doesn’t exceed 375°F. Transfer each batch of fried fish to the rack to drain briefly, then place it on a baking sheet and put it in the oven to keep warm. Even better, serve the fish as soon as it comes out of the pan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> If you have been keeping the fish warm in the oven, once all of it has been fried, arrange the calamari and whitebait on separate serving dishes and place the rest of the fish on a large platter. Serve with lemon wedges and/or <em>allioli,</em> if desired. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>LENGUADO FRITO EN COSTA DE PATATAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Salvador Rojo, who presides over a stylish namesake restaurant in Seville, changed my life when he suggested coating fried fish in instant mashed potato flakes! Though coarsely milled flour is the classic coating in Andalusia, to achieve perfection these clever flakes deliver a light crust similar to that of the fashionable Japanese <em>panko</em> crumbs, with the added benefit of the lovely taste of potatoes. Although I particularly like this nifty “breading” with delicate fish such as flounder or sole, it works with just about any fish—as well as for shrimp, scallops, and thin chicken or pork cutlets. For the breading to stick properly, press it on well and make sure your oil is sufficiently hot; otherwise, the potato flakes tend to fall off.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_216"/><strong>1½ pounds flounder fillets, cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Pour olive oil to a depth of about 1½ inches in a large, deep skillet, and heat it to 360°F; when hot, a piece of bread placed in the oil will sizzle on contact.

Fry 5 or 6 pieces of fish in the hot oil until deep golden, about 1½ minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried fish to the prepared rack and baking sheet set up to drain.

<h3 class="h3a">SALT-COOKED SHRIMP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GAMBAS A LA SAL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Already hooked on salt-cooked fish, I was intrigued to discover this ingenious shrimp-cooking method at a restaurant near Valencia. It involves cooking whole shrimp in their shells in a cast-iron skillet on a bed of salt, which heats the crustaceans gently and evenly, leaving them with plenty of savor. (Anyone who truly loves shrimp knows that they are best when cooked in their shells to preserve the flavor and juices.) When the shrimp are of impeccable quality, as they are on coastal Spain, no sauce is necessary. But if you like, make a simple vinaigrette with a third of a cup of fruity olive oil, the juice of one lemon, two crushed garlic cloves, and a few tablespoons of minced parsley. Don’t forget finger bowls and empty bowls for the shells.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_217"/><strong>1½ to 2 cups coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>

<p class="indentt">Spread the salt evenly on the bottom of a heavy 12-inch skillet, preferably cast iron. Heat the skillet over medium-high heat until the salt is very hot and almost beginning to smoke. Place half of the shrimp on the salt and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the shrimp over and continue cooking until the shrimp are just cooked through, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and cook the remaining shrimp in the same way (the second batch may take less time to cook, since the salt will be very hot). Let the shrimp cool just enough to handle, then gently wipe off any excess salt with paper towels.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>VIEIRAS CON LIMON CONFITADO DE MARI CARMEN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The last time I ate at La Sirena, a restaurant in Alicante that I adore, the chef, Mari Carmen Vélez, offered an unforgettable scallop dish. Presented in stark white soup bowls, the fat, seared scallops came in a delightful sweet-tart broth strewn with a bright confetti of diced zucchini, pumpkin, and mushrooms. “But what gives the dish that unusual citrusy kick and mystique?” I wanted to know. Candied lemon peel was the answer. Adapted to a home kitchen, the scallops make a showstopping first course. They are also simple to make, as you can use high-quality store-bought candied lemon instead of making your own. If you’d like to serve the dish as a main course, just increase the number of scallops to six per person.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>⅓ cup diced zucchini (¼-inch dice)</strong></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>VIEIRAS CON CREMA DE AJO Y MERMELADA DE TOMATES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This modern Catalan way of preparing seafood is not only great for scallops; it’s also fabulous for many different types of seafood, from shrimp to lobster to fish fillets, such as turbot or sea bass. The contrast of tastes—the smooth garlicky cream and olive oil emulsion and the sweetened roasted tomatoes—is truly attention grabbing.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>14 medium-size garlic cloves; 12 lightly smashed and 2 minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup bottled clam juice, or chicken stock or broth</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the smashed garlic cloves, cream, and clam juice in a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, partially covered, until the garlic feels completely soft when poked with a skewer, 10 to 12 minutes. If the cream mixture has reduced in volume, add enough cream to make about 1 cup. Let the garlic cream cool for a few minutes, then transfer it to a blender and puree until smooth.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and the minced garlic in a small, deep skillet over medium-low heat. Stir until the garlic is very fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic cream and whisk until the sauce is emulsified.

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">LOBSTER AND MONKFISH SUQUET</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SUQUET DE LLAGOSTA I RAP</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Suquet</em> is a cousin of bouillabaisse, an essential, soupy stew and a classic in the regions of Catalonia and Valencia. Its name comes from the Catalan <em>suquejar,</em> or to throw off juice. Like bouillabaisse, it originated as a fisherman’s meal, prepared on boats from potatoes, seawater, and small gelatinous rockfish that wouldn’t fetch top money at markets but were excellent for flavoring broth. These days <em>suquet</em> can be as simple as a single kind of fish, some broth, a tomato or two, and a <em>picada</em> of minced garlic and parsley. Or it can get a bit more elaborate, prepared with a whole host of seafood and a fancier <em>picada.</em> Either way, the soul of a good <em>suquet</em> is a strong fish stock traditionally made with lots of small rockfish, a monkfish head, and other Mediterranean critters. Away from the Mediterranean shores, I suggest using clam juice infused with lobster shells. Or, you can make <em>suquet</em> with large shrimp instead of lobster, using the shells for the stock. In addition to the monkfish here (or in its place), sea bass, tilefish, snapper, or halibut are all welcome. So are clams and mussels. And, don’t forget the <em>allioli,</em> which gives the dish a great garlicky smack.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 live lobsters (1½ pounds each)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 medium-size garlic cloves; 6 left whole and 2 chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups bottled clam juice, diluted with 1½ cups water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup cubed day-old country bread</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup blanched almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into ⅜-inch-thick slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ to 2 pounds monkfish fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons minced, fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Almond or regular Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Bring a very large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Plunge the lobsters into the water, heads first. Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the lobsters to a large bowl or baking dish and let cool until manageable. Working over a bowl to catch the juices, remove the meat from the tails and claws, place it in a bowl, and set aside. Do not discard the shells. Remove and discard the tomalley. If there is any roe, set it aside with the meat. Crack the body and claw shells slightly.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the chopped garlic in a large pot over medium heat and cook for about 1 minute. Add the body and claw shells and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the clam juice and wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, for about 15 minutes to extract all of the flavor from the shells. <a id="page_220"/>Strain the stock, discarding the solids. (The recipe can be prepared 1 day ahead up to this point. Cover and refrigerate the lobster meat and stock separately.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil in a heavy 4-quart saucepan over medium heat until almost smoking. Add the bread and the 6 whole garlic cloves and cook until the bread is deep golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bread and the garlic to a mini food processor. Add the almonds to the saucepan and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting the heat so the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, add the almonds to the food processor. Run the food processor until the fried bread, garlic, and almonds are finely ground. Set the <em>picada</em> aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Add the onion to the saucepan and cook over low heat until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until they are thick, dark, and reduced, about 20 minutes, periodically adding a little lobster stock to the pan if they begin to stick or burn. Stir in the potatoes and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the lobster stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the potatoes are half cooked, 7 to 8 minutes. Rub the monkfish generously with salt, add it to the pan, and cook until just cooked through, about 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> When the fish is just cooked through, add the <em>picada</em> to the saucepan, then rinse out the processor bowl with a little liquid from the stew and add this as well.

Ladle the stew into bowls and serve with the <em>allioli</em> on the side. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CHIPIRON A LA PLANCHA EN ROJO, VERDE, Y NEGRO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Griddled squid served with peeled diced tomatoes, basil oil, and a vinaigrette tinted with squid ink is incredibly fashionable among Spanish cooks. This isn’t surprising—the simple combination of flavors is hard to beat, and the dish looks as striking as it tastes. Packets of squid ink are increasingly available at better fish stores, or you can order them by mail (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>). Look for the smallest squid you can find. It’s important that the squid sear in a griddle without releasing their liquid and stewing (for tips, see “Searing Squid” on <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_222">page 222</a>). Squeeze bottles, available from many cookware shops, are a great tool for drizzling the squid ink vinaigrette and the basil oil.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_221"/><strong>1½ pounds very small squid, cleaned but left whole (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#ch07_note4">Note</a>)</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the squid in a bowl. Rub it lightly with salt and toss it with a little olive oil. Let stand for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1½ teaspoons of the vinegar, and the sugar in another bowl. Toss to combine, then season with salt to taste. Let stand until ready to use.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_222"/>SEARING SQUID</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">There are few things more delicious than <em>chipirón a la plancha,</em> squid seared on a hot, flatiron griddle. When cooked properly—a procedure that takes just a few minutes—the squid comes out kissed by the fire and beautifully tender. However, when the searing goes wrong, the squid ends up stewing in its own juices, looking pallid, and tasting tough. Here’s how to do it right.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">First choose your utensil. Lacking a <em>plancha,</em> my favorite searing surface is a paella pan. Because the pan is so large, there is less chance of overcrowding the squid. Plus, as the surface is so thin, it heats very quickly. If you don’t have a paella pan, use a large seasoned cast-iron skillet or a griddle pan. A wok or a Mexican <em>comal</em> are fine, too.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">When searing squid, the crucial thing is not to put too much into the pan, lest it release too much liquid and sweat rather than sear. To sear a pound of squid properly, you’ll need to do it in four or five batches. Make sure to blot the squid thoroughly dry with paper towels before cooking. Heat the pan until it’s red-hot; this will take three to five minutes. The amount of oil should be minimal: Either wipe the pan with an oiled paper towel before heating it or toss the squid with a little oil right before searing.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Seared squid is delicious with nothing more than a wedge of lemon. It’s divine on a bed of arugula with a drizzle of <em>allioli,</em> perhaps one flavored with saffron or roasted garlic. As for the <em>plancha</em> technique, it’s ideal for cooking many different things—unpeeled shrimp, scallops, clams, small sardines, asparagus, oyster mushrooms, baby lamb chops—you name it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nothing describes “Spanish seafood treat” better than a plate of razor clams, all chewy sweetness and brininess. Seemingly, it’s a dish you can’t improve upon . . . unless, like chef Quim Marqués of the Barcelona seafood restaurant El Suquet de l’Almirall, you add a touch of genius—white truffle oil for an extra dash of exotic earthiness. Razor clams are an obsession in the American Pacific Northwest, available there from April to early fall. In other areas, look for them at Chinese seafood markets or by mail order. If you can’t find them, this simple but luxurious recipe is great made with regular clams, such as littlenecks or Manilas.</p>

(If you are using small clams, grill them in 2 or 3 batches.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> When all of the clams are done, transfer them to a platter, discarding any unopened ones.

<h3 class="h3a">CADIZ CLAMS WITH SPINACH AND EGGS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALMEJAS CON ESPINACAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">El Faro in Cádiz is one of Spain’s legendary fish restaurants. Its proprietor, Gonzalo Córdoba, runs a tight ship. Here he is, receiving a shipment <a id="page_223"/>of fish so fresh it still jumps. There he is plying a table of regulars with an old Pedro Ximénez sherry and boasting about his ethereally crisp <em>tortillas de camarones</em> (shrimp fritters) to a German couple. And finally he’s urging everyone to try his famous <em>almejas</em>: clams cooked in a deliciously messy sauce of spinach, brandy, and scrambled eggs. Gonzalo’s secret ingredient here is the pureed fish soup that lends the sauce roundness and depth. The lobster bisque that’s sold at many fancier food stores is the ideal option; failing that you can use Campbell’s cream of shrimp soup or bottled clam juice diluted with a little water. Though Cádiz is a long way from Hong Kong, there is something Cantonese in the expressive simplicity of the dish—not to mention the belief that everything tastes better with eggs.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>About 10 ounces fresh spinach, stemmed and rinsed but not dried</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, finely minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds Manila or small littleneck clams, scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons good-quality brandy, preferably Spanish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup store-bought seafood or lobster bisque, or ⅓ cup Campbell’s Cream of Shrimp Soup whisked together with 2 to 3 tablespoons water, or ⅓ cup clam juice diluted with 3 tablespoons water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Crusty bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cook the spinach in the water clinging to its leaves in a large pot over medium heat until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Drain the spinach in a sieve, pressing gently to get rid of the excess moisture. Coarsely chop the spinach and set it aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large, wide pot or wok over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook until it is very fragrant but not colored, about 2 minutes.

Add the seafood bisque, cover the pot, and steam the clams until they open, 4 to 7 minutes depending on their size. Discard any unopened clams.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the wilted spinach to the pot and toss it with the clams for about 1 minute. Using a large spoon, push the clams and spinach to the side of the pot. Reduce the heat to low, add the eggs, and stir, scrambling the eggs until they just begin to set, 45 seconds to 1 minute.

<p class="noindent">What timing—the day I finished testing chef Quim Marqués’s exquisite recipe for razor clams with truffle oil (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_222">page 222</a>), Quim himself arrived in New York from Barcelona for a guest <a id="page_225"/>stint at Solera restaurant. On his menu was a dish of clams “poached” in olive oil together with pine nuts and bits of serrano ham. Once again, I was wowed: three simple flavors, each with its own elusively sweet aftertaste, combined in a dish that lingered for days in my memory. When I tried making it for a dinner party, <em>knockout</em> was the word that came out of everyone’s mouth. And the dish is ridiculously easy, to boot. For best results use a lovely olive oil and good pine nuts, preferably imported from the Mediterranean, not from China. You’ll want plenty of bread to mop up the sauce. Any leftover sauce is delicious tossed with pasta.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1¼ cups fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALMEJAS CON ALCACHOFAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Clams and artichokes is a truly ingenious Spanish pairing: The particular sweetness of both ingredients mingles in the mouth in a most delightful way. Found on the menu of many Spanish seafood restaurants during the artichoke season, the dish should really be called artichokes with clams, rather than the other way around, since the chokes constitute the principal flavor. Fresh, young artichokes make all the difference, but if these are out of season, go ahead and use frozen artichoke hearts. The dish is usually served as a first course, with bread to dunk in the sauce.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 medium-size artichokes, pared down to the hearts (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_370">page 370</a>)</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_226"/>NIFTY TRICKS: POACHING IN OLIVE OIL</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">At modern Spanish restaurants these days, your fish order is likely to be <em>confitado en aceite de oliva.</em> This means gently cooked in a bath of olive oil. Prepared this way, fish comes out amazingly silky and moist and not at all oily. A low cooking temperature is the key to this method: In Spain it’s never higher than 65°C (about 150°F), just below the point at which the proteins in the fish begin to dry out. Great candidates for this smart, simple technique are very fresh halibut, sea trout, salmon, snapper, or cod fillets, and sashimi-quality tuna loin. It’s best if the fish is cut into 1-inch-thick, 6- to 7-ounce portions, and is at room temperature. The olive oil should ideally be aromatic and rather light in texture; it can also be cut with a lighter, flavorless oil, such as sunflower or peanut oil. For even more flavor, before cooking the fish, infuse the oil with aromatics, such as unpeeled lightly smashed garlic cloves, sprigs of thyme or rosemary, citrus peel, or even a stick of vanilla (this is delicious with flaky white-fleshed fish, such as cod). To do this, cook the oil with the aromatics over low heat for about 15 minutes, then either strain it before adding the fish, or leave the aromatics in.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">To submerge a single layer of 1-inch-thick fillets you’ll need 3 to 4 cups of oil. Use a saucepan in which the fish will fit snugly so you don’t waste oil. Pour the oil in the saucepan and heat it over low heat until it registers about 150°F on a candy thermometer. Add the fish and adjust the heat to maintain a temperature of about 130°F. It will take about 15 minutes for cod or halibut to be done, less for rare tuna or salmon. But, if you leave the fish in longer, no problem: At such a low temperature, it’s unlikely to overcook. Blot the oil off the fish before serving. Another method is to heat the oil, pour it over the fish to cover, and bake in a 225°F oven for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Oil-poached fish is best served with an acidic counterpoint, such as Tomato Vinaigrette (<a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_201">page 201</a>), Black Olive Vinaigrette (<a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_205">page 205</a>), or a sprightly raw tomato or cucumber salsa. Or you can simply dress it with fresh olive oil and a dusting of Maldon (flaky) sea salt. Shrimp, scallops, or lobster also taste incredible when prepared this way. Try it—the texture of olive oil–poached seafood will come as a revelation!</p>

One of the best places to lunch here is La Puda. Here the specialty is a great pile of mussels with a wonderful, sassy tomato sauce enriched by a <em>picada</em> of fried garlic and nuts that lends a straightforward dish a hint of toasty complexity.

The tomatoes will have dissolved and the sauce will be flavorful. Add additional stock if it seems too thick.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the fried garlic, almonds, and hazelnuts in a mini food processor and pulse until finely ground. Add the garlic mixture to the tomato sauce. Cook, stirring, until well blended, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the mussels to the pot, cover it, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Cook the mussels, shaking the pot occasionally, until they open, 5 to 7 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. Season with salt and black pepper to taste, sprinkle the parsley over the mussels and sauce, then serve in soup bowls with the bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>
