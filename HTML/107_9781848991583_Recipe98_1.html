<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_162"/><b>Pan-fried Chili Squid</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Garlic Mayonnaise</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Squid is another of my favorite foods. In Spain, it is served everywhere, mainly as tapas, but also cooked and flavored in many different ways. At The Vineyard we sometimes prepare squid sous-vide—sealed in a bag and slowly cooked in a water bath—but I particularly like it this way, too, with the squid coated in spiced bread crumbs and fried until golden brown, then served with the perfect garlic mayonnaise. You can buy panko bread crumbs in Japanese food stores or online if you can’t find them in your supermarket. In fact, the name just means “bread crumbs,” but they are processed to form flakes rather than fine crumbs, so they tend to give a crispier coating.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">4 squid, about 6 ounces each</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups panko bread crumbs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon dried chili flakes</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 red chilies, seeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxta">4 tablespoons very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE GARLIC MAYONNAISE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Start by preparing the squid. Wash them thoroughly, then pat dry, remove the tentacles and leave to one side, then remove and discard the beaks. Cut the bodies in half lengthwise, then rinse and pat dry again. Cut each body in half lengthwise once more so you have 16 pieces, plus the tentacles. Pat everything dry with paper towels and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> To make the garlic mayonnaise, put the egg yolks, vinegar and mustard in a bowl and whisk together. Whisking continuously, drizzle in the oil, a little at a time. until the mayonnaise is thick and creamy. Add the crushed garlic and lime zest and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and put in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put the bread crumbs into a food processor with the chili flakes and blitz to a fine powder. Pour the chili powder onto a plate. Break the eggs into a shallow bowl and whisk with the chopped fresh chili. Put the flour on another plate. Pass the squid through the flour, then drop into the chili-flavored egg and finally into the chili-flavored bread crumbs, tossing to coat on all sides.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Heat half the butter with the oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add half the squid and pan-fry 2 to 3 minutes, turning once, until golden brown and crunchy. Drain on paper towels, then repeat with the remaining butter and squid.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Pile the squid on a large plate, scatter the parsley over the top and put it in the middle of the table with the garlic mayonnaise and let everyone help themselves.</p>
