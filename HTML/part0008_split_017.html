			<p class="rec-intro">Use the best chocolate you can get for making this tart, as it really is worth it. And yes, it does contain a lot of butter but it is very special. It’s great for a party as you can make it the day before and keep it in the fridge, but do warm it through gently and serve it tepid. </p>

			<p class="body">To make the pastry, cut the butter into small pieces and leave it to soften at room temperature. Sift the flour and salt, place them on the work surface and make a well in the centre. Add the butter and sugar and gently work together with your fingertips. Add the egg yolk and gradually draw in the flour, adding drops of water as you go. When all the flour has been incorporated, shape the dough into a ball, but do not overwork it. Wrap the pastry in cling film and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before using. </p>
			<p class="body">To make the bitter orange sauce, boil the orange juice and sugar until reduced by three-quarters. Add the marmalade, stir until it has melted, then pass the sauce through a fine sieve. Leave to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4. Roll out the pastry and use it to line a 26cm flan tin. Cover the base of the pastry with greaseproof paper and add some dried beans, then bake for 20 minutes. Remove the beans and paper and return the pastry to the oven for 5 minutes to cook completely. Turn the oven down to 140°C/Fan 120°C/Gas 1.</p>
			<p class="body">Whisk the whole eggs, yolks and sugar with an electric mixer at full speed for 5 minutes, or until pale and frothy. Melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, then fold into the egg mixture. Pour this on to the pastry base, place the tart in the oven immediately and bake for 15 minutes. Remove and leave to cool to tepid before serving with bitter orange sauce and some ice cream (see <a href="part0008_split_025.html#Brown-butter-ice-cream">here</a>).</p>
