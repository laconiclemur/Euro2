			<p class="body">Cut each chicken neck into 3 pieces and the gizzards in half. Trim the thickest part of each wing to reveal the bone by pushing down the meat so it resembles a lollipop and keep these for later. Trim the rest of the giblets as necessary.</p>
			<p class="body">Heat a tablespoon of the butter with a little drizzle of oil in a large saucepan and fry the necks, gizzards, wing tips and combs. Sprinkle in the flour and stir well until brown, then pour in the stock and 500ml of water. Add the bouquet garni and seasoning and simmer for an hour or until all the meat is tender. Pass the soup through a strainer and keep warm. </p>
			<p class="body">Pick the meat off the necks and slice the gizzards and combs. Heat a tablespoon of butter in a small pan and gently cook the sliced celery until tender. Fry the livers, hearts and wing lollipops in the rest of the butter and a little oil until golden, then season. </p>
			<p class="body">Add the cooked rice to the soup and warm through. Serve the soup in deep plates with the roughly chopped meat.</p>
