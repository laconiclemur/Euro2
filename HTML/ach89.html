<p class="noindent">During my family’s stay in Italy in 1974, we went to visit my mother’s cousin Catherine in Calabria. “I remember working with her in the kitchen and watching as she made these light, delicious stuffed crepes,” says Joan. “Before that I had used this stuffing to make cannelloni or stuffed shells.”</p>
<p class="indentb">This is a terrific first course or buffet dish. It may be prepared earlier in the day or may be frozen for several weeks before bringing to room temperature and baking.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CREPES</span>:</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup grated mozzarella cheese (about 4 ounces)</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound), all liquid squeezed out</span></p>

<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE CREPES</span>:</span></p>
<p class="noindentqa"><span class="red">1.</span> In a large bowl, beat the eggs until frothy. Beat in a small portion of the water, followed by a small portion of the flour. Continue adding water and flour, beating after each addition, to make a smooth batter. Season with salt.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_174"/><span class="red">2.</span> Line a baking sheet with waxed paper or plastic wrap and set aside. Brush an 8-inch crepe or nonstick pan with olive oil. Warm the pan over medium-high heat. Pour <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the batter into the pan. Swirl the batter around the pan to evenly coat the bottom, and pour any excess batter back into the bowl. The batter should cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Cook the crepe until bubbles appear, about 1 minute. Flip over the crepe and cook the other side for an additional minute.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Remove to the prepared baking sheet and continue cooking crepes, placing waxed paper or plastic wrap over each one on the baking sheet. (If the crepes begin to stick to the pan, brush it with more oil.) With this batter you will be able to make 24 crepes.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE FILLING</span>:</span></p>
<p class="noindentqa"><span class="red">1.</span> In a large bowl, stir together the ricotta, mozzarella, egg, parsley, white sauce, and spinach. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the Romano cheese and season with salt.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F. Divide <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the tomato sauce between two large baking dishes, and spread to cover the bottom with a thin layer.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Spread a rounded tablespoon of the filling across the bottom third of each crepe. Roll the crepe closed and place, seam side down, in one of the prepared baking dishes. Continue filling crepes and arranging them in the baking dishes, making sure that their sides do not touch. Spread a generous teaspoon of tomato sauce across the top of each crepe. Sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons Romano cheese.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and bake until the crepes puff, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, with remaining warm tomato sauce and grated Romano or Parmesan cheese if desired.</p>
