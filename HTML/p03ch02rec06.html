<p class="summary"><span class="italic">It is worth learning to make mayonnaise and acquiring confidence, as it is the basis of many other sauces. The eggs should be fresh, and if possible free-range and organic. All the ingredients, including the egg yolks, must be at room temperature. And the bowl should be warmed with hot water and thoroughly dried. All this is very important.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Extra virgin olive oil makes mayonnaise too strong for most tastes. Chefs I spoke to in Spain used sunflower oil or refined (not extra virgin) olive oil, or a mixture of sunflower and extra virgin olive oil. I use a mix of two-thirds sunflower oil and one-third mild extra virgin olive oil. But you should do it to your taste.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun">¼ teaspoon salt, or a pinch more</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun1">1¼ cups oil—about 2:1 parts sunflower and mild extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="recsum">Take the eggs out of the fridge well before you need them—it will help keep them from curdling.</p>
<p class="recsum1"><span>Put the yolks in a warm mixing bowl, add the salt and lemon juice or vinegar, and beat with a whisk or an electric mixer for about 1 minute, until smooth. Add the oil (first the sunflower oil, then the olive oil) to the egg yolks drop by drop at first, whisking constantly. When the mixture begins to thicken (within a minute, after you’ve added about 4 tablespoons oil), you can add the oil a little faster, but not too fast, as the egg yolks can only absorb the oil at a certain pace. Allow the oil to be absorbed each time before adding more. When all the oil is incorporated and you have a thick, smooth, firm mayonnaise, taste and add a little more salt and/or lemon or vinegar if necessary, whisking all the time. If it is too thick, whisk in a tablespoon of water.</span></p>
<p class="recsum1"><span>Put the mayonnaise, covered, in the fridge until you are ready to use it. It keeps well for a few days.</span></p>
<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> Mayonnaise can suddenly curdle, meaning it will become quite thin and the oil will start to separate and float to the top. If this should happen, you can easily save it: Put another room-temperature egg yolk into another warm bowl, then start whisking in the curdled mayonnaise, a teaspoon at a time to begin with, until it re-emulsifies.</p>
