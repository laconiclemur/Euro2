 TAMARIND PRAWN COCKTAIL SANDWICH</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002729">
<em>Retro as they are, I love a good prawn cocktail. And what’s even better in my opinion is a prawn cocktail between two slices of bread. In case you’re wondering where I tasted my first-ever prawn cocktail, the answer to your question is my dad’s Indian restaurant. (Yes, that’s right! My dad served prawn cocktail in his Indian restaurant!) I don’t know if it was authentic or anywhere near the real thing – all I remember is that it was delicious, rich, creamy and full of prawns. This is my take on the classic, but in sandwich form and with my own little twists.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put the cooked prawns into a bowl, making sure not to tip in any excess moisture.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002740">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Now take the seafood sticks and start peeling them in strips lengthways, until all the flesh is shredded, or slice thinly with a knife if yours are difficult to peel. Add them to the prawns.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002741">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Put the mayonnaise, tamarind paste and pink peppercorns into a separate bowl. Give this all a thorough mix and add to the seafood. Stir it all together.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002742">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Butter your bread slices. (I like to put lashings on. My rule is if I can’t see my teeth marks in the butter, there’s no point in eating it!)</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002743">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Lay some shredded lettuce on top of half the buttered bread slices and spoon on the prawn cocktail mixture.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002744">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the rest of the buttered bread slices on top. Now, if like my dad you want to serve this on a bed of lettuce in a tall martini glass, by all means do so. There are no rules.</p>
