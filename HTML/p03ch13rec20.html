<p class="summary1">Zurracapote, <span class="italic">also called</span> marmelada de frutos secos<span class="italic">, is a New Year’s Eve special in the Basque Country and Navarre. It is great served with this Basque custard, which can be flavored with rum or Cognac; I love it with rum. The recipe is from Carlos Posadas Gomez, a young Basque chef at the Santo Mauro restaurant in Madrid.</span> Zurracapote <span class="italic">was not on his sensational tasting menu—it came out of his childhood memories when I asked him about traditional Basque dishes.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound pitted prunes</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound dried peaches or apricots</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup Rioja or other dry red wine</p>
<p class="qun">3 cups water</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ to ½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CUSTARD</span></p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">6 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons rum</p>
<p class="qun1">Toasted almonds, pine nuts, and/or walnuts (optional)</p>
<p class="recsum">Soak the dried fruits in the wine and water to cover for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Put the soaked fruits, with their soaking liquid, and the sugar in a saucepan and simmer, covered, over low heat, for 20 to 30 minutes, until the fruits are very soft; uncover at the end to reduce the liquid. Let cool, then chill.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, for the custard, bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan; remove from the heat. With an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar in a bowl to a light, pale cream, then beat in the flour. Gradually pour in the hot milk, a little at a time, beating vigorously until well blended. Then pour the mixture back into the pan. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula over very low heat for about 10 minutes, until the custard thickens. If any lumps form at the start, they will disappear as you work the cream vigorously. Add the rum and mix well. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve chilled or at room temperature in little bowls, the cream at the bottom and the fruits on top with their wine sauce. There will be a lot of custard. Pour some in a bowl for people to help themselves to more. If you like, also pass around a bowl of lightly toasted almonds, pine nuts, or walnuts, or a mix of the three.</p>
