Place whites in a large bowl or in the bowl of your electric mixer. Make sure the bowl is very clean and at a temperature close to the eggs’. Now, I’ve never failed to beat egg whites to the desired stiffness but there seems to be people who have. The trick is to keep the bowl at a temperature close to the eggs, make sure that none of the yolk gets into the white, and that the bowl is clean and dry. Then add elbow grease.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Melt the chocolate with a tablespoon of water in a glass dish in the microwave (or use the double boiler method if you prefer cleaning a lot of extra pans.)</p><p class="calibre6">3- Add the vanilla and egg yolks to the melted chocolate one by one and stir rapidly to incorporate. Add one yolk at a time so that they won’t cook in the heat of the chocolate.</p><p class="calibre6">4- While the chocolate mixture cools, beat the egg whites until they are firm enough that a spoon can stand when placed in the center of the bowl. Halfway through beating the eggs add the salt.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Add the beaten egg whites to the egg yolks and chocolate mixture. Then ever so gently, and in a scooping and folding motion, fold the chocolate mixture and the egg whites together with a spatula, careful not to rush which would break the precious bubbles that make this a mousse.</p><p class="calibre6">6- When the mix is homogeneous, divide into 4 pretty bowls and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Serve with berries and maybe a dash of whipped cream.</p></div></div></body></html>
