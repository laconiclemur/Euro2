			<p class="rec-intro">The seasoning of the mango is vital to this dessert. In the tropics, mangoes and pineapples are often served sprinkled with pepper or chilli – both a perfect foil for the fragrant flowery sweetness of these fruits. For this recipe you need mangoes that are ripe enough to taste good but not so ripe that you can’t slice them neatly. If you can’t manage the mango curls, don’t worry – cut your mangoes into matchsticks and the millefeuille will still taste delicious. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g all-butter puff pastry</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">plain flour, for rolling </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 ripe mangoes</p>
			<p class="ing-nu"> grated zest of 1 lime and juice of 2</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tsp ground piment d’Espelette (chilli powder)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu"> 60g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">seeds from 1 fresh pomegranate </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">icing sugar, for dusting</p>
			<p class="for-the">Crème pâtissière</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 medium free-range egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">25g flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100ml double cream, whipped</p>

			<p class="body">Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to form a rectangle, 2.5mm thick – that’s about the thickness of a 2 pence coin. Place the pastry on a baking tray and leave in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Prick the pastry at intervals with a fork to prevent it from shrinking as it cooks. Place a sheet of greaseproof paper on top, followed by another baking tray to keep the pastry flat. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the tray and paper. Turn the oven temperature down to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 and cook the pastry for another 20 minutes or until crisp and cooked through. Remove from the oven and carefully slip the pastry on to a wire rack to cool. Cut the pastry into 12 rectangles, each 8 x 4cm.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the crème pâtissière, whisk the eggs with the sugar in a bowl and add the flour. Bring the milk to the boil and pour it into the bowl, mixing well. Tip the mixture back into the saucepan and bring it to the boil, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat as soon as it boils and dust the surface with a little icing sugar to avoid a crust or skin forming. Once the crème is completely cold, fold in the whipped cream. </p>
			<p class="body">Skin the mangoes, slice them and season with the lime zest, half the lime juice and the piment d’Espelette. Roll the slices into curls as neatly as you can. To make the sauce, blitz all the mango trimmings with the caster sugar and the rest of the lime juice until smooth.</p>
			<p class="body">To assemble, take a pastry rectangle and pipe a little crème pâtissière over it. Add some mango curls, pomegranate seeds and then repeat, finishing with a layer of pastry. Dust with icing sugar or add some spun sugar or tiny brandy snaps if you like. Serve with the mango sauce. </p>
