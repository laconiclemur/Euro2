    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page61"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">It’s easy to miss the lids.</span></span> Their rusted metal surfaces blend so completely into the surrounding moonscape that only their rounded handles give them away. When lifted, the heavy covers reveal what at first appears to be nothing but a hole in the ground, until the geothermal smoke plume billowing up from inside clears to reveal more to the story. These are the geyser bread ovens of Iceland, passed down from one generation to the next, where sweet, dense rye bread known as <em><a id="ind89a"/>rugbraud</em>, or “geyser bread,” has been baked in the same way for centuries.</p>
<p class="extract">The landscape on the north shore of <a id="ind399a"/>Lake Mývatn is streaked in heaving, alluvial swirls of flaxen and rust that break at the edge of electric blue geothermal pools. The ovens rise above the lake on a gently sloping hill, where clouds of geothermal heat never subside and it is possible, even on the harshest winter day, to find warmth by standing in them. For generations, bakers of all ages have trudged through the countryside with their metal tins, waxed milk cartons, and, most recently, white plastic buckets filled with malty brown dough. In the past, every family had its own bread recipe, but modernization and inertia have battered that once-solid tradition.</p>
<p class="extract">Bakers still come to the geothermal ovens of Mývatn, though admittedly in smaller numbers. They do not arrive on foot as they once did, but they still carry their dough with them to their family ovens, where within twenty-four hours it is transformed from a thickened mass that looks like gingerbread into a dense rye loaf. The dough cooks slowly in the humid earth, absorbing the <em>terroir</em> of the unique topography. When the bread is ready, veteran and novice <em>rugbraud</em> bakers alike know that the best way to eat a slice is hot from the oven, slathered with creamy butter. It has been eaten this way from the beginning, and there is no point in fooling with perfection.</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="ind279a"/>Gudny Halldórsdóttir was born in the remote northern village of <a id="ind351a"/>Langanes in 1930 and, as so many young people do, left home to seek a better life. At nineteen, she spent the winter in a culinary training program at a private home in the town of <a id="ind9a"/>Akureyri, known as the Capital of North Iceland. Her brother sold his Bible to buy her the book she needed for her studies, and with the burden of debt heavy on her shoulders, she moved farther east to Mývatn to work at a hotel run by her parents, who had relocated there a few years earlier. It was here that she learned how to bake geyser bread, walking back and forth from the ovens a few times each week with her metal baking case filled with dough.</p>
<p class="extract">At some point on her journey, Gudny married a local man, with whom she had five children. Today, she has eleven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, and although her life has changed dramatically since leaving her village more than six decades ago, one thing remains the same: she still bakes <em>rugbraud</em> in her inherited family ovens on the storied shores of Lake Mývatn.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c03-s15"><a id="page62"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Rugbraud Baker Gudny Halldórsdóttir</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Where did you learn to bake geyser bread?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">When I came to live in the <a id="ind400a"/>Mývatn area in the 1950s, people were baking bread in the ground and I wanted to try it. I got a recipe for a sweet rye bread from a friend back home. I began by baking it in a standard oven, but I decided to start baking it in the ground in the late 1960s, and I have done it that way ever since.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do people in your community still bake it in the traditional way?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, people still do, even though they don’t have to rely on geothermal energy any longer. Usually, if they are making <em>rugbraud</em>, they will bake it in the ground, never in a traditional oven.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you construct an oven for geyser bread, and does each family have its own oven or do you share them?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The walls need to be fortified with bricks, because the sides of the oven can cave in easily, and heavy metal plates are used as covers. Our family has two large ovens that my son dug in the late 1980s. Each one is about one meter [three feet] deep and one and a quarter to two meters [four by six feet] across. Each family tends to have its own oven, so there are very few bakers per oven.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you know how old the geyser bread tradition is?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I’m not sure how old the baking tradition is, but I do know it arose out of necessity during a time when there was no electricity and fuel was expensive. People had to rely on the heat in the ground to bake their daily bread.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Has the tradition changed through the years?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">My grandfather told me that in the 1930s, teenagers were sent on foot to the ovens from as far away as five kilometers [three miles]. It was a difficult journey because there were very few roads. Today access to the ovens is easy. People also baked the bread differently. Each time they baked, they dug holes in the sulfur for holding the tightly sealed metal pots. Now we dig permanent holes in the clay.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page63"/>How much bread do you bake?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We’ve been selling bread in local shops since the early 1980s, but we always keep a little bit for ourselves. During the busy summer months, we bake around forty kilograms [ninety pounds] of bread daily to fill the demand. But people who are just baking it for themselves make one to six kilograms [two to thirteen pounds] at a time. They then share it with their neighbors or freeze it for later use. A wax-coated paper milk carton holds just under a kilogram [two pounds] of bread, the classic size of a loaf.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you use milk containers to bake your bread?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, because we produce so much, we have twenty liter-size [quart-size] sealed containers, each fitting one of our holes. People who are just baking bread for themselves tend to use milk containers. This technique has been around since the 1980s. An even more recent one is to use a round plastic bucket. Some still choose to do it like we did in the old days, using a tin or other metal pot with a good lid.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Does each family have its own <em>rugbraud</em> recipe?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Families used to but not as much nowadays. Today, many people use a standard <em>rugbraud</em> recipe that has stood the test of time.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do the seasons affect when you bake <em>rugbraud</em>?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, it doesn’t depend on the season at all. The heat can drop temporarily if the winds get very strong, or a hole can disappear for no reason and people have to dig a new oven. But you can bake <em>rugbraud</em> even in the dead of winter.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Why do you think the geyser bread tradition has endured?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The benefits of baking bread in the ground are that it turns out softer than when you bake it in a conventional oven and it has almost no crust. It connects us to our past, too—plus, it’s much more fun.</p>

<p class="Essays_header"><a id="page65"/><span class="dk_blue">VISITING <a id="ind401a"/>LAKE MÝVATN</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Lake Mývatn, which stands in the center of northern Iceland, is one of the most mercurial places in the nation, and for a country that boasts a wealth of out-of-this-world natural beauty, that is quite an endorsement. The lake itself is surrounded by volcanoes that jut up from the dusty red terrain like a moonscape smoldering down to ashes. Algae balls that are green and soft like wet moss bob on the glassy surface of the lake. No one knows how they form or why, but because they exist only in Mývatn and one other lake in Japan, they are a rare and coveted sighting.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">To the east of the lake are dozens of cone-shaped hot pots as tall as grown men, spewing blasts of geothermal steam from deep within the earth. Nothing is better on a frigid Icelandic day than to stand in a hot cloud of steam and inhale its warm, healing vapors. The nearby Mývatn geothermal baths offer another warm respite from the cold. Farther north are the geyser bread ovens, where local families bake their daily loaves of sweet rye.</p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR (PLUS 12 HOURS TO DEHYDRATE THE CHIPS)</div>
<div class="headnote1">Beer and bread are a natural combination, so what better way to showcase them than to combine them into one element of a recipe? Here, Gunnar adds beer to the rye bread before dehydrating it into chips. That flavor paired with the tanginess of skyr, a traditional thick, rich fresh cheese similar in consistency to <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_bm1_r1.htm#bm1-K1">Greek yogurt</a>, will make this one of your favorite snacks. There is a recipe for <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-s49">skyr</a> in this book, but store-bought skyr, available at many major supermarkets, is a good substitute.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Chives are just one of the many flavorings that can be added to the skyr. At <a id="ind323a"/>Icelandic Fish &amp; Chips—an organic restaurant in downtown <a id="ind496a"/>Reykjavík known for its fish breaded in the airiest spelt-and-barley batter—the kitchen has really upped the skyr dipping sauce game. Fish is served with seemingly endless dipping flavor options, including <em>tzatziki</em>, horseradish, honey mustard, and dill. It’s an example of how fun it can be to play around with what you add to skyr, a rich and creamy ingredient that’s ready for almost anything you want to stir into it. You can also add flavor to this snack by sprinkling seasonings into the bread and beer batter before you dehydrate it. Freshly grated nutmeg, dried herbs, and red pepper flakes are all excellent choices.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>BEER CHIPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>7 ounces (200 g) rye or other dense, robustly flavored bread (such as pumpernickel or tangy sourdough)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (120 ml) India pale ale, plus more as needed</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_space"><strong><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-s49">Skyr</a></strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Finely chopped fresh chives, for garnish</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the chips, preheat the oven to 185°F (85°C). Break up the bread into chunks, place in a food processor, and process until finely crumbled. Transfer the crumbs to a saucepan, pour in the ale, and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cook for about 15 minutes, until the bread is soft and has completely absorbed the beer.</div>
<div class="method">Return the bread mixture to the food processor and process until smooth. Turn the batter out onto a baking sheet and spread in an even layer ¾-inch (2-cm) thick. Bake for about 12 hours, until completely dry and crispy. Let cool to room temperature, then break into chips.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon skyr into a bowl and sprinkle with chives. Accompany the chips with the skyr.</div>

<div class="headnote">Cucumbers were not cultivated by the earliest settlers in Iceland, but they are enjoyed by contemporary Icelanders, who primarily purchase those grown in the greenhouses that dot the countryside. Gunnar frequently uses cucumbers in his recipes, and because he is a stickler for never throwing away even the trimmings from a vegetable, he came up with the charred cucumber peels in this recipe. The charring brings out the natural sugars in the cucumber skins, resulting in a sweet taste reminiscent of dried orange peels. The pickled cucumber is bright and tart and pairs well with the tanginess of the buttermilk and with the nuttiness of the bread powder, which is also delicious sprinkled over ice cream.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>BUTTERMILK ESPUMA</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cups (480 ml) buttermilk</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>PICKLED CUCUMBER</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 large Kirby cucumber</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>6½ tablespoons (100 ml) malt vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (50 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¾ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>CHARRED CUCUMBER</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Reserved cucumber peel and flesh (from the pickled cucumber)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>HAY-SMOKED RYE BREAD POWDER</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1¾ ounces (50 g) rye bread, torn into bite-size pieces (2 loosely packed cups)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>About 4 handfuls of <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-eass6">hay</a></strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Rapeseed oil, for garnish</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the espuma, line a colander with a coffee filter and place over a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into the colander and let drain, refrigerated, for 4 hours, until it resembles a thickened crème anglaise. If it is too thick, whisk in some of the whey. Transfer the thickened buttermilk to a siphon and charge the siphon with 2 nitrous oxide (NO<sub class="frac">2</sub>) chargers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Shake the siphon vigorously and refrigerate until chilled (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note12">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled cucumber, prepare an ice bath. Peel the cucumber and cut it lengthwise into sixths. Slice the seed area and a bit of the soft internal flesh into strips as long as the cucumber. Reserve the peel and soft internal flesh for the charred cucumber. Coarsely chop the external cucumber and transfer the pieces to a glass jar just large enough to <a id="page69"/>contain them. Combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the cucumber, immersing it. Cover the jar loosely and place in the ice bath until chilled. Seal the jar tightly and refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the charred cucumber, thoroughly pat the reserved cucumber peel and flesh dry with paper towels. Arrange them as flatly as possible on a new set of paper towels and let them air-dry for 4 to 6 hours. Be sure the peel is completely dry, or it will curl during the charring process.</div>
<div class="method">Arrange the peel and reserved soft internal flesh in a nonstick frying pan, place over low heat, and heat, turning the pieces over a few times to prevent uneven charring, for about 10 minutes, until the peel turns black and the flesh is charred. Remove from the pan and reserve.</div>
<div class="method">To make the smoked bread powder, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). In a bowl, toss the bread pieces with the butter until evenly coated, season with salt, and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast for 6 to 8 minutes, until the pieces are crisp on the outside but still soft and chewy on the inside. Transfer to a metal bowl.</div>
<div class="method">Put the hay in a pot large enough to easily accommodate the bowl holding the bread, then ignite the hay with a kitchen torch. Once it has burned down to smoldering ashes (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note12">see notes</a>), place the bowl on the hay to extinguish any remaining flame and cover the pot with either a tight-fitting lid or with aluminum foil. Be sure the flame is extinguished before smoking the bread or it will taste like jet fuel. Once the smoke has completely subsided, after about 5 minutes, remove the lid or foil, let the bread cool to room temperature, and then pulse to a coarse powder in a spice grinder.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, dispense the espuma into a bowl and arrange the pickled and charred cucumber on top. Sprinkle with the bread powder and drizzle with oil.</div>
<div class="note" id="c03-note12">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. A double layer of cheesecloth can be used in place of the coffee filter. If you do not have a siphon, just before serving, froth the buttermilk espuma with an immersion blender or whisk it vigorously. It will not be enough to create a true espuma (a thick foam or froth), but it will be enough to lighten and aerate the thickened buttermilk.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. It is fine if the hay has not turned to ashes before you begin the smoking process. Billowing smoke from still-smoldering hay is sufficient.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">These delightful beet pillows were inspired by Asian soup dumplings but have a strictly Icelandic flavor profile. Beets, a mainstay vegetable throughout the Nordic countries, are cleverly transformed into tiny pillows that are perfect for popping into your mouth at the start of a meal. The vinegar coins tickle the nose with their acidic aroma, while the tarragon cream mellows the dish. Such a miniature package defies the almost impossibly complex taste experience these pillows deliver and illustrates how much flavor can be realized using the most humble ingredients. At Dill, Gunnar serves his beet pillows on a stone foraged from the countryside. Stones are believed to possess healing properties in Iceland, which makes it fitting that they are paired with this renewing commencement to a meal.</div>

Place a 1-inch (2.5-cm) dollop of the mixture in the center of a beet slice, then bring the sides up around the filling and pinch them together like a coin purse. The pillow should resemble a miniature Asian soup dumpling. Repeat with the remaining slices and filling. Refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the vinegar coins, prepare an ice bath. Combine the vinegar, sugar, gellan, and tarragon in a saucepan, place over medium heat, and heat to 185°F (85°C). Simmer at this temperature for 1 minute, skimming off any foam from the surface as it forms. Remove the pan from the heat and nest it in the ice bath until the liquid is chilled. Pour the cooled liquid into a thin layer onto a small, flat plate about 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>) and refrigerate until chilled and fully set. Using a ring cutter slightly smaller than the beet pillows (about the size of a penny), punch out disks and top each pillow with one. The coins are delicate and brittle, and a small offset spatula works best for this step, but a paring knife works well, too.</div>
<div class="method">To make the crispy rye bread, preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Cut the bread into ½-inch (12-mm) pieces and put in a bowl. Add the butter, toss until evenly coated, and season with salt. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 9 minutes, until crispy. Cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, using an offset spatula, top each beet pillow with a vinegar coin, dot with the remaining tarragon cream, and sprinkle with the crispy rye bread.</div>

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Gellan gum is a water-soluble food additive that is often used as a thickener in place of sheet gelatin. There are two types of gellan gum: high-acyl and low-acyl. The low-acyl variety results in an extremely firm, crumbly product. High-acyl gellan gum results in a substance that is elastic and flexible, which is why high-acyl is used in this recipe. It is available online and in many specialty food stores.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. A Japanese <a id="ind365a"/>mandoline is one of the handiest tools a home cook can have in his or her kitchen arsenal. The only caveat about this inexpensive and easy-to-use tool is that you must watch out for your fingers as you slice vegetables into uniformally thin segments with the saber-sharp blades. One way to stay safe is to wear a double layer of latex kitchen gloves as you work. Another way is not to hold the vegetable with your fingers as you cut. Instead, use your palm to guide the vegetable back and forth, as it is less likely to come in contact with the blades.</span></p>

<div class="yield">MAKES 1 LARGE JAR <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: 3 WEEKS</div>
<div class="headnote">Pears are expensive in Iceland, but <a id="ind509a"/>rhubarb is abundant throughout the country, where the stalks grow to heights rarely seen elsewhere in the world. The outsize stalks are due to the lack of sun, which ensures a long, slow growing season. This recipe is Gunnar’s exchange of a luxury item for one that is easily accessible to anyone. It is democratization of produce in action and is as appealing as a pear could ever be. The flavor is tender and sweet, with a hint of tartness from the vinegar. Ice cream is a nice companion, as is a soft fresh cheese like ricotta. Gunnar often serves his “pears” at Dill with fresh cream and crispy rye bread powder.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>14 ounces (400 g) rhubarb stalks, pale, tender portion only</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cups (480 ml) cider vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ cups (300 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 sprig tarragon</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Using the white portion only, trim each stalk into pieces that will fit inside a large widemouthed glass jar, then arrange the pieces in the jar. Combine the vinegar, sugar, and tarragon in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

<div class="headnote">If there is any recipe in this cookbook that might sound unappetizing, it is this one. The trick is to get over the term <em>ice cream</em> in the title and think of this as a savory dish that celebrates Iceland’s most famous fish and that also happens to be a dessert. The cool creaminess of the ice cream pairs exceptionally well with the brininess of the fish, and the pickling technique employed for both the shallots and the herring adds an extra layer of whimsy. Indeed, whimsy is what this dish is all about. It’s one of the first recipes Gunnar served at Dill, and it illustrates not only the playful way that he approaches his food but also his desire to showcase Iceland’s most traditional ingredients in new and innovative ways. Getting over your reluctance to try something called herring ice cream promises to deliver a satisfying conversation piece that your guests will be talking about long after the ice cream has been eaten.</div>

<div class="method"><a id="page77"/>To make the pickled shallots, prepare an ice bath. Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the shallots, and blanch for 1 second. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to the ice bath, immersing them. Let stand until chilled, then drain and place in a small heatproof glass jar. Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the shallots, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 1 week before using. The shallots will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled herring, prepare an ice bath. Combine the salt and 3¾ cups (900 ml) of the water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. When the salt has dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and nest it in the ice bath until the liquid is chilled. Arrange the herring fillets in a container and pour the salted water on top, immersing them completely. Cover with a tightly fitting lid or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 24 hours.</div>
<div class="method">When the herring is ready, prepare an ice bath. In a saucepan, combine the remaining 1¼ cups (300 ml) of water with the vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, allspice, bay leaves, cloves, onion, carrot, and dill and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn down the heat to medium-high and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and nest it in the ice bath until the liquid is chilled.</div>
<div class="method">Drain the herring fillets and place in a glass jar. Pour in the chilled pickling liquid, immersing the herring. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 week before using. The herring will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</div>
<div class="method">To make the ice cream, drain the pickled herring, reserving the solids and liquid separately.</div>
<div class="method">Separate the herring from the vegetables and reserve both. Measure 1¾ ounces (50 g) of the pickled herring for the ice cream and reserve the remainder for serving. Measure 1 cup (240 ml) of the pickling liquid, pour it into a saucepan, add the milk and cream, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the sugar, glucose, trimoline, ice cream stabilizer, and gelatin and continue to simmer gently, stirring for about 1 minute, until all of the ingredients have dissolved and are fully incorporated. Do not allow to boil. Taste and season with additional pickling liquid if the flavor is too sweet.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page79"/>Transfer to a blender, add the 1¾ ounces (50 g) of pickled <a id="ind304a"/>herring, and process until smooth.</div>
<div class="method">Taste once again and season with pickling liquid as needed to create a tart and tangy flavor. Transfer to Pacojet beakers (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note15">see notes</a>) and freeze for 12 hours. Process according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a Pacojet.</div>
<div class="method">To make the butter, using a stand mixer or handheld mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip the butter on high speed until light and fluffy. Fold in the buttermilk and pickled vegetables until incorporated. Season with sea salt. Pour the butter into a shallow container and smooth the surface with an offset spatula. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, then punch out small disks using your smallest round cutter.</div>
<div class="method">To make the rye bread crumble, preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Tear the bread into pieces, put them in the blender or a food processor, and process until crumbs form. Transfer to a bowl, add the butter, and toss until evenly coated, then season with salt. Spread on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 4 to 6 minutes, until crisp.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon quenelles of the ice cream onto plates and add the pickled herring and pickled shallots alongside. Sprinkle with the rye bread crumble and dot with the butter disks and sour cream.</div>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">HERRING: SILVER OF THE SEA</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Herring is more than a fish to Iceland. It is affluence, wealth, prestige, and power—or at least it was during the boom years of the first half of the twentieth century, when thousands of people flocked to Iceland’s northern shores to stake their claim in a gold rush measured in gills and scales. Hundreds of ships unloaded their “silver of the sea” on the shore, where “herring girls” packed fish in brine or salt in wooden barrels, which were then shipped around the globe.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">No one imagined an end to the silver shoals of herring that seemed to continuously brighten the sea. But then, in 1969, the nets came up empty and the rush was over. Overfishing shuttered the doors of the herring factories, a disaster that initiated the strict regulations the country’s fishing industry follows today. Those laws ensure that there will never be another herring boom and that there will always be herring off the shores of Iceland.</p>
