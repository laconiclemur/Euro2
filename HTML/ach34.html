<p class="author1"><span class="txit">zuppa di pesce alla veneziana</span></p>
<p class="noindent">“The uglier the fish, the better the soup.” That’s the Italian rule of thumb. The fish that live closer to the rocks are the tastiest and also the ugliest. And the type of fish used determines how this recipe will proceed, so there isn’t really a set recipe to follow. The basic idea is to cook the firmest fish first, adding the more delicate fish and seafood later on to produce a soup with great flavor and texture.</p>
<p class="indentb">It also helps to purchase the smallest, sweetest clams available. Littlenecks are a good choice. Some specialty fish markets may be able to supply Manila clams, which are ideal. This simple soup goes well with grilled or toasted bread that has been rubbed with garlic. Venetian-Style Fish Soup may be prepared several hours in advance. Store it at room temperature and slowly reheat it before serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_67"/><span class="red">1.</span> Heat the olive oil and garlic in a large flameproof casserole set over medium-high heat. When the oil is warm, add the parsley and jalapeño. When the garlic begins to brown lightly, add the lobster and clams. Stir and begin to warm the clams, about 2 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook, allowing the lobster to absorb the flavor, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes. When they begin to simmer, add the fish. Cover and simmer until the fish is no longer translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Add the mussels, shrimp, and scallops along with the oregano, marjoram, and basil. Gently push this new layer of seafood down into the broth. Cook until the mussel shells have opened and the shrimp are pink, about 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, discard any clams and mussels that haven’t opened, and serve immediately.</p>
