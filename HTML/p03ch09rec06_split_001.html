<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This is a splendid example of the famous</span> mar y montaña <span class="italic">(sea and mountain) Catalan dishes that mix meat and seafood. I asked a Catalan I met at a dinner why they mixed them and was told, “The mountain is right by the sea and we use what we have.” My friend Pepa Aymami is famous for this dish. When I asked her for the recipe, she sent me a copy of the book she and her colleagues at the Fundació Institut Català de la Cuina had just published,</span> Corpus de la Cuina Catalana, <span class="italic">and marked the page with the recipe. Her version was the grand variation, with lobster instead of shrimp and with chocolate in the</span> picada<span class="italic">, the nutty paste that is stirred in at the end of many Catalan dishes to thicken the sauce and add another dimension of flavor. Putting chocolate in savory dishes was a novelty that came with the Spanish returnees from Mexico in the nineteenth century. Brandy and sherry give another sensational note.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Catalans grate rather than chop their tomatoes, and that gives the famous</span> sofregit <span class="italic">of fried onion, garlic, and tomato a finer texture. To grate tomatoes, cut them in half and grate on the fatter holes of a box grater until you get to the skin; discard the skin.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large chicken (about 4½ pounds), cut into 6 to 8 pieces</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">Flour for dredging</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">About 20 jumbo shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">2 medium onions, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 tomatoes, grated (see headnote above and page 129)</p>
<p class="qun">Pepper</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup Cognac or other brandy</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE</span> <span class="bolditalic">PICADA</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup blanched whole almonds</p>
<p class="qun">1½ teaspoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">5 to 6 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="qun">1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, grated</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ cup oloroso or amontillado sherry</p>
<p class="recsum">Season the chicken pieces with salt and turn them in flour to coat them all over, then shake off the excess flour. Brown lightly in the oil in a wide casserole over medium heat, turning occasionally. Remove the chicken.</p>
<p class="summary">Fry the shrimp very briefly in the same oil for 2 minutes, turning them once, until they turn pink; then remove them.</p>
<p class="summary">Fry the onions in the same oil over low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and just beginning to color. Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste, and cook over medium-high heat until all the liquid has evaporated and the sauce is reduced to a jammy consistency.</p>
<p class="summary">Heat the brandy in a small pan. Carefully ignite with a long match, and when the blue flames die down, pour it into the sauce. Add the chicken pieces and just enough water to almost cover them. Simmer, covered, over low heat for 20 to 30 minutes; remove the breasts after 15 minutes (check to see that they are done), and put them back when the legs and thighs are done.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, for the <span class="italic">picada,</span> fry the almonds briefly in the oil in a small skillet, stirring and turning them until lightly browned. The traditional way is to crush all the <span class="italic">picada</span> ingredients together in a mortar, but it is easier and perfectly fine to blend them in a food processor: Finely grind the fried almonds first, then add the garlic, parsley, and grated chocolate and blend to a paste. Add the sherry and blend well.</p>
<p class="summary">Stir the <span class="italic">picada</span> into the sauce and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and heat through.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary">Use the cooked meat from 1 lobster instead of shrimp.</p>
