<p class="nonindent0">Beef, from blue to lingeringly slow cooked over hours, it never fails to excite the taste buds. This versatile meat really comes in to its own with tapas being both alluring and so easy to cook well.</p>

<h2 class="section"><a id="page177"/>beef carpaccio with anchovy mayo &amp; crispy garlic</h2>
<h3 class="section"><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c07_r1.htm#page193">see variations</a></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This Italian classic has had a Spanish makeover with anchovy mayo and crisped garlic.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/3 lb. beef fillet, trimmed</p>
<p class="hanging">2 free-range egg yolks</p>
<p class="hanging">1 heaping tsp. Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">8 anchovy fillets in oil, mashed to a paste</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups vegetable oil</p>
<p class="hanging">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">5 large cloves garlic, sliced</p>
<p class="hanging02">good handful watercress or arugula leaves, dressed in lemon juice and olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wrap beef tightly in plastic wrap and place in freezer for 1/2 hour. To make the mayonnaise, put the egg yolks in a deep bowl and add the mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper, and anchovies. Mix well. With a whisk, mix in the vegetable oil, a drop at a time. Once you’ve added about a quarter of the oil, the mixture will begin to thicken. Add the rest of the vegetable oil in a thin stream, whisking all the time, until you have a thick smooth mayonnaise. Finish by squeezing in the lemon juice. Chill until you are ready to serve.</p>
<p class="extract">To make the crispy garlic, heat the olive oil in a heavy pan over high heat until the surface of the oil shimmers. Add the garlic and let sizzle for about 30 seconds, until just crisp and light golden brown. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Remove the beef from the freezer and, with a very sharp knife, slice as thin as you can. Lay slices neatly on plates and top with mayonnaise, crisp garlic, and the dressed watercress or arugula.</p>

<p class="nonindent">A rich red wine reduction dresses and glosses beef tenderloin while the blue cheese slowly oozes as it melts against the meat. Rioja is a quintessentially Spanish wine and a perfect partner for beef tenderloin.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 1/4 cups Rioja red wine</p>
<p class="hanging">2/3 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 lbs. beef tenderloin</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. light brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. dried red pepper flakes</p>
<p class="hanging02">5 1/2 oz. blue cheese, such as Stilton, crumbled, for serving</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a deep bowl, whisk 3 tablespoons red wine with 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, and salt and pepper until the mixture is emulsified. Cut beef into 16 equal-sized pieces, add to the marinade, and stir in. Cover and leave in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">In a heavy pan, make the sauce. Boil together the remaining wine, sugar, cinnamon stick, and red pepper flakes. Place over a moderate heat and simmer briskly, stirring until the wine is reduced to a thin syrup. Heat a griddle pan until very hot and almost smoking. Toss the meat to coat in the remaining oil, and cook until the outside is scored with deep chars and the inside is pink (medium-rare). Tumble the meat through the Rioja reduction and pile onto a serving plate with a good crumbling of the blue cheese.</p>

<p class="nonindent">It’s still the simplest of tapas that are the crowd-pleasers, and grilled beef skewers dipped into a classic béarnaise sauce could please a stadium.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 sprigs fresh tarragon</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. dry white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">3 1/2 tbsp. water</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="hanging">3 free-range egg yolks</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. sirloin steak, cut into 3/4–inch cubes</p>
<p class="hanging">4 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 1 hour</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the béarnaise, mix the shallot, tarragon, wine, white wine vinegar, and water in a saucepan. Boil until reduced by two-thirds. Pour through a sieve, reserving all the juice and discarding the tarragon and shallot. Allow to cool slightly. Then, melt the butter in a pan over a low heat, until liquid. Turn up the heat and let butter boil for 30 seconds, then pour the clear liquid into a measuring cup and discard the milky residue at the bottom of the pan. With a hand whisk, whisk the egg yolks and wine reduction together. Slowly, still whisking, add the butter in a thin, steady stream, until a medium-thick sauce has formed. Cover and set aside until the steak is cooked.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan or a barbecue grill until really hot and almost smoking. Thread the steak pieces equally among the wooden skewers. Drizzle with the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay the skewers on the griddle or grill and cook for 1 minute on each of the 4 sides. Serve the skewers piled up together on one big platter with a bowl of the béarnaise to dip into.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Sometimes it’s nice to look at tapas as simply a plate to share, so turning up at the table with a large carved beef rib and fries is a treat for guests. Polenta fries are the new craze on the block and the Spanish twist is added with melt-in-the-mouth piquillo peppers.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the polenta fries</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</p>
<p class="hanging">3/5 cup (5 1/2 oz.) instant polenta</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. finely grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. vegetable oil</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the steak and peppers</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. ribeye steak, at room temperature</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 clove garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging02">4 oz. canned piquillo peppers, drained</p>
<p class="nonindent">For the polenta, grease a 9 × 12–inch baking pan with the olive oil. Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan. Gradually add the polenta, whisking constantly until well mixed. Lower the heat and cook, stirring constantly. In 2 minutes the mixture should thicken and the polenta should be soft. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, butter, and salt and pepper. Pour the polenta evenly into the prepared baking pan and smooth the surface, patting gently with the back of a spoon. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">Turn cold polenta onto a clean cutting board. Cut into strips, 3/4 inch wide by 3 inches long. Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet. Toss the polenta strips in the flour until thoroughly coated. Add the polenta in batches to the oil and fry for 5 minutes or until golden brown on each side. Use a slotted spoon to transfer polenta fries to a plate lined with paper towels. Keep warm.</p>
<p class="nonindent">For the steak, set a griddle pan on high heat until the pan is very hot. Season beef with salt, rub with a little of the olive oil, and cook, turning after 2–3 minutes, until the outside is charred and the inside is medium-rare. Remove from heat and let rest while you cook the peppers. For the peppers, warm the remaining olive oil in a saucepan over low-medium heat, add garlic, and stir to infuse the flavor. Add peppers and stir until they bleed into the oil. Some will stay whole and some will mush up. Season with sea salt and pepper. Slice the meat thickly and serve on a board topped with the peppers and a pile of polenta fries.</p>

<h2 class="section"><a id="page184"/>flap steak with bone marrow</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Flap steak is a cut of steak taken from the side of the animal. It tends to be underused outside of France (where it’s known as bavette d’aloyau), which is a shame because it’s one of the most delicious beef cuts. Shallots and roasted bone marrow complement the meat, producing a modern tapas classic.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 pieces veal or beef marrow bones, each 2–3 inches long and split down the middle</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">8 small shallots, trimmed and peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. red wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups red wine</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 fresh bay leaf, bruised</p>
<p class="hanging">1 3/4 cups homemade beef stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. flap steak</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the marrow bones, marrow side up, in a roasting pan, and season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven for 20 minutes, until the marrow is loose and soft, without melting away. In a small saucepan, melt the butter, then brown the whole shallots until they are caramelized on all sides. Add the wine vinegar, red wine, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and stock, and simmer for 10 minutes. Once the sauce is syrupy, remove from the heat and discard the bay leaf. Keep warm.</p>
<p class="extract">Season the steak with salt and pepper, then rub with olive oil. Heat a griddle or barbecue grill until smoking, then cook the steak for 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Allow the steak to rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Slice the steak across the grain, place on a serving plate with the roasted marrow, and pour the sauce and any of the marrow oil on top.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The great thing about oxtail is that it makes a perfect tapas portion when serving only one or two bones. Served with a delicate parsnip puree, this will be one of the dishes that you might just want to serve as a full-sized portion.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the oxtail stew</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/4 lbs. oxtails, cut into 2–inch lengths and trimmed of excess fat</p>
<p class="hanging">8 shallots, peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">2 large cloves garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. tomato paste</p>
<p class="hanging">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/4 cups red wine</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/2 cups homemade beef stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. finely chopped fresh thyme</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the parsnip puree</p>
<p class="hanging">3 large parsnips, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="hanging02">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 275°F. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven. Over high heat, brown the oxtails on all sides, in batches if necessary. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Caramelize the shallots in the fat remaining in the pan, then add the garlic and tomato paste. Cook, stirring for a minute, then return the browned oxtails to the pan with the celery, carrot, wine, beef stock, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and place in the oven for 3 hours. The meat is cooked when it is falling off the bone and the sauce is thick and reduced. Cook the parsnips in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, then add to a blender with the butter, whipping cream, salt, and pepper, and blend until smooth. Serve on the bone or shred the meat off the bone. Serve the parsnip puree in a serving dish, topped with the stew.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Veal, sage, and anchovies are a marriage made in heaven, so imagine this … Breaded veal escalope pan-fried and dressed with crispy sage and anchovy sandwiches and doused in lemon. Scrumptious!</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 small veal escalopes</p>
<p class="hanging">1 large free-range egg</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. flour, seasoned with salt and pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cups fresh white bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. (1/2 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">12 canned anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="hanging">24 small fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 lemon, quartered</p>
<p class="nonindent">Make the escalopes thinner by placing them between pieces of plastic wrap and gently beating them with a rolling pin or meat mallet. Beat the egg in a shallow bowl. Put the flour and bread crumbs into separate bowls. Dip each escalope, first into the flour, then the beaten egg, and then into the bread crumbs. Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When really hot, add the escalopes to the skillet. Cook them for 3–4 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels and keep warm.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the anchovies to the same length as the sage leaves. Lay each anchovy on top of a sage leaf and crush gently with a fork, being careful not to tear leaves. Sandwich with another leaf, face down. Press together to seal. Fry for 1 minute on each side and drain on paper towels. Serve the escalopes with the anchovies and a good squeeze of lemon.</p>

<p class="nonindent">An Italian special is a good steak with a rich porcini cream, but cream sauces can get quite rich. That’s the great thing about eating tapas — the serving size means you can have a little bit of something decadent. It doesn’t get much more decadent than this.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 oz. dried porcini mushrooms</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. sirloin steak</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. (3/8 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">2 shallots, finely sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 clove garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup homemade chicken or beef stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tbsp. chopped fresh tarragon</p>
<p class="hanging02">2/3 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cover the porcini with hot (not boiling) water, and set aside for 20 minutes. Remove and chop the porcini and reserve the liquid. Season the steak well with salt and pepper on both sides and place onto a very hot griddle or barbecue grill for 2–3 minutes per side until charred on the outside and cooked medium-rare. Cover and set aside to rest.</p>
<p class="extract">Melt the butter in a small skillet and fry the shallots until soft. Add the garlic and continue to cook, stirring, for a few minutes. Add the mushrooms and fry for several minutes more. Add the mushroom soaking liquid, stock, and tarragon to the pan. Let simmer until reduced by two-thirds, then add the cream. Season and then allow the sauce to gently simmer for a few minutes before serving it over the sliced steak.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Another underused cut of meat is the hanger steak, which is very lean and tender. It becomes a good wintry tapas when paired with celeriac and red cabbage.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 lb. celeriac</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/4 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging">7 tbsp. (7/8 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. fennel seeds, lightly pounded in a mortar and pestle</p>
<p class="hanging">1 red onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. red cabbage, outer leaves and core removed, sliced thin</p>
<p class="hanging">3 1/2 tbsp. red wine vinegar</p>

<p class="nonindent">Peel the celeriac and cut into small chunks, then gently boil it in the milk with some salt until tender. Drain well, setting aside 3 tablespoons of the milk. Put celeriac in a blender. Add half the butter, some salt and pepper, and the reserved milk. Blend to a thick puree. Keep warm. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the remaining butter on high heat. Add the fennel seeds, followed by the red onion and cabbage. Pan-fry for 5 minutes, then add the vinegar and sugar and allow it to simmer until the liquid has evaporated. Add the water and let it cook slowly for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, rub the steak all over with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a griddle pan or barbecue grill to high heat. When the pan is hot, cook the steak for 2–3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Remove and set aside to rest, covered, for 10 minutes. To serve, carve the steak into 4 pieces. Spoon the celeriac puree and a spoonful of cabbage onto a plate, then top with the steak and its juices.</p>
