<p class="noindentb">My mother grew up with a large garden that came right up to the edge of the house. “My parents cultivated a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables,” she remembers. “Everyone helped in the garden, turning the soil and planting in the spring, harvesting and canning in the fall. In fact I have pictures of Stanley as a baby helping Pop in the garden.” Among the vegetables my grandfather grew were wide, flat Italian pole beans. He would pick a basket of beans, a few tomatoes, and a small zucchini. My grandmother would cook them all together to create a light dish for lunch or dinner, followed by chicken or meat.</p>
