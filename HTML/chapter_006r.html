<h2 class="h2b">FOUGASSE FARCI</h2>
<p class="normala">After the first proving, knock the dough back and then cut into three pieces. Roll each out into slightly oblong circles of about 20cm (8in) in diameter. Put the artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes and anchovies along one side, leaving 4cm (1½in) free at the edge. Fold the dough over and seal the edges well. Turn the three pieces of stuffed dough so that the joint is at the bottom, and press down to make sure that they are sealed well. Pinch the ends. Slice three lines through the dough to the point that you can see the ingredients in the middle. Brush with the olive oil. Put a clove of garlic in each hole, then sprinkle with the grated cheese and salt flakes. Bake without the second proving in an oven heated as before for 15–20 minutes until golden brown.</p>
