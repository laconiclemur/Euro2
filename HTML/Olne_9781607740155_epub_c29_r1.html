  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2">THE PROVENÇAL FISH STEW</h2>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page398"></a><em>Bouillabaisse</em> is, to tell the truth, more a philosophy than a culinary preparation. More gastronomic literature—and quarrels—have centered around it than any other dish (with <em>cassoulet</em> running a close second). If most of the recipes for it were to be followed, however, the result could only be the most banal of fish soups (I am thinking of those in French—some that I have seen in American and English cookbooks would make the hair of the most indifferent Marseillais stand on end).</p>

  <p class="indent">It is not a delicate dish; to be good, it must be highly seasoned, and it is terrifyingly soporific, but it embodies and engenders the warmth, the excitement, and the imagination which, perhaps, of all the Mediterranean peoples, the Provençaux exude in the highest degree. At best, it belongs to the realm of divine things.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is a perpetual quarrel as to whether <em>soupe de poissons</em> (literally, soup of fish) or <em>bouillabaisse</em> (which is a <em>soupe</em> aux <em>poissons</em>, or soup <em>with fish</em>) is the finest dish. This is essentially debated among professional eaters and writers on food who are not experts on the technical side of things, for any professional chef knows (though rarely tells) that a really good <em>soupe aux poissons</em> is moistened, not with water, but with a fish stock, which is nothing more nor less than a <em>soupe de poissons</em>. Another detail little discussed by its practitioners is the addition of a bit of pastis, an anise-flavored apéritif alcohol similar to absin the. It serves admirably to reinforce the perfume of the fennel in the dish.</p>

  <p class="indent">A number of circumstantial factors are, no doubt, essential for this fish soup to be translated into a memorable experience. It should be the main dish—and plentiful; it should be shared with friends in a relaxed and informal atmosphere; it marries well with the sea air (in any case, the proximity of the ocean tends to ensure the freshness of the fish); the wine should be kept generously flowing throughout the meal. I, personally, have many sublime memories of entire days devoted to shopping (early in the morning to the fish market to find the freshest fish of the greatest possible variety), everyone preparing fish and vegetables together (accompanied by a few more pastis than <a id="page399"></a>wisdom would ordinarily dictate), followed by euphoric hours spent at table.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following is a list of fish used traditionally in <em>bouillabaisse</em>, with English translation where possible (although some may be unobtainable in English-speaking countries), and possible substitutes:</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Rascasse</em>: The one fish considered absolutely indispensable. Its appearance is vicious; alone, its flesh is mediocre in quality. The ocean <em>rascasse</em>, though retaining the same form as the Mediterranean fish, is without interest. No translation. Substitute red snapper.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Vive</em>: Weaver. I have never seen this fish in American markets, but it or a near cousin likely exists in American waters. It is a sand-burrowing shore fish. Substitute whiting.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Girelle</em>: I find no translation for this gloriously colored fish, and a substitution is difficult. Although wall-eyed pike is a freshwater fish, one might try it.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>St.-Pierre</em>: John Dory. A ferocious-looking fish of very delicate flesh which exists in English waters, but, to the best of my knowledge, not in American. Substitute grey sole or lemon sole.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Congre</em>: Conger eel.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Baudroie</em> or <em>Lotte</em>: Angler-fish. Substitute sea bass, fresh haddock or fresh cod.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Rouget</em>: Red mullet. The Mediterranean rock mullet (<em>rouget des roches</em>) is far finer than any other—it even seems a pity to lose its delicacy in a <em>bouillabaisse</em>. Substitute other mullets.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Favouilles</em>: Small crabs. Substitute soft-shelled crabs.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are others with no translations, and no easy substitutions, some of which the fishermen themselves are not always able to name. The Caribbean is undoubtedly rich in species with which I am unfamiliar that would lend themselves well to this preparation. Mussels are often added and one often finds <em>langouste</em> (rock lobsters) added for elegance’s sake, but neither the lobster nor the soup gains in this marriage.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following recipe is entitled noncommittally <em>Soupe aux Poissons</em>, out of respect for those purist defenders of the true <em>bouillabaisse</em>, which is prepared with fish to be found only on the rocky Mediterranean shores, moistened only with water, and accompanied by <em>la</em> <em>rouille</em>, a highly flavored <em>pommade</em> made by pounding together Cayenne pepper <a id="page400"></a>and raw garlic, and adding olive oil (some mount it, like a mayonnaise, with egg yolks). Generally speaking, the qualities essential to the success of the dish given here are a variety of absolutely fresh fish (at least 5 or 6 different kinds, some of firm gelatinous flesh, others of tender white flesh—avoid, above all, any strongly flavored oily fish such as sardines or mackerel), a very good quality fruity olive oil, and a rapid boil (the word <em>bouillabaisse</em> means “boil at top speed”). This rapid boiling, by forming a light emulsion of the oil in the cooking liquid, thickens the soup. If some of the suggested fish are unavailable, substitute others and don’t worry about it.</p>

  <p class="center3">Soupe aux Poissons</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 pounds mixed whole fish of medium size—5–10 ounces (small red snappers, grey sole, lemon sole, mullet, whiting, wall-eyed pike, etc.)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound sea bass, fresh cod, halibut, etc., cut into thick slices</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound conger eel, cut into slices approximately 1½ inches thick</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound soft-shelled crabs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>herbs: branches of wild fennel</em> (<em>or lacking these, fennel seed</em>)<em>, bay leaf, thyme, savory, oregano</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>approximately ½ teaspoon powdered saffron and a good pinch of whole saffron (more or less, according to taste)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small glass of pastis, Pernod ’51 or Ricard</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound leeks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4–5 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>approximately</em> 3 <em>quarts water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound fish carcasses (ask your fish merchant for carcasses from fish that have been filleted—these replace, albeit imperfectly, the little “soup fish” used on the Mediterranean coast)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>dried orange peel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em> (<em>preferably coarse sea salt—or, if near the ocean, sea water diluted to the right saltiness</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ pounds firm, well-ripened tomatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page401"></a><em>freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 20 slices of French bread, dried out, either in the sun or in a very slow oven, but not toasted</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>garlic</em> (<em>6–7 cloves) with which to rub the bread</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut off the fins, remove the gills and scale and clean the fish that are whole, if this has not been done for you. The heads may be removed or not—the presentation is more attractive if the heads remain, but the fish stock is thus impoverished. Trim the slices of larger fish to make them more presentable and put aside the trimmings with the heads and carcasses. Sponge all the fish and seafood, dry with paper towels, spread them out on a large platter and sprinkle them thoroughly with some of the olive oil, then with the herbs, about ⅓ teaspoon of powdered saffron, and finally with half the pastis. Gently rub the fish in your hands, inside and out, until they are all equally yellowed by the saffron, then leave to marinate, turning them around from time to time, while preparing the fish stock and vegetables.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE FISH STOCK</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut off the tough, dark-green parts of the leeks and discard them. Slit the remaining parts halfway down to facilitate washing them and, when they are well washed, cut each in 2 in order to separate the greenish parts from the white of the leek. Put the white parts aside and coarsely chop the green parts. Peel the onions, put 2 aside and coarsely chop the third. Crush the 4–5 cloves of garlic.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat the water and add the heads, carcasses and trimmings of the fish, chopped leek greens, chopped onion, crushed garlic, a branch of fennel (or seeds), dried orange peel, thyme, bay leaf, and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, over a medium flame, for approximately ½ hour. After 15 to 20 minutes, crush all the solid material with a wooden pestle. Pour the contents of the pot into a fine sieve and press the debris well with a pestle or wooden spoon in order to extract all the flavor possible.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE FINAL STEPS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Dip the tomatoes in boiling water for a moment to loosen their skins, peel them, cut them in 2 horizontally and squeeze them to rid them of seeds and excess liquid. Chop the white parts of the leeks and the remaining onions finely.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page402"></a>Pour the remaining oil (there should be approximately ⅔ cup) into a very large saucepan (the fishermen in the south of France use a large galvanized tin basin, the same form as a dishpan—if you have no suitable saucepan, an enameled dishpan will serve). Put the chopped leeks and onions to cook gently in the oil, stirring them regularly with a wooden spoon, and, 10 minutes later, add the chopped tomatoes, a pinch of powdered saffron, a pinch of whole saffron (the powdered, assuming it to be pure good-quality saffron, lends more flavor, and the whole saffron lends a decorative aspect), and a piece of dried orange peel. Continue to cook for another 5 minutes or so, salt lightly (bearing in mind that the fish stock has already been salted to taste) and add a generous amount of freshly ground pepper. Place the pan over the highest possible flame and add the fish stock and the remaining pastis. From this moment count 15 minutes’ cooking time. The liquid should be kept at a rapid boil and the pan uncovered. The fish should be added at 3 different intervals; those of firm and somewhat gelatinous flesh should be added first along with any crustaceans; 5 or 6 minutes later, the larger specimens of the more tender-fleshed varieties; and 5 minutes after that, the smallest of the soft-fleshed fish. This timing is inevitably somewhat arbitrary, everything depending on the variety, the size, and the kind of fish used. Sometimes only 2 intervals rather than 3 are needed, and it may be that 10 or 12 minutes’ cooking time is sufficient.</p>

  <p class="indent">During the time that the fish is cooking, rub the dried-out bread slices with the 6–7 cloves of garlic. Count 1 medium-sized clove for 3 slices of bread.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lift out the fish carefully with a large wire skimming spoon and arrange them on a heated serving platter. Moisten them with 2 or 3 ladlefuls of broth and pour the remainder into a soup tureen. Send the fish and the soup to the table at the same time, accompanied by the garlic-flavored crusts, and serve, first, a ladleful of soup poured over a garlic crust, and after, the fish, moistened with an additional ladleful of soup for each guest.</p>

  <p class="extract1"><span class="small">NOTE</span>: Should there be leftovers, the whole thing may be thrown together, boiled up, strained, and served, with a handful of boiled pasta thrown in, as a fish soup, or it may be transformed into a <em>bouil<a id="page403"></a>labaisse</em> <em>en gelée</em>, a light and attractive luncheon first course. The fish themselves do not give sufficient gelatin, so a certain amount of commercial gelatin must be added, and, as all cold dishes need to be more sharply seasoned, its flavoring should be heightened by a bit more salt and a pinch of Cayenne.</p>

  <p class="indent">Choose a simple mold or use a small mixing bowl. Remove the fillets from the larger fish, bone the sliced fish, and put the debris aside with the crabs or other crustaceans. Line the mold with the more presentable pieces and fill up the center with the remaining cold fish. Carefully skim all the grease from the surface of the cold soup, heat the soup and add some dissolved gelatin (using a bit less than instructions indicate for a given quantity, bearing in mind that the preparation already contains a certain amount of natural gelatin, and that a jellied dish should be only firm enough to hold its shape, once unmolded), a bit of salt and a pinch of Cayenne pepper. Pass the liquid through a fine sieve without pressure. Pound the crabs and/or other crustaceans in a mortar until reduced to a near purée, remove to a saucepan, add the other fish debris and that from the sieve, moisten with about ⅓ cup of the broth and bring to a boil. Reinforce this mixture also with a light addition of dissolved gelatin and pass it first through a <em>moulinette</em>, then through a fine drum sieve with the help of a plastic disk (<em>corne</em>). When the broth has cooled, add it slowly, using a ladle, so as not to displace the fish, to the mold. Put to jell in the refrigerator, and when it is firm enough not to absorb the other liquid on contact, pour the crab purée over the entire surface. Leave overnight to set thoroughly. Before unmolding, pass the blade of a knife around the edge and dip the mold rapidly into hot water. Decorate the plate with a <em>chiffonade</em> of lettuce, bouquets of chervil, nasturtium flowers, etc.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c29-s113">THE CERVELLE DE CANUT</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A specialty of Lyons, <em>cervelle de canut</em> is basically a fresh white cheese made of cows’ milk (homemade cottage or pot cheese—that is to say, freshly curdled milk, put to drain in a cheesecloth), beaten with a whisk, seasoned with salt, pepper, finely chopped <em>fines herbes</em>, and <a id="page404"></a>enriched by the addition of a certain amount of heavy cream. The essential herb is chives. Parsley, chervil and tarragon may be used, but chives should dominate. Some people add garlic and white wine. To my palate, it is in no way improved by these sophistications, and in any case they would not be indicated after a <em>bouillabaisse</em>. Although different in spirit and intention, a <em>cervelle de canut</em> is similar to a number of American cocktail dips.</p>

  <p class="indent">A <em>canut</em> is—or was—a worker in a silkworm factory at the time that silk was one of Lyons’ important industries. Eaten by poor people with nonetheless a solid gastronomic tradition, this dish might be translated “Poor Man’s Brains.”</p>
