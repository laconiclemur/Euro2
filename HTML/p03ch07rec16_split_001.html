<p class="summary"><span class="italic">I have eaten several versions of these eggplant fritters, which are a specialty of Córdoba, and have loved them all. The combination of savory and sweet is sensational. In the town of Priego de Córdoba, which is in the mountains on the Ruta del Califato (the tourist route of old Muslim Spain), where there is an old Moorish quarter, the eggplant slices I ate were very thin and crisp and served with a dribble of honey. I learned from the chef at the restaurant Rio a new way to prevent the eggplant from absorbing too much oil, which is to soak the slices in milk, then drain them and cover them in flour.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">These are best eaten as soon as they are done, but they are also very good reheated in the oven.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 5</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 eggplants (about 1¼ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">About 2 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">Flour for dusting or dredging</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">Olive or sunflower oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="qun1">Orange blossom honey or other aromatic runny honey</p>
<p class="recsum">Peel the eggplants and cut them into slices about ⅓ inch thick. Put them in a bowl, add enough milk to cover, and put a small plate on top to hold them down. Let soak for 1 to 2 hours; drain.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cover a plate with plenty of flour mixed with a sprinkling of salt. Working in batches, turn the eggplant slices in this so that they are entirely covered with flour, then shake them to remove the excess. Deep-fry in sizzling but not too hot oil, turning the slices over as soon as the first side is brown. Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve hot with a dribble of honey, and let people help themselves to more honey if they like.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">In Córdoba, I had the eggplant slices dipped in batter. The coating was crisp, the eggplant was moist, and they were served with grape juice molasses.</p>
