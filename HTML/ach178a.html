<h3 class="h3b">peaches and wine</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pesche al vino</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My mother likes to serve this simple and wonderful summer dessert in glass goblets with biscotti on the side. “Whenever I serve this dessert it reminds me of Compare Pullano, a neighbor and good friend of my father’s,” recalls Joan. “They had an ongoing competition over who could raise the best chickens or make the finest wine. They also loved to show off to each other with examples of their successful gardening, although neither of them would ever admit the success of the other.</p>
<p class="indentb">“One afternoon Compare arrived with a beautiful peach from his garden. Although the peach was bigger than any my father had grown, he was only willing to admit that it was okay. They decided to have a glass of wine and share this peach. My father cut it into several slices and they soaked the slices in their wine for several minutes before eating them. It is an exceptional dessert.”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 medium-size ripe peaches, peeled and pitted</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups dry red wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Slice the peaches into bite-size wedges (you should have about 4 cups). Place in a large bowl and cover with the wine. Sprinkle the sugar on top and gently stir. Cover and leave at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours before serving.</p>
