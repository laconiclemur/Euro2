<p class="summary">It is not the custom in Spain to serve a cheese platter after dinner, but some top restaurants have now started to offer tastings of artisanal cheeses at the end of the meal. Cheese is eaten as a <span class="italic">tapa</span> or an <span class="italic">aperitivo</span> with wine, beer, or cider. It is sometimes accompanied by the quince paste called <span class="italic">membrillo</span> or <span class="italic">codoñate</span>, and it is also served with grapes.</p>
<p class="summary">Enric Canut, the author of <span class="italic">Los 100 Quesos Españoles</span> (<span class="italic">The 100 Cheeses of Spain</span>), who, with others, rescued, helped to rejuvenate, and continues to champion traditional artisanal cheeses, gave our little group of British journalists in Barcelona a tasting of cheeses and a fascinating talk. The huge variety of cheeses in Spain is due to centuries-old customs and lifestyles—shepherds made cheese when they moved with their sheep and when they spent a lot of time alone with their goats in the mountains—and to the great diversity of <span class="italic">comarcas</span> (<span class="italic">terroirs</span>).</p>

<p class="summary">Sheep’s- and goat’s-milk cheeses are still the most common. The harsh climate of the vast semi-arid plains of the interior suits the foraging habits of sheep, while goats are happy even in rocky mountainous areas. Cow’s-milk cheeses are produced only in the wet northern areas, which have green pastures, and in Minorca, where Friesian cows were brought over from England during a period of English occupation. What is peculiar to Spain is the blending of two and sometimes three types of milk in a single cheese.</p>
<p class="summary">In 1960, when Spain’s economy was suffering under Franco’s government, a decree was issued requiring cheese producers to process a minimum of 10,000 liters of milk per day. Cheese counters soon filled with industrially processed cheeses, and most of the artisanal ones became illegal. After 1984, when the decree was repealed, artisan cheese makers could sell their craft again. It is only in the last twenty years that many great artisan cheeses have become available outside their regions, and some have earned a <span class="italic">Denominación de Origen</span> (DO) label. A few are becoming known abroad. You will find more about these in the chapters on the individual regions.</p>
<p class="summary">The lovely Spanish custom of eating cheese with honey is worth adopting. In the past, honey vendors on mules would go from village to village with barrels of cheese, honey, and <span class="italic">arrope</span>, a sweet syrup made from boiled-down grape juice. They were called <span class="italic">mieleros</span> (<span class="italic">miel</span> means “honey”) and wore special clothes. Now they travel around in vans, but they still wear the same type of clothes. <span class="italic">Mel y mató</span> is a popular Catalan dessert of <span class="italic">mató</span>, a fresh unsalted cheese made from cow’s or goat’s milk (you can substitute fresh ricotta, although it won’t be as good) with a dribble of honey (<span class="italic">mel</span> in Catalan). In other parts of Spain, a traditional shepherd’s snack of fried or grilled cheese—a medium-young Manchego, a sheep’s-milk cheese, or a goat’s-milk cheese will do—with scented honey has become popular (see page 161). An old custom is to put cubes of Manchego in a jar with extra virgin olive oil and dried herbs such as thyme, marjoram, or rosemary and let it marinate for a month.</p>
