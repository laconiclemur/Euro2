<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_166"/><b>Celery Root</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Apple Rémoulade</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Crystallized Celery Root Leaves</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>What better to have as part of a fresh tray of crudités than a celery root rémoulade—well, perhaps, a rémoulade with freshly cut, crunchy green apple to bring some essential acidity to cut through the richness of the mayonnaise. You’ll see what I mean when you try it, because the apple really raises the dish to another level. I have also used the leaves of the celery root, which you might be able to get if you buy your celery root from a farmers’ market, but not usually from a supermarket. If you can’t get them, just use ordinary celery leaves. They are more tender and a touch less bitter, but will work fine, because they will be sprinkled with superfine sugar before being dried in the oven and becoming crystallized. It is a fun idea that’s worth doing if you happen to have some time to hand, and it really finishes the dish beautifully.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus making the mayonnaise and 20 minutes marinating</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 6 to 8 hours</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 head celery root or celery</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 egg white, lightly whisked</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small celery root, about 1 pound 2 ounces total weight, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 lemon, halved</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons Mayonnaise (see <a href="011_9781848991583_Recipe5.html#pageid_18">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon whipping cream, lightly whipped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 crisp green eating apple, such as Granny Smith, cored</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 150°F, with the fan switched off if that is a feature of your oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Pick all the leaves from the celery root. Leave to one side 24 to 28 very fine, pale, flat leaves from the middle, then roughly chop the remaining green, slightly firmer leaves. Put the fine leaves in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, then brush with a little egg white on one side. Sprinkle the sugar lightly over the top of the egg white and put the baking sheet in the oven 6 to 8 hours until the leaves are fully crystallized and dry. Remove them from the oven and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Quarter the celery root lengthwise, then rub all over with the cut lemon to stop it from turning brown. Grate the celery root into long strips (you can use a mandolin if you have one, just take care) and put them in a bowl with another squeeze of lemon juice. Add the chopped celery root leaves and lime zest, then add the mayonnaise, mustard and cream and fold together. Cover and leave to marinate in the refrigerator 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Just before the rémoulade finishes marinating, cut the apple into thin slices from top to bottom, discarding the end slices that are all skin, then stack the slices and cut through through them to form thin matchsticks.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> When ready to serve, fold the apple through the celery root mixture. Pile the rémoulade on a plate and carefully put 4 or 5 crystallized leaves on top. Serve immediately while the leaves are crisp.</p>
