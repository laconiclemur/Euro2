<p class="nonindent">Huge thanks:</p>
<p class="extract">To Peter – this book would have been impossible without your incredible enthusiasm and dedication. Thank you for accompanying me on the months of research, for taking wonderful photographs, for remaining the chilled chauffeur (most of the time) with the worst navigator yet, for walking the streets of Bristol with little Mrs Mimms so that I could get the writing done and just for always being there.</p>
<p class="extract">To all my family, especially Mum, for their great support and encouragement.</p>
<p class="extract">To everyone at Books for Cooks and Divertimenti, I haven’t forgotten you all, I just got waylaid in a sea of purées and prams.</p>
<p class="extract">To all my wonderful friends in Bristol for being such eager guinea pigs and to Gill, Genevieve and Clare for your patience and cooking skills.</p>
<p class="extract">To my Grandparents in Ibiza and the Nicolau family in Castellón, who ignited my insatiable passion for Spain.</p>
<p class="extract">To Spanish friends who made the research a delight: to Cheche, Gabriel and the rest of the Cirera family, to Mercè and Jaume and everyone at El Folló, to Marta and Ramón, to Yolanda and Juan, to Fernando and his niece Eva, to Rafael in the Alpujarras and Pilar in Miranda.</p>
<p class="extract">To all the wonderfully generous stall holders and shoppers in the Spanish markets who were so happy to share their recipes, tips and experiences with me. They created this book.</p>
<p class="extract">To the entire team at Anova Books: to Kate Oldfield for getting the wheels turning and to Anna Cheifetz for being so understanding about the time constraints of writing with a new baby around. To Emily Preece-Morrison for always being so calm and supportive and for miraculously tailoring my lengthy text to fit the pages and to Kathy Steer for her painstaking copy-editing.</p>
<p class="extract">To Vanessa Courtier for bringing the book to life with fabulous pictures and stunning design, to Janie Suthering for getting up at 5 am and making the food look so delicious and to Wei Tang for her beautifully natural styling.</p>
