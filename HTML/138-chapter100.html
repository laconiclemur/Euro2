<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Pocketed with fishing villages, riddled with inlets, and blessed with protective coves for its colorful fleets, Spain’s northern Atlantic coast is a source of much of the country’s shellfish, from lobsters to prehistoric-looking <em>centollas</em> (spider crabs), from the spectacular razor clam dug in the sand to the humble mussel cultivated on floating wooden rafts called <em>bateas</em>. This preparation elevates the inexpensive mussel beyond its modest status into one of those dishes that is nearly impossible to stop eating. The slow-cooked tomato sofrito gives the dish a sweetness, the sherry a lovely aroma, and the mussels more than a glint of the sea.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 POUNDS/910 G SMALL TO MEDIUM MUSSELS, CLEANED, SCRUBBED, AND DEBEARDED <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">(SEE PAGE 341)</a></li>
<li>4 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>4 RIPE MEDIUM TOMATOES, HALVED, SEEDED, AND GRATED <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">(SEE PAGE 339)</a></li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>SUGAR</li>
<li>1 GARLIC CLOVE, MINCED</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON MINCED FRESH FLAT-LEAF PARSLEY</li>
<li>¾ CUP/180 ML DRY SHERRY</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON PLAIN DRY BREADCRUMBS</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large pot, add the mussels and ½&gt; cup/120 ml water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat, cover the pot, and simmer, shaking the pot from time to time, until the mussels have opened, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid. Discard any mussels that did not open. Twist off the empty half of each mussel and discard.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and prepare a sofrito with the onion and tomatoes, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. Allow plenty of time for it to become particularly dark, pulpy, and sweet. Season with salt and a generous pinch of sugar during cooking and moisten from time to time with a touch of reserved liquid from cooking the mussels to keep the sofrito from drying out.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> When the sofrito is ready, stir in the garlic and parsley. Arrange the mussels facing upward in the pan, moving them gently around the sofrito with a wooden spoon. Drizzle over the sherry and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs. Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 15 minutes. Transfer the mussels to a serving platter and spoon the sofrito over top. Serve immediately.</p>
