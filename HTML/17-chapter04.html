<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The Basque name translates to “broth of leek” and this soup is about as humble and homey as it sounds. Sometimes you find the soup with a bit of salt cod added for flavor. Of course, befitting the soup’s humble nature, it doesn’t get an expensive cut of salt cod, but usually a piece from near the tail or head.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, PLUS MORE FOR DRIZZLING</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>6 CUPS/1.5 L MILD CHICKEN STOCK <a href="238-chapter174.html#page_336">(PAGE 336)</a> OR WATER</li>
<li>4 LEEKS, WHITE AND TENDER GREEN PARTS ONLY, CUT INTO 1-INCH-/2.5-CM-THICK ROUNDS</li>
<li>1 CARROT, CUT INTO THIN ROUNDS</li>
<li>2 MEDIUM WHITE POTATOES</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onion with a generous pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are soft and lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour in the stock, add the leeks and carrot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and gently boil for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Peel the potatoes. Working over the pan and adding them directly to the stew, break the potatoes into generous bite-size pieces by making a small cut with a paring knife, twisting the blade, and snapping off a piece. (You will hear the noise.) Continue to gently boil for 20 minutes, or until all of the vegetables are tender.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Generously drizzle more olive oil into the pot, stir, and ladle the soup into bowls to serve.</p>
