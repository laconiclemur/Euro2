<p class="author1"><span class="txit">cotolette di pollo</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My grandmother prepared this recipe using veal cutlets. Today I prefer to use chicken cutlets because they are so easy to purchase and are a healthier choice. I serve it accompanied by <a class="nounder" href="ach99.html#page_194">Milanese Risotto</a> or <a class="nounder" href="ach96.html#page_191">Rice with Zucchini</a>, sautéed broccoli rabe, or sautéed escarole. If you have any leftover chicken cutlets, they make a delicious sandwich on slices of country bread.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil, plus more as needed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, cut into 6 wedges</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Remove the white tendons from the chicken breasts and discard. Cut off the tender chicken pieces (the fillets) that are not part of the whole breasts and set them aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Pound each piece of chicken breast between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap until it is uniformly <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch thick. Pound the fillet pieces as well.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs and water. In another shallow bowl, toss the bread crumbs, cheese if desired, and salt to taste. Dip the individual chicken pieces into the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and then into the bread crumb mixture. Coat the chicken thoroughly with the bread crumbs. Place the coated pieces of chicken on a cookie sheet and set aside for at least 5 minutes to allow the bread crumbs to dry and adhere.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_279"/><span class="red">4.</span> In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add as many pieces of chicken as will fit comfortably in the pan. Cook, turning once, until the breasts are no longer pink in the center but still tender, about 6 minutes per side. (Reduce the heat if the bread crumbs begin to brown too quickly.) Remove to a platter lined with paper towels to drain. Add more oil to the pan as needed to cook the remaining chicken pieces. Serve immediately, garnished with the lemon wedges.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Medium white and light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Veal or chicken prepared this way may be used for a Parmesan casserole. This dish is, I believe, a purely American creation. Although the ingredients would suggest southern Italian origins, I’ve never seen it served in Italy. I’m especially confused by the Parmesan cheese called for in several of the recipes I’ve seen, since southern Italians mostly use pecorino Romano. This has become a classic dish that is easy to prepare in advance and then bake just before serving.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Arrange the cooked cutlets in a casserole, slightly overlapping. Spoon about 2 cups of <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a> over the cutlets. Sprinkle 1 cup grated mozzarella cheese and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup grated pecorino Romano on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 350° F to warm the cutlets through and melt the cheese, about 20 minutes. Serve with a salad and bread.</p>
