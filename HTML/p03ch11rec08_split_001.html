<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is a very special and unusual dish in that the rice is cooked in a glorious mix of creamy onion sauce with chicken stock and sherry and flavored with a touch of saffron. I have roasted the chicken and made a splendid stock with the carcass and juices, and the result was a sensational dish, but that takes too long for most people. A simpler and equally good method is to buy good chicken stock and to mix in the juices and melted fat from the roast, as described below.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 chicken (about 3½ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">3 large onions, halved and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup amontillado or oloroso sherry (I prefer amontillado)</p>
<p class="qun">3¾ to 4 cups chicken stock, or as needed</p>
<p class="qun">A good pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="qun1">2 red bell peppers, roasted (see page 128), peeled, seeded, and cut into 6 pieces each</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the chicken in a baking dish, season with salt, and rub with one tablespoon of the oil. Turn it breast side down, pour in ¾ cup water, and roast in a preheated 375°F oven for 45 minutes. Turn the chicken breast side up, add a little more water if the pan has dried out, and roast for 30 minutes longer, or until the chicken is brown and the juices that run out when you cut between the leg and the body of the bird with a pointed knife are clear.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, sauté the onions in the remaining 4 tablespoons oil in a wide casserole that you can bring to the table. Put the lid on and stir occasionally until the onions are very soft and beginning to color, then cook, uncovered, over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown. Add the garlic and stir until the garlic is lightly colored. All this can take as long as 45 minutes, because there are so many onions.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the sherry and cook for 1 minute more. Blend with an immersion blender or in a food processor, and return the onion sauce to the casserole.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Transfer the roasted chicken to a carving board. Bring the chicken stock to a boil and pour it into the baking dish, mixing it thoroughly with the chicken juices and melted fat, then pour this into the onion sauce. Add the saffron and some salt (the rice will need a good amount), taking into consideration the saltiness of the stock.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cut the chicken into serving pieces—cut each leg and each breast into 2 pieces—and keep them covered. Pick the small pieces of meat off the carcass and wings and add them to the stock.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bring the onion sauce and stock to a boil, pour in the rice, and stir well (do not stir again). Cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 10 minutes, then lower the heat and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Lay the chicken pieces and red peppers on top of the rice, cover with a lid or foil, and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the chicken is heated through; add a little more stock or water if the rice seems too dry before it is done.</p>
