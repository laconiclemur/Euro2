<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The favorite way of cooking fish and seafood on every Spanish coast is</span> a la parrilla <span class="italic">(on the grill over embers) or on a</span> plancha <span class="italic">(a large flat griddle). You can cook one type of fish or seafood alone, or have a selection for a great</span> parrillada <span class="italic">(mixed grill). Serve it simply sprinkled with salt, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and chopped parsley, or with one or more of the following dressings and sauces:</span> salmorreta <span class="italic">(page 138),</span> vinagreta <span class="italic">(page 135),</span> vinagreta de tomate <span class="italic">(page 137),</span> alioli <span class="italic">(page 141),</span> mayonesa <span class="italic">(page 140),</span> salsa de romesco <span class="italic">(page 143),</span> mojo de perejil <span class="italic">(page 139),</span> mojo verde de cilantro <span class="italic">(page 280), or</span> mojo picón <span class="italic">(page 280).</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Grilling is not a precise way of cooking; you have to use your intuition, and experience helps. Here are some suggestions:</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Fish steaks</span> (monkfish, tuna, swordfish, hake, turbot, cod, halibut, or haddock). Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place on a well-oiled grill about 2 inches from glowing embers, or on a medium-hot well-oiled flat griddle, and cook for 2 to 4 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness. The fish is cooked when the flesh begins to flake away from the bone when you cut into it with the point of a knife. <span class="italic">Note:</span> The best way to cook tuna is to marinate it in olive oil for 30 minutes, then just sear it on the outside over high heat and leave it rare or medium-rare inside.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Thick fish fillets or large whole fish—split open down the belly and the backbone removed</span> (sea bass, bream, hake, or turbot). Leave the skin on. Brush with extra virgin olive oil and season with salt. Cook on the skin side only, not too close to the fire if on a grill, or on a medium-hot well-oiled griddle. Do not turn over; the fish will cook through.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">For whole fish</span> (small or medium bream, red mullet, sardines, or flatfish such as sole). Have the fish scaled and cleaned, but keep the heads on. Brush with extra virgin olive oil and season with salt. Cook for 2 to 5 minutes or so on each side, depending on the size; cut into one fish with a pointed knife to see if it is done.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Mussels and clams (in their shells).</span> Clean, and test to make sure they are alive (see page 127 or page 304). Put them on a baking sheet over the fire or on a hot griddle. They will open within minutes and be done as soon as they do.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Jumbo shrimp (in their shells).</span> Sprinkle coarse sea salt on a moderately hot griddle and lay the shrimp on top. Turn them over as soon as the first side turns pink, in about 3 to 5 minutes, and serve as soon as they are pink on both sides.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Lobster.</span> A way of killing a lobster is to put it in the freezer for an hour to put it to sleep, then lay it on its back on a cutting board and chop its head off, then cut it lengthwise in half with a big serrated knife. Lay the lobster halves shell side down on a medium-hot grill, cover with foil, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the flesh is opaque in the thickest part. Provide nut crackers and lobster picks to remove morsels from the jointed claw sections. It’s best to avoid the green stuff, the tomalley (the lobster’s liver), as any contaminants such as mercury may be concentrated in it. The red bits are the roe in a female; they are a delicacy.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Small squid.</span> To clean the squid, see page 127. Cut the bodies open to make flat pieces. Using a sharp knife, score the inside with parallel lines ½ inch apart, without cutting right through, and crisscross these with other parallel lines. Turn the bodies in olive oil to coat and place them scored side down on a very hot grill or griddle. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then turn the pieces over. They will curl up immediately and be done. Alternatively, cut the bodies into slices and put on an oiled griddle, with the tentacles. Throw on some finely chopped garlic and chopped chile pepper.</p>
