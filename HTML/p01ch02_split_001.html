<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Years ago, when I visited El Molino, a restaurant and center of</span> gastronomic research outside Granada where they give courses on the history of Spanish food, I asked about the origins of the cooking. One of the teachers said, “Arab and Jewish,” and gave me roast pork, which is forbidden to Jews and Muslims, as an example. He explained, “When the Muslims and Jews converted to Christianity, they cooked pork in the way they cooked lamb, which was to rub it with cumin seeds.” Now you know why you may find cumin seeds on roast pork belly in Spain today. The Arab-Islamic presence had a huge impact on Spanish gastronomy, even in parts of the country where it was brief.</p>
<p class="para">In 711, an Arab army crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with their North African Berber foot soldiers and vanquished the Visigoths. Except for a pocket of resistance in the north, all of the Iberian Peninsula fell under the rule of the Umayyad caliph of the Islamic Empire, who was based in Damascus, and became known as Al-Andalus. In 756, the entire Umayyad clan was massacred by the Abbasids, who relocated the capital of the empire to Baghdad. One Umayyad prince who escaped the slaughter, Abd-al-Rahman I, managed to regain Al-Andalus and founded an autonomous Islamic emirate under a new Syrian Umayyad dynasty. In 929, Abd-al-Rahman III declared himself caliph of a state independent from Baghdad, the Caliphate of Córdoba. Under the caliphs of Córdoba, a glittering culture flourished in Spain in many fields, including philosophy, poetry, music, medicine, science and mathematics, architecture, agriculture, and gastronomy.</p>
<p class="para">The Muslims introduced irrigation techniques—a system of canals and the <span class="italic">noria,</span> a large waterwheel placed over a fast-flowing stream that carries a series of earthenware pots—and horticultural practices such as grafting. New crops were brought from all over the Islamic Empire, some indigenous to India and China. Among them were rice; a different species of wheat; sugarcane; vegetables such as artichokes, eggplants, spinach, and carrots; fruits such as bitter oranges, watermelons and other melons, dates, bananas, and quinces; new varieties of almonds; and saffron. The grapes of Jerez, which are used to make sherry, are said to have come from Shiraz in Persia. Lemons and pomegranates, which had disappeared after Roman times, were reintroduced. Market gardens and orchards sprang up around every city, and Moorish houses had private gardens and patios with a fountain and fruit trees.</p>
<p class="para">New varieties of sheep, including the merino, prized for its wool, were brought over from North Africa, as were new species of pigeons, and dovecotes were set up. Libraries were full of works on botany and agriculture. Agronomists taught in mosques and markets when to plant, when to graft, when to harvest, what fertilizer to use, and how to predict the weather. The greatest medieval treatise on agriculture was written by a Muslim, Abu Zakaria.</p>
<p class="para">Trade was heavy between Al-Andalus and the Islamic world and parts of India and the Far East. Muslim ships sailed across the Mediterranean, bringing back goods such as gems and silks as well as foodstuffs. Spices and aromatics were a mainstay of the trade. Muslim, Jewish, and Christian merchants grouped along ethnic lines, each group forming a kind of club, and Jewish traders controlled a major portion of the commerce, trading with Jewish communities around the Mediterranean. While Christians generally despised merchants, Jews and Muslims held them in high esteem.</p>
<p class="para">The refinement of pleasure and the search for the most delicious foods became the preoccupation of the Muslim elite. A Kurdish lute player, Abu I-Hasan “Ali Ibn Nafi,” known as Ziryab, who came from the court of Harun al Rashid in Baghdad and joined the Córdoban court, is credited with transforming the art of living in Al-Andalus. Apart from introducing new music, he taught people how to dress, how to wear makeup, how to cut their hair short, and how to dye their beards with henna. He also taught the refinements of cooking that emanated from Baghdad, as well as rules of etiquette, including table manners and table setting. He established an order for serving different courses, starting with cold appetizers, followed by meat and poultry, pastas, and rice dishes, and then soups, pies, puddings, and pastries. Before that, all the dishes had been put on the table at the same time.</p>
<p class="para">By the eleventh century, the caliphate had declined and broken up into separate small rival kingdoms and principalities called <span class="italic">taifas,</span> which fought among themselves. In 1086, when the Almoravids, a puritanical fundamentalist Islamic Berber sect from Morocco, were called in to help fight off the Christians, they took over and reunited Al-Andalus. Another puritanical Berber dynasty, the Almohads, from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, succeeded them, making the twelfth and thirteenth centuries a period of Berber influence and strict militant fundamentalist rule, which frowned upon good living.</p>
<p class="h">THE RECONQUISTA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Within a few generations of the Arab occupation, the Christians began to fight back from their northern enclaves, pushing their frontiers southward. In the more-than-seven-centuries-long crusade known as the Reconquista, they fought to reconquer their land. They fought in a haphazard kind of way, grouping in separate kingdoms. Sometimes they fought among themselves, sometimes together, sometimes with the help of Muslim kings, sometimes for Muslim kings. By the time Alfonso VI conquered Toledo in 1085, the Christians had recaptured the central plateau, and by the mid-thirteenth century, almost all of the peninsula except for the enclave of Granada had been repossessed.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p031.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">The marriage of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469 united the two most powerful kingdoms of Spain. In 1492, their armies entered Granada, and the Moorish king Boabdil handed over the keys of the city. The spot where he took his sad farewell, looking back at the city from which he had been banished forever, still bears the name Suspiro del Moro (sigh of the Moor).</p>
<p class="para">The Reconquista was a holy war, a crusade against the infidel. It was also a continuous process of colonization of the land. Conquered territories were resettled by Christians from the north, who brought their own tastes with them—in particular, the use of pork and pork fat, forbidden by Muslims and Jews, which came to symbolize the Reconquista. Several characteristics of the Muslim agricultural revolution were reversed. The land fell into the hands of nobles and the ecclesiastical authorities, who used most of it for the production of cereal grains and for grazing sheep. Some of the new crops brought by the Arabs disappeared, such as bananas, sugarcane, and cotton.</p>
<p class="h">CONVIVENCIA–LIVING TOGETHER</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The story of the Muslims in Spain and the cultural interaction between the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities was recently opened up by scholars. For hundreds of years, Spain was a land where the three groups coexisted. The rich variety, the sensual character and complexity of Spanish cooking today is in part the result of that long <span class="italic">convivencia,</span> or “cohabitation,” and the intermingling of the three cultures.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p032.png" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="para">While the Reconquista was mostly over by the middle of the thirteenth century, the fact that an area had been reconquered by the Christians did not mean that the entire culture or population changed, but, rather, simply that a transfer of power had taken place. As the Christians moved south, there were usually not enough settlers to repopulate and cultivate the land, and Christians were not familiar with the type of agriculture there, so Muslims were allowed to remain. In Valencia, the Muslim population continued to work in the rice fields and in various crafts. The rural villages of central and southern regions of the peninsula remained predominantly tenanted by Muslims, who were allowed to keep their faith, customs, and laws. They were called Mudéjars. In the cities, they were mainly employed as craftsmen and in the building trades.</p>
<p class="para">Throughout the centuries of Muslim occupation, there were ongoing wars and problems of coexistence, but there were also treaties and trade exchanges and long periods of peace. Christian knights served as mercenaries in Muslim armies and for <span class="italic">taifas,</span> and Christian troops were contracted out by their warlords to Al-Andalus in exchange for gold. There were constant migrations from the Muslim south to the Christian north of Christians who had kept their faith. These Christians, called Mozarabs, spoke Arabic, wore Moorish clothes, and cooked in the Moorish tradition. In parts under Muslim occupation, there was intermarriage (the caliphs’ wives and mothers were often Christian women from the north of Spain) and numerous conversions of Christians to Islam. Christians who converted to Islam were called Muwallads. By the eleventh century, the majority of Christians in Al-Andalus had converted to Islam while keeping their ancestral identity. Muwallads could become lords and masters like Muslims, especially if they were descended from the old Visigoth nobility. When territories were reconquered, many Muwallads reconverted, sometimes en masse, and were reabsorbed into Christian society. Muslim converts to Christianity were called Moriscos.</p>
<p class="para">During and after the Reconquista, there were many towns where Muslims lived among Christians and Jews. In reconquered towns under Christian rule, intermarriage (and sleeping together) was taboo, but the communities fraternized despite condemnation by the Church. They sometimes lived in the same neighborhoods, sometimes even in the same house. They did business together, they ate and drank together, sang and played games together, and invited each other to festivals and weddings. The style of cooking that had at first been rejected as part of the enemy Muslim culture by Christians was eventually assimilated by them. Its voluptuous character won over Castilian austerity.</p>
<p class="para">Toledo in the time of King Alfonso X of León and Castile, known as Alfonso the Wise, was famously a tolerant world of cultural diversity, where large Muslim and Jewish communities lived in their own quarters among Mozarab Christians, and Christians who arrived from the north and from other countries. While the Castilian language was adopted there, Arabic remained the lingua franca for centuries.</p>
<p class="para">Toledo is the center of Spain’s marzipan industry, and there is a marzipan museum, where the delicacy is described as a product and symbol of the old intercommunal harmony. There is controversy today among historians as to whether coexistence was ever happy or even fruitful. It was certainly fruitful in the arts and sciences, and for food it was a great enrichment.</p>
<p class="h">THE MORISCOS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The direct Muslim influence in the kitchen continued long after the fall of Granada and lasted into the seventeenth century through the Muslims who remained as Christians. King Boabdil had capitulated on terms that allowed the Muslims who remained in Spain to retain their faith, language, and property. But the terms were broken a few years later because of pressure from the clergy, and the Muslims were forced to convert or to leave. As converted Muslims, they suffered discrimination. They rebelled, and their revolts were brutally suppressed. In 1568, to prevent organized opposition, people of Muslim descent were forced to leave what had been the old kingdom of Granada and to disperse throughout Castile. Some fifty thousand, it is said, went in groups accompanied by soldiers to different parts of the country, where they were resettled in towns and mountain villages. They were originally artisans—weavers, dyers, masons, shoemakers—but became muleteers and street vendors. Dishes similar to those they would have sold as street food are now familiar in tapas bars all over Spain. Among these are <span class="italic">pinchos morunos</span> (small spicy kebabs), <span class="italic">fritura de pescado</span> (deep-fried fish and seafood), <span class="italic">empanadillas</span> (little pies), and chickpea and spinach stews. The <span class="italic">churros</span> (long fluted pieces of fried dough) sold for breakfast from stalls all over Spain are the same as fritters found in North Africa today. Vendors who until recently went around villages by mule selling cheese, butter, honey, and the like, now go with vans, but they still wear a distinctive folk costume that some believe to be a version of the old Moorish dress.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p034.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">Young Morisco girls worked in homes as domestic servants. They cooked for families, and their special dishes were appreciated. When wealthy and aristocratic Christian women remained unmarried, it was the custom for them to become nuns and to take their servants with them to the convent. Convents throughout Spain today specialize in Moorish-style pastries that are most likely a legacy of the Morisco maids. There were also prosperous Moriscos—silk merchants, skilled artisans, masons, physicians—still living in cities, whose families had integrated Christian society for generations. A report of 1588 from Seville described them as having great riches, dealing in food, and controlling the greater part of the bread trade.</p>
<p class="para">Priests were sent to teach Moriscos to be good Catholics, while inspectors for the Inquisition knocked at their doors to make sure that they were not speaking Arabic, singing Moorish songs, dancing in their traditional manner, wearing Moorish-style clothes, or cooking Moorish dishes. Inquisitors could enter their homes at any time to check that they were cooking with pork fat and pork products—perhaps that is the time when the Spanish custom of putting little bits of ham in every possible dish, including vegetable and fish dishes, took root, as converted Muslims and Jews, as well as Old Christians, were forced to show proof of their allegiance to Christianity by eating pork. Back in 1514, one Íñigo López de Mendoza, count of Tendilla, captain general of the kingdom of Granada, and viceroy of Andalusia, sent a letter to the Catholic monarch, attacking the attempts of the Inquisition to force the Moriscos to abandon their customs. He wrote, “What clothing did we used to wear . . . what sort of food did we eat, if not in the Morisco style? Did the kings cease to be Christians and saints because of this?”</p>
<p class="para">In Aragon and Valencia, the nobility depended on Morisco agricultural labor and so protected their peasants from the Inquisition, allowing them to observe their own religion in secret. Until the beginning of the seventeenth century, Moriscos represented about one-fifth of the population of Aragon, one-third in Valencia. The more Castile tried to force their cultural assimilation and integration, the more they held on to their identity. In 1609, all Moriscos were accused of conspiring against the Crown with the Ottoman Turks and with North African pirates, who were mostly Muslims who had left. Except for the few Moriscos certified by the clergy as true Christians, they were deported, and by the mid-seventeenth century, all descendants of Moors in the peninsula had officially been expelled from the country. Of course, some remained. You can sometimes tell that a person is of Moorish descent by their name, which denotes a trade such as stonemason or ironmonger and by the prefix “al.” Alcaide (which means “the chief” in Arabic) is a common name in Spain. I met an Alcaide in Andalusia who said that there had been a handwritten book of recipes in Arabic in her family that was burnt by a great-aunt. The Inquisition may have tried to eradicate the Moriscos’ cooking, but its impact is still striking today.</p>
<p class="h">A HISPANO-MOORISH CUISINE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A new and unique culinary culture developed in Al-Andalus that mirrored the multicultural cosmopolitan society of people from various parts of the Muslim world together with Christians and Jews. The inhabitants of Granada, Toledo, Córdoba, and Seville and the Arab elites who established themselves in the major cities, in the south of Al-Andalus, and in the valley of the river Ebro followed the fashions and manners of Baghdad, including the high style of cooking that derived from Persia. Settlers from Shiraz in Persia founded the city of Jerez. Their culinary ways, together with those of settlers from Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Yemen, and North Africa, formed the basis of medieval Andalusian cooking. Poorer migrants, Berbers from North Africa, who were made to settle in the harsh rural mountain regions and in the marsh areas of Valencia, used basic methods to cook mainly chickpeas, rice, pasta, and couscous.</p>
<p class="para">More than forty years ago I found a Spanish translation by Ambrosio Huici Miranda of a twelfth- or thirteenth-century Arabic culinary manuscript of Al-Andalus by an unknown writer at the British Library and tried some of the recipes. This same manual, entitled <span class="italic">Kitab al Tabikh fil Maghrib wal Andalus</span> (<span class="italic">Cookbook of the Maghreb and Al-Andalus</span>), translated into English and annotated by the American Charles Perry, has been published in <span class="italic">Medieval Arab Cookery</span>. Another work, Lucie Bolens’s <span class="italic">La Cuisine Andalouse, un Art de Vivre: XIe–XIIIe Siècle</span> (<span class="italic">Andalusian Cooking, an Art of Living: Eleventh to Thirteenth Century</span>), which includes the same work and other sources, also gives an idea of the Moorish dishes of the time. Many of the recipes in these books are similar to those in a Baghdad manuscript of the same period by a certain Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan Al-Baghdadi, translated and annotated by A. J. Arberry as <span class="italic">A Baghdad Cookery Book</span> (Islamic Culture, No. 13, 1939) and Charles Perry (Prospect Books, 2005), and another thirteenth-century manuscript from Damascus, <span class="italic">Wusla ila I-habib fi wasf al-Tayyibat Wa-al-tib</span> (<span class="italic">Book of the Bond with the Friend, or Description of Good Dishes and Perfumes</span>), which the French sociologist Maxime Rodinson analyzed, both of which are published in <span class="italic">Medieval Arab Cookery</span>. The old Andalusian recipes make use of a long list of spices, including saffron, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, cardamom, mustard, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, aniseed, and ginger; and of herbs such as parsley, coriander, and mint. Sweet dishes are scented with orange blossom water and rose water. The favorite meat was lamb, but beef, kid, poultry, and game were also used. The Arab nobility famously hunted game birds—woodcock, partridge, pheasant, quail, and pigeon. They did not eat pork, but they did drink wine, which is also forbidden by Islam. Some of the old Moorish dishes disappeared when the Muslims left. In the seventeenth century, eating couscous was seen as an un-Christian activity to be despised, for which a person might be obliged to do penance.</p>
<p class="para">Over the centuries, Arab cooking methods—the use of clay pots and skewers and the technique of preserving in vinegar or in sugar syrup—were adopted. Among the Moorish legacies are meats cooked with fruits, such as apples, pears, or quinces, and marriages of artichokes and fava beans and of eggplant and zucchini. Stuffed vegetables filled with ground meat or rice or a mixture of the two, grilled meats on skewers, and sauces thickened with ground almonds and hazelnuts are other legacies, as are garnishes of raisins and pine nuts. Meatballs, rice dishes, chickpea stews, rice pudding, fritters in syrup, almond pastries—all these and combinations of sweet and savory and of sweet and sour are legacies of that old mixed society of diverse cultures and identities.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p037.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">You can hear the Arab influence in hundreds of culinary terms, such as <span class="italic">alboronía</span> (an eggplant dish), <span class="italic">almíbar</span> (syrup), <span class="italic">alcachofa</span> (artichoke), <span class="italic">albóndigas</span> (meatballs), <span class="italic">arroz</span> (rice), <span class="italic">escabeche</span> (foods marinated in vinegar), <span class="italic">fideos</span> (like very short spaghettini), and <span class="italic">aletría</span> (short macaroni). The tradition of salting and drying tuna roe to make <span class="italic">bottarga</span> came with the Arabs, as did the technique of alembic distillation for making brandies. The Arabs used spirits for medicinal purposes (the words <span class="italic">alembic</span> and <span class="italic">alcohol</span> are derived from the Arabic). Spanish alchemists (another Arabic word) and monks improved the techniques and the equipment for making brandy, and these were eventually passed on to France. Today many innovative chefs are inspired by the ancient cookbooks to explore their medieval gastronomic roots, and you might find couscous and <span class="italic">briks</span> (fried savories wrapped in paper-thin pastry) in some of the best Spanish restaurants.</p>
<p class="para">Various versions of Spanish dishes are much loved in Arab countries today, particularly in North Africa, where the Muslims who had been expelled from Spain settled. In cities like Fez and Tétouan in Morocco, and in Tunisia, these dishes are described as Andalusian. A character in Cervantes’s <span class="italic">Don Quixote,</span> a Morisco called Ricote, tells Sancho Panza, his former neighbor, that his people, condemned by the expulsion to wandering through the world in search of a new home, never stopped crying for Spain. But their dishes gave them comfort and started a culinary revolution in their new homelands.</p>
