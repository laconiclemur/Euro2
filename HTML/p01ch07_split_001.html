<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">The Catholic Church had a big influence on cooking traditions in</span> Spain. For centuries it was one of the ruling forces, with the nobility and the military. Like the nobility, the Church financed private armies. It was immensely rich and powerful and, again like the nobility, was exempt from taxes levied by the Crown. While the material fortunes of the nobility deteriorated, the Church prospered, at least until the nineteenth century, when some of their lands were confiscated. Bishops, abbots, and cathedral chapters owned huge estates, given to them by the king, on land reclaimed from the Muslims. The clergy were at the top of the social hierarchy. They were divided into a rich and powerful aristocracy recruited from wealthy noble families and the multitude of minor clergy who served them. Families gained prestige if they had a priest or a nun as a relative.</p>
<p class="para">The clergy were known for their appreciation of good food and their gargantuan appetites. Monasteries were famous for culinary refinement. The peasants who worked their vast lands gave the monks much of their produce in lieu of rent and maintained their vegetable and herb gardens. In the south, when monasteries took over Moorish palaces, they turned the interior patios into herb gardens. Monasteries were known for making wine, brandy, and cheese, and for growing uncommon vegetables such as artichokes, spinach, and asparagus, as well as a wide variety of herbs. Benedictine monks famously made chocolate.</p>
<p class="para">The high clergy was very well educated and had French and Italian connections, and the food on their tables was more varied and refined than the mountains of meat on most aristocratic tables. The lower clergy cooked their meat and game with the brandy and wine they produced and the herbs they grew. King Charles V of Castile and Aragon, a renowned gourmand, chose to spend the years after his abdication in 1555 in the monastery of Yuste northwest of Madrid because, it was said, of the food. The Monasterio de Guadalupe in Extremadura, which provided daily meals for both monks and pilgrims, had a reputation for high gastronomy. The nineteenth-century chronicler Vicente Barrantes listed the New Year’s fare given there to King Philip and his entourage as six baby deer, three large deer, two wild boar, a hundred ducks, a hundred partridges, a hundred pigeons, two hundred rabbits, four dozen hams, mountains of the best candied lemon peel and assorted confectionery, baskets of fruit, and gallons of wine.</p>
<p class="para">The style of cooking had nothing to do with the locality, because the clergy came from different parts of the country and their orders moved them, together with their servants. Many of them had spent long periods with their orders in the New World and returned with new produce from there. Certain prestigious dishes and several cookbooks are associated with monasteries that became famous for their gastronomy. In the fourteenth century, the bishop of Tarragona’s cook wrote <span class="italic">El Libre del Coch de la Canonja de Tarragona</span> (<span class="italic">The Cookbook of the Diocese of Tarragona</span>). <span class="italic">El Libre de Ventre</span> (<span class="italic">The Book of the Belly</span>) was written at the Ripoll monastery. The Franciscan Catalan writer and theologian Francesc Eiximenis devoted a book to the art of drinking and cooking and to the rules of etiquette of the table. The most famous of these culinary manuscripts came from the monastery of Alcántara in Extremadura. It was discovered by the French general Jean-Andoche Junot when he sacked the monastery during the Peninsular War (1806–1814). He sent it to his wife, the future Duchess of Abrantès, who included some of the recipes in her memoirs. (Escoffier was later to comment that the manuscript was the only worthwhile French gain from the war.) One of the dishes, <span class="italic">faisán a la moda de Alcántara,</span> is pheasant stuffed with duck liver pâté and cooked in port wine with truffles (my version of this recipe is on page 386).</p>

<p class="para">Nuns came to convents from different parts of Spain. They were from both the aristocracy and the peasantry. There was a strict hierarchy: rich women and the nobility were superior, and the others were servants and laborers. Many convents were founded by noblewomen for unmarried women of their own class. If the daughter of a landowner fell in love with someone inappropriate, such as a laborer or a retainer, she was forced to become a nun. The convents received enough wealth in dowries and bequests that their nuns could live in comfort. Some convents had dairy farms and produced all kinds of foods. Nuns in poorer convents offered cakes and pastries to show their gratitude to patrons who made their frugal existence possible.</p>
<p class="para">The Church had a hold on the Spanish diet through the Office of the Inquisition, which was only formally abolished in 1834. The role of the Tribunal was to check on non-Catholic behavior, and that included eating meat on fast days. In La Rioja, at an eighteenth-century coach house converted into a hotel and restaurant I was shown a handwritten document, dated 1798, signed by two government representatives, a tax collector and a church inquisitor, who had come to inspect the inns in the village. They reported that everything was in order. People in the towns and in the countryside were obliged to abide by the rules of fasting and abstinence ordered by the Church during the seven weeks of <span class="italic">Cuaresma</span> (Lent), on every Friday, and, four times a year, at the beginning of the seasons, on Wednesday and Saturday as well. During these days dedicated to silence and prayer, meat was forbidden and only vegetarian and fish dishes were eaten. Traditional Lenten foods included salt cod and cured herring; legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils; and eggs and dairy products, as well as a variety of vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, turnips, leeks, spinach, peas, and fava beans. But pastries and chocolate were allowed—to compensate for the lack of meat.</p>

<p class="para">In <span class="italic">Spanish Society 1400–1600,</span> the social historian Teofilo Ruiz quotes from the fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Libro de Buen Amor</span> (<span class="italic">Book of Good Love</span>) by Juan Ruiz, which describes the struggle between Don Carnal (Lord Carnality) and Doña Cuaresma (Lady Lent). The former’s armies, composed of succulent hams, bacon, cheeses, game, and abundant wine, are routed by Doña Lent’s host of salted dried fish, beans, chickpeas, and other foods associated with vigils and fasting. Carnality was imprisoned and there began the metaphorical withdrawal from the world during the forty days preceding Easter Sunday.</p>
<p class="para">In the early twentieth century, several cookbooks dedicated to making Lenten and fast dishes agreeable were published. Each began with an ecclesiastical permission and an introduction for the faithful explaining the divine obligation to fast, and the idea that fasting combats passions. One such book is the Catalan <span class="italic">Ayunos y Abstinencias</span> (<span class="italic">Fasts and Abstinence,</span> 1914) by Ignacio Doménech and F. Martí. A large chapter on soups for institutions (quantities are huge) gives substantial ones with legumes and vegetables, occasionally with a little salt cod added. They are flavored with herbs such as bay leaf, thyme, oregano, and parsley and sometimes with spices such as saffron and nutmeg. They all use stock cubes—Maggi or Knorr (yes!). The authors included recipes from several regions, as well as some foreign ones. “<span class="italic">Cocottes de guindas à la Rothschild</span>” is a pear compote with syrup perfumed with vanilla and Curaçao and sprinkled with chopped pistachios. The book, obviously, was not aimed at the peasantry or the urban poor.</p>
