<h2 class="h2b" id="page108">GIGOT D’AGNEAU FARCI AUX HERBES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Herb-stuffed Leg of Lamb</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>Many people insist that a</em> gigot <em>should always be cooked on the bone, but the flavour added by the breadcrumbs and the soft poached garlic is wonderful. The leg is also very easy to carve, and the breadcrumbs soaked with the juices from the lamb are so moreish that you’ll find yourself scraping them up off your carving board</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>I serve this lamb with gratins of courgette or Swiss chard, potatoes and often a big bowl of ratatouille. You could more simply roast some onions alongside the lamb and serve a big salad on the side. Ask your butcher to tunnel-bone the leg for you, which means removing the pelvic and thigh bones without cutting through the flesh so that you have an unbroken pocket to stuff. Make sure he keeps and chops the bones for you, as these will serve both as a trivet and the base for your jus. I like to do the boning myself, both to keep my hand in and so I can show our guests at the school, but I almost have to fight with my butcher, Jacky, who is certain that there’s no way I could do it as well as him. Your butcher may react the same way and save you the trouble</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 8</span><br/>
1 small leg of lamb, about 2kg (4lb 8oz)<br/>
16 large garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
1 recipe Provençal Breadcrumbs (<em><a href="chapter_001i.html#page31">see here</a></em>)<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.</p>
<p class="normala">Blanch the garlic in three changes of water until it is soft and much of its harshness is removed. Mix it with the breadcrumbs, half the olive oil and season it well. Rub salt and pepper all over the inside of the boned lamb then push the garlic and herb breadcrumbs into it, packing it as tightly as possible. Mould the lamb with your hands back into a leg shape. Tie up the leg starting at the open end then looping the string around at about 3cm (1¼ in) intervals until you reach the thigh joint. Loop the string back going in-between each original loop until you reach the open end, and tie the two ends of string together.</p>
<p class="normala">Put all the chopped bones evenly over the base of a roasting tray just big enough to hold the lamb, then put the leg on top. Put a little salt in the palm of your hand and mix it to a paste with some water, rub this into the lamb as if you were giving it a massage and pour over the remaining olive oil.</p>
<p class="normala">Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes then turn the oven down to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4, and roast for a further 15 minutes. Pour 250ml (9fl oz) water into the bottom of the roasting tray and roast for 30 minutes more.</p>
<p class="normala">Once cooked allow to rest in a warm place loosely covered with foil for at least 20 minutes. Remove the string and transfer the lamb to a heated dish in the oven.</p>
<p class="normala">Pour another 300ml (10fl oz) of water into the roasting tray and, over a high heat, scrape all of the caramelised goodies off the bottom of the pan. Bring this to the boil, transfer the bones and liquid to a small saucepan and bring to the boil again. Simmer again for about 5 minutes, strain and season well.</p>
<p class="normala">Carve the leg by cutting the stuffed thigh away from the bone end then slice the thigh in half so that you have two flat surfaces. Serve a couple of slices of the stuffed and a slice from the bone on each plate with some of the jus.</p>
