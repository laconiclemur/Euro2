<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">In 1180, King Sancho VI of Navarre declared in a code of regulations on hunting that big game and animals of the woodland could only be hunted “by the king, grandees, nobles, and knights.” Today in Spain, big game hunting is a macho trophy sport. But venison and wild boar are much less of a gastronomic tradition than game birds. Only a few Spanish restaurants and hunting clubs are known for their venison and wild boar specialties. Deer are hunted in the high mountains of northern Spain—in the Cantabrian range and the Pyrenees. The meat is mostly sold to Germany and France or turned into pâtés and sausages. The meat from older deer needs to be slowly cooked, but that of young farm-raised animals can be roasted briefly. It is dark red meat with little fat. You must start this dish a day before, because the meat needs to marinate for 24 hours.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 cups red wine</p>
<p class="qun">7 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">10 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">One 1½-pound (young farmed) venison tenderloin</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CHESTNUT PUREE</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound fresh peeled (see page 130) or defrosted frozen or vacuum-packed chestnuts (about 4 cups)</p>
<p class="qun">About 1½ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE PEAR COMPOTE</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry red wine</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">4 unripe pears, such as Comice or Conference, peeled, quartered, and cored</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the wine, 5 tablespoons of the olive oil, onion, black peppercorns, and bay leaves in a glass or ceramic bowl or baking dish and mix well. Add the meat, curled if necessary to fit, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 24 hours, turning the meat once.</p>
<p class="summary">For the chestnut puree, put the chestnuts in a saucepan, add milk to cover and the cinnamon, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the chestnuts are soft. Pour out the milk; add the butter and salt to taste. Mash the chestnuts with a potato masher, or blend in a food processor. Reheat when ready to serve.</p>
<p class="summary">For the pear compote, put the wine and sugar in a wide saucepan, add the pears, and cook, covered, over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are tender; turn them once.</p>
<p class="summary">Lift out the meat, reserving ½ cup of the marinade, pat it dry with paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Bring the marinade to a boil in a small saucepan and reduce to about half. Heat the remaining oil over high heat in a large skillet. Add the meat and turn it around to sear it all over. Then put it in a baking dish, with the reserved marinade, and roast in a preheated 400°F oven for 20 minutes, or until it is done to your liking. It is best eaten rare or medium-rare, while still pink and juicy inside (the meat is too dry if well-done).</p>
<p class="summary">Serve the meat cut into slices, accompanied by the reheated chestnut puree and pears.</p>
