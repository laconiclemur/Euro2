  <p class="chap-para">Artichokes are very popular in Italy, especially in the south, where they grow in abundance. The season begins in spring and they are often eaten at Easter time. I love artichokes; they are light and digestible and can be cooked in so many different ways. In this slow-cooked stove-top dish they are filled with a tasty mixture of pancetta and vegetables.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 globe artichokes</p>

  <p class="ing1">juice of 1 lemon</p>

  <p class="ing1">1–2 small carrots, scrubbed and halved</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk with leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small onion, halved</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 potato, scrubbed</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the filling</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz pancetta, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 shallots, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small courgette (zucchini), finely diced</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ aubergine (eggplant), finely diced</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">15g/½oz/2 tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing2">a small bunch of basil leaves (optional)</p>

  <p class="para">First clean and prepare the artichokes: using a sharp knife, remove the bottom outer leaves and cut off the stalks. Trim the base so the bottom is flat and the artichoke can stand upright. With your fingers, gently open out the artichoke leaves until you can see the hairy choke. With a small teaspoon, remove and discard the choke, which is inedible. Place the artichokes in a bowl of water with the lemon juice in order to prevent discoloration while you prepare the filling.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the pancetta and fry until crisp, remove and set aside. Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sweat until softened, ensuring you don’t burn the garlic; remove and set aside. In the same pan, stir-fry the courgette and aubergine for 8–10 minutes, until soft but not mushy. Remove from the heat and combine with the pancetta, shallots, parsley, pine nuts, Parmesan and pepper.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the artichokes from the water and turn them upside down to drain. Open them up and fill the cavity with the pancetta mixture; tie with string to ensure the filling does not fall out and, if you like, tuck a few basil leaves into the top of each artichoke. Place in a pan large enough to hold all four artichokes snugly.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the carrots, celery, onion, potato and tomatoes. Sprinkle the artichokes with a little salt, drizzle with olive oil and fill the pan with water to come halfway up the artichokes. Put the pan on a medium–high heat and bring to the boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and simmer gently for 1¼ hours. Lift the artichokes out of the pan using a slotted spoon and serve one per person, with a little of the broth. And don’t forget to eat the potato and carrot!</p>
