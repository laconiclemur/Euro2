<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_206"/><a id="ach104"/>puree of white beans, rosemary, and garlic</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">purè di fagioli, rosmarino, e aglio</span></p>
<p class="noindent">These pureed beans are made especially flavorful by the addition of olive oil that has been infused with rosemary. To create a pungent oil, it must first be heated with the rosemary for at least twenty minutes. Simply warming the oil on top of a stove is not as effective as the method Gianni devised for this recipe: Place the oil and the rosemary in a jar that is then set in the pot along with the simmering beans. This is an efficient way of preparing the small amount of oil called for.</p>
<p class="indentb">You do not need to presoak the dried cannellini beans called for in this recipe. Canned beans may also be substituted for dried. They don’t need to be cooked, so you can begin the recipe at the point where they are processed in the olive oil. (Reserve 3 tablespoons of the canned bean liquid to use in place of the cooking water called for.) Serve this as a side dish with lamb or seafood, or spread it on top of bruschetta.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dried cannellini beans, picked over and rinsed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> medium-size onion</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Four 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves fresh garlic</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon ground cumin</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the beans in a large pot. Fill the pot with water to a level 2 inches above the beans. Add the onion and 1 teaspoon salt, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the beans are tender, about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Meanwhile, place the olive oil in a heat-resistant jar (such as a canning jar). Strip the rosemary leaves from the sprigs and add to the oil. When the beans have cooked for 1 hour and 10 minutes, place the jar in the pot of simmering beans and let it heat for <a id="page_207"/>the last 20 minutes of cooking time. This will infuse the oil with the flavor of the rosemary. (If using canned beans, place the jar in a pot of boiling water and simmer for 20 minutes.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Remove the oil-filled jar from the beans and set it aside. Discard the onion and drain the beans, reserving 3 tablespoons of the cooking water. Place the beans in a food processor or blender along with the reserved water, garlic, cumin, and lemon juice. Strain the olive oil, discarding the rosemary leaves, and add the oil to the beans. Process until all of the ingredients are blended and the beans are smooth. Stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Shrimp may be served with these beans to make a delicious appetizer. Shell and devein 8 jumbo shrimp. Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 clove garlic, chopped, in a small sauté pan set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the shrimp and cook until pink and cooked through, about 7 minutes. Distribute equal portions of the bean puree onto eight small plates. Top each plate with one of the cooked shrimp. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle some of this dressing over each plate and serve.</p>
