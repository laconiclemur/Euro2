<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">If there is a richer or more delicious way of braising chicken than in a pepitoria sauce from La Mancha, thickened with pounded almonds, hard-boiled egg yolks, and the region’s celebrated saffron, then I haven’t come across it. An ancient dish dating back centuries, it remains festive, even celebratory. While once prepared using a young hen (<em>gallina</em>), it is perfect—and more commonly prepared these days—with a plump, free-range chicken. I like to use whole legs, but you can prepare it with only drumsticks or only thighs if desired.</span></strong></p>

<li>1 CUP/240 ML DRY WHITE WINE</li>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Peel the eggs and remove and reserve the yolks. Roughly chop the whites and set aside.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, lightly dredge in flour, and cook until golden, turning as needed, about 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the onion, and the bay leaves. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the onion is soft and nearly translucent but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, prepare a picada with the almonds, garlic, bread, saffron, and 1 tablespoon water, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. Add the reserved egg yolks and 1 tablespoon water and mash into a moist paste.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> When the onion is ready, return the chicken to the pan along with the picada, turn to coat the chicken, and then pour in the wine. Let the alcohol burn off for 2 minutes, pour in the stock, and bring to a simmer. Cook uncovered over low heat for about 50 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender but not falling off the bone and the sauce thickened.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> To serve, divide the chicken among plates, cover with the sauce, and garnish with the chopped egg white.</p>
