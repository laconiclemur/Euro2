			<p class="rec-intro">This recipe does make a large terrine but it keeps for a week in the fridge and can be served hot or cold. The beautiful green colour comes from the natural chlorophyll in the green leaves – a trick I learned from my father and not known to many chefs nowadays.</p>

			<p class="body">Blitz the 500 grams of white fish in a blender with the egg whites to make a smooth purée. Pass this through a fine drum sieve into a bowl, making sure you scrape all the mixture off the base of the sieve. Place the bowl over ice and gently beat in enough cream to make it the consistency of mayonnaise. You may not need all the cream so add it in stages. Season well, then test the mousse for texture and taste. To do this, bring a small pan of seasoned water to simmering point and drop in a teaspoon of mousse. Cook for 3–4 minutes, then taste and add more cream or seasoning if necessary. </p>
			<p class="body">Butter a terrine measuring about a 31 x 12 x 10.5cm. Bring a pan of water to the boil and add enough large spinach leaves to line the terrine. Drain immediately and plunge the leaves into cold water, then use them to line the terrine, leaving no gaps and letting them hang over the edge of the dish. </p>
			<p class="body">Blitz the remaining spinach with the watercress and parsley and enough water to make a wet mulch. Press this through a fine strainer to extract all the liquid. Put this liquid in a pan on a medium heat, being careful not to let it boil or the chlorophyll will loose its vibrant colour. Skim the solid matter floating on the top and drain it on a muslin cloth – this is the chlorophyll.</p>
			<p class="body">Spoon half of the mousse into another bowl and add enough chlorophyll to colour it green. Beat out the sole or plaice fillets to flatten them slightly and lay them in a row on cling film. Season, then spread some of the white mousse over them. Lay a thick strip (2–3cm) of salmon over the mousse and roll it all up. Add a layer of white mousse to the terrine, then add the white fish and salmon roll. Finish with alternating layers of green and white mousse and fold the spinach over the top. Cover with buttered foil. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 160°C/Fan 140°C/Gas 3. Put the terrine in a roasting tin, pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides, then bake for 1½ hours. Remove and leave to cool completely before slicing. Serve cold with herb mayonnaise (see <a href="part0010_split_020.html#Herb-mayonnaise">here</a>) or warm with beurre blanc (see <a href="part0010_split_018.html#butter-sauce">here</a>). If serving warm, gently reheat the slices in a steamer.</p>
