  <p class="nonindent">This book is written on the assumption that you have had some cooking experience. I have worked on the premise that you own and use at least one of the large basic cookbooks, that you <em>do</em> know how to boil water and are familiar with the more usual recipe terminology. You may never have whipped up a soufflé, rolled up a galantine of chicken or stretched out a sheet of strudel dough, but you can be expected to produce a simple meal for your family or a few guests without danger of mishap. This means that you already know the difference between boiling and simmering, and when a recipe tells you to separate three eggs, you know you are not expected to place them in opposite corners of the room.</p>

  <p class="indent">This also means that your cupboards contain such basic equipment as a coffee pot, water kettle, some frying pans and saucepans, a few larger pots of one sort or another and, perhaps, even a double boiler, a wooden mixing spoon or two, a set of knives and a good sharpener for them, a strainer, and standard measuring cups and spoons; and that your pantry contains such simple provisions as salt, pepper, sugar, flour.</p>

  <p class="indent">Therefore, the lists of utensils, herbs, spices and condiments, and cooking terms in this chapter include only those things that will be especially helpful to you in preparing the German recipes in this book.</p>

  <p class="extract">Every national cuisine has its identifying flavors. By understanding what they are and knowing how to impart them to food you are preparing, <a id="pagexix"></a>you can make the same basic preparations taste authentically German, French, Italian, Turkish, Spanish or Chinese. Almost every country has its own versions of the meat ball and the rolled meat bird, but the fat in which they are browned, the seasonings with which they are flavored, and the liquids in which they are simmered combine to produce dishes that taste entirely different. The French roulade would probably be browned in butter with perhaps a little bacon added to it, it would be seasoned with shallots and minced parsley and simmered in red wine. The Italian rollatine would be browned with garlic in olive oil, simmered in tomato sauce and flavored with basil and oregano; while the German rouladen would be browned in lard or bacon fat, flavored with sautéed onions and simmered in beef stock, water or beer—a heel of rye bread or a few gingersnaps might also be added to the sauce and there would very likely be a dash each of vinegar, sugar and sour cream in it. Similar examples could be drawn for the meat ball, or for those meat-filled packets of noodle dough that are the Italian ravioli, the German Maultaschen, the Jewish kreplach or the Chinese won-ton, as well as for hundreds of other dishes. Although all cuisines sooner or later use all of the same herbs and spices, they do so in different ways and with varying degrees of frequency. If the overwhelming flavors in German food come from caraway seeds, root vegetables, onions, paprika, vinegar and sugar, juniper and nutmeg, this does not mean that a German cook never uses garlic, basil, wine or thyme. The following list tells which herbs, spices, condiments and special ingredients are most often called for in German recipes, along with some indication of how they are used. As you read and prepare the recipes in this book, you will begin to understand the idiom of German cooking. Eventually, you should be able to make any food “taste German” and be able to plan complete and authentic German meals without any recipes to guide you.</p>

  <p class="extract">Allspice (Nelkenpfeffer): You may buy this powdered or grind the whole kernels yourself in a spice mill. Allspice flavors many German fish and meat dishes and is used in the pickling marinades for Sauerbraten and herring.</p>

  <p class="indent">Almonds (Mandeln): Either the blanched, untoasted, unsalted nuts—or almond extract—flavor many candies, cakes, desserts and sweet sauces. The almond paste candy, marzipan, is world-famous and goes into many cake fillings and confections. That of Lübeck is the best in Germany, if not in the world. Sweet almonds are generally mixed with a few bitter almonds in most recipes. If you cannot get the latter, use extract along with the sweet almonds. A quarter of a pound of almonds is equivalent to two-thirds to three-quarters of a cup, depending on whether the nuts are whole, slivered, chopped or grated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Anchovies (Sardellen): Mashed with butter, these salty fish filets flavor canapés, sandwiches and such broiled fish as salmon and sword-fish. They are also mixed into mayonnaise dressings used on cold fish and shellfish. Flat filets are toppings for open sandwiches and flavor many veal and lamb dishes. Surprisingly, they also go into meat dishes <a id="pagexx"></a>such as Sailor’s Hash and Beef Tartar. If you use anchovy paste, allow I teaspoonful for 3 mashed or minced filets. If filets are extra salty, they should be rinsed in cold water and then drained before being added to a dish that is to be cooked.</p>

  <p class="indent">Anise (Anis): These licorice-flavored seeds, whole or powdered, go into Chrismas cookies, cakes and desserts. In the latter, anise-flavored liqueurs such as anisette, or Strega, can be substituted. Whole seeds should be lightly crushed before being stirred into a batter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Apples (Äpfel): This fruit is used as flavoring throughout Germany and is often added to soups and vegetable dishes made with cabbage, sauerkraut and potato. You may also get the same flavor by substituting cider (Apfelwein) or a dark jam, Apfelkraut, which is like apple butter. Do not use sugar with the latter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Arrack <em>(see</em> Rum)</p>

  <p class="indent">Basil (Basilikum): Although used mainly in Bavaria, this does appear in some soups, meat stews and sauces elsewhere in Germany. Germans rarely use pepper in a dish that contains basil.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bay leaves (Lorbeerblätter): Used in many fish and meat soups and stews, this is especially popular with veal and lamb. Bay leaves are also used in Sauerbraten marinade.</p>

  <p class="indent">Borage (Borretsch): This is very popular in Germany and more widely available than it is here. Its mild cucumber flavor is used to enhance salads and, of all things, cucumbers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Candied fruits (Kandierte Früchte): Citron (Zitronat), orange peel (Orangeat), angelica (Angelika) and cherries (Kirschen) are used in many sweet yeast breads or coffee cakes, cookies, candies and puddings as well as in frozen or jelled desserts. They are often soaked until softened in a little rum or arrack.</p>

  <p class="indent">Capers (Kapern): These spicy seeds, bottled in vinegar, should be drained, rinsed and drained again, before being added, whole or chopped, to other ingredients. They are used in many hot and cold sauces that are served with fish, shellfish or bland meats such as veal or lamb.</p>

  <p class="indent">Caraway seeds (Kümmel): These fresh-tasting gray seeds flavor many breads, soups, meat stews, sauerkraut and cabbage dishes, a few cakes and an akvavit-like liqueur, Kümmel. They are also very good mixed into cottage cheese or butter as a sandwich or canapé spread.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cardamom (Kardamom): When powdered, this aromatic ivory-colored pod is added to Christmas sweet breads and cookies, most especially to Lebkuchen.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chervil (Kerbel): Used in Germany as here, mainly in salad dressings but also for Green Soup.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chives (Schnittlauch): Used in Germany as here, chives are mainly a flavorful garnish for soups, sauces, egg dishes, vegetable salads, cottage cheese and sandwich butters. In Germany they are usually added raw, after a dish is cooked. Chives are rarely cooked.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cinnamon (Zimt): In stick, cracked or powdered form, cinnamon flavors cakes, desserts and hot drinks. It is also used in several soups and sweet-sour sauces, especially those that have raisins.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="pagexxi"></a>Cloves (Nelken): Whole or powdered cloves are used in much the same way as here, except that they are added to a greater variety of meat dishes; they flavor sauces served with fish, and some vegetables.</p>

  <p class="indent">Curry powder (Curry): This exotic Oriental spice blend is surprisingly popular in Germany. It is mixed into mayonnaise, cream sauces and tomato sauces and is a great favorite in hot or cold fish and chicken dishes, and in Curry Wurst.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dill (Dill): Fresh dill is much preferred and almost always available in large well-stocked vegetable markets the year round. Only the fresh is used for salads; fresh or dried may flavor soups, sauces and especially cucumber dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fruit Juices (Obstsafte): Anyone who has not sampled the superb concentrated berry juices that are so popular in Germany has a wonderful surprise in store. My favorite is the winy currant juice (Johannisbeersaft), but the blackberry (Brombeersaft), strawberry (Erdbeersaft) and cherry (Kirschsaft) are also excellent. Used separately or in combination with each other, they make very good punches or, with ice and soda, Spritzers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Garlic (Knoblauch): This is used very sparingly in Germany and appears mainly in the food of the eastern regions. The rest of the country confines its use mainly to mutton and lamb dishes or as a seasoning in several sausages and salamis.</p>

  <p class="indent">Ginger (Ingwer): Used for the most part as it is here, in desserts, cakes and cookies. It is also added to potted beef dishes, either in powdered form or via spicy Lebkuchen which are also used in preparing carp.</p>

  <p class="indent">Horseradish (Meerrettich): Freshly grated horseradish root mixed with whipped cream, sour cream, cream sauce, apples or grated lemon rind is served with dozens of boiled meat and fish dishes throughout Germany. It should be sprinkled with a little vinegar or lemon juice as it is grated, or it will blacken. Since it is very peppery, grate it near an open window. Never cook horseradish; simply stir it into cooked food just before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jams and jellies (Marmeladen): Currant and raspberry preserves are often melted into sauces that are to be served with meats, especially game, and into such dishes as Hamburg Eel Soup. They are also used in preparing red cabbage, and as fillings for cakes and cookies.</p>

  <p class="indent">Juniper berries (Wacholderbeeren): Although most popular in Swabia, these large brown berries, lightly crushed, are used in game dishes all over Germany. In Swabia they are also added to sauerkraut instead of caraway seeds, and flavor a popular white Schnaps liqueur. Juniper, by the way, is the herb that gives gin its flavor and aroma.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lemon (Zitrone): Strips of rind, or the juice, are used in all sorts of soups, stews, sauces, meat and fish dishes, desserts and cakes. Lemon juice may be used instead of vinegar for sauces that are sweet and sour, and it flavors all of the white stews known as fricassees.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lovage (Liebstöckel): Although pretty generally available fresh in Germany, you will probably have to buy this dried here unless you grow <a id="pagexxii"></a>it yourself. Its mild carrot flavor is especially popular in soups and meat stews. One leaf of the fresh herb goes a very long way.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mace (Muskatenblüte): Used in fish or chicken soups, stews and some white sauces, this is also a great favorite with creamed cauliflower and potato dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Marjoram (Majoran): As with basil, this is mainly popular for soups and stews in Bavaria, though it does appear elsewhere in the country to a lesser degree.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mustard (Senf): Powdered mustard is used in salad dressings in Germany as elsewhere. The real difference is in the superb prepared mustards one finds in that country. They are sweet or hot, finely or coarsely ground, light or dark, with horseradish and without. Go to a good German delicatessen or gourmet food shop and sample all of the varieties. Düsseldorf mustard is the most famous but you might find another favorite. Mustard is used in many sauces and in such cooked dishes as Mutton Pot Roast with Mustard.</p>

  <p class="indent">Nutmeg (Muskatnuss): Used for the most part, as here, in desserts and cakes, but also very popular in creamed potatoes and potato puddings. Cream soups and sauces and bread dumplings are also flavored with this spice.</p>

  <p class="indent">Onions (Zwiebeln): These must be considered seasonings in German cooking as they are the base of almost every soup, sauce, meat, fish and vegetable dish. They are also sautéed in fat and used as toppings for many meat and potato dishes and are served as vegetables, creamed or French-fried.</p>

  <p class="indent">Paprika (Paprika): Sweet paprika is used in many soups, stews and sauces, more in Bavaria and Prussia than elsewhere. It is an essential ingredient in goulash and goulash soup and is also used as garnish on many dishes, as it is here.</p>

  <p class="indent">Parsley (Petersilie): Used in Germany a great deal, in the same way as it is elsewhere. The fresh is preferable, and usually the flat Italian variety is the kind used, rather than the curly parsley. If you must use dried parsley, steep it in a little hot water first.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pepper (Pfeffer): This is used with restraint, as food is rarely highly seasoned in Germany. The white pepper is preferred to the black because it is milder, and for one thing, will not spoil the appearance of light sauces. You may buy whole or powdered white pepper—actually the inside of the husked black peppercorn.</p>

  <p class="indent">Poppy seeds (Mohnsamen): Used for cakes and yeast breads as well as for flavoring buttered noodles and potato puddings.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pot vegetables, root vegetables or soup greens (Wurzelwerk oder Suppengrün): This combination is perhaps the most distinctive in the German cuisine. Countless soups and fish or meat stews and pot roasts are flavored with this group of root vegetables and greens. It includes carrot, parsley root (petrouchka), parsnip, leek, knob celery or celeriac, onion and sometimes white turnip, along with such greens as flat parsley, celery leaves and perhaps dill, though this last is likely to sour as it cooks and is better added raw as a garnish. Not all are essential at all <a id="pagexxiii"></a>times, but the more variety, the better. Turnip is very strongly flavored and is the root vegetable most often eliminated—especially by me.</p>

  <p class="indent">Raisins and currants (Rosinen und Korinthen): Used, as here, in desserts and cakes, but in Germany these are also added to many sweet-and-sour sauces and meat dishes such as Rhineland Sauerbraten.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rosemary (Rosmarin): Used almost exclusively for lamb and mutton dishes in Germany.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rum (Rum): This flavors dozens of puddings, molded jellies and frozen cream desserts, as well as cakes and frostings. It is used interchangeably with the mellow-flavored Arabic liqueur, arrack. The latter is perhaps harder to find, so use whichever is more convenient.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sage (Salbei): Fresh sage leaves are cooked with many eel, pork, lamb and mutton dishes and also flavor a few cheeses and sausages.</p>

  <p class="indent">Savory (Bohnenkraut): As its name implies, this is Germany’s favorite “bean herb.” It is used in almost all dried and fresh bean dishes, many vegetable soups, and is an essential ingredient in Hamburg Eel Soup.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tarragon (Estragon): Used in Germany as elsewhere, it is very popular in salad dressings and vinegar.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thyme (Thymian): This is used in many vegetable soups and stews as well as in some sausages. As with basil and marjoram, it is found mostly in Bavaria and also in East Germany. It is an important ingredient in Goulash Soup and Hamburg Eel Soup, but then, everything seems to be an important ingredient of that Schleswig-Holstein hodge-podge.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tomato puree or ketchup (Tomatenmark oder Ketchup): Often stirred into soups, stews and sauces just before serving to improve color. Both are also added to mayonnaise and cottage cheese dressing used for fish or fruit salads.</p>

  <p class="indent">Vanilla (Vanille): Both the bean and the extract are used to flavor desserts and cakes. Vanilla Sugar can be used to flavor dishes also. If you use the bean, it must be cut and its seeds scraped into the food you are preparing, or a piece of the whole bean must be simmered with whatever liquid is used in the dish. One teaspoonful of vanilla extract is equal approximately to half a vanilla bean. Imitation vanilla flavor, or vanillin, is an all-around unsatisfactory substitute for the bean or its extract. There is no reason, and therefore no excuse, for ever using it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Vinegar (Essig): This, along with its flavoring companion sugar, is used more in German cooking than in any other, primarily because of the passion for sweet-and-sour dishes. Unless otherwise stated, vinegar in a German recipe means distilled white vinegar. Lemon juice or white wine can be substituted in most cases. To get an instant sweet-sour flavor without using either vinegar or sugar, use the pickling liquid of sweet gherkins, which already contains both ingredients.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="pagexxiv"></a><em>FATS (Fett)</em></h3>

  <p class="indent">Lard (Schweinefett), bacon (Speck) and butter (Butter) are the most commonly used fats in German cooking. Beef suet, or kidney fat (Nierenfett), is used in beef stews and pot roasts and in some English-style puddings. Mildly flavored oil <em>(Öl)</em> is used in dressings and for some cooking, but much less often than those above. Some olive oil is used for salad dressing, but its flavor is most “un-German.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Now, of course, the Germans have become as cholesterol-conscious as everyone else, and the market shelves are lined with bottles and tins of polyunsaturated fats, just as ours are. These, and the semi-ersatz vegetable shortenings, are fairly popular, but they are not typical of German cooking and detract from its true flavor. I have not used them in recipes, but you may substitute them as you would in any other kind of cooking. Margarine (Margarine) is used there as here, but is rarely served melted or in sauces.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although many people in this country have a squeamish attitude toward lard, it is probably due to a bad experience with some that was of poor quality or, worse yet, not fresh. Good lard, usually purchased from a butcher, produces excellent results in cooking and baking. Avoid the kind that is treated with preservatives and needs no refrigeration.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you use bacon that is very smoky or salty, blanch it in hot water for 5 minutes before going ahead with the recipe.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rendered chicken, duck and goose fats (Geflügel-, Enten- und Gänsefett, oder Schmalz) are used more in northern Germany and Swabia than elsewhere. They add a wonderful flavor to cabbage and kraut dishes, boiled or mashed potatoes. They are also popular spread on bread and sprinkled with salt and eaten as open sandwiches. To render these fats, trim fat from inside of poultry, taking much of it from the area around the throat and chest. Dice it, rinse in cold water and cook very, very slowly in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until all of the fat has melted down. If some skin is cut up with the fat, this will remain and form cracklings (Grieben), which are sometimes sprinkled on top of mashed or boiled potatoes or used in cabbage, kraut and noodle dishes. The liquid poultry fat is also sometimes mixed with melted butter before solidifying, to give it a more delicate flavor. Rendered fat can be stored for weeks in a tightly closed jar in the refrigerator. Onions may be fried with the fat when it is being rendered, but I think that they limit its use.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="pagexxv"></a><em>STARCHES AND FLOUR (Stärke und Mehl)</em></h3>

  <p class="indent">Wheat flour (Weizenmehl) and rye flour (Roggenmehl) are used most often in baking. Wheat flour is also used to bind sauces. Potato starch or flour (Kartoffelmehl) is used in some baking, but more to bind fruit puddings or flummeries. Semolina or farina (Griess), rice or rice flour (Reis oder Reismehl), tapioca (Sago), cornstarch (Stärkemehl) and arrowroot (Mondamin) are all used for binding sauces and thickening puddings and flummery desserts.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>THE UTENSILS (Die Geräte)</em></h3>

  <p class="indent">Although no pot, no matter how costly or magnificent, ever made a good cook out of a bad one, the right equipment can make the cook’s work easier and more effective. In many cases the difference between a good pot roast and a great one is the pot in which it was cooked. With that in mind, I have suggested the equipment listed below. You probably already own a good deal of it, and the rest can be filled in gradually as you need it. Though suggested here in relation to German cooking, all of the equipment is equally effective for preparing any kind of food and should be a useful addition to your kitchen. Where possible, buy professional cooking utensils, as they are more durable and practical than their high-fashion, gimmicky counterparts usually found in fancy cookware departments.</p>

  <p class="indent">Electrical appliances: A mixer with attachments for yeast doughs, grinders, choppers, puree mechanisms and the like can be the most helpful thing in the world for German cooking. So many things are chopped, ground, pureed and blended that such a machine is as good as an extra helper in the kitchen. An electric blender would be a fairly good second choice, though there is plenty of work for both appliances in the recipes in this book. A third and most useful appliance is an electric hot tray. So many German meats, fish and vegetables must be kept hot while their sauces are prepared that this kind of tray would be a tremendous aid. With it, you do not have to heat serving platters, food stays hot at the table and the trays are usually attractively designed and sturdily built.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pots and pans (Töpfe und Pfannen): Heavy copper cookware, lined with tin, is a superb material for pots and pans. However, good copper-ware is extremely expensive, and all of it is something of a nuisance to clean. If you would like one or two pieces, the most useful would be an oval-covered casserole in a 3- or 5-quart size, and a sauté pan with a cover. Enameled cast iron, the heavier the better, is the most all-around satisfactory material for any cooking—German or otherwise. It does not scorch, it holds and distributes heat evenly, and will not discolor itself or darken sauces that contain white wine, vinegar, lemon juice or <a id="pagexxvi"></a>egg yolk. This is an extremely important point in German cooking because so much vinegar is used. Plain black cast iron is also very good when no acids or egg yolks are to be stirred into it, and one very large skillet of this material is a great asset. Heavy cast aluminum is the next best choice as far as ordinary cooking is concerned, but again, not if acids or egg yolks are to be included in foods prepared in it. Spun aluminum, fireproof glass and the newly popular, decorative and inexpensive enameled steel are all highly unsatisfactory, as is stainless steel, with or without copper bottoms. All of these materials scorch and are poorly insulated. Heavy earthenware is good for oven cooking but is very fragile when used on the stove. It should be placed over an asbestos mat, never directly on the burner.</p>

  <p class="indent">Casseroles, stew pots and Dutch ovens are all perfect for braising, pot-roasting and stewing. For complete explanations of these processes, and the requirements of pots used for them. A 2-, 3-, and 5-quart casserole or Dutch oven are all very useful. If you entertain large groups, a 7- or 9-quart size would also be useful. The small round pot with the flat cover and two handles is perfect for stews. The larger, taller versions of these are also good for soups and boiled meats. If you prepare a great deal of soup often, you should have a special soup pot, since its shape enables you to cover meats and vegetables with a minimum amount of water or stock.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_001_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="indent">Saucepans with lids, in a wide range of sizes (from 1 pint to 5 quarts), are endlessly useful. If they have metal handles and knob lids, they can be used as oven casseroles. Wooden handles do not get hot and are therefore practical, so perhaps you should have several of each type.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="pagexxvii"></a>Skillets and sauté pans: The one best suited for making crepes should be about 7” in diameter. Frying and browning are best done in a pan with sloping sides. Several of these, ranging from 9” to 12” to 14” in diameter, are very useful. They can also be used for omelettes, unless you are a purist about yours and want them done in a thin steel omelette pan. The straight-sided pan is best for sautéing. It is most generally useful in a 12” size with a lid.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fish cooker: If you serve a great deal of steamed or poached whole fish, this pot is essential (a description of its use). It is also good for steaming asparagus and other vegetables.</p>

  <p class="indent">Vegetable steamer: This is very popular in Germany and does preserve color, flavor and vitamins in the vegetables it cooks.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_002_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="indent">Baking pans: It is good to have a variety, since many German cakes differ from each other only in form. They are the Kugelhupf, the mock venison saddle (or Rehrücken) mold, savarin and/or other ring molds, layer-cake pans, spring form, flan rings, cookie sheet, jelly-roll pan that is also used for yeast coffee cakes, loaf tins and muffin tins. Other useful baking accessories are the rolling pin, Springerle roller, wood blocks for such cookies as Prenten, pastry decorating tubes and cookie cutters. If you want to prepare deep-fried cakes and crullers, you will need either a deep saucepan with fry basket or an electric deep fryer. A skimmer and a deep-fat thermometer are other essentials.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pudding and bombe molds: The covered molds are for steamed puddings; how they should be set in the water bath. Also used for steamed puddings or jelled deserts are porcelain molds. The round soufflé dish is used in the oven or in a water bath. Some of the bombe molds can be used for puddings. The most classic shapes are the melon, the bombe, the conical and the tiered mold.</p>

  <p class="center"><a id="pagexxviii"></a><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_003_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="center"><a id="pagexxix"></a><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_004_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Miscellaneous equipment</em></p>

  <p class="indent">Spatulas: Wooden spatulas are useful for turning food when it is frying, as they do not break delicate bits and pieces. The rubber spatula is essential for cleaning batter out of a bowl, for folding egg whites into batter and for scraping the sides of a blender or elecric mixer. The metal spatula is used for spreading frosting.</p>

  <p class="indent">Food mill and food grinder, or chopper: The first is useful for pureeing fruit, potatoes and vegetables; the second for grinding meats, nuts, vegetables, etc. You will not need these if you have an electric mixer with similar attachment.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beaters and whips: Wire whips or whisks in both small and large sizes are essential—the smaller for producing smooth sauces, the larger for egg whites. A rotary beater is fairly good for batters and egg whites; better still, of course, is an electric beater. Whisks do a superior job, however. Be sure you get very good ones, preferably made of piano wire.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_005_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="pagexxx"></a>Large mixing bowl: This should be used for egg whites so that you will get enough air into them. Purists insist that one should have a huge copper bowl that is used for nothing else, but this is a rather costly and bulky kitchen appointment for such limited use. The bowl you use for egg whites should be absolutely free of moisture or grease, or the egg whites will not be stiff and voluminous.</p>

  <p class="indent">Larding needles and pin: Lean meat should be larded, or it will become dry and stringy during cooking. Lard, salt pork or bacon strips can be used for this. If you prefer, strips of the fat can be tied around the meat instead of being laced through it; the results are <em>almost</em> as good.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meat tenderizer or flattener: This helps make tough meat more tender. Large pot roasts can be beaten before being seasoned and the mallet can also be used for pounding cutlets into scallopini or Schnitzels.</p>

  <p class="indent">Graters: The most useful of all is the four-sided grater. In some cases, electric mixer attachments can replace graters. A very small grater is for nutmeg, and a long-handled cheese grater is a most convenient gadget.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sieves and strainers: The cone-shaped sieve with several layers of fine wire mesh is used for straining soups and fine sauces.</p>

  <p class="indent">Brushes and basters: These are convenient for roasted meats and fish dishes. The brushes are used to apply fat to the roasting food; the bulb baster or long-handled spoon for basting with pan liquid. A small brush is used for brushing pastry or breads with melted butter, milk or beaten egg, and the same brush should never be used with strong-tasting fats or gravies. Let brushes dry in the open air after washing.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thermometers: Besides the deep-fat thermometer, a roasting thermometer is essential. It is the best way to be sure meat will be roasted to <a id="pagexxxi"></a>the desired doneness. If you make a great deal of candy or sugar confections, the candy thermometer is also essential.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the above, a ball of good strong white cotton twine and tough cotton thread are very useful in the kitchen for trussing meat roasts and poultry. Since many German dishes come directly from oven or stove to the table, several trivets are helpful too.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bind (binden, oder legieren): To thicken a soup or sauce with a starch such as wheat, potato or rice flour, cornstarch, breadcrumbs, tapioca or egg yolks beaten into a little cold liquid, then stirred into the hot, not boiling, soup or sauce. In Germany, binding is done mainly with a roux, or Einbrenne, or cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water and then stirred in and simmered for a minute or two, or with egg yolk. Another popular method uses the butter-flour dumplings (Mehlbutterklösse). Knead together I tablespoon each butter and flour, roll into tiny balls, then drop into the soup or sauce when it is ready and simmer 2 or 3 minutes, or until properly thickened.</p>

  <p class="indent">Blanch (blanchieren): To place an ingredient in boiling water and boil for a given amount of time, until it is partly cooked or can be skinned or peeled, depending on the purpose of blanching. This is often followed by a plunge into cold water, but follow instructions in specific recipes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Blend (vermengen): This is a gentler method of combining foods than beating, and is done with ingredients of different textures, such as butter and sugar. It is usually done with a wooden spoon, fork or pastry cutter, or with a special slow speed on an electric mixer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Braise (braten, oder schmoren): All variations and explanations.</p>

  <p class="indent">Breading (panieren): A coating of flour and/or breadcrumbs and seasonings used to coat meat, fish or vegetables that are to be fried. Beaten egg and sometimes milk are used to first moisten the food so the breading will adhere. Breaded food should stand for about 20 minutes before being fried.</p>

  <p class="indent">Coat a spoon: Custards, and the sauces which contain egg yolk and often cornstarch and which are cooked over hot water, must reach this thickness to be done. It simply means that if you dip the bowl of a spoon (usually wooden) into the sauce, enough will remain on it to coat the back.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fold (unterheben): To turn gently a light and fragile mixture such as beaten egg whites or whipped cream into a heavier batter. This is best done with a rubber spatula. Although it can be done either way, it is easier to fold if the heavier batter is poured on top of the lighter one. The spatula is then drawn and turned through the mixture, starting in the center of the bowl and working to the side. The bowl is turned after each fold.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="pagexxxii"></a>Gratiné (überkrusten): To brown the top of a cream sauce dish that is sprinkled with breadcrumbs and/or cheese and dotted with butter; this may be done in the upper third of a hot oven or in a preheated broiler.</p>

  <p class="indent">Knead (kneten): To work dough until it is smooth, pushing it in small batches with the heel of the hand, folding over and repeating process. The amount of time necessary is indicated in specific recipes. Pastry and yeast doughs are almost always kneaded.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lard (spicken): To lace lean meats with strips of fat so they will remain moist and tender during cooking. Information on larding needles and methods of doing this.</p>

  <p class="indent">Marinate (marinieren): To soak food, usually meat but sometimes fish, in a liquid that will add to the flavor or tenderness, or both, of the food itself. Marinades may be based on vinegar, lemon juice, wine, beer or, in Germany, buttermilk.</p>

  <p class="indent">Poach (dünsten, pochieren): To simmer food just below the boiling point, in a minimum of water (that is barely enough to cover it). The cooking liquid is brought to a boil and the food added; then the pot is covered and the heat reduced. Foods are generally poached covered.</p>

  <p class="indent">Purée (Pürée): This is a process that creates a mash (Brei, oder Mus) out of solid foods. It can be done through a sieve or a food mill, sometimes with a potato masher or ricer, with a fork or in an electric blender.</p>

  <p class="indent">Ribbon: There is no equivalent to this in German cooking terminology, at least as far as I can tell. It refers to a batter, usually of egg yolk and sugar, that must be beaten until thick enough to form “ribbons” on the surface of the mixture when it drips from a mixing spoon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roux (Einbrenne): This is a thickening base for soups, sauces and stews. It is made by first melting fat in a pan, then stirring in flour and cooking to the desired color. For the complete German use of the Einbrenne. It is one of the most important steps in that country’s cooking.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sauté (schwenken): To brown, or brown and cook, food quickly in a little very hot fat. The food may or may not be breaded, but it should be dry and the pan should not be overcrowded, or the food will steam and not brown. Pieces of food should never touch each other when being sautéed. Frying is a similar but longer process, and more fat is used.</p>

  <p class="indent">Skim or degrease (abschöpfen oder entfetten): To remove fat and/or foam that rises to the top of soup or gravy. This is done with a large tablespoon, as necessary. To make it very easy to remove fat, a little cold water can be added to the liquid to be skimmed, to separate the fat. Or, if you have time, let the liquid chill in the refrigerator overnight and remove the solidified fat from the top.</p>

  <p class="indent">Steam (dünsten, dämpfen): To cook in steam (usually fish or vegetables), by placing food in a covered, perforated container over boiling water. Usually an alternate to boiling, steaming takes much longer, but preserves flavor and vitamins.</p>

  <p class="indent">Steep (Einweichen): This is what you do to leaves when brewing tea. To steep something (usually a seasoning or herb), place it in water that has been brought to the boiling point, cover the pot or kettle and</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="pagexxxiii"></a>remove it from the heat. Let the steeping continue until the brew is as strong as you want it to be.</p>

  <p class="indent">Toss (anmengen): This is a lighter, gentler form of mixing, usually applied to salad greens in their dressing. The food is literally, but gently, tossed, usually with two forks or a fork and spoon, and as it lifts it also turns, until all pieces are coated with fat, dressing or whatever they’re supposed to be coated with. This is done when it is important to keep the food in its original or cut shape instead of having it tear or break apart.</p>

  <p class="indent">Water bath, or bain-marie (Wasserbad): This is a receptacle, one-third to one-half full of hot water, into which a pan, pot, bowl or pudding form is set in order to cook food or keep it hot. Water baths may be set up on the stove or in the oven. A double boiler is one version of the water bath, used for cooking sauces and custards, keeping foods hot or reheating them.
