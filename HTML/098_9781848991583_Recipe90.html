<p class="normal"><b>This is a twist on the beautiful, classic Paris–Brest choux pastry dessert, which I’ve given a whole new dimension by filling it with a delicious mixture of chicory and coffee cream. You will find granulated chicory and coffee online or in specialist coffee stores.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 45 minutes, plus cooling and 35 minutes resting</p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CHOUX PASTRY</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ sticks unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ tablespoon superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 medium eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">a few drops vanilla extract</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 teaspoon granulated chicory and coffee mixture</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CHICORY AND COFFEE CREAM</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1⅓ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 teaspoons chicory and coffee granules</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup cornstarch</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ sticks unsalted butter, soft</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To start the chicory and coffee cream, put the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring almost to a boil. Stir in the chicory and coffee until it dissolves. Remove from the pan the heat, cover and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> To make the choux pastry dough, put the butter, salt, sugar and 2 cups water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the flour. Return the pan to the heat and gently stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it starts to come away from the side of the pan and falls off the spoon easily. Remove the pan again from the heat and whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until they are all incorporated. Stir in the vanilla, then cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest 35 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350°F. Using a 3¼-inch round biscuit cutter or upturned cup as a template, draw eight circles on a large sheet of parchment paper. Turn the paper over and put it on a cookie sheet.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Spoon the choux pastry dough into a disposable pastry bag, snip off the end to a ¾-inch opening, then carefully pipe eight circles using the circles drawn on the parchment paper as templates. Sprinkle the granulated chicory and coffee on top and bake, with the door ajar by 2 inches, 30 minutes, or until the pastry is medium golden brown. (Leaving the door open allows the pastry to dry as it bakes and makes it very light.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> While the pastry is baking, complete the chicory and coffee cream. Beat together the eggs, sugar and cornstarch, using an electric mixer, 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Strain the chicory-coffee milk onto the egg mixture and whisk to combine, then return it to the pan. Put over medium-low heat and stir continuously 10 minutes, or until the mixture starts to thicken. Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until the mixture cools and is smooth, thick and slightly trembling. Beat the softened butter in a separate mixing bowl until very soft, then add the chicory-coffee cream, a little at a time, until incorporated. Continue to whisk 10 minutes, or until you have a very light buttercream.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> To assemble, halve the choux rings horizontally and spoon the chicory-coffee cream into a pastry bag the same size you used to pipe the pastry. Pipe the cream over the bottoms, then gently put on the pastry tops.</p>
