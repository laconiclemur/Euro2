<h1 class="chapter_title" id="h31"><span class="red"><span class="bold">WINTER</span></span></h1>
</div>
</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div4"><span class="dropcaps2line">W</span>e arrived in Médoc in late October, when the vineyards were golden and plucked and the weather was wet. There was silent beauty all around, but we couldn’t escape the feeling that had we come a few weeks earlier, we could have enjoyed some al fresco dinners, a few dips in the pool. People spoke of the cèpes that were now gone and glorious harvest feasts just weeks ago. Our neighbors were preparing for winter, gathering wood and pinecones, making jam. But we weren’t ready to hibernate. We wanted to explore the region, make discoveries. We quickly found the best markets and some nice restaurants that hadn’t yet closed down for the winter. We took long walks with the dogs on the endless stretches of unspoiled beaches and dreamt of future summer days with picnic baskets and chilled rosé.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div5">The huge rosemary bush just outside the kitchen was a source of inspiration for my cooking those first few weeks; there was a lot of lamb on our table that month. In November, we found a bay tree with the most aromatic leaves just outside our garden gate. Nature might be dormant—the apples gone, the leaves falling—but we could still make use of some of her riches. By December, we felt pretty familiar with the region. We had fun visiting châteaus and buying wine; we even found the best baguette in Médoc (we haven’t changed our minds on that one). We had oysters twice a week and my husband stopped cutting himself <a id="page224"/>when he opened them. We stopped locking our door; the gunshots and insistent barking of the hunting groups that passed by our house didn’t startle me any longer. We had frequent visits from all sorts of creatures of the forest: hares, wild boars, deer, frogs, and snakes are regulars, although the smart ones quickly discovered that a house with fourteen dogs is not the place to be. We began to feel a little bit like real Médocains, but in truth, we had barely scratched the surface.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div6">That first year, a few days before Christmas, two of our puppies went missing after chasing a flock of deer. We scoured the area, called the local authorities, and alerted neighbors, but by nightfall they still weren’t home. Just five months old and lost in the forest, amongst foxes and worse. I couldn’t sleep at all that night and we spent hours shouting their names into the woods, like wolves howling for their babies. The next few days were spent combing the area, widening the circle of search, calling people. We drove down every road and path we could find in our city car, and we got stuck and saved over and over. Some of the narrow country roads led to dilapidated houses. There would be smoke coming from the chimney, chickens and ducks and dogs and sometimes donkeys milling about outside. Usually a man with very few teeth would come out and greet us, and often we could see his wife in the doorway peeking at us, a big pot of something brewing on the stove. None of them had seen our dogs, and weren’t even familiar with fox terriers. “Are they hunting dogs?” the men would ask. I got so worried they would keep the little puppies for themselves if they found them that we started saying they were utterly useless. It was all very Hansel and Gretel. Dark thoughts crept in, like, <span class="italic">Maybe this isn’t a place for us after all.</span></div>
<div class="indent" id="div7">The day before Christmas, we got a call from the <span class="italic">mairie</span> (town hall); a man had found two dogs that he believed were ours. Could he come and see us, and did we have a little something for him? Indeed they were our dogs, and in good shape, too. The man, looking a bit sheepish, said he’d taken good care of the puppies, that he had toyed with the idea of keeping them but then thought, <span class="italic">It’s almost Christmas, they are so cute, someone must miss them.</span> We thanked him, gave him that little something, and said our good-byes. As he was walking to his car, he turned and said mischievously, “Why did you leave Paris for Médoc? Nothing ever happens here.” He didn’t wait for an answer and continued, “The people are a bit boring, don’t you think? All they talk about is mushrooms and oysters and wine and the weather.” “Those <a id="page225"/>are my favorite topics,” I replied. He smiled and then he was gone. From that moment, I knew I would stay here for a long time.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div8">Now we’ve been here a few years and while I still prefer summer, the rural French winter is starting to agree with me. There is something strangely comforting about Sunday mornings when the stone floors of the house are ice cold and I not only feel the chill but can actually see it through my bedroom window as I lie in bed. Staring out at the bare branches, admiring the lifeless beauty, is a privilege of country life. Then a dog inevitably jumps into the picture. My husband always wakes up early because of the dogs and sometimes brings me tea in bed, which is most appreciated. If I am feeling courageous, I sometimes dress warmly and cycle to the village to get provisions. I fill the basket on my bike with a piece of meat, a fresh baguette, and lots of vegetables. Riding home, through peaceful and often icy pastures, brings me serenity and my mind wanders from the sights around me to the food I will be cooking. On days like that, bringing home the groceries feels like an achievement.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div9">In winter, my kitchen table still life includes beets and turnips and pumpkins and nuts and … just looking at the table with its palette of choices—beautiful produce waiting to be turned into something even more wonderful—inspires me to cook. I take great pride in arranging the vegetables and fruits, as if they were going to be painted or photographed (the latter actually quite likely, given Oddur’s inclinations). During those cold days, my cooking takes a bourgeois turn and I prepare slow-cooked meals that simmer forever on the stove and fill the house with warmth and wonderful aromas. Some dishes just can’t be enjoyed properly in warm weather—and they are my favorite thing about winter.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div45">I was once asked what my favorite ingredient to cook with is. After giving it some thought, I decided it must be eggs—so humble yet rich, and endlessly versatile. Give me a dozen eggs and a few other basics, and I’ll be fine. Here in Bordeaux, they like to cook them in wine (of course) with shallots (of course) and it makes for a delicious little treat. My version includes chanterelles and broth and I favor spring onions instead of shallots. I always serve them with <span class="italic">mouillettes,</span> toasted sliced baguette, slightly rubbed with garlic to give that extra flavor when you dip them in the runny eggs. In our family, we often have this for dinner when lunch has dragged on almost until evening and we just need a little something to tide us over until morning. It makes a pleasant start to any meal, and it is equally welcome when served at midnight after an evening at the theatre.</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div55">5 ounces/150 g chanterelle mushrooms</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div56">1 garlic clove, cut in half, one half minced</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div57">2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div60">In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the wine and simmer to reduce for 2 minutes. Add the stock, 2 teaspoons of the butter, and salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened and glossy, 4 to 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div61">Meanwhile, prepare the mushrooms. In a large sauté pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of butter over high heat. Cook the mushrooms for 2 minutes. Add the minced garlic and the parsley, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms are slightly soft, 1 minute more.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div62"><a id="page230"/>Rub the inside of four individual ramekins with the halved garlic clove and spoon the mushrooms into them. Crack the eggs into the ramekins.

<div class="method_step" id="div63">Put the ramekins in a baking dish and pour enough boiling water into the dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 12 to 15 minutes.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div68">I am constantly making savory pies and tarts, often with meat in them, but they can be just as delicious made with potatoes—and a little cheese. My mother would sometimes take me to a tea salon in Paris where we’d share a potato pie after a shopping session. One day, I had a yearning for that pie from my childhood, so I made it from memory. I don’t think the original had Comté cheese in it, but since that is my all-time favorite cheese, I couldn’t resist. This pie can easily be served as a meal on its own, but served as a starter, it adds a decadent (and very filling) touch to an elaborate Sunday lunch. It can be prepared in advance, travels very well, and so is ideal to take to other people’s houses. I am a big fan of Bordeaux wines, but this pie is most perfectly paired with a slightly chilled red Burgundy.</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div78">2 pounds/900 g russet potatoes, peeled and sliced into thin rounds</div>
<div class="IL_item1" id="div79">Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div80">2 cups/190 g diced Comté cheese</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div81">½ teaspoon grated nutmeg</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div82">½ teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div83">2 tablespoons/30 g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div84">1 large egg yolk</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div85">1 tablespoon heavy cream</div>
</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div86"><span class="method_first_phrase"><span class="purple">IN A MEDIUM SAUTÉ PAN,</span></span> heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and cook the bacon until crisp, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div87">Heat the remaining teaspoon of olive oil in the same pan, and cook the onion for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until the onion is golden, about 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div88">Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div89">Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each piece of dough ¼ inch/0.5 cm thick. You want a slightly larger base (about 12 inches/30 cm in diameter) and a slightly smaller top layer (about 9 inches/23 cm in diameter).</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div90"><a id="page232"/>Line a 9½-inch/24-cm pie dish with one circle of dough, leaving ¾-inch/2-cm overhang. Add a layer of half of the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and follow with layers of the onions, bacon, and cheese. Sprinkle with the nutmeg and thyme, scatter the bits of the butter on top, and finish with a layer of the remaining potatoes. Season with salt and pepper.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div91">To make an egg wash, whisk the egg yolk with the cream. Brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Cover with the second circle of dough and seal by pressing firmly on the rim of the dish with your thumbs. Cut off the excess dough, reroll it, and cut out 5 to 7 leaves to decorate the pie. Press the leaves gently onto the dough. With the back of your knife, press lightly all around the edges of the pie to make a border. Pierce a hole in the center of the pie (I use a chopstick) to make a steam vent. Brush the pie with the remaining egg wash.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div92">Bake the pie until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Cover with parchment paper or foil if the pie browns too much. Serve warm or at room temperature.</div>

<h2 class="textbox_header" id="h32"><span class="purple">FRESH HERBS</span></h2>
<div class="textbox_nonindent" id="div95">I am a master of impromptu dinners, mostly because I am also a master of poor planning. I’ve been saved from embarrassment more times than I can remember by fresh herbs. Not everyone can have a bay tree or a huge rosemary bush, but any enthusiastic cook should make a point of growing her own herbs. They are often readily available in stores, but somehow the ones you need most are always the ones sold out: it’s frustrating to have ten packs of mint in front of you when all you need is tarragon. And they are expensive, too. So I grow them all, boxes of them, in the windows, where I hang the laundry outdoors, and outside the guest bedroom. We have tarragon for omelettes, sage for pork chops and butter sauces, and an abundance of thyme for everything. It may be a contradiction in terms, but I say, if you only grow one thing, grow lots of different herbs.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div101">When I make this, I think of ladies who lunch. Perhaps it’s the grandeur of the presentation or even the cute little hat that looks so chic. Whatever it is, I still haven’t met a woman who doesn’t go a little crazy for a well-made vol-au-vent. I used to have this dish occasionally at Ladurée in Paris, where it’s served at its most classic, with sweetbreads and morel mushrooms, and only in winter—and that’s how I like it. But for me, a vol-au-vent is an idea more than a recipe. You take some puff pastry and make a little nest out of it. Then you fill it with a creamy sauce flush with mushrooms and meat, and voilà. If you do not want to use sweetbreads, simply omit them. Even the name of the pastry is open for interpretation—something like “blown by the wind” or “up in the air” might do. I like to call it “gone with the wind.” And I always make more than I need, because someone always wants seconds.</div>

So the question arises, what to serve with all that Champagne? Gougères are airy little cheese puffs so seductive that guests will find it impossible to stop eating them. I make them extra glamorous with Roquefort and walnuts. The trick is finding the right balance of how many to serve: too many, and your guests will lose their appetite for the dinner you’ve been cooking all day; too few, and they will feel cheated.

<div class="headnote" id="div154">I love using <span class="italic">cocottes,</span> or cast-iron Dutch ovens, when I cook. They have a certain rustic allure to them and make every dish seem more bistro-like and tasty. I have several big ones and plenty of little ones that can be used for individual servings. Putting a piping-hot cocotte on the dining table and ceremonially lifting off the lid with a thick cloth always gets everybody’s attention. Usually they can’t wait for me to unveil what’s inside and let the aromas perfume the air. In winter, I like to flavor colorful vegetable stews with a well-chosen piece of slab bacon. This is not a rigid recipe; any of the vegetables can be replaced by other seasonal ones as you wish. Additionally, it can also be served as a starter, or side, as well as a main dish.</div>

If I had to, though, Stéphane Jégo’s L’Ami Jean would get my vote any day. I’ve been to the restaurant countless times and have never been disappointed. His cooking strikes the most elusive balance between traditional and inventive and strangely feels like home cooking while at the same time it feels special. One of the classics at his restaurant is this Parmesan soup, for which he generously lent me the recipe. It’s been such a crowd-pleaser at my table for years that I just had to include it in this book. <span class="italic">Merci,</span> Stéphane!</div>

Bring to a boil, then add the cèpes, reduce the heat, and simmer until the chicken is tender but not falling off the bones, about 1 hour or so, depending on the size of the pieces and the age of the bird (a mature rooster will take at least 2 hours).</div>

When I make it, I sometimes think of Bernard coming into his lavishly decorated apartment after a long cold day at the antiques fair. I imagine him taking off his hat, greeting his cat, pouring himself a nice glass of Bordeaux, and enjoying a bowl of the soup he would have made the night before. I imagine he listens to jazz.

<div class="headnote" id="div304">Christmas, to me, means having some sort of bird. I have never gotten into turkey, but quail, squab, and ducks are all welcome visitors during the festivities. There is something so beautiful about a whole roasted bird (or birds) in the middle of the dining table, surrounded by candlelight, wine in crystal glasses, glistening silverware, and all sorts of side dishes. Through the years I’ve experimented with various ways of cooking guinea hen, and I’ve reached the conclusion that this great-tasting bird shouldn’t be tampered with too much; a few herbs and some duck fat do the trick nicely. At Christmas we tend to have many courses and endless extras—it sometimes feels as if lunch and dinner overlap—so one large bird is usually enough for the family. It’s always important to leave a bit of space for dessert, and at Christmas it’s an absolute necessity.</div>

He certainly had something to tell me. “You have to try these,” he said, holding up a strand of sausage links. “These look like ordinary chipolatas, but they are not; they are much better. I sourced them locally.” I hadn’t had any intention of buying sausages that day, but after such a presentation, I couldn’t bear to let him down. I cooked them that night, roasting them with onion and fennel, finishing them with red wine.

As long as we’ve been going to Iceland for Christmas, we’ve been having these throughout the month of December, and now I can’t imagine the holiday without them. I make them once a year, but they bring back so many fond memories and really put me in the spirit of the season. When I make these chewy, nutty cakes, I always make a lot because they go fast when offered. I keep them in tin boxes in my freezer and take them out about five minutes before serving. That way they are fresh and cold, just the way Santa Claus likes them.</div>

For me as a young girl, nothing felt more grown-up or proper than going to Angelina’s and ordering a hot chocolate and a Mont Blanc. It combines so many things that I like—a sense of history and tradition, a bit of flair and chicness, and, of course, chestnut cream. I don’t make this classic dessert very often, but when I have visitors from overseas and want to make them feel extra welcome, I will surprise them with a homemade Mont Blanc, just to say <span class="italic">Bienvenue en France.</span></div>

<div class="headnote" id="div569">When I was a child, one of my fondest memories was the <span class="italic">goûter</span> hour or afternoon treat. My friends and I were always starving when the school bell rang, and one of the little luxuries we would have was a small tube of vanilla chestnut cream to spread on <span class="italic">pain au lait,</span> a white bread made with milk. So sweet, so earthy, it satisfied our every need. I always keep chestnut cream on hand at home and somehow manage to squeeze it into just about any dessert I love—chocolate chestnut cake, <a class="hlink" href="#h21">Mont Blanc</a>, even pancakes. Sometimes I simply enjoy a large spoonful in the middle of the day. You can buy chestnut cream in some supermarkets and in gourmet shops. This ice cream is my idea of bliss, especially at Christmas time, when chestnuts are traditional.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div586">Marcel Proust famously took one bite of a madeleine and was instantly transported to days spent with his aunt in the French countryside. These days, none of us can so much as think of a madeleine without thinking of Proust. But these little cakes have had a special place in my heart forever because they are just so good. I love to serve them to guests, usually after dessert with coffee, as a chic way to end the meal. Sometimes I served them as dessert, but I’ve found that, delightful as they may be, they don’t quite work on their own. So I started pairing them with little custards and have settled on this favorite combination, a luscious pistachio pudding that goes ever so well with both madeleines and coffee. The madeleines are best served straight from the oven.</div>

</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div633">It has been a long time since I lived in Hong Kong, but I always celebrate Chinese New Year with my family, no matter where we are. It’s part of who I am. It usually falls near the beginning of the year, so it’s also a perfect excuse to brighten up our days, do something different, and educate the children. They are French children who go to French schools, but we are all mixed; we have many different cultures and traditions in our blood and I want to keep them alive in our family. I want my children to have some of the same food experiences I had as a child, and I want to cook all my favorite dishes for them. It warms my heart when one of my kids leaves the table with a beaming smile after having eaten some of the same things I did at his or her age.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div634">The food I would always look most forward to having at Chinese New Year was <span class="italic">lo bak gao</span> (daikon radish cake), a traditional must-have dish thought to bring luck and prosperity, perhaps because <span class="italic">gao</span> means “height,” or “high achievements.” Custom aside, I just love the semi-bitterness of the radishes mixed with the delicate flavors of shrimp and mushrooms.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div635">When I was a little girl, my parents had a ritual of hosting a Shanghainese meal on Saturday nights, gatherings with old family friends at a great restaurant, and the food from this province has always been among my favorites. The meat is often soaked in wine, slow-cooked, and then caramelized, and has sweet and sour flavors. A ham hock cooked this way is delicious; the meat literally melts in your mouth, and star anise and cinnamon add such depth. It’s a typical family dish, served with freshly steamed white rice. I would always ask the waiter to bring me a plate of beautiful tea eggs to have on the side.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div636">We lived in a neighborhood called Happy Valley in Hong Kong, and it had a restaurant that served some of the best wontons in town. If my parents couldn’t find me, they would always start by looking there. I found comfort going there at any time of the day, sharing my table with strangers, and devouring hot dumplings dipped in chile sauce. Just writing about it makes me hungry.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div637">Mango pudding is the one dessert I always made sure to order at a dim sum restaurant. I would quickly look down to the bottom of my order sheet to check the mango pudding box first, then go back up my list, and select the best of the dim sum menu.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div638">With these simple dishes, I give my family a taste of what my life was like growing up.</div>

Boil gently for 12 minutes. Drain the eggs and cool them in cold water, then drain and gently tap the eggs all over with the back of a spoon; be careful not to tap too hard. This will allow the tea mixture to create the marbled effect on the eggs as well as to flavor them.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div696">Pour the water into a large saucepan and add the tea leaves, soy sauce, star anise, cinnamon, orange peel, if using, brown sugar, and the cracked eggs. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, and simmer for 3 hours.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div697">Remove from the heat and let the eggs cool at least slightly in the tea mixture before serving. You can let the eggs soak in the mixture overnight in the refrigerator to get more intensity of flavor if you wish; simmer them in the tea mixture for a few minutes to heat them through before serving.</div>
