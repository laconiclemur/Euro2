<p class="fm"><a class="nounder" href="intro.html#intro"><span class="blueb"><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br/>Falling in Love with Spain</span></a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch01.html#ch01"><span class="green"><strong><small>THE REGIONS OF SPAIN</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Some fast facts on the history, food, and wine of each of Spain’s regions</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02"><span class="green"><strong>TAPAS<br/><small>LITTLE BITES, BIG TASTES</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Bar hopping, complete with a vast array of tapas, is essential to the social scene in Spain. Smoky Fried Almonds, Eggplant Stacks with Tomato Jam, Grilled Shrimp with Pepper Confetti, Moorish Kebabs, <em>Patatas Bravas</em>—all are perfect accompaniments to a glass of beer or wine spritz.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03"><span class="green"><strong>SOUP<br/><small>FROM COZY TO COOL</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Enjoy hearty bowlfuls of both traditional and innovative, modern soups including Roasted Vegetable Soup with Anchovy Toasts, Tomato and Bread Soup with Fresh Figs, Castilian Garlic Soup, Silky-Textured Chicken Soup with Mini Meatballs, and six refreshing gazpachos—from the classic to an adventurous Spicy Gazpacho Sorbet.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_viii"/><a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04"><span class="green"><strong>SALADS<br/><small>SO FRESH, SO GOOD</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Spanish take on salads: beautiful vegetables, simply dressed with the finest quality olive oil and vinegar. What could be better? Try Green Salad with Apricots and Hazelnuts, Mesclun with Figs, Cabrales, and Pomegranate, a Fava Bean Salad with Jamón and Fresh Mint, and a Roasted Pepper Salad so good that “addictive” is part of its name.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#ch05"><span class="green"><strong>EGGS<br/><small>MORE THAN BREAKFAST</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">In Spain the egg is beloved—and more likely to show up at lunch or supper than first thing in the morning. The iconic Potato Tortilla. Tasty Eggs Over Smoked Bread Hash. A luxurious Wild Mushroom Revuelto in an Egg Carton. Use only the freshest, best-quality eggs for these heavenly dishes.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#ch06"><span class="green"><strong>EMPANADAS<br/><small>CANAPES, COCAS &amp; MORE</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Canapés, <em>tostadas, cocas,</em> and empanadas—breads find their way onto the Spanish table in a remarkable array of tasty bites. Serve up Pastry Puffs with Roquefort and Apple Spread, Basque Triple Seafood Canapés, “Deconstructed” Tomato Bread, Galician Tuna Empanada with Melting Onions, and a crusty pizzalike Coca with Candied Red Peppers.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_ix"/><a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#ch07"><span class="green"><strong>SEAFOOD<br/><small>SOPHISTICATED SIMPLICITY</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Roasted Halibut on a Bed of Potatoes. Monkfish with Eggplant Allioli. Fresh Sardines with Garlic and Parsley. Seafood Stew in Romesco Sauce. Cadiz Clams with Spinach and Eggs. Incredibly fresh seafood is at the heart of the Spanish diet and translates into recipes that are welcome on any seafood lover’s table.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08"><span class="green"><strong>MEAT<br/><small>PORK, LAMB, AND BEEF</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Pork Tenderloin with Lightly Seared Strawberries. Salt-Baked Pork in Adobo. Braised and Glazed Pork Ribs with Applesauce. Pork is the number one meat with the Spanish, but they also make glorious lamb dishes (Lamb Shanks with Five Heads of Garlic) and beef dishes (Grilled Skirt Steak with Almond &amp; Caper Salsa).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09"><span class="green"><strong>POULTRY<br/><small>AND GAME</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Just wait until you try Grilled Chicken with Piquillo Gazpacho Sauce, Smothered Chicken with Vegetable Jam, and Lemon Chicken with Honey and Saffron. Plus Duck Legs with Prunes and Olives, Hunter’s-Style Baked Quail in Escabeche, and a robust Rabbit Stew with a Touch of Chocolate.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_x"/><a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#ch10"><span class="green"><strong>BEANS AND POTATOES<br/><small>RUSTIC ELEGANCE</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Originally thought of as poor man’s cuisine, bean, legume, and potato dishes flourish in Spain. Enjoy Lentil and Wild Mushroom Hash with Poached Eggs, Chickpea Stew with Chorizo and Meatballs, White Bean and Clam Casserole, Pyrenean Potato and Kale Cake, Smoky Mashed Potatoes, and Wrinkled Potatoes with Spicy Chile Mojo.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11"><span class="green"><strong>RICE AND PASTA</strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">A Spanish cookbook without paella? Impossible. And this chapter includes a Classic Valencian Paella, a Black Paella with Squid, Mussels, and Peas, and a Paella with Pine Nut Meatballs, Sausage, and Potatoes. Plus there’s a Toasted Pasta “Paella” with Shrimp and a Spanish take on Spaghetti and Clams in a Skillet.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12"><span class="green"><strong>VEGETABLES<br/><small>LUXURIOUSLY PERFECT</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">On Spanish tables, vegetables are frequently eaten as a first course rather than a side dish, and choices range from beautifully Batter-Fried Artichokes to Eggplant Ham and Cheese “Sandwiches” to Andalusian Spinach with Chickpeas to Zucchini “Boats” with Tuna and Roasted Tomatoes.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_xi"/><a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13"><span class="green"><strong>DESSERTS<br/><small>THE GRAND FINALE</small></strong></span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Fragrant tarts, luscious mousses and ice creams, refreshing granitas—including one made with espresso and another with Campari and blood oranges—plus a full array of sensational chocolate treats like Adolfo’s Warm Chocolate Soufflé Cakes, Chocolate Custards with a Citrus Cloud, and Hot Chocolate with Meringue Stars. Sensational!</p>
