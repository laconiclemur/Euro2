			<p class="rec-intro">This is a true French classic of Dover sole fillets, stuffed with lobster, sealed in breadcrumbs and fried, then served with a rich lobster sauce. Epigrammes are often made with breast of lamb or veal, but this is a much more luxurious – and expensive – version.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 large Dover sole, skinned and filleted (keep the bones for stock)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 x 500g lobster, cooked </p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 shallot, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 celery stick, chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ carrot, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp brandy</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tsp tomato paste</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tomato, cut into quarters</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 sprig each of tarragon, chervil, chives, chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g plain flour </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g breadcrumbs </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range egg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">75g unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Trim the sole fillets and place them on a piece of cling film. Using the smooth side of a meat mallet or a rolling pin, gently bat the fillets out to double their width. Set them aside with what was the skin side facing up. </p>
			<p class="body">Pull the head off the lobster, crack the shell and remove the meat. Cut it into small dice, keeping 4 nice medallions from the tail to garnish the dish. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan and sweat the chopped shallot, celery, carrot and garlic until the shallot is translucent, then add the lobster shell and crush it down with a rolling pin. </p>
			<p class="body">Add the brandy, tomato paste, fresh tomato, bay leaf and wine, then boil until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the stock and simmer for 20 minutes, then strain through a fine sieve. Pour the strained liquid back into the pan and reduce again by half. Add 2 tablespoons of this to the diced lobster and set the rest aside. Mix the chopped herbs with the lobster.</p>
			<p class="body">Put a generous amount of the lobster stuffing on each sole fillet. Fold over the end of each fillet and tuck it in to make a little parcel enclosing the filling. Spread the flour and breadcrumbs on separate plates and beat the egg in a bowl. Carefully roll each sole parcel in flour, then the beaten egg and finally the breadcrumbs, making sure to seal the edges and keep the shape. </p>
			<p class="body">Warm the butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan until frothy and foaming. Add the sole parcels and shallow fry them for about 10 minutes, turning them until golden all over and cooked through. </p>
			<p class="body">To finish the sauce, add the cream to the reduced lobster stock and boil until it has the consistency of a sauce. Check the seasoning and serve with the fish and some baby turnips and asparagus. </p>
