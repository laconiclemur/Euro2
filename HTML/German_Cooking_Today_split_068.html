</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Roe deer has delicious redbrown venison and is available on the market as fresh meat during the shooting season, between May and February.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Red deer has very tender, finefibered dark venison (young specimens up to 3 years old) and is available on the market as fresh meat during the shooting season, between June and February. During the rutting period the meat often has a strong, distinctive taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Fallow deer produces more tender venison than red deer but it is also more marbled with fatty streaks. Its taste very much resembles that of roe deer. The hunting season starts in July and continues until February. As well as being shot, fallow deer can also be bred.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Wild boar In the case of wild boar it is important that the meat comes from young animals (young boars). The meat of older boars is tougher, fatter, more difficult to digest and has a layer of bacon fat. The shooting season for young boars is from June until January.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Hares up to 8 months old have very tender, red-brown meat. The quality of the meat depends on the age of the animal and its environment. The shooting season is from October to January.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Pheasants, which are often sold ready-to-roast, are the size of chicken and have tender, juicy meat, especially young animals. The shooting season is from October until January. Pheasants are also often bred.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Partridges are the size of pigeons and produce very tender meat with a delicate taste. This is especially true when the animal is young. The shooting season is from September until December.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparation</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The game offered in shops is usually already skinned and cut into pieces. The cuts usually available are the following:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Saddle, leg, whole hare for roasting.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Shoulder, foreleg for braising.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Neck, belly, breast for stewing.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Game should always be well cooked.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Skinning</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Game (except for wild fowl) must be skinned before it can be prepared. For this you will need a pointed, very sharp knife which you will slide with great care under the sinewy skin and make an incision. Then gently pull the end of the cut sinew using your hand, slightly lifting the knife with the blade upwards and pulling off the skin in large strips.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Marinating/pickling</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">“Marinating” refers to the process of pickling the meat to alter the taste of the meat or to reduce its strong, “gamy” taste. Marinating is especially common in the case of older animals and cheaper cuts. The meat (frozen meat should be defrosted first) is marinated for a period of 12 hours to 4 days. This makes the meat more tender and juicier while reducing the strong gamy taste, as the meat absorbs the flavours of the marinade. Besides the usual main ingredients such as vinegar, wine or buttermilk, marinades also include condiments and onions. Condiments should only be added in small amounts in order to avoid excessive seasoning. Do not add salt to the marinade – it would dry out the meat. The meat should be completely covered by the marinade. Cover the container and refrigerate.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Basic recipe for a red wine marinade:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Take 200 g/7 oz onions, 150 g/ 5 oz carrots and 150 g/5 oz celeriac. Wash and chop coarsely. Add 2 sprigs of thyme, 1 tablespoon slightly crushed juniper berries, 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, 4 cloves and 2 bay leaves. Mix all together and arrange on top of the meat. Mix together 1 litre/1</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">3</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">4</span></span><span class="calibre6"> pints (4</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">1</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">2</span></span><span class="calibre6"> cups) red wine and 40 ml/1</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">1</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">2</span></span><span class="calibre6"> tablespoons port and pour over the meat and vegetables.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Barding and larding</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Larding consists of inserting strips of bacon into a large cut of meat with a larding needle. This may damage the meat fibres, allowing the meat juices to run out and causing the meat to dry out. If buying already larded game, check that the bacon is fresh because it can easily go rancid while being stored.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> In order to prevent the meat from drying out during the cooking process, lean game is wrapped in (barded with) slices of fatty or streaky bacon and the bacon is secured with kitchen string. The bacon can then be removed after cooking and the meat remains tender and juicy.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Very lean wild fowl should also be barded to prevent it from drying out.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The bacon is removed after cooking and can also be eaten.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Carving saddle of hare and venison</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Roast saddle of hare or venison is carved into individual servings as follows:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Place the saddle on a carving board with the bone downwards.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut along the bone with a sharp knife, then detach the bone underneath.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Remove the small fillets on the underneath of the bone.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut the meat which you have detached from the bone in pieces or slices and arrange on a preheated dish with the fillets.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> If you do not have much time you can also detach the saddle from the bone when still raw and briefly fry.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Frozen game</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">Deep-frozen game is available all year round in the shops. The meat will have become more tender as result of the freezing process. Frozen game may be kept at a temperature of -18 °C/0 °F for one year and wild fowl for 8–10 months. Frozen game should be defrosted in the refrigerator, covered, and the defrosted meat prepared immediately.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_68"></div>
