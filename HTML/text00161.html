 FENNEL WELSH CAKES WITH BLUEBERRY COULIS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0001199">
<em>Whenever I visit Wales, I find myself so mesmerized by the view from the train window that I always nearly miss my stop. On my first trip there, wondering what I could take back for my children apart from a fridge magnet, the answer came when I discovered Welsh cakes! Shaped much like a scone, but flatter and cooked on a griddle, they are sweet and spicy, full of chewy currants. Back home, fridge magnet in hand, I set out to recreate this simple yet delicious treat for the kids. My version is spiced with crushed fennel seeds, dotted with tart dried blueberries, and served with a crisp, fresh blueberry coulis. In Wales, Welsh cakes are often eaten with butter and jam, so you can go more traditional if you prefer. Either way, these mini ones make a great sweet treat at a party.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put the flour and 85g of the caster sugar into a large bowl, add the baking powder and crushed fennel seeds and mix together.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001215">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Add the cubed butter and use your fingertips to rub it in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001216">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Scatter the blueberries in and mix through, then make a well in the centre and add the egg. Use a palette knife to mix the egg in, then pour in the milk and get your hands in there to bring the dough together.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001217">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Dust your work surface with flour and roll out the dough to 1cm thickness. Using a 4cm round cutter, cut out rounds, then take all the scraps, bring them together and re-roll. Cut out more rounds, and keep doing this until you have used up all the dough.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001218">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Put the remaining 200g of caster sugar into a bowl.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001219">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Lightly brush a medium non-stick pan with a little melted butter. Or alternatively you can use spray oil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001220">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Place a batch of Welsh cakes in the pan, well spaced out, and cook over a low heat for 3 minutes. Turn them over and cook for another 3 minutes, then take off the heat and immediately dip each Welsh cake into the bowl of sugar. Set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001221">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Do the same for the remaining Welsh cakes: cook, coat in sugar and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001222">
<span class="pink">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 To make the coulis, put the blueberries into a food processor with the icing sugar and lemon juice and blitz until broken down. Then push through a sieve to remove all the bits.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001223">
<span class="pink">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Serve the coulis in a small bowl alongside the Welsh cakes.</p>
