Pat the bird dry, then carefully wiggle your fingers under the skin to release it from the meat—the breast, legs, and back—being mindful not to rip it. Spoon 5 tablespoons of the red pepper paste into a cup and, using your fingers, smear 4 tablespoons under the skin of the chicken and inside the cavity. Smear the remaining tablespoon over the entire bird. Tie the legs together with twine and tuck the wing tips under.

Lower the heat to 350°F and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F, 50 minutes to 1 hour more (longer if the chicken came from the refrigerator).</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">A</span><em>púcara</em> is a clay pot whose tall, bulbous shape—similar to an urn—makes it superb for cooking chicken. <em>Púcaras</em> can be bought all over Portugal, but I found excellent, beautifully decorated ones in São Pedro do Corval, near Reguengos de Monsaraz in the Alentejo.</p>

  <p class="indent">Traditionally this dish is made by tossing a whole chicken and the other ingredients into the <em>púcara</em> and then roasting. The result is a juicy bird, but one with pale, flabby skin. I use chicken pieces and cook them on the stove in a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid—the way my mom taught me. Not only can I mix and match dark and light meat to suit my guests’ preferences, but the dish cooks faster and the pieces brown nicely. Serve the <em>frango</em> with roasted potatoes or rice to sop up the delicious sauce.</p>

When Mozambique won its independence from Portugal in 1975, many locals traveled with their recipes to other Portuguese colonies, including Macau, in China, where the dish picked up an Asian accent. While chef Luís Caseiro, a native of Figueira da Foz in Portugal’s Beira Litoral region and former chef at Alfama Restaurant in New York City, was working in Macau, he tweaked the dish. He also changed the name to <em>frango naufragado,</em> or “shipwrecked chicken,” because its travel route was similar to that of the famous Portuguese poet Luís Camões, who was shipwrecked near Goa in 1558 on his way back home from Macau.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="big"><em>peru assado com dois recheios</em></span></p>

  <p class="center"><strong><span class="small">SERVES 8</span></strong></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">W</span>hen I was growing up, my family often made a simple roast turkey: rubbed with butter and sprinkled with paprika and a dusting of salt and pepper. But for holidays, my grandmother whipped up her <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c007_r1.htm#page198">bread-based dressing</a> and my godmother, who was half-Portuguese, made a potato-based dressing. When we all ate together, the two versions were happily passed around the table.</p>

  <p class="indent">While researching turkey in Portugal, I discovered that the classic way to serve it is stuffed with—what else?—both potato and bread dressing. For years my family performed certain rituals without really knowing why. When I stumbled upon this centuries-old tradition of dual dressings, a bit of my identity jiggered into place.</p>

  <p class="extract"><strong><span class="small">ATENÇÃO</span></strong> <img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_150_r1.jpg" /> <em>My grandmother Costa always rubbed her poultry with salt and let it sit in the fridge for several hours. She believed it pulled out impurities. Her ritual is similar to the koshering process, in which poultry is coated with salt and washed several times. The benefit is it leaves the bird juicy and flavorful. That’s why I must insist you buy a kosher turkey.</em></p>

    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Remove any pin feathers from the turkey and pat the bird dry with paper towels. Rub the cavity with a wedge of orange and of lemon, season well with salt and pepper, and stuff with the remaining wedges and the bay leaves. Tuck the wing tips under the bird and tie the legs together. Mix <a id="page121"></a>together the melted butter, paprika, 1½ teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and brush about half of it over the turkey. Place the bird breast side down on a V-rack set in a roasting pan.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Slip the turkey into the oven, pour 2 cups of water into the pan, and roast for 30 minutes. Lower the heat to 350°F, flip the bird breast side up, and brush with some of the remaining butter-paprika mixture.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Continue roasting and brushing the turkey every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°F, 1½ to 2 hours more. Tent the bird with foil if browning too quickly. Transfer the turkey to a serving platter and let stand, tented, for 20 minutes. Although it’s not the custom in Portugal, you can make gravy (see Variação).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, plonk the potatoes into a large pot of cold water. Add 1 tablespoon salt, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, return half to the pot, and mash well. Set the rest aside and keep warm.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until the foaming subsides. Crumble in the ground sausage and cook, breaking up the clumps, until well browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the sausage into the pot with the mashed potatoes. Lower the heat to medium and, if the skillet is dry, add a bit more butter. Drop in the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 12 minutes. Scrape in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the chopped reserved liver and sauté until browned, about 3 minutes. Scoop the mixture into the pot with the mashed potatoes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Whisk the yolks and milk into the potatoes until smooth; if the dressing is too thick, whisk in more milk. Place the pot over medium heat and stir to cook the yolks, about 3 minutes. Fold in the reserved potatoes, sprinkle in the nutmeg and parsley, and season well with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">To serve, plate the turkey, scoop the dressings into decorative bowls, and take everything to the table pronto.</p>

Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, scraping the bottom to loosen any browned bits. Blend together ¼ cup softened unsalted butter and ¼ cup all-purpose flour in a small bowl to form a smooth paste. Scoop the paste into the stock, whisking constantly, until the gravy thickens and no floury taste remains, 5 to 10 minutes. Strain and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

      <p class="nonindent">Place the birds breast side down on a cutting board. Using poultry shears, cut down along one side of each backbone, and then the other; discard the bones. Flip the birds over and cut them in half down the breastbone. Snip off the first joint of each wing and separate the legs and thighs from the breast. (Have your butcher do this if it’s too much for you.) Pat the birds dry with paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper.</p>

      <p class="nonindent">Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot. Working in batches, add the partridge pieces skin side down and sear <a id="page124"></a>until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Flip and sear for 2 minutes more. Transfer to a platter.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Reduce the heat to medium-low, drop in the onions and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until the onions are spotted with brown, about 10 minutes. Add the bay leaves, coriander seeds, curry powder, ginger, cumin, cinnamon, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Nestle in the partridge pieces and add any accumulated juices. Pour in the 1 cup of oil, the stock, and vinegar, and add just enough water to almost cover the birds. Bring to a boil, then reduce to the lowest heat and let burble, covered, for 45 minutes.</p>

Or do as José does and heat the marinade and pieces until both are warmed through, and take the pot to the table. This is a messy dish, so instruct your guests to feel free to use their hands and to squeeze the garlic cloves right from their skins.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">A</span><em>rroz de pato,</em> or duck with rice, is a specialty of the Minho region. Traditionally it’s made by first boiling the duck to cook it and make a stock, then later roasting shredded bits of the meat along with the rice. But I find this technique leaves the duck flavorless and dry. Plus, to degrease the stock, it takes another day. This riff, which is inspired by my friend, chef Vitor Veloso, calls for braising the legs in chicken stock, then shredding the meat and stirring it into a creamy risotto, along with the de rigueur ingredients—presunto, chouriço, and orange zest. Adorning the top are slices of the perfectly seared duck breast. Much faster, infinitely easier, and far more sophisticated.</p>
