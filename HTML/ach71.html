<p class="author1"><span class="txit">linguine con capperi e olive</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This sauce is similar to puttanesca sauce, which traditionally includes anchovies. Since my father is not fond of anchovies, my mother, Joan, created this recipe, which may be prepared earlier in the day and reheated while the pasta is cooking. It is delicious served as a first course before grilled chicken.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large clove garlic, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 kalamata olives, pitted and halved</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons capers, drained and rinsed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound linguine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnish (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a large frying pan, warm the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook until the onions soften slightly but do not brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the olives and capers and cook to warm through, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or the back of a slotted spoon as you stir them into the pan. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the basil leaves. Bring the sauce to a low boil, and then simmer slowly until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have sweetened, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Add the linguine and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain well and toss in a bowl with a ladleful of the sauce. Distribute evenly among four dinner plates. Top with the remaining sauce and serve immediately. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese if you like.</p>
