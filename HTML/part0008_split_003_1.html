  <h3 class="h3a">Slow-cooked ragù</h3>

  <p class="para"><em class="calibre4">Simbolo della domenica in famiglia</em> (‘the symbol of Sunday with the family’)</p>

  <p class="para">This dish is a very popular and traditional Sunday lunch in most southern Italian families. When I was growing up, Sunday just wasn’t Sunday without <em class="calibre4">il ragù</em>. The weekend would traditionally begin with the housewife’s early trip to the butcher to obtain the perfect cuts of meat; with the package firmly clutched under her arm, she would begin to imagine how it would be cooked. Once at home, surrounded by children, grandparents and the odd neighbour or two, she would begin preparations for this weekly ritual – discussions would erupt among the women as to what should go in, how the meat should be sealed and so on. Just like in the film <em class="calibre4">Saturday, Sunday and Monday</em> (1990), when Sophia Loren goes to the butcher and ends up in a fiery discussion with other housewives as to what makes the perfect ragù! Ultimately, the ragù would be left slowly, slowly bubbling away on the stove, in a large terracotta pot, for most of Saturday and sometimes even throughout the night – a cooking time of 12 hours or more was quite normal. As the ragù gently simmered, the women went about making fresh pasta and gossiping, or in some families the rosary was recited. The smell of the bubbling ragù, the warmth from the wood-fired stove, the squeals of playing children and the animated voices of the women gave the serene feeling of home, family and the sign that the weekend was truly under way.</p>

  <p class="para">Traditionally the ragù was made with various cuts of beef – shin, knuckle, chuck – with the precious addition of <em class="calibre4">nervetti</em> (tendons) to give more flavour, as well as cuts of pork such as ribs and shanks. Home-preserved bottled tomatoes, made at the end of summer, gave the ragù its unique taste.</p>

  <p class="para">The secret to simmering a perfect ragù is to put it on an extremely low heat, partially cover the pot and listen for that gentle ‘plop, plop, plop’ sound during cooking. When the sauce and olive oil separate and the oil comes to the top, you know the ragù is ready.</p>

  <p class="chap-para">The ragù is enjoyed as two courses, the first course being the rich tomato sauce served with pasta, followed by the meat. Pasta shapes such as <em class="calibre4">ziti</em> or <em class="calibre4">candele</em> were popular, but this varied from village to village; in my home village, Minori, we preferred <em class="calibre4">fusilli</em>. Not the mass-produced twist shapes found in the shops today, but long, thin curls made by rolling the pasta around umbrella spokes. I know ladies who still make <em class="calibre4">fusilli</em> like this today and when I go back to visit, I make sure I bring back a bagful to enjoy with my version of <em class="calibre4">il ragù</em>.</p>

  <p class="ing"><a id="page_39" class="calibre1"></a>Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">600g/1lb 5oz beef shin, cut into about six chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 pork ribs</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz stewing pork, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">75ml/2½fl oz/5 tbsp red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp tomato purée (paste), mixed with</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz can chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups tomato passata (strained tomatoes)</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of basil leaves</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a very large saucepan, add the onion and sweat for a couple of minutes on a medium heat. Add all the meat and brown well all over.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the wine and allow to evaporate. Then add the tomato purée and stir to coat the meat. Add the canned tomatoes and cook for a minute, then add the passata, basil, salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very, very low, partially cover with a lid and cook for 6 hours. Check the liquid level (top up with a little stock or water if necessary) and stir very carefully from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para">After 3 hours, remove the ribs and pork and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">About 20 minutes before the end of cooking time, return the ribs and pork to the sauce to heat through.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the pan from the heat and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat and set aside. Use the tomato sauce to dress freshly cooked pasta and serve the meat as a main course.</p>

    <p class="box-head">For a slow cooker</p>

    <p class="box-para">Traditionally this is always cooked in a large pot, and all the meat is browned together so the flavours begin to mingle. When using a slow cooker you may find it easier to brown the meat in batches.</p>

    <p class="box-para">Sweat the onion and brown the meat as above. Continue as above and bring to the boil, then transfer everything to a large slow cooker pot, press the meat beneath the liquid, cover and cook on Low for 8–9 hours (there’s no need to remove the ribs and pork from the slow cooker). Serve as above.</p>
