<p class="author1"><span class="txit">salsa pomodoro di joan</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are many similarities between this recipe and the one for marinara sauce <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a>. The most important difference between them is the size pot they are cooked in. The uncovered 12-inch sauté or frying pan called for in the marinara sauce allows the tomatoes’ juices to reduce or cook off, resulting in a thick, densely flavored sauce. This recipe calls for the sauce to be cooked in an 8-inch covered saucepan so the tomatoes retain their juices, resulting in a less thick and slightly milder sauce.</p>
<p class="indentb">Because this sauce freezes well, consider making extra to have on hand. It may also be cooled and then pureed in the blender for a finer consistency.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon seeded and chopped green bell pepper (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 28-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 fresh basil leaf</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Warm the olive oil in a medium-size saucepan (about 8 inches in diameter) set over a medium-low heat. Add the garlic, onions, and bell pepper, if using. Cook until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or with the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Add the basil and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cook the tomatoes until they sweeten, about 35 minutes. Uncover and continue to simmer for 5 minutes to thicken the sauce slightly.</p>
