  <p class="h2"><a id="page_170"/><span class="italic">A Much-too-pricy Beef Wellington!</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="small">FORGETTING THINGS IS PART</span> of my nature. Like, for example, the charger for my computer that is often hidden somewhere in the house. I usually have to come racing back to the house after dropping the kids off, speeding up the driveway and rushing in to search before heading out again. Of course, I know you’re not supposed to do that to the environment! But in my defense, I do make trips to the recycling center every weekend. It’s not easy to live right all the time.…</p>

  <p class="indent">When it comes to my own domain—food, and how and what we should buy—I can hear myself preaching about sustainability and the environment at the same time that I’m looking at the box of strawberries in my shopping cart… out of season. Why don’t I practice what I preach?</p>

  <p class="indent">One weekend when the kids and I had woken up with the rooster, and I finally had time to read the whole newspaper (even the classifieds), I had found an ad for a children’s yard sale. All of a sudden, the hands-on mom in me snapped awake, and I tried to explain to my children the concept of second-hand as well as I could. But they only heard what they wanted to hear: “Buying new toys!”</p>

  <p class="indent">But first we had to swing by the supermarket, since we were expecting some guests that evening and, in a moment of weakness, I had offered to make Beef Wellington baked <a id="page_171"/>in puff pastry. You know—that proper, old-fashioned dish. We were dressed and ready with our teeth brushed in two seconds flat. The kids and I chose a supermarket that we normally don’t go to, and you could tell we caused a bit of a ruckus in there, which was fun.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/170-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">“Food-Tina, food-Tina!” someone shouted from the cheese counter! “Would you like to try our cheeses?”</p>

  <p class="indent">After having tried a thin slice of a really delicious cheese, I, of course, felt obligated to buy something. But I really had to control myself when I saw the price tag. Ten dollars for one tiny piece of cheese! I had just finished paying the last of the bills from our wedding the day before, and I was basically flat broke at that point.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pushing the shopping cart with that small piece of cheese, the kids and I started searching for the beef. I had already decided to buy a cut that was imported from as far away as possible, because I simply couldn’t afford anything local and organic that day. This is a bit embarrassing, but I tried to justify myself by remembering that trip to the recycling center the weekend before.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Where can I find beef tenderloin?” I asked the guy at the meat counter. He recognized me of course right away as “Food-Tina” and said quickly, “Only the best for the best! I take it you want our best organic Swedish fillet.…”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_172"/>What could I say? I talk about buying local, organic meat every day in both the newspapers and on TV. I couldn’t exactly say, “Actually, between you and me, you wouldn’t happen to have a cheap Danish piece, would you?” In short, I ended up walking away from the counter with a beef tenderloin that cost me nearly 100 dollars, and it was going to be served baked in puff pastry! All the children and I could do was head to the register and pay for the beautiful piece of meat.</p>

  <p class="indent">But, of course, the meat ended up tasting amazing! I treated it with care and let it rest at room temperature for a long time, sautéed it nicely, and seasoned it with love. Just to make sure the meat stayed its best inside that puff pastry. When it finally ended up in our mouths, it melted like butter.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/171-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">If we were all to practice what we preach and feel bad every time a cow passes gas, we would all have to become strict vegetarians—and self-sustaining ones at that. But I know that I’m not the only one who has difficulties merging ideals with lifestyle. I don’t feel alive if <a id="page_173"/>I don’t have a chance to sink my teeth into a nicely aged sirloin or beef tenderloin once in a while.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/172-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">However, it’s not something I need to eat each and every day. Today, beef is a luxury item and should be treated as such. When you do eat it, be sure to enjoy it, so you can look a cow in the eye with a good conscience. When I was younger, I used to go with my dad to buy goose blood for black soup for St. Martin’s Day. In those days, the meats were not wrapped in plastic. You either bought the animal whole or half. Over the years, after working at various restaurant kitchens, I’ve had to learn butchery from scratch. I remember the time my now husband came to fetch me from the restaurant Petri <a id="page_174"/>Pumpa while I was arm-deep in dismembering half a cow. The fact is, I love butchering meat just as much as I love cooking an animal whole. An animal should never die in vain; therefore, the care and consideration of every little detail of the meat is important to me.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/173-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">To cut up the various parts of the animal and use the meat for rolls, steaks, and minces is incredibly stimulating. Today’s renewed interest in all this makes me happy. Stuffing sausage, making liver pâté, and preparing bone marrow are making a comeback, and it’s wonderful that so much cooking knowledge is making its way back into the collective consciousness. So, if you’re thinking of making Beef Wellington one of these days, perhaps you should actually buy organic, local meat after all. Only eat a small portion of the meat, and treat the sides and vegetables as the main dishes.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/173-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_175"/><span class="bold">THINK LIKE TINA</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">HOW CAN I TELL IF MEAT IS TENDER?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Tender meat should retain its juices. So when you buy meat, always go for a package with as little blood in the wrapping as possible.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/174-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">SEASON WITH SALT BEFORE OR AFTER COOKING?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">What’s the rule again? Season the meat with salt and pepper before or after you cook it? Yes, the salt will absorb the juices, but only if you have salted the meat the day before. You can definitely season with salt and pepper just before you cook it.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/174-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">ROOM TEMPERATURE</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Remove the meat from the refrigerator well before you intend to cook it, so it can reach room temperature. If you put a steak straight from the fridge onto a hot frying pan, it will cool the pan significantly, and rather than pan-frying the meat, you will boil it.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DON’T FLIP THE STEAK OVER TOO SOON</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Let the meat get a nice color on the first side before turning it over to cook it on the other side so the meat becomes pan-fried instead of boiled.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">THE MAILLARD EFFECT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">The French professor and chemist Louis Camille Maillard realized that when you fry a piece of meat, chemical reactions will occur. The proteins inside the meat caramelize on the surface, and this is what makes the meat taste good. You can either get this effect by frying the meat in a pan on both sides or by cooking it in the oven on low heat and then finishing by broiling it.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_176"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/175-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">SLOW COOKING MEAT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you cook meat, it initially shrinks and gets tough and chewy, but if you slow cook it in the oven or in a slow cooker, it will tenderize at the same time. The fibers break down, and your meat becomes tender and delicious. The secret to a really delicious stew is patience. Put the meat in the pot and add enough water that the meat is only just covered and bring to a boil. Remove the foam that floats to the top. Add vegetables and spices after you have removed the foam and cook the stew for a long time.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">THE MEAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE HOT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you’re preparing a dinner with meat, you can actually cook the meat the day before. Remove the meat from the refrigerator well ahead of time the day of the dinner, and let it reach room temperature before slicing. Place the meat on warmed plates to serve (see next section for heating plates), and pour a hot sauce or gravy over the meat. The meat doesn’t need to be hot because the gravy and plate already are.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">SERVE ON WARMED PLATES</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">It feels luxurious to have your food served on warm plates. Place a stack of plates in the microwave and turn it on at full blast for a few minutes. Or heat them in the oven at 200ºF (100ºC).</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/175-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">A DELICIOUS CHICKEN IDEA</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Chicken is easy to season and it easily becomes a delicious dish. Cut a chicken breast or thigh into strips and mix with the miso marinade on <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_102">page 102</a>. Sauté in a hot frying pan or in the oven at 425ºF (225ºC). Serve with Thai cabbage and celery salad (see <a href="../Text/006_Chapter002.html#page_33">page 33</a>). There are also a million and one ways to season the chicken. Rub spices on the skin or under it when cooking a whole chicken or individual pieces. Choose herbs, garlic, and a variety spices.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Most everyone loves this dish. Treat the meat well and try not to rush. Beef tenderloin is too high quality a meat to allow for any rushing.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¾ lbs (800 g) beef tenderloin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter and oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">20 cherry tomatoes on the vine</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove, crushed (outer skin and all)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tbsp brown sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch tarragon, freshly chopped (approx. ¾ oz [20 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 425ºF (225ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Put the tomatoes and garlic clove in a baking dish and sprinkle sugar on top. Season with salt and pepper. Bake in the oven for 10–15 minutes. Remove the tomatoes and reduce the temperature to 225ºF (110ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Season the meat with salt and pepper. Pan-fry the tenderloin in butter and oil for 3–5 minutes per side. Place it on an oven rack and stick a thermometer into it. Cook it in the oven until the core temperature is 130ºF (54ºC); this way, the inner meat will be nice and pink. Let the meat rest for a few minutes before serving.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Flash-fry the onion and dried tarragon in butter. Add water and vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce to 2 tbsp. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the egg yolks. Whisk for a minute. Add the butter in a thin, steady stream while whisking constantly. Add the fresh tarragon. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Serve the sliced meat with baked tomatoes and béarnaise sauce.</p>

  <p class="h2a">95. Sliced White Pepper Beef Tenderloin with Sauce Morel</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dish is a remnant of the ’80s and is both simple and rustic—and I like that. The beef tenderloin is really peppery.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 pieces of beef tenderloin (each approx. 6–7 oz [180–200 g])</span></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_180"/>96. Beef Wellington with Mushroom Filling</p>

  <p class="noindentl">A classic recipe from the ’80s. I can thank my physical therapist for this, because she pretty much forced me to try it. The baking sheet must be super hot to start cooking the puff pastry immediately—if you ignore this part, the bottom pastry will end up unpleasantly chewy. The name Wellington comes from the Duke of Wellington, who defeated the mighty Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">6–8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 lbs (1 kg) beef tenderloin, the middle part (i.e., cut off the ends so the length is all of equal size)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter and oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½–¾ tsp salt, ½ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">6 big slices of prosciutto (approx. 5 oz[150 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1–2 tbsp Dijon mustard</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 sheets of puff pastry + a little bit of flour</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">egg yolk for glazing</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MUSHROOM FILLING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10½ oz (300 g) mushrooms</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 chopped shallots</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MADEIRA SAUCE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) Madeira wine</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp (50 ml) balsamic vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp light soy sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp brown sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 shallots, thinly sliced</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp olive oil to thin the sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MUSHROOMS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10½ oz (300 g) mixed mushrooms</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter and oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">7 oz Brussels sprouts, with outer leaves removed</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of coarsely chopped parsley</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼–½ tsp salt, ¼–½ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   In a food processor, mix the mushrooms with the onion. Sauté the mushrooms in butter and let the mushrooms absorb the liquid. Add the heavy cream. Let simmer until the mixture is creamy. Season with salt and pepper and let it cool.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Reduce all ingredients for the Madeira sauce—except the olive oil—in a pan, until the mixture is reduced by half. Drizzle the olive oil on top when you serve; gently pour the oil over the top of a spoon so the sauce turns into beautiful pearls. This makes the sauce more of a warm vinaigrette than anything else. Season with salt and white or black pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper. Flash-fry it in a frying pan in butter and oil. Let it cool.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Wrap a cutting board with plastic wrap and layer the prosciutto on the board. Spread out the mushroom mix, and place the tenderloin in the middle. Top the meat with some mustard. With the help of the plastic wrap, roll every-thing together so it’s all held together firmly.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Layer the puff pastry and roll them out thoroughly with plenty of flour so they don’t stick. Remove the meat from the plastic wrap and place it on top of the puff pastry. Roll the meat up into the puff pastry and pinch the edges together. “Glue” it together with whisked egg yolk. Score a few diagonal lines in the top of the dough; this will ensure that the steam can escape during cooking and will prevent the meat from boiling.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Put the puff pastry roll seam-side down on the hot oven plate and stick a thermometer into the meat. Place the oven pan in the middle of the oven. After 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 325ºF (160ºC). The meat should be done after 25–35 minutes, or once it has reached a core temperature of 130ºF (54ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">8.   Sauté the mushrooms in butter for a few minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts and sauté them as well. Season with salt, pepper, and parsley.</p>

  <p class="nlist">9.   Serve the sliced meat with the sides.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_181"/>97. Venison Roast and Vinegar Pork with Potato and Apple Compote</p>

  <p class="noindentl">The vinegar pork in this recipe is so delicious! And the compote of apple, lemon, and shallot is super fresh and easy to make. It doesn’t matter if you choose venison or elk.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔–2¼ lbs (800 g–1 kg) venison roast</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">VINEGAR PORK:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10½ oz (300 g) pork belly</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) white wine vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) maple syrup or honey</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">POTATO AND APPLE COMPOTE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ lbs (800 g) firm potatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 apples, peeled</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon, zest + ½ lemon, juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 shallot, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 225ºF (110ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Season the venison roast with salt and pepper. In a frying pan, sear the meat on all sides in butter and oil. Put the roast in a baking dish. Cook in the oven until the core temperature is 135ºF (57ºC). Cook the meat just a little bit longer if you prefer a more well-done meat.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Cut the pork into big cubes, about 1” x 1” (2 x 2 cm). Put them in a pot and pour vinegar and syrup on top so they’re almost completely covered. Let it simmer for about 30 minutes. The pork should have a reddish-brown color and will have a sweet and sour taste to it.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Peel the potatoes and boil in salted water. Drain the water and lightly mash the potatoes. Shred the apples into the potatoes and add the lemon zest and juice. Add onion, olive oil, crème fraîche (or sour cream), and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_183"/>98. Cordon Bleu</p>

  <p class="noindentl">A favorite at our house! Try to get a hold of Japanese panko breadcrumbs rather than using standard breadcrumbs, as the panko breadcrumbs make this dish so much tastier. You ought to be able to find them in a well-stocked supermarket, but if not, try an Asian grocery. A real wienerschnitzel is always made of veal. To make it cordon bleu, use Emmentaler cheese and ham.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 large flattened veal schnitzels (approx. 1⅓ lbs [600 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 slices of Emmentaler cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 slices of prosciutto</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 tbsp Dijon mustard</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter and oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DOUBLE BREADING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (200 ml) panko breadcrumbs</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Spread the veal schnitzels on a cutting board. Season with salt and pepper. Put two slices of cheese, one slice of ham, and a little bit of mustard onto one side of each veal schnitzel. Fold together.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Whisk the eggs. In another bowl, add the flour and season with salt and pepper. In a third bowl, add the breadcrumbs. Begin by dipping the schnitzels into flour, then into the egg mixture, and lastly into the breadcrumbs. Make sure the meat gets thoroughly coated at each step.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Pan-fry the schnitzels in butter and oil until they are golden brown in color—about 5–7 minutes on each side. Don’t turn the burner to too high of a temperature; otherwise the meat will burn. While cooking, baste the meat with the butter and oil mixture.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dish is from my first cookbook. It’s named after August Strindberg, even though nobody knows for sure if he ever actually ate this dish. The parsley potatoes pair well with many other dishes, especially during the summertime. You can actually use parsley on pretty much everything and anything—grilled vegetables, boiled ears of corn, salads.…</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Ask the store to hammer out the beef to crush the fibers, which lets the meat cook faster. You can fill the rouladen with practically anything: celery, ajvar relish, parsnip, mushrooms, scorzonera.… Let the fridge decide! The cool warm cucumber is also great with gravlax, pan-fried fish, or atop whole-grain bread with a thick piece of smoked sausage.</p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Peel the carrots and celeriac. Rinse the leek. Cut carrots, celeriac, leek, and sausage into sticks.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Spread a little bit of mustard onto each piece of beef. Distribute the root vegetables, onion, and sausage onto the steak slices. Roll them up and insert a toothpick into each roulade to hold them together. Season with salt and pepper. Pan-fry the roulades in some butter and oil, and place them in a casserole dish.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Peel and slice the onion for the sauce and pan fry it in butter or oil until soft. Add tomato paste, porter, water, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and let simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the beef stock over the rouladen and cook them in the oven for about 1 hour. Test with a toothpick to make sure they’re fully cooked. When cooked, remove the rouladen from the oven and take out the toothpicks holding them together.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Strain the juices from the casserole dish into a pot and bring to a boil. Thicken the sauce by adding cornstarch that has been mixed with water until it is a thick paste. Season the sauce with a few pinches of salt and a few turns of the peppermill.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Peel and shred the potato on the roughest side of the grater. Squeeze out the juices. Pour in the melted butter (the secret of achieving a delicious-looking cake is in the fat, so don’t skimp!). Season with salt and pepper. Flatten the shredded potatoes into a cake shape and pan-fry some butter or oil for 5–10 minutes, until it has a lovely golden-brown color. Flip the cake over with the help of a lid or a plate. Cook the other side on low heat until both sides have a beautiful color and the cake is really soft. Poke it with a knife to make sure it’s done.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Peel and core the cucumber. Cut it diagonally into pieces. In a saucepan, melt some butter and add the cucumber and some water. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the cucumber on low heat. Add the finely chopped onion and parsley just before serving.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8.   Place the rouladen in the sauce to heat them up. Serve with the potato cake and the warm cucumber.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_186"/>101. Topside Beef and Roasted Garlic Butter with Carrot and Jerusalem Artichoke Mash</p>

  <p class="noindentl">For this recipe, I use tender cuts of beef from highland cattle; the meat is as tender as I feel after the first day of cross-country skiing in the wintertime. The butter highlights the sweetness of two sources: the roasted garlic and the mango chutney. Even if you’re one of those people who frown at garlic, you’ll certainly enjoy this garlic butter. When you roast the garlic, it turns mild and “un-sticky,” and is a lot tastier. You may want to make a double batch of the butter and serve it on a baked potato the next day.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">What would a hefty cookbook be without a recipe for Boeuf Bourguignon? Be bold enough to cut thick chunks of meat and let it cook for a long time. When it’s done, it should literally fall apart. At first, when cooking meat, it shrinks and is tough and chewy, but when it’s cooked slowly in the oven or in a slow cooker, it will become tender. The fibers of the meat break down and when it’s ready, you’ll have a tender and tasty meat. So dare to cook it for a very long time. You might even start cooking a day in advance, as that will only improve the taste and texture.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3⅓ lbs (1½ kg) chuck roast</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Cut the beef into chunks roughly 1¼” x 1¼” (3 x 3 cm). Sear the beef chunks in butter. Sprinkle the flour on top and let the surface of the beef turn a lovely brown color. Put the chunks into a large pot. Pour ½ cup (100 ml) of water into the frying pan in which you seared the beef, and bring to a boil before pouring it over the beef chunks in the pot.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Peel carrots, yellow onion, and garlic. Cut the onion into eight wedges and crush the garlic. Cut the carrot into pieces.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Sauté the pork belly, carrots, yellow onion, and garlic with the tomato paste. Pour all of this into the pot, and pour in the red wine and water. Bring to a boil and add in the thyme and bay leaves. Let the stew simmer for 2–2½ hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Peel the pearl onions, and sauté in butter with the mushrooms. Ladle some of the stew into the frying pan and let the onions simmer until they turn soft. Pour the pearl onion and mushroom mixture into the stew and season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">MY BEEF STOCK</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">Instead of using store-bought beef stock, I prefer to use water and let the ingredients provide the flavor themselves.

  <p class="noindent">Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC). Roast the chicken wings, oxtail, root vegetables, and garlic in the oven for about 25 minutes until they turn golden brown. Put everything in a large pot and pour in enough water to cover all ingredients. Bring to a boil and skim off the fat and impurities. Add the spices and let simmer for 3–4 hours. If it looks cloudy, strain the stock, and let it cool to room temperature before refrigerating. It will last for 5–6 days in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">If you want it to be a true Maqluba, you have to prepare the “magical” spice mix! Go ahead and make a large supply, as it will last for a long time.

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Cut the meat as needed so it will fit into the pot. Peel and finely chop the onion. Peel and crush the garlic cloves.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Sear the meat in butter inside a large pot. Add the onion, garlic, and spices. Sauté for a few minutes. If there’s not enough space left in the pot, just lift up the meat so the onion has room to finish frying. Add enough water to cover the meat completely and then some. Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer for about 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   In the meantime, slice the eggplant and put it in a bowl. Sprinkle salt over the eggplant slices. Let it rest for 20 minutes. Then, soak up the liquid from the eggplant with some paper towels, and sauté the eggplant slices in butter and oil.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Slice the zucchini.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   When the meat has cooked for an hour, pour its stock into a separate pot and set it aside. Keep the meat in the pot. Place the eggplant on top of the meat. Pour in the raw rice and the broth you set aside. If you don’t have enough broth, you can add a little bit of water, but you’ll need to add some salt as well. Add the zucchini and let simmer under a closed lid until the rice is cooked—about 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Turn the pot upside-down onto a plate. Top off the Maqluba with some roasted almonds and serve it with lemon sliced Russian style (see below).</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Stick the knife through the lemon as shown in the drawing. Make an incision lengthwise through the lemon, from one side to the other. Now turn the knife over so that the other side of the lemon comes up and make an incision equal to the first. Now you can split the lemon and remove the knife.

Now, imagine if these fourteen dishes could each taste fourteen different ways. The same recipes but with different flavors and shapes and colors and methods of cutting the ingredients. So stock up your spice rack. You can change so many elements of your meal by just changing up basic flavors. Here you go! The same pork is sometimes party pork and sometimes everyday pork.

  <p class="noindentl">This recipe for porchetta (which means “little sow” in Italian) was a dish I prepared with Magnus Nilsson in Fäviken when I was there filming a TV program. To make it, he gave me a cut from his Christmas pig, which was one of the fattest and nicest looking pigs I’ve ever seen. And the porchetta turned out so incredibly delicious because of it! Pork belly is unsliced bacon, and I cut it without actually slicing it all the way through. Then I spread it open, fill it up, and roll it together.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3⅓ lbs (1½ kg) pork belly</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (200 ml) dried apricots (approx. 3 oz [150 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 garlic cloves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a handful of fresh herbs, for example, oregano, parsley, thyme, rosemary</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">cooking string</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅓ lbs (600 g) potatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 turnips</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ yellow onion</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tbsp ground allspice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cup (300 ml) whipping cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) spiced cheese, shredded</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Split the pork belly lengthwise without cutting it all the way through. Spread it wide open. Season heavily with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Cut the apricots into strips. Peel and crush the garlic cloves with a knife.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Spread the apricots, garlic, and herbs onto the pork belly. Roll it up tightly and bind it with cooking string. Rub the rolled-up meat with olive oil and salt. Score the rind of the pork belly and insert the cinnamon sticks into the scored meat. Place the porchetta onto a baking pan and put it in the oven. After about 20 minutes, flip the meat over so it will get a nice, even color before reducing the temperature to 300ºF (150ºC). Pour the apple juice on top and cook the porchetta for about 1½ hours, until it is tender. Baste the porchetta every 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Thinly slice the potatoes and turnips, preferably in a food processor or with a mandolin. Peel and thinly slice the onion. Sauté the onion with the allspice in some oil and butter. Add the milk and the heavy cream and bring to a boil. Add the sliced potatoes and turnips and season heavily with salt and pepper (the potatoes will absorb a lot of salt). Cook the potatoes and turnips until they are soft and their consistency is creamy, for about 3–5 minutes. Be sure to stir consistently—do not walk away from the stove. Pour the creamy root vegetables into a casserole dish and sprinkle the cheese on top. Put all this delightfulness into the oven beside the porchetta. Bake for 30–40 minutes. Poke it with a fork to check if it’s done.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Remove the porchetta when it’s done and increase the oven temperature back to 475ºF (250ºC) or set it to broil. Keep the potato and turnips au gratin in the heat to get some color.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Serve the sliced porchetta with the potato and turnips au gratin.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   In the meantime, cut the cabbage into wedges and remove the stem on each wedge. Slice the cabbage into thin strips. Peel the onion and cut into thin slices.

Finally, mix the cubed apple into the pan and season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Put the four apples on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Score the apples and insert a garlic clove and bay leaf into each. Smear some butter on top of each apple and bake in the oven with the ribs until they are soft, for 20–25 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Feel free to put the ribs back in the oven and broil just before serving to give them a really nice surface. Serve the spare ribs hot with the red cabbage and the baked apples.</p>

    <p class="h2b"><span class="italic">One Kind of Ground Meat, Three Different Kitchens</span></p>

    <p class="noindent">You can dress up ground meat for any nationality: one day it might be in a German dirndl, and the next it might be rocking modern studs and leather. You can season, roll, or shape ground meat in any way you like. It can also be fun to grind your own meat: so if you want your meal to have a mild lamb flavor, combine equal amounts of ground lamb with ground pork. The pork is necessary because of its fat content; you’ll need lots of fat when sautéing smaller pieces of ground meat, because they dry up easily. Don’t be afraid of fat, but do use common sense!</p>

    <p class="indent">I use white bread instead of bread crumbs, because the taste and texture are better when you choose bread. It makes the ground meat lighter and less dense, and on top of that, the meat you have will go further and will feed more people. Remove anything called soda water from the meatball-making process. Yes, the meat does expand when you add soda water but trust me, the water and carbonation will both evaporate in the pan, and the meatballs will be really dry.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This Swedish classic was named after Marcus Wallenberg, whose father-in-law, Charles Emil Hagdahl, happened to be the author of cookbooks. In case you can’t get ground veal, you can make a “Broström burger” from lean ground pork instead. The fresh bread crumbs, which hold together the loose ground meat, are really important here, and they offer a crispier surface. Keep in mind that the ground meat contains a lot of fat, so be sure to keep all ingredients cold. It’s easiest to mix the ground meat in a food processor.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lb (500 g) ground veal</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 egg yolks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel and boil the potatoes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Make sure that the ingredients for the burger patty are really cold, otherwise the patty may fall apart. In a food processor, mix the meat with salt and pepper for a few seconds. Mix in the egg yolks and ¾ cup to 1 cup (200 ml) of the heavy cream, a little bit at a time.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Whisk ¾ cup (200 ml) heavy cream lightly. Pour onto the meat mixture and fold in the lightly whisked cream. Let the meat rest in the fridge for a little while, so the burgers will be easier to shape.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   In the meantime, cut the crusts off the bread and crumble into bread crumbs. Pour them onto a plate.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   With wet hands, shape four burgers and turn them around in the crumbled bread.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Pan-fry the burgers slowly in butter and oil, for about 6–7 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Drain the water from the potatoes and dump the hot potatoes into a bowl. Add the milk and butter. Whisk until you have reached a smooth purée consistency. Season with salt, pepper, and a little bit of sugar.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8.   To “clarify” means to melt the butter and skim the top off. Serve right away with the Wallenberg burgers, potato purée, peas, and cognac lingonberries.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">An everyday dish that can be easily made festive with just a bit more work and a few added ingredients. Just as in many other recipes, you can use this as a base. Omit the apricots and prunes or the lemon zest. Use any spices you like, and add some pearl onions, leeks, or strips of smoked sausage. If there’s any meatloaf left over, it will make a great sandwich on some bread or will be a delicious dinner with a fried egg and a salad.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

Cook in the oven for about 50 minutes. The meatloaf is ready when the liquid runs clear.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   In a new pot, melt the butter for the cream-stewed potatoes and sauté the chopped onion. Sprinkle the flour on top and add the milk and cream while stirring to create a smooth and creamy sauce. If the stew becomes too thick, add some more cream and milk.

Flatten them slightly while cooking to shorten the cooking time—thus ensuring that everything will be done cooking at the same time.

  <p class="h2b"><span class="italic">Four Ways to Make Rice</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">I like the kitchen staples—the foods you can switch up without having to think too much. By staples I mean those dishes we make out of habit but that can easily be adapted into something new. Rice is a perfect example. We tend to take it for granted and rarely allow it to take center stage. Rice, potatoes, and pasta can all be seasoned to become something more than just a side dish. They make great leftovers or to serve plain with a salad. By changing up the rice you serve, you’ll have the opportunity to teach your kids new flavors, but you have to be patient: it takes time for children’s palates to become accustomed to new things. Generally you’ll have to serve a new dish five times for the child to recognize its flavor and learn to like it.</p>
