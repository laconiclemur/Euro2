<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><small>HOUGH MY HERITAGE</small> is Italian, my mom prepared a lot of Mediterranean and Greek food when my sister and I were growing up. And professionally I’ve cooked a lot of Greek food, so I feel a special kinship with Greek cuisine. I couldn’t write a cookbook without paying a little homage to what I call “my Greek side.”</p>
<p class="indent">I worked in Atlanta for a few years and during that time had the great fortune of visiting my chef’s family in Greece, where I learned the secrets of cooking the classics. In Greece, you’re not considered a chef until you can cook octopus perfectly. So, I learned how to do it and I’ve had octopus on the menu of all my restaurants since then.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people think they don’t like octopus and squid because they’ve found it rubbery. The key to making really tender octopus or squid at home is in how you braise it. Covering the octopus keeps the steam in and lets the octopus release its own liquid into the braising liquid, which then steams it in its own juices. The vinegar in the braise tenderizes it, and the octopus liquid just intensifies the flavor. You can use a cake tester to check for doneness—it should just slide right out with no tension.</p>
<p class="indent">As a kid, I usually cooked with my grandmother. But the best memory I have of cooking with my mom is when we brought fresh calamari home from Chinatown after eating dim sum one Sunday morning. We cleaned <a id="page_140"/>it up and made <i>calamari classico</i> that night, and the combination of the tender calamari with the marinara and lemon over spaghetti was one of the best dinners she ever made. I’ve included a few calamari dishes in this chapter as a thank you to her for introducing me to it—and I hope these recipes for octopus, squid, and cuttlefish will entice you to prepare it at home as well.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Growing up in Jersey, someone’s mom was always making stuffed shells with tomato and ricotta. I love the smell of tomatoes cooking, so I decided to incorporate that into this dish and stuff baby squid instead. The texture and creaminess of the scallop, shiitake, and bread crumbs inside the squid is delicious, and the basil and lemon zest open it up and give it extra-fresh flavor.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>In Greece, they say you’re not a chef until you can cook octopus perfectly. I like octopus braised or grilled—and no matter how you cook it, the key to bringing out the most flavor is to hit it with acid just before serving—in this case, fresh lemon juice. It opens up the palate so you can really taste the octopus. It is very important to buy the freshest octopus you can for this recipe.</i></p>
