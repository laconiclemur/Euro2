			<p class="rec-intro">This classic recipe of poached chicken with chicken mousse and a supreme sauce was created by the great French chef Auguste Escoffier (1846–1935). He made it in honour of Agnès Sorel, mistress of King Charles VII of France and a keen cook herself.</p>

			<p class="body">Heat a knob of butter in a frying pan and add all the mushrooms. Season and add a squeeze of lemon juice to keep the mushrooms white, then cook them until tender. Remove them from the pan and set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">Take one of the chicken supremes and blitz it with the egg white in a food processor until smooth. Pass it through a fine sieve to remove any sinew or gristle. Beat in about 250ml of the cream to make a mousse that’s light but still holds its shape. It should have the texture of a thick mayonnaise. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4. Butter 2 small ramekins measuring about 3cm across and 4cm high. Finely slice the small mushrooms and use them to line the ramekins, then fill them with the chicken mousse. Cover the ramekins with foil and place them in a bain-marie – a small roasting tin will do fine. Add boiling water to about half way up the sides of the moulds and cook them for about 10 minutes, depending on the size. The mousse should feel firm to the touch when done. Keep them warm in the tin of hot water until needed. </p>
			<p class="body">Pour the stock into a pan and add the herbs and seasoning. Gently poach the remaining chicken for 15–20 minutes until cooked through. Keep the stock at a simmer and do not allow it to boil. Remove the chicken and keep it warm while you make the sauce. Set aside the cooking stock for the sauce.</p>
			<p class="body">Put the chopped shallots and mushroom trimmings in a saucepan with the wine and cook until the liquid has reduced and the pan is almost dry. Pour in half the chicken cooking stock and reduce by half, then add the remaining cream and reduce again. Meanwhile, pour the veal jus into a separate pan and boil to reduce it to a sticky glaze. Cut the ox tongue into thin rounds and finely slice the large mushrooms. </p>
			<p class="body">To serve, slice each chicken supreme into 3 pieces and put them on warm plates. Place some slices of ox tongue and mushroom on top and brush them with the veal glaze. Turn out a chicken mousse on to each plate and serve with the sauce. Add some deep-fried salsify crisps if you like (see <a href="part0010_split_030.html#Salsify-crisps">here</a>).</p>
