  <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span> W<span class="small1">HEN I FIRST VISITED LE MARCHE IN 1958, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO</span> get there, separated as it was by the Apennines from the main Venice-Florence-Rome travel corridor. But today, by the autostrada, you can easily make it from Bologna to the heart of Le Marche in less than two hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">I was twelve years old when my parents took us to the Adriatic coastal city of Pesaro to see my aunt Anna Perini, my father’s sister. She had moved there from Pola with her husband when World War II began. We were about to leave Italy to immigrate to America, and we went to say goodbye My aunt, like most housewives in those days, was a good cook, but the experience I had on that visit was extraordinary. I still recall the spaghetti with white clams that she made for us. The Adriatic coast of Le Marche is sandy, with the exception of some beautiful steep cliff promontories, and clams thrive in that sand. That day, she came home from the market with a bag full of clams, none any bigger than my thumbnail. She chopped lots of garlic and parsley, threw the pasta in the boiling water, rinsed the clams, and, shell and all, tossed them in the golden garlic and oil. By the time the pasta was cooked, the sauce was made. A steaming, garlicky plate of spaghetti peppered with little clamshells was put in front of me. Being from Pola, a sea town, and having a fisherman as an uncle, I was not intimidated by shells and bones in fish. But this was different; it became a game, a delicious game of slurping the tiny clams out of their little shells in between forkfuls of deliciously clammy spaghetti.</p>

  <p class="indent">The next time I visited my aunt Anna was in 1966, on my honeymoon—and return I did to the fish market where Aunt Anna had gone eight years before. I bought a bag of those same little clams, called <em class="calibre4">lupini</em> (in English, striped Venus clams) or <em class="calibre4">poveracce</em> (<em class="calibre4">Chamelea gallina</em>). This time I cooked for all of them, <em class="calibre4">spaghetti con poveracce</em>, and it was every bit as delicious as I remembered. And to this day, Spaghetti with Clam Sauce remains one of my favorite dishes. My aunt passed away, at ninety-two, but I still visit my cousins, and as I travel from Pesaro to Ancona along the coast, I have many opportunities to sample the great seafood cookery of Le Marche. I always enjoy the <em class="calibre4">brodetto</em> at Nenetta, a seaside shack in Porto Recanati, which calls for thirteen different local fishes. I also love the <em class="calibre4">Ziti all’Ascolana</em> with tuna, a memorable and easy recipe; and Fish with Pepper Sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page157"></a>Another delicious seafood tradition in this area of Le Marche is the preparation of <em class="calibre4">crudo di pesce</em>—raw fish—some of the best to be had anywhere. Around Senigallia, chef Moreno Cedroni, in his beach hut Il Clandestino and restaurant La Madonnina del Pescatore, and chef Mauro Uliassi of the restaurant Uliassi have received many accolades, for their extraordinary work with raw fish. One of my own New York chefs, David Pasternack of our restaurant Esca, prepares some unusual <em class="calibre4">crudo di pesce</em>, and he continues to do research in this area.</p>

  <p class="indent">Inland, Le Marche is covered with olives, which have been growing in these areas since the Greeks first brought them to Italy. Great olive oil also hails from this region, but Le Marche, especially around Ascoli, is famous for the olive variety called <em class="calibre4">Ascolana tenera</em>, tender Ascolana. Large green olives cured in brine, they are great for antipastos, with vegetables, and in meat dishes such as Chicken with Olives and Pine Nuts, an enticingly different dish.</p>

  <p class="indent">The cuisine of inland Le Marche, as I have discovered on my repeated visits, is also delicious, very rich in meats and game. Squab, hare, quail, and rabbit are common. Two of my favorite recipes are the Stuffed Quail in Parchment and Rabbit with Onions. And I’ve been delighted to discover some distinctive dishes, such as <em class="calibre4">Scrippelle</em> Ribbons Baked with Cheese and Meatloaf with Ricotta. Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, dried beans) and grains (farro and barley) are used year-round in soups and salads and desserts. Farro with Roasted Pepper Sauce is an excellent side dish, but add to it some shrimp, clams, or mussels and you have a great main course. In Le Marche, not only is <em class="calibre4">grano</em> used for bread or as a main staple of the meal, but when it is mixed with some dried fruits and chocolate chips, it becomes a pauper in prince’s clothing, a dessert fit for any royal table.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sheep husbandry is a way of life in the highlands of Le Marche, and lamb dishes like Lamb Chunks with Olives—<em class="calibre4">Agnello ’ncip-’nciap</em>, are common. And there is no lack of sheep’s-milk cheese in this region. Pecorino is eaten as an appetizer, grated in soups and pastas, and especially good and crunchy when used in <em class="calibre4">Scrippelle</em> Ribbons Baked with Cheese. But the prized cheese is the Pecorino di Fossa.</p>

  <p class="indent">I first encountered Pecorino di Fossa when my friend Mario Piccozzi brought me to Gastronomia Beltrami to meet Vittorio Beltrami, the genius cheesemaker, madman, and philosopher. He looked like an Italian version of Einstein, his hair flying in the wind as he came out the door with open arms and grabbed Mario by the neck. He immediately ushered us in, pressed us to eat and drink something—the Italian welcome—and took us out to meet his animals and his wife, Elide, and daughters, Cristiana and Sara, who tend the rustic <em class="calibre4">gastronomia.</em> There, on an old, large wooden table, were the cheeses, as well as jams, mustards, and the Beltramis’ own wines, for visitors to taste and buy. I felt immediately welcomed by the whole family.</p>

  <p class="center"><a class="calibre8" id="page158"></a><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_056_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="figure1"><em class="calibre4">The town of Sirolo on the Adriatic Coast</em></p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page159"></a>Then off we went to visit the animals. Vittorio petted them and called each one by name, and they seemed to respond. Indeed, it was a beautiful bond between a shepherd and his flock. On our way back, when he stopped in front of a slanted old wooden door, my nose caught wind of some cheese; he opened the door to reveal a narrow cave dug through the pumice, with descending steps.</p>

  <p class="indent">As we went down into the cave, I noticed that on each side of the wall were shelves chiseled into the stone, and on them the forms of pecorino were set to age. As the humidity increased, so did the intensity of the mold flavor. Because Pecorino di Fossa is made from unpasteurized milk, all nutritive elements and flavors are kept intact, and the resulting cheese is soft and crumbly. It is prepared at the end of spring and beginning of summer, and then put in the wells to age from August to October, at which point it is cleaned and ready to be enjoyed. The Beltrami wells maintain a constant temperature between sixty-two and sixty-eight degrees, and the humidity reaches up to 100 percent. In these conditions, the bacteria and mold modify the cheese so much that in three months it matures into the characteristics of cheese typically aged for three years.</p>

  <p class="indent">The story of the wells goes back to medieval times, when cheese was the most precious commodity. To save it and hide it from possible burglars, wells were dug out of soft rock like pumice, and the cheese was stored and kept safe. But little did the cheesemonger know at that time that he would get an extra bonus, a cheese that was deliciously aged, Pecorino di Fossa.</p>

  <p class="indent">As Mario and I enjoyed Vittorio Beltrami’s marvelously complex and crumbly Pecorino di Fossa and washed it down with Rosso Piceno and Rosso Conero, the main DOC reds of Le Marche, the madman seemed mad no more.</p>

  <p class="extract">Celery is plentiful and a wonderful vegetable, yet I see it mostly used in making stocks or salads. This way of braising celery is easy and flavorful, and makes a grand side dish for grilled fish or chicken. It can be cooked in advance and reheated when your guests come—or serve it at room temperature as an appetizer. I’ve also discovered that any leftovers make a very good chutney: chop coarsely and spread on a sandwich of cold cuts or cheese. Fantastic!</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Separate the heads of celery, and wash and trim the stalks. Shave tough outer ribs with a vegetable peeler or paring knife, removing thick skin and strings. Cut the stalks crosswise, including leafy parts, into 4-inch pieces (or smaller chunks if you prefer).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the saucepan, set it over medium heat, stir in the garlic cloves and sliced onions, and heat until sizzling. Heap the celery in the pan, sprinkle over it the salt and peperoncino, and stir and toss, coating the celery chunks with oil. Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, as the celery starts cooking. Stir in the olives, turn up the heat a bit, and sauté the vegetables about 15 minutes, tossing and stirring now and then, until the celery and onions are softened and caramelized on the edges.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, stir and blend the tomato paste in the 2 cups of hot water to make a braising liquid. When the celery is lightly browned, pour in the tomato water and bring it to a boil. Cover the pan, and adjust the heat to maintain a steady, gentle perking. Cook about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the celery is completely tender and caramelized and the liquid has reduced to a glaze. Serve right away as a side dish, or let it cool to room temperature. Leftover celery will keep in the refrigerator for a few days and freezes well.</p>

  <p class="extract">Zucchini is such an abundant and tasty vegetable, yet too often is bland and unpleasing when served. This preparation is simple and full of flavor. The anchovies provide much of it, and if you crave the anchovy taste you can increase the amount used. On the other hand, if you are apprehensive about anchovies, cut the amount in half. For extra spice, add crushed red pepper as well. Serve this hot, as an appetizer or a side dish, or prepare it in advance and serve at room temperature. It’s delicious either way (and thus an excellent buffet item). The savory zucchini makes a great pasta sauce, too—simply toss with hot drained ziti (or other short hollow pasta) and top with grated cheese.</p>

  <p class="extract">Farro, a variety of wheat also known as emmer, was one of the first domesticated crops. It is a low-yielding grain and difficult to cultivate; hence it fell out of favor in much of the world. But in Italy, farro has always been appreciated. The Roman legions ground it to make <em class="calibre4">puls</em>, a version of polenta, and today it is still used to make great soups, or side dishes like this recipe. Served warm or at room temperature, it is wonderful with grilled meats, and a great item on a buffet table. If you want to turn it into a main course, just add shrimp, clams, mussels, or canned tuna.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though farro is the best choice for this recipe, you can substitute spelt, barley, or other grains, adjusting cooking times. And in place of bell peppers, you can flavor the dish with other vegetables such as zucchini or eggplant in the summer, or squash and/or mushrooms in the fall.</p>

Rub the peppers all over with 2 tablespoons olive oil, season with ½ teaspoon salt, and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast for 30 minutes or so, turning the peppers occasionally, until their skins are wrinkled and slightly charred. Let the peppers cool completely.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drain the plumped raisins, squeeze out excess water, and toss them into the simmering sauce.

Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until the farro is very hot. Turn off the heat, drizzle over the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkle the grated cheese and parsley on top, and stir well.

  <p class="extract">This is a very flavorful rendition of pasta and clam sauce, a bit more complex than the one Aunt Anna made for me on my first visit to Le Marche. It can also be made with other seafood, such as shrimp or calamari, in place of the clams—just keep in mind the varying cooking times of whatever shellfish you use. If you are not in the mood for seafood, omit it altogether and double the artichokes. And who is to say that you can’t do this recipe with chicken breast? Just add slivers of breast meat before the artichokes, cook and stir for a few minutes, then proceed with the basic recipe.</p>

Toss in the garlic slices, and heat and stir for a minute or so, until sizzling. Drop in the artichokes, stir, and season with the peperoncino and oregano. When the artichoke slices are sizzling, pour in the wine and orange juice, and heat to a boil.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Immediately dump in the clams, shake the pan to spread them evenly over the bottom, and put on the cover. Adjust the heat to keep the liquid at a steady simmer, and cook just until the clamshells open, 5 minutes or so. Remove open clams to a colander set in a bowl; cook any tighly closed clams a bit longer, about 3 minutes. When all the clams are out of the pan and draining, turn off the heat (and discard any shellfish that have not opened at all).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil (6 quarts, with a tablespoon of kosher salt).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Shake the clams in the colander to collect all their juices in the bowl below, and pour this liquid back into the saucepan. Bring the clam juices to a boil over medium-high heat, and reduce to a thin sauce consistency (turn off the heat before it gets thick). Meanwhile, pluck the cooled clam meat from the shells, and chop it finely.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now cook the spaghetti—if you’re in a hurry, it can cook at the same time as you reduce the sauce and shuck and chop the clams. Have the clam cooking sauce barely simmering in the pan, and stir in the chopped clams just before the spaghetti is <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift the cooked pasta from the pot, let it drain briefly, drop it into the saucepan, and toss well until all the strands are nicely coated with clam sauce. Sprinkle on the chopped parsley, toss again, and serve the pasta right away in warm bowls.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Brush the skillet with olive oil. Set over medium-high heat, and cook until hot but not smoking. Ladle a level ⅓ cup of the batter into the pan, then quickly tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom.

Drop the crâpe out of the pan onto a dinner plate. Cook all the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> in the same way, piling them up when done.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you’re ready to assemble and bake the dish, heat the oven to 425° and arrange a rack in the middle.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the sauce: Pour the olive oil into the saucepan, and set it over medium heat.

  <p class="extract">Ascoli is a city in the Marche region known for its big green olives. They add a distinctive local flavor to this sauce of tomatoes and canned tuna, a pasta dressing found in many regions of Italy. If you can’t find Ascolane olives, other green Italian olives will do. Do not be afraid to alter some of the other ingredients to make your own version of this tasty sauce. For example, anchovies add complexity, but you could omit them if you choose. And though chopped parsley is fine, a little mint and/or a little oregano could go far. Also, do not feel compelled to use the exact pasta shape: I call for ziti here, but fusilli, shells, or mafalde could all add a new dimension to this dish.</p>

Cook and stir for a couple of minutes, as the anchovies melt in the oil. Pour in the tomatoes, rinse the can with 1 cup water, and pour that in.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drain the tuna, and break it up into bite-sized chunks.

  <p class="extract">This tasty sauce goes well with all kinds of fish. In the recipe, I use firm white fish, frying the fillets first, then briefly simmering them in the sauce. The acidity and intensity of the sauce also complement more oily fish, such as bluefish and mackerel.

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To roast the peppers: Heat the oven to 350°. Rub the peppers all over with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, season with ½ teaspoon salt, and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast for 30 minutes or so, turning occasionally, until the skins are wrinkled and slightly charred. Let the peppers cool completely, then peel off the loosened, charred skin. Slice the peppers lengthwise, discard the stem, and scrape out the seeds. Cut the halves crosswise in ½-inch strips, and let them drain and dry in a sieve.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour ⅓ cup olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Stir in the onion and celery, season with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the peperoncino, and cook them for a few minutes to soften. Stir in the marjoram, sage, and orange zest, and heat until everything is sizzling, then pour in the tomatoes along with a cup of water used to rinse the tomato can and bowl. Partially cover the pan, heat to a boil, and adjust the heat to keep the sauce perking steadily. Cook about 20 minutes, until the onion and celery are tender, then remove the pan from the heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the sauce into a food mill set over a clean saucepan and pass it through (or mash the sauce with a potato masher and press it through a wire strainer). Rinse the skillet with a cup of water, and stir into the strained sauce. You should have about 2½ cups sauce in all. Stir in the pepper strips, and keep the sauce over low heat while you flour and fry the fish.</p>

Pour the remaining olive oil into the nonstick skillet, and set over high heat. Lay the fillets in the pan, flesh side down, and let them cook, without moving, until the first side is nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the fish, and cook until the skin side is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes more.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, spoon any excess oil out of the pan, and pour in the pepper sauce so it surrounds the fillets.

  <p class="extract">Every region in Italy cooks rabbit, and I love it—it is tasty, healthy, and low in fat. So in every one of my books I include a rabbit recipe.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though a whole cut-up rabbit is traditional, I recommend rabbit legs for this delicious braise. They are worth looking for—easier to handle, more moist when cooked, and yielding a good portion of meat versus bones. (If you can’t find legs, a whole rabbit, cut in serving pieces, will work fine in this recipe.) Should you have any leftovers, do what I do: shred the meat off the bones back into the sauce, and freeze. It will be a great dressing for pasta when you are late and tired and want a quick, delicious meal.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">Ascolane olives were a delicacy even in Roman times. The elder Pliny praised the excellence of <em class="calibre4">picenae</em> (as they were then called), and there is documentation in old records of the practice of removing the pits from these delicious olives. The hollow cores of these big olives were undoubtedly stuffed in many ways over the centuries, but the most celebrated is the traditional olive <em class="calibre4">all’Ascolana</em> (invented about 200 years ago), in which the olives are stuffed with chopped meat and herbs, then breaded and fried.</p>

  <p class="extract">Pan-cooked chicken, caramelized and sticky to the fingers, moist and flavorful inside, is a favorite food around the world. If there are chicken-lovers in your family (as in mine), this Le Marche version is sure to be a hit. Its special taste and texture come from the region’s big fat Ascolane olives, which imbue the chicken with flavor, and the crunch of native pine nuts.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though authentic Ascolane olives are fantastic in this dish, they’re only occasionally available in the United States. But other varieties of green, brine-cured Italian olives (such as Castelvetrano or Cerignola) will be delicious, too; just keep in mind that the saltiness of olives will vary, and season accordingly.</p>

  <p class="indent">“How about black olives?” you ask. And I say, “Black oil-cured olives will be delicious as well; even a green-and-black combination would be nice.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Choose your preferred chicken pieces, too. A whole bird, cut up, is fine, though all dark meat—drumsticks and thighs—is my favorite. And if you are in a hurry (or watching your fat intake), use breast pieces. With these, you can cut the oil and butter in the recipe in half and, because breast meat cooks faster, brown the pieces initially for only 10 minutes, turn them, add the olives, then cook for an additional 10 minutes.</p>

Trim off excess skin and all visible fat. Cut drumsticks off the thighs; cut breast halves into two pieces each. Season the chicken all over with the salt.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the olive oil and butter in the pan, and set over medium-low heat.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cover the pan, and let the chicken cook over gentle heat, browning slowly and releasing its fat and juices.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> While the chicken is browning, pit the olives (if they still have pits in them). If you’re using small olives like Castelvetrano, use a pitter and keep them whole. If you have larger olives (such as Ascolane or Cerignola), smash them with the blade of a chef’s knife to remove the pits, and break them into coarse chunks.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After the chicken has cooked for 30 minutes, scatter the olives onto the pan bottom, around the chicken, and pour in the wine.

  <p class="extract">Most of you have made meatloaf on occasion; you may even have a family-favorite recipe that you make frequently. Well, I want to introduce you to the Marchegiano style of meatloaf, with ricotta added to the mix, which renders the loaf tender and tasty—not heavy and dense, as they so often are.</p>

  <p class="indent">Another textural delight in this loaf are cubes of mozzarella, oozing and moist when the meatloaf is served hot and fresh from the oven. However, if you plan on having extra meatloaf to enjoy the next day—I think it is almost better that way—omit the mozzarella, because the cubes harden and won’t melt again. In this case, use an additional cup of ricotta in the loaf mix.<a class="calibre8" id="page175"></a></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Preheat oven to 375°. Pour the milk over the bread cubes in a bowl, and let soak for a few minutes, until the bread is saturated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Squeeze the soft bread a handful at a time, pressing out as much milk as you can (discard milk, or give it to a pet), then tear bread into small shreds and toss back into the bowl. Crumble the ground beef into the bowl, and add the eggs, ricotta, scallions, grated cheese, parsley, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Fold and toss everything together, and squeeze the mixture a few times between your fingers to distribute all the ingredients evenly. Scatter the mozzarella cubes on top, and fold and mush them throughout the loaf mix.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Brush the roasting pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Gather the meat mixture in the bowl, turn it into the pan, and shape it into a fat oval loaf. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cover the pan with foil—tent it so it doesn’t touch the meat—and bake 45 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue to bake until the meatloaf is browned all over and completely cooked through, another 1 hour and 30 minutes or so. (If you check the loaf with a meat thermometer, it should reach a temperature of 160°.) Remove the loaf from the oven, and let it rest for about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the tomato sauce to a simmer in a saucepan as the meat rests. Turn off the heat, and, if you like, stir ½ cup or so fresh ricotta into the sauce. Cut the loaf crosswise in the pan or on a cutting board, in slices as thick as you like. Serve on warm dinner plates, topped with a spoonful or two of sauce, and pass more sauce at the table (or, for family-style serving, arrange the slices on a warm platter, topped with some of the sauce). To accompany this meatloaf, I love braised broccoli rabe (<em class="calibre4">broccoli di rape</em>) or escarole, served on a separate plate or platter.</p>

  <p class="extract">This is one of those delicious dishes that are complex in taste but easy in preparation. In Le Marche it is made with lamb and Ascolane olives, because that is what the land provides, but it could be made with other green olives; black olives, such as <em class="calibre4">taggiasche</em> or Gaeta, would be fine, too. As in the recipe for Chicken with Olives and Pine Nuts, the simple pan-cooking method used here is typical of Le Marche. Try preparing other meats, such as beef or pork, the same way—keeping in mind that the cooking time will vary—and the results will be excellent. And though lamb shoulder is delicious and economical, more expensive lamb would be extraordinary prepared in the same style. This dish is good any time of year, too. In the winter, serve it with polenta and braised bitter greens such as <em class="calibre4">broccoli di rape;</em> in summer, a tossed green salad would go nicely.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour in enough apple cider to the reserved juices to make 1 cup total, then stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and ½ teaspoon salt.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lay a cut piece of parchment in a shallow pasta or soup bowl, and set a bird in the middle of the paper, with the legs facing one long side of the paper. Top the quail with a sage leaf and a short branch of rosemary, and drizzle over it about 1½ tablespoons of the seasoned juice. Pull the short edges of the parchment up over the quail, join them and fold them over an inch or so, so they hold together, and then fold over several more times, so the bird is enclosed with just a bit of space around it. Now tuck the open ends of the folded paper underneath the quail, forming a neat, fully closed packet.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Place all the wrapped quail on the baking sheet, leaving at least 2 inches between them—you will probably need two sheets to hold them all. Set the sheets on the oven racks, and roast the quail about 25 minutes; then switch the sheets top to bottom and rotate them back to front, to ensure even cooking.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roast another 20 minutes or so (45 minutes in all), until the juices are bubbling and the quail are tender and nicely browned. (To test for doneness, remove one packet from the oven and unwrap. If it has a good roasted color and the juices look like light maple syrup, it should be done. If too pale, rewrap, roast another 5 to 10 minutes, and check again.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve right away, placing two wrapped packets on each dinner plate, with scissors for cutting the parchment (and a bowl for the paper) on the table.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Dolce di Grano <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 8 cups, serving 8 to 12</p>

  <p class="extract">In the culinary world today, dishes with whole grains are “in,” but they have always been part of Italian regional cuisine, even as desserts. Put together from whatever grains and nuts were in the house, and minimally sweetened with available fruit, traditional desserts like this wheat-berry ambrosia are among my favorites. In that spirit, this recipe can be a guideline for your own creativity.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is a versatile and practical dessert, too. Prepare the mixture of wheat berries, dried fruit, and chocolate in advance, and refrigerate it. Let it return to room temperature before serving (though it is nice slightly chilled in summer). It’s also great for a buffet with whipped cream or scoops of vanilla or chocolate ice cream on top.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drain the soaked wheat berries, and put them in the saucepan with 3 quarts fresh cold water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, cover slightly ajar, and adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Cook until the wheat berries are tender but still slightly firm to the bite, about 40 to 45 minutes. Drain off any liquid that has not been absorbed, discard the bay leaf, and let the wheat berries cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the wheat berries, cherries, apricots, dates, chocolate, and hazelnuts in a large bowl, and fold them together. Sprinkle the cinnamon over them, and drizzle the honey and Saba on top. Tumble the mixture together gently to distribute the spice and sweetening throughout.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve: Scoop ¾ to 1 cup of the <em class="calibre4">grano</em> mixture into each wineglass. Top each with a dollop of whipped cream, and serve immediately.</p>
