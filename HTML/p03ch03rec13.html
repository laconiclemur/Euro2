<p class="summary">Pig rearing in Spain is as old as antiquity. It’s always been part of the rural tradition, providing meat for the peasantry, and adding flavor to their otherwise bland food. After the pig was slaughtered, the meat was dry-cured to last. Peasant families kept at least one pig and then lived off the ham and sausages for an entire year. The hams were usually heavily salted to make sure that they would not spoil. The best ones were made in the mountain areas, where the cold, dry climate was ideal for curing. The hams were hung to dry on rooftops and in attics with open windows. In rainy regions, hams were dried in the kitchen fireplace, where they acquired a smoky flavor.</p>
<p class="summary">In the nineteenth century, pork products were still seen as the food of the rural poor and the lower classes; the upper classes found them “indigestible.” It was only during the Spanish Civil War, when food was scarce, that they came to appreciate cured pork products.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Jamón,</span> dry-cured ham, is now the best-loved food in Spain and the undisputed king of Spanish gastronomy. Consumption of cured ham and sausages has grown at a huge rate over the last two decades, triggering a rush of investment in modern production facilities with state-of-the-art technology that the European Union has helped to fund. Today Spain is the world’s leading producer of dry-cured pork.</p>
<p class="summary">Two broad types of cured ham are made from different breeds of pigs. The most typical, which accounts for about eighty percent of all cured ham in Spain, is <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>—<span class="italic">serrano</span> means “from the <span class="italic">sierra,</span>” or mountain range. These hams are produced from the meat of the European white (really pink) pig, which is mostly crossbred commercially. The other, <span class="italic">jamón ibérico,</span> from the meat of the indigenous black Ibérico pig, amounts to only about ten percent of the total production. White pigs are quicker to fatten and more fertile, producing bigger litters than black pigs, which makes their hams cheaper.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Jamón serrano</span> is now commercially produced all over Spain. Conditions similar to those of the <span class="italic">sierras</span> are created with technology that controls temperature, humidity, and airflow in curing plants. The raw hams—the best come from the hind legs—are covered with a layer of moist coarse sea salt for about two weeks, during which time much of their moisture is drawn out and the meat acquires some saltiness. The salt is washed off and the hams are hung on racks to rest for a month. Then they are moved to <span class="italic">secaderos</span>, or drying rooms, where the temperature is gradually raised and the humidity lowered in a drying and aging process that lasts about seven months; it causes the fat to infiltrate the muscle and a distinctive flavor and aroma to develop. Finally, the hams are transferred to the cooler <span class="italic">bodegas</span> (caves) to mature for another two months. The best <span class="italic">serrano</span> hams come from Trevélez in the Sierra Nevada and from Teruel in Aragon.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Jamón ibérico</span> comes from the Ibérico pig, which lives mostly in southwest Spain. It is descended from a Mediterranean wild boar and has a dark skin, long legs, and a pointy snout. It is also known as <span class="italic">pata negra</span> (black foot). Ibérico products are protected by four <span class="italic">Denominaciones de Origen</span> (DO). One controls the breeds: there are one-hundred-percent-pure Ibérico pigs and crossbreeds that are at least seventy-five percent Ibérico. Three other grades are determined by the hogs’ feed. The finest is <span class="italic">de bellota</span>, indicating that the pigs are allowed to roam free in a <span class="italic">dehesa</span>, or <span class="italic">terroir</span>, of holm and cork oak tree woodlands to feed on acorns (<span class="italic">bellotas</span>) for a few months before slaughter. The next-best quality, <span class="italic">de recebo</span>, is produced from pigs that are pastured and fed on a mixture of grain and acorns. The third grade, variously called <span class="italic">de pienso</span>, <span class="italic">cebo</span>, and <span class="italic">campo</span>, is from pigs fed entirely on grain.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p178.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="summary">The oak <span class="italic">dehesas</span> are protected natural parks, mainly in the mountains of Andalusia and Extremadura, as well as Salamanca. Year-old pigs are taken there four months before slaughter, when the acorns start to fall—from October on. Ibérico pigs know how to crack open the acorns, eat the insides, and spit out the shells. During this period, they put on a huge amount of weight and the fat infiltrates the muscles. The curing, aging, and maturing of the hams is done according to centuries-old traditions, with the help of the latest technology, and the process takes more than two years. As they age, a particular flora forms on the hams, which is supposed to add to their aroma.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Jamon ibérico de bellota</span> is the jewel in the crown of Spanish charcuterie and one of the great foods of the world. Names such as Jabugo, Aracena, Cáceres, Badajoz, Huelva, Ciudad Real, Seville, Córdoba, and Guijuelo are associated with the best ham. Believe me, it is irresistible—dark red, soft, and silky, marbled with fat, and with a delicious, lingering sweet, barely salty flavor and a beautiful aroma. Apparently an added advantage is that the fat resulting from the acorn diet increases the meat’s level of oleic acid, the unsaturated fat that lowers “bad” cholesterol and raises “good” cholesterol. It is the best ham I have ever eaten. On one occasion when I had the chance to eat as much as I liked, I honestly could not stop eating it.</p>
<p class="summary">The ham should be eaten on its own accompanied only by bread and wine. It is at its best carved off the bone in extra-thin slices down the length of the bone and served at room temperature on a warm plate. For carving, the entire ham is mounted horizontally on a wooden stand, with the trotter held in a clamp, and a long, thin, flexible knife is used to slice the meat.</p>
<p class="summary">Ibérico pigs have very small litters; the breeding, handling, and curing are labor-intensive; and the process is seasonal. That is why the hams are so expensive. Because a whole ham would last too long for today’s small households, and young people do not have the skill to slice by hand, the majority of these hams are sold boned and vacuum-packed, ready for slicing by machine in a shop, or packaged in slices. To experience the best texture, flavor, and aroma of vacuum-packed slices, take them out of the fridge at least twenty minutes before you are ready to eat.</p>
