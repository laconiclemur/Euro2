<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_44"/><b>Chicken Poached</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Kaffir Lime Leaves</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I love the fragrance of kaffir lime leaves as much as I like the smell of lime blossom, or even lemon or orange. When I lived in in the Algarve, in Portugal, the scent of citrus blossom was all around us from morning to night, invading our apartment and, when mixed with the breeze and the heat, was such a great fragrance. Here, the lime leaves gently lift the broth by adding a delicate scent and a refreshing flavor that goes so well with the chicken.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 chicken breast halves, skin on, about 6 ounces each</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 thick slice fresh horseradish</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 kaffir lime leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">5⅓ cups Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups peeled potatoes cut into ½-inch dice</p>
<p class="acktxt">4½ cups thinly shredded hispi or other young, spring cabbage</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small handful cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the chicken breast halves in a large saucepan and just cover with lukewarm water. Put over medium-low heat about 5 minutes and slowly bring to a simmer. Lift the chicken out of the water and drain on paper towels, then, when cool enough to handle, carefully remove the skin from each and reserve. Cover the chicken breasts with plastic wrap and leave to one side. Discard the poaching water.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Heat the oven to 375°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the skin, flesh-side down, on the prepared tray and brush with the oil. Cover with a second sheet of parchment paper and a slightly smaller baking sheet, which fits inside the large sheet. This will help to keep the skin flat and let it cook evenly. Roast 10 to 12 minutes until it is golden brown and nearly crisp. If the shin isn’t ready, return the baking sheets to the oven 5 minutes longer, then check again. Leave the skin to cool between the baking sheets so it crisps even more.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, to make the broth, put the horseradish, kaffir lime leaves and stock in the cleaned saucepan and bring almost to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat down to medium and simmer 10 to 12 minutes until the broth reduces by one-third, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Add the poached chicken breasts and potato to the simmering broth and simmer 8 minutes, then add the cabbage and simmer 2 minutes longer, or until the chicken is cooked through and the cabbage is just wilted. Season with salt to taste, then scatter the cilantro leaves over.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Remove the chicken, lime leaves and horseradish from the broth. Leave the chicken to one side and discard the flavorings. Ladle the broth and vegetables into soup bowls. Slice the chicken breasts and put them on top, then break the crisp chicken skin into pieces and scatter over just before serving.</p>
