<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This is the best known dish of La Cerdanya, the northern area of Catalunya that borders the mountainous French Cerdagne region. It has long been considered <em>un plato popular</em>. While in the early nineteenth century, when game and marmalades may have been found only on the tables of the upper classes, <em>trinxat</em> was enjoyed by every level of society. The name of the dish comes from the Catalan verb <em>trinxar</em>, which means to cut into small pieces. Here, it isn’t exactly cut up, or even mashed, but rather smashed.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     It is a winter dish that uses winter ingredients, with cabbage at its heart. Cabbage is tastiest when it has been, as they say in La Cerdanya, <em>tocades pel fred</em> (touched by the cold).</span></strong></p>

Add the potatoes and continue to boil until the potatoes are tender and the tip of a knife can easily penetrate, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a colander and drain well.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Meanwhile, in a skillet or small sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook until golden and fragrant, about 1 minute; remove and discard the garlic. Add the salt pork to the skillet and fry until golden and crunchy, 6 to 8 minutes; remove and drain on absorbent paper towels. Reserve the oil.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Chop two pieces of the fried salt pork; set the others aside until serving.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a large sauté pan or skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add the vegetables and chopped salt pork and cook while tapping down on the ingredients with two flat-bottomed wooden spoons until mashy and pasty, about 5 minutes. Spoon off about 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil and stir it into the mash. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed.</p>
