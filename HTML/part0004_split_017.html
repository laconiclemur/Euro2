			<p class="rec-intro">This delicate, elegant dish is a real classic of the Escoffier era. Many colleges still use this recipe as a way to teach basic skills and techniques, and it comes up quite often in Masterchef. It can be made with most flat fish, such as plaice or lemon sole, but it’s best with firm meaty Dover sole. Skinning soles can be tricky so ask your fishmonger to do this for you. They will also fillet the fish if you don’t want to do it yourself, but make sure they give you the bones. You can serve this dish very simply with the sauce or go to town with a more elaborate presentation for a special occasion. </p>

			<p class="ing-nu">2 x 400g Dover soles, skinned and filleted </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 shallot, peeled and sliced </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 lemon </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60ml dry white wine </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">120g unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60ml white vermouth </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp double cream </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 small bunch of white grapes (preferably Muscat), peeled and deseeded </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">white pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Chop up the bones of the sole and rinse them well. Leave them to soak in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain. To make the stock, put the fish bones in a large saucepan with the sliced shallot, a squeeze of lemon juice and the wine, then pour in cold water to cover. Bring to a gentle boil, skim the surface well and simmer for 20 minutes. Pass the stock through a fine sieve and set aside. </p>
			<p class="body">Place the sole fillets on a piece of cling film. Using a rolling pin or a small pan, gently bat the fillets to flatten them out. Roll them up – if you like, you can keep them in place with little wooden skewers. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Put the fillets in a lightly buttered baking dish, season with salt and white pepper, then pour on the stock and vermouth. Cover the fish with some buttered baking parchment and place in the oven to poach gently for 5–6 minutes. Turn the fillets, then put them back in the oven for another 5–6 minutes. When the fish is just cooked, remove it from the oven and pour the cooking liquid into a saucepan. Cover the fish and set it aside to keep warm.</p>
			<p class="body">Boil the cooking liquid until it has reduced to a syrup. Add the cream and butter, whisking well until the liquid has emulsified into a creamy sauce. </p>
			<p class="body">Serve the sole beautifully garnished with the grapes, a few diced vegetables and a little sauce, with the rest of the sauce in a jug on the side. Alternatively, pour the sauce over the fish before serving and garnish with grapes. Good with some steamed potatoes and green vegetables.</p>
