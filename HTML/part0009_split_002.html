<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">What? You do not possess a fire pit large enough to roast an entire lamb? Or perhaps you don’t have the heart to run after a baby lamb, catch it and transform it into a kebab version of itself? Consider this alternate version. In France we call this a</em> ‘gigot de sept heures’<em class="calibre7">, or seven hour lamb.</em></p><p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">It really is a wonderfully fragrant way of cooking a leg of lamb. It’s effortless to prepare, amazing to eat and fantastic to serve to company because it can be forgotten in the oven where it will do nothing but become ever more delicious by the minute.</em></p><div id="c06s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre27"><b class="calibre4">Lamb Mechoui</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre27"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for six to eight servings,</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre27"><b class="calibre4">depending on the size of the leg of lamb</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1 large leg of lamb with bone in</p><p class="calibre6">5 peeled shallots</p><p class="calibre6">10 unpeeled cloves of garlic</p><p class="calibre6">Olive oil</p><p class="calibre6">1 tsp coriander seeds</p><p class="calibre6">Salt, pepper</p><p class="calibre6">1 teaspoon red paper flakes to add some kick</p><p class="calibre6">Optional: Root vegetable medley, peeled baby turnips, carrots, baby beets, peeled (I kept the skins on for the picture to achieve a more rustic look)</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre27"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">I wish I owned a Le Creuset French cast iron pan but never wanted one badly enough to splurge. Mine is a cheap imitation and works perfectly well. All you really need is an ovenproof casserole with a tight lid. The size of the leg of lamb will dictate the size of the pan. If you’re cooking for a crowd you can use any pan you would use to cook a turkey and cover the dish tightly with heavy-duty tin foil before placing it in the oven. Because my lid is not tight (sounds like I’m making a comment about myself here) I make a simple dough using 2 cups of flour and a bit of water and I seal it all around the lid, making it airtight. When the time comes to serve I place the dish on the table and break it at the table, which is pretty much awesome. The dough will look like bread but after baking for hours it will be hard as rock and inedible. You might need one of those cute girly hammers to break it.</p><p class="calibre6">1- Heat the olive oil, then add the leg of lamb, turning it so that it browns on all sides.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Add the peeled, quartered shallots and the coriander seeds.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Add the unpeeled cloves of garlic.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Add salt and pepper to taste.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Cover the pan, place it in the oven at a temperature of 300°F degrees (150°C ).</p><p class="calibre6">6- Cook for 3 hours at that temperature.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Lower the heat to 250°C and cook for another 2 to 4 hours. As long as the lid is sealed tight there will be no loss of juice and the lamb will not get dry, it will only get more delicious. If you feel your lid is not tight (hee hee) add broth or water mid-way though cooking. This is the point when I add root vegetables to the pot and make my dough seal. Cook an additional 2 to 4 hours as before.</p><p class="calibre6">8- Serve. I like to place the dish on the center of the table, family style. After showing off by breaking the dough, I give each person a few cloves of garlic. Because the skin was not removed the garlic cloves have kept their shape as they cooked in the lamb’s juices. On the plate they become miniature containers of garlic jam. Divine!</p><p class="calibre6">9- If you did not add root vegetables to the pot, in keeping with the North African theme, you can serve this lamb ‘<em class="calibre7">méchoui</em>’ with a vegetable couscous or a refreshing <em class="calibre7">taboulé</em>.</p></div></div></body></html>
