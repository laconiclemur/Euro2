<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">arroz con costra–valencia</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This baked rice dish is unusual in that it has an egg topping. Chicken drumsticks, spareribs, and sausages make it a hearty and flavorful meal in itself. You will need a</span> cazuela <span class="italic">or a wide casserole with which you can start cooking on the stove, then continue in the oven. Otherwise you can start in a saucepan and transfer to a baking dish (see Note).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">6 country-style pork spareribs or 6 thin pork loin chops</p>
<p class="qun">3 pork sausages</p>
<p class="qun">6 chicken drumsticks</p>
<p class="qun">4 cups beef or chicken stock (or 4 cups water plus 2 bouillon cubes)</p>
<p class="qun">2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="qun">1⅓ cups canned chickpeas, drained (optional)</p>
<p class="qun1">5 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a wide ovenproof casserole over medium heat. Add the spareribs or chops, sausages, and chicken and brown them, over medium-high heat, turning occasionally. Take out the sausages and ribs or chops as soon as they are lightly browned, but cook the drumsticks for 20 minutes, turning often.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, bring the stock (or water and bouillon cubes) to a boil in a saucepan.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the tomatoes to the casserole and season with salt and pepper and the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (or paprika); cook 5 minutes over medium heat. Stir in the rice and the chickpeas, if using, with a wooden spoon. Pour in the stock and return the sausages, cut in half, the spareribs or chops, and the drumsticks to the casserole, stirring to distribute the rice and meats evenly. Add salt, taking into consideration the saltiness of the stock. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat, without stirring, for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bake the casserole, uncovered, in a preheated 400°F oven for 15 minutes, or until the rice is almost tender.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Season the eggs with a little salt and pour evenly over the top of the rice. Bake for another 15 minutes, or until the eggs are firm.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> If you do not have a large casserole, brown the meats in a skillet, fry the tomatoes in a saucepan, add the stock and the rice, then pour into a large baking dish. Arrange the meats on top and continue as above.</p>
