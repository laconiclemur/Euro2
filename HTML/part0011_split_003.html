  <h3 class="h3a">Baked filled onions</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Onions are perfect for slow cooking – their flavour becomes delicate and subtle. They can be filled with all sorts of different ingredients; I love this combination of mortadella, walnuts and thyme, which I sometimes use as a stuffing for chicken. This dish can be eaten by itself, served with a green salad, or as an accompaniment to roast meat. It can be made in advance and reheated when needed.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 2–4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 large onions</p>

  <p class="ing1">115g/4oz mortadella, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz/¾ cup walnuts, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp finely chopped thyme leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 eggs, beaten</p>

  <p class="ing1">extra virgin olive oil, to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp dried breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing2">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para">Peel the onions and slice off the tops at about a third of the way down, then scoop out the cavities. Finely chop the scooped-out onion and combine with the mortadella, walnuts, Parmesan, thyme, some salt and pepper and the eggs; set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the onions in an ovenproof dish and sprinkle a little salt and pepper inside them. Fill each onion with the mortadella mixture, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs. Pour the stock into the bottom of the dish, cover with foil and bake in the oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
