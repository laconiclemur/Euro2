			<p class="rec-intro">As a young chef I worked in a charcuterie in Paris and this was one of my favourite terrines – both to make and to eat. Very French, very easy, this is great for a party and keeps well in the fridge for about ten days. </p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="serves">serves 12</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">900g good-quality green gammon leg meat, off the bone and preferably with some skin and fat</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ pig’s trotter, split </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">325ml dry white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 whole black peppercorns</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 juniper berries </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bunch of flatleaf parsley </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bunch of tarragon </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 sprig of thyme </p>
			<p class="for-the">Jelly</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 leaves of gelatine </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bunch of flatleaf parsley, chopped </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp tarragon vinegar </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">grating of nutmeg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Cut the gammon into big chunks of about 10cm and place them in a large saucepan of cold water with the trotter. Bring the water to the boil and cook for 3 minutes, then drain and rinse the meat.</p>
			<p class="body">Put back the gammon and trotter back into the rinsed pan and add the wine, peppercorns and juniper berries. Tie the parsley, tarragon and thyme together and add them to the pan. </p>
			<p class="body">Add enough water to cover the meat. Slowly bring the liquid to a very, very gentle simmer – barely a tremble – and continue to cook the meat for about 1½ hours, until tender. Skim often to remove any scum and excess fat. </p>
			<p class="body">Once the gammon is cooked, allow it to cool a little before removing it from the pan and setting it aside to drain. Keep the cooking liquid.</p>
			<p class="body">Pass the cooking liquid through a muslin cloth. You should have about 400ml but if there is too much, bring it to the boil and reduce. Soak the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water to soften, then remove and squeeze out the excess liquid. Add the gelatine to the hot stock and stir well to melt. </p>
			<p class="body">Cut the gammon into small bite-sized cubes and place them in a bowl. Leave some or all of the fat and skin, as it is delicious. </p>
			<p class="body">When the cooking liquid is semi-set and has the consistency of cream, add the chopped parsley, tarragon vinegar and nutmeg, season with black pepper and mix with the gammon. Pour all of this into a large glass bowl or terrine, cover and refrigerate overnight. </p>
			<p class="body">Turn the terrine out on to a plate to enjoy its full splendour or spoon out wedges to serve with plenty of toasted country style bread and mustard.</p>
