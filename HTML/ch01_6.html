<p class="author">by tyler coleman</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="stickup">I</span>s a 1971 Barolo from Giacomo Conterno the perfect wine pairing for Joan and Gianni’s Risotto alla Milanese? While I would relish the opportunity to try the two together, I certainly wouldn’t push back from the table in disgust if other wines were offered with the dish, such as a younger nebbiolo or an earthy red Burgundy. The fact is, when it comes to pairing food and wine, there’s often no one right answer.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, many diners think there is only one wine that they should have with a given dish. Generally, this is because they read somewhere or heard as much from someone in passing. But if it’s not available, the angst of finding a replacement wine often ends in frustration. And everyone knows that angst and fine food make for terrible dinner partners.</p>
<p class="indent">On the flip side of the precision of finding the perfect wine, others simply scoff at the notion of pairing wine and food. If they like only a big red Châteauneuf-du-Pape, for example, then they will have that with Maryland crab cakes or Chinese food, turning a deaf ear to the advice of oenophiles. It’s hard to argue against pairing the wines you like with the foods you like—indeed, a recent survey found that most wine in America is actually consumed away from food, so it’s not wrong to simply opt for the wine you like. Still, it’s not exactly pushing the gustatory envelope. Moreover, some pairings do bomb and you’d like to avoid them—and you’d hate for the sommelier to come storming out to your table the way Primo did in <span class="txit">Big Night</span> when a diner ordered pasta and potato dishes together.</p>
<p class="indent">So I suggest a middle ground, one that avoids the frustration of looking for the one perfect wine yet is more adventuresome than the “one wine fits all” approach of simply having the same wine for every meal. There are a few classic pairings that really hit the ball out of the park, such as: oysters and Muscadet; a pale, dry sherry and Marcona <a id="page_xxxi"/>almonds; roast chicken and a cru Beaujolais; port and Stilton; and on the more luxurious side, white truffles and Barolo or foie gras and Sauternes. But generally there are plenty of combinations that will work well no matter the meal.</p>
<p class="indent">The approach here suggests thinking about wine by style and then offers a style of wine that will work with a given dish from this cookbook. I make some specific picks for each style of wine at the end of this section. But first we need to discuss some generalities for success in pairing food and wine.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PAIRING</h3>
<p class="noindentb">Pairing wine and food is both an art and a science. Here are six simple suggestions:</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">1. Wines with higher acidity than the food really sing.</span></span> Squeezing a lemon with its bright acidity onto a fish filet enlivens the taste; the same is true with wines that have higher acidity. Wines with higher acidity pair magically with rich, creamy foods, fish dishes especially; they are incredibly versatile and that’s why they are often on my table and will be recommended a lot with these recipes. Some examples of these wines include: sauvignon blanc, champagne, Riesling, or Muscadet for whites, and Pinot Noir, Gamay, or sangiovese for reds. Dry rosés also have great acidity.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">2. Avoid power struggles.</span></span> If the dish is spicy, such as <a class="nounder" href="ach68.html#page_133">Angry Penne</a>, bow to its supremacy and serve a light wine; trying to outmuscle it with a 16 percent alcohol Zinfandel can only lead to unleashing the gustatory equivalent of a heavyweight title bout in your mouth. If you really want to serve a huge wine, try a lighter dish; the obverse also applies.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">3. Sweet tames spice.</span></span> Potent spices don’t feature too much in the recipes here, but as a general rule of thumb, having some gentle sweetness to the wine can moderate the spice.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">4. Tannins crave meat.</span></span> Tannins give red wine a chompy, dry bitterness—think oversteeped tea—that can be off-putting when a wine is young. However, those <a id="page_xxxii"/>same tannins provide a structure for aging, as with nebbiolo or Bordeaux, and complement the fat and protein of meat.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">5. With sweet wine and dessert, one is always a loser.</span></span> Similar to avoiding a power struggle between a big wine and a rich food, pairing a sweet wine and a sweet dessert will likely result in only one winner. A sweet wine will end up tasting less sweet, just as a dessert made with berries will taste bitter by contrast. Thus, with rare exceptions, it’s one or the other—either dessert or dessert wine, not both. Many ultrasweet wines actually pair well with savory foods, such as the classic pairing of port and Stilton.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">6. If it grows together, it goes together.</span></span> This saying comes from the local, seasonal food movement, but it is readily applicable to wine. Simply, regional foods pair well with regional wines. Think about mortadella and Lambrusco, both from Emilia-Romagna (the region around Bologna), which represent one of those classic pairings where the food and the wine improve each other. White truffles and Barolo certainly qualify, as do Serrano ham and Rioja and charcuterie with white wines from Alsace.</p>
<p class="indenta">Because wine pairing can cause undue anxiety, it’s good to have a wine that you can turn to in an emergency that has a high rate of versatility and success. That wine is champagne. Champagne is often saved for toasts and boat christenings, but it is actually remarkably food-friendly. If you’ve never had a bowl of popcorn (try popping it with coconut oil!) and a glass of champagne while watching your favorite movie, a tremendous treat awaits you. Moreover, it turns regular meals into celebratory occasions; it really is the host’s ace in the hole. Of course, the budget does not always allow champagne, but there are some very serviceable options from the world of sparkling wine, including cava and prosecco, the Spanish and Italian equivalent of French champagne.</p>
<p class="indent">One final topic worth noting is alcohol levels in wine. The past decade or two have seen a notable rise in alcohol levels in part because of global warming and also because winemakers have chosen to make their wines that way. While the calorie-conscious may love the efficiency of faster intoxication, when it comes to food, higher alcohol content <a id="page_xxxiii"/>can get in the way in part because you can have fewer glasses of it while remaining good at dinner conversation and in part because higher alcohol wines tend to have lower acidity, making them less agile food partners.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WINES HAVE STYLE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Open the wine list at a restaurant with a progressive wine program and you will often see wines sorted by flavor profile, not by grape or region. Organizing a list according to how each wine tastes in the glass makes sense given the restaurant setting, where wine is expressly meant to pair with food. Also, it is often more user-friendly to choose a wine based on flavor or style as opposed to going by grapes or regions, since some grape varieties have many wine guises. Take Riesling, for example. From the Clare Valley in Australia, the wines are bone-dry with a laserlike acidity. But from the Mosel, the wines have a little (or sometimes a lot) of residual sugar to balance the acidity and make the wines a little more round, or full-bodied. The same could be said of Pinot Noir. The grape naturally has a high acidity, but various renditions run the gamut of lean, to minerally earthy, to high alcohol and woody.</p>
<p class="indent">So that’s how I’ll be making the wine pairings in this book: by style. Generally, there are six styles, a light, medium, and full-bodied style for both whites and reds. There are also the discrete categories of sparkling, rosé, and dessert wines to cover. Let’s do the tour, starting with the whites.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Lighter-bodied whites:</span></span> With the decline in the popularity of oaky Chardonnay, this racy category that includes sauvignon blanc, Pinot Grigio, and dry Riesling has taken off. This category also includes “patio pounders” such as vinho verde, a simple choice for outdoor dining that lets the food really shine. The wines are mostly fruit-forward, have a lean acidity that make them food-friendly, and are unburdened by oak.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Middleweight whites:</span></span> These wines have a bit more structure and are more serious than simple quaffers. The structure that sets them apart is a mineral quality that’s reminiscent of wet stones. To taste the structure I am describing, consider the difference between a Chardonnay from somewhere like Australia as opposed to a Chablis, which is made <a id="page_xxxiv"/>from the Chardonnay grape. The Chablis is likely to have a more stony quality thanks to the cooler climate and the fact that the grape vines actually are grown in soils with chalk, limestone, and fossilized seashells. Try the same experiment with a New Zealand sauvignon blanc and a French Sancerre, which grow in similar soil to Chablis. Other examples of this category include some white Burgundies, Muscadet, or Pinot Gris.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Fuller-bodied whites:</span></span> The effect of fullness in a white wine can come from three things: sugar, oak, or alcohol. For the sugar, such as with Riesling or Gewürztraminer, the best examples are accompanied by an underlying acidity, which prevents the wines from feeling too heavy. Oak can be overdone if the wine sees a lot of new wood, which comes from putting the wine in new, small barrels for expensive wines or from putting the wood in the wine by way of dunking a giant bag of oak chips, as happens in lower-priced wines that want that oaky taste. More alcohol in the wine can make it seem fuller and, incidentally, sweeter. It takes a deft hand for the winemaker to pull off a fuller-bodied wine effectively. And in general, I prefer these wines with richer foods and usually in winter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Lighter-bodied reds:</span></span> With alluring fruit and palate-stimulating acidity, these lighter reds match a wide variety of dishes superbly. Lots of hugely enjoyable wines fall into this category, including some Pinot Noir, cru Beaujolais, Barbera, and Frappato to name a few. For people who prefer more full-throttle reds, they might seem like summer reds. But really their food-friendliness makes them irresistible all year-round. One summer twist is to serve them slightly chilled, as the low level of tannins can make them seem not astringent but rather refreshing that way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Middleweight reds:</span></span>This category has a bit more structure, including—you got it—more minerality as with their white counterparts. In this regard, Cabernet Franc from the Loire and Dolcetto are in line with the leaner style of reds. An unoaked Malbec lies right in the middle, while a California Merlot or oaked Malbec would be a plusher style middleweight.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Fuller-bodied reds:</span></span> This is where the thunder rolls, the dark berry notes dominate, and oak or alcohol may be (overtly) present. These are the sort of “hedonistic fruit bombs” championed by some critics that can impress through a sheer show of force rather than subtlety. These include big Zinfandels, some Cabernet Sauvignons, southern Rhône wines, and many Australian shirazes. But this category isn’t all over-the-top; there are <a id="page_xxxv"/>northern Rhône syrahs with alluring black olive notes and some Zinfandels that have a pleasant spiciness, as do some Nero d’Avola. However, tread carefully when selecting a wine in this category, as some drink more like cocktails than companions for food.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Sparkling:</span></span> Champagne is the best known sparkling wine. The cool climate and chalky soil of this region about a hundred miles to the east of Paris produce nervy, distinctive wines, often worthy of contemplation, as they are more food-friendly than commonly thought. Other sparkling wines include the more carefree prosecco from Italy, with its smaller, more gentle bubbles, or cava from Spain, as well as sparkling wine from California.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Dry rosé:</span></span> Drinking the pink has become increasingly popular since the days when white Zinfandel was in vogue, but cloying, sweet wines have marred the reputation of dry rosés in the Provençal style. In the past few years, they have found a more receptive audience and have exploded in popularity. The good acidity and food-friendliness of this carefree wine also adds to the appeal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="txbf">Dessert wines:</span></span> Ranging from ice wine to botrytized wines to fortified wines such as port, dessert wines still have a place at the table, even if people are drinking less of them. They go well with savory foods or in place of dessert, rather than with it. Madeira is the most exciting new dessert wine—and it’s only four hundred years old. But it has become invigorated in the American market because the deliciously aromatic drink has a complexity that makes it suitable for pairing with dishes that precede the cheese course.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_xxxvi"/>GETTING THE MOST OUT OF WINE</h3>
<p class="noindentb">Finally, here are three quick tips for getting the most out of the wine you drink, whichever style works for you.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="font2">1</span>. <span class="txbf">Have some good stemware.</span></span> Sure, what matters most is the wine <span class="txit">in</span> the glass, not the glass itself. And countless dinners have been merrily consumed in Italy with those squat, straight glasses for ages. But having a good crystal glass that tapers at the top can enhance the wine experience by concentrating the aromas. The glasses are not expensive; you can find a good, impact-resistant one for ten dollars. Splurge. And remember, you don’t need to burden your cabinets with a different one for each grape variety from each region, as some are marketed.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="font2">2</span>. <span class="txbf">Find a good shop.</span></span> Bacchus delights in you having a relationship with a good local wine merchant. Go in, tell them the recipe in this book you are making and the suggested wine style, and see what they come up with. Take it home, try it. Go back and tell the same clerk what you thought of it. Or go in with a budget and ask for a few wines in various styles, keep the receipt near the corkscrew, and on it note your reactions to the wines. Take the receipt back to the store. This interpersonal feedback loop is where good local merchants excel, making them worth their weight in happily pulled corks.</p>
    <p class="noindentir"><span class="red"><span class="font2">3</span>. <span class="txbf">Chill a bottle in five minutes.</span></span> For those summer days or urgent needs for sparkling, keep a bucket on hand. Fill it with ice, then add some water, a good helping of salt (which lowers the freezing point of the water), and the wine bottle. Rotate or stir occasionally for best results.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SOME WINE PICKS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Whereas wine drinkers a generation ago suffered through limited wine selections (remember the prevalence of those straw-covered bottles of Chianti?), the amount and diversity of wines available today in America resembles a wine lover’s Nirvana. Wines from obscure <a id="page_xxxvii"/>grapes and previously unheralded regions, both domestic and foreign, stream into wine stores and restaurants. A wine store manager may have to choose which wines to stock from literally thousands of selections. In the United States the TTB (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau), which regulates wine labels, has seen wine label applications double over the past ten years, to more than 130,000 in 2011.</p>
