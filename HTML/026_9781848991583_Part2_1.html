<p class="normalw"><b>It is not easy to describe what we mean by “liberté” in cooking, especially for me, because I have been classically trained and there are boundaries I have been taught not to cross. But I have found myself trying more and more new ideas and techniques that improve the taste, the flavor, the texture and the lightness of dishes.</b></p>

But, despite any changes, it is important to retain the essence of a dish, whatever you combine it with The best dishes need spontaneity, flexibility and that liberty of expression on the plate.</b></p>
