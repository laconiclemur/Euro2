<p class="h2title">December, or <span class="scalasans">Reputation</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">“S</span>hit,” Roger Alcaraz whispers to himself. “I am so fucked.” As he tries to portion pieces of chicken cartilage for the canapé, a journalist from <span class="txit">La Vanguardia</span> follows Roger’s every move. He has stacked pieces of wax paper, labeling each with a number and then a second “2” or a “5” that indicates the number of covers—and hence how many chunks of cartilage—for each table. Because of elBulli’s reputation and the fascination its chef holds in the public imagination, there are often television crews, reporters, film directors, photographers, and bloggers in the kitchen; it is without a doubt the most media-documented restaurant in history. The cooks are used to having to work around the cameras and extra bodies, just as they are used to feeling like the figures in a diorama every time a high school class comes in during mise to see the great man at work and gawk at his minions. But this is something different. The journalist is from a Catalan newspaper and is focusing his story on the Catalan stagiaires. Which means that he is focusing on Roger. A month earlier, chef de partie Toni Moraga was offered a job at Carles Abellán’s new Barcelona restaurant, Velódromo, starting immediately, and departed abruptly. Roger took over Starters II in his <a id="page_230"/>place. Just like Kim, he is now running his own station. But unlike Kim, who welcomed the chance to prove herself, Roger bears the pressure uncomfortably. Now he tries to continue prepping the canapés as he answers the reporter’s questions but finds it hard to focus on both things at the same time. It would be easy to blow off the reporter—<span class="txit">Can’t you see I’m working?—</span>but Ferran and the other chefs have told the stagiaires to respond willingly to journalists’ requests. So Roger tries again. Asked, “Where are you from?” he puts down the piece of cartilage to answer. “Where did you work before?” He stops stirring the ham reduction. “What is it like to work here?” He pauses in midpivot, his body tense, and looks around guiltily to see if anyone has noticed. Finding no one, he answers at length. The reporter thanks him and shakes his hand. Finally the interview is over. Roger glances nervously at the clock, then turns around to glare at the pile of unfinished canapés waiting just as he left them. He feels his blood pressure rise further. “Shit,” he whispers again. Is this what he signed up for?</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_231"/>Within the span of a single December morning, the season’s great question is resolved: the stagiaires learn who will be returning to elBulli. In an unusually high turnover, all the chefs de partie except Luis, who will be Mateu’s assistant in Pastry, have decided to move on. That leaves six slots to fill. They have been given to Roger, Gaël, Javi, and Jacobo, plus two other guys who were stagiaires in previous years. For Gaël, it will mean leaving his girlfriend behind and giving up his 3,000-euro-a-month salary in exchange for less than half that amount, but Denis Martin has promised to hold his job until he returns. Jacobo too feels as though he’s worked out a good arrangement; he’ll spend January through June working at Albert Adrià’s tapas bar Inopia and then return to haute cuisine at elBulli in the summer. Javi is a bit less enthusiastic—he, after all, is the one who doesn’t like elBulli’s food and told everyone he wasn’t interested in working there. But there’s a recession in Spain, and he needs a job. Of the four, it’s only Roger who has real doubts about what he’s getting himself into. Having done the job for the past two months, he knows firsthand just how nerve-wracking a position as chef de partie can be. For him, it’s the most stressful work he’s ever done.</p>
<p class="indent">The other stagiaires who submitted their names for consideration are disappointed. For Luke, who feels that he has done everything in his power to show elBulli just how hardworking and dedicated he is, the rejection comes as a blow. Marc tells him it’s because of his nationality: for years now, the restaurant has decided it isn’t worth the trouble or expense to help foreign cooks get their visas and therefore hires only from within the European Union. But Luke, who made such sacrifices to work at elBulli, had hoped that in his case the restaurant would make an exception. He had chosen Ferran as his guru, someone to whom he could dedicate himself wholly. But it turns out that the guru doesn’t want him as a disciple. “I give everything to them and work so, so hard, and it’s not enough,” Luke sighs. Instead, he will go back to Korea while he waits for a visa to return; Mugaritz, where he worked during the last off-season, has now promised him a contract. “Maybe it’s better,” Luke consoles himself. “Ferran was in the army, you know. I think that’s why <a id="page_232"/>elBulli is so military. But Mugaritz is more like a family.” Still, he can’t hide his disillusionment.</p>
<p class="indent">Gabriel feels a similar sense of disappointment. He not only wanted to return for the following year but had hoped to spend the off-season as a stagiaire in the Barcelona <span class="txit">taller</span>. “I would have done it for free,” he says plaintively. “All I asked for was a hundred euros a month to buy food.” The Brazilian is discouraged by this outcome, but Sunny, his sense of outrage now easily pricked after months of being held in check, fumes openly on Gabriel’s behalf. “Are they so cheap that they won’t pay a hundred euros a month to someone who has just spent six months working for them for free?” he demands, deaf to explanations of labor laws and personality fit.</p>
<p class="indent">Of all the hopefuls, Nico expresses the most anger. After all, he was tapped from the beginning as the assistant to Starters I, a sign, everyone said, of his superior skills. He watched as Kim was promoted ahead of him, and later spent a crushingly dull six weeks doing spherification. He was ambitious and volunteered ideas—complete with diagrams—for new dishes. He worked hard. And Marc and the others made it seem that he had a chance. What happened?</p>
<p class="indent">Nico doesn’t realize it, but up to the end he was being tested. The chefs realize he has strong skills and that he can work hard. But they have seen some of his flare-ups and know that he can lose his temper. They watched as Kim sometimes had to prod him to stop tinkering and get out his orders. For that reason, they postponed making a decision about him—they wanted to see which side of the balance he would come down on. “It comes down to attitude,” Marc explains. Apparently Nico’s isn’t good enough. A former stagiaire named Ivan is given the job; he returns two weeks before the end of the season to train for next year. No one told Nico he was coming. To add to the insult, once Ivan is in the kitchen, Nico is asked to train him.</p>
<p class="indent">Is Ivan a better cook than Nico? It doesn’t really matter. If best means the most talented, the restaurant doesn’t necessarily hire the best cooks. If it did, it would be willing to endure the extra hassle and paperwork necessary to take on non-EU workers such as Kim and Luke, who have <a id="page_233"/>so clearly proven themselves. But the restaurant does not really consider a cook’s palate, or whether she knows how to combine flavors well, or how strong his skills are, or even how hard she works because it does not need to. There is so much talent concentrated at the very top, and the system those talented chefs have created for production is so tightly controlled, that as long as the lower levels simply do what they’re told, the kitchen more or less runs itself. ElBulli is a little like the old theological construct of the clockmaker God: create all the conditions for life on Earth, wind it up, then stand back and let it run. Still, it comes as a revelation to the stagiaires that the reputation of the best restaurant in the world does not rest on the talent of all of its cooks, only its top ones.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">It is during one of the last days of December that the <span class="txit">Vanguardia</span> reporter and his photographer show up. The same day, about half a dozen people working for ONCE, Spain’s national organization for the blind, are also in the restaurant, shooting an ad campaign in which Ferran will star. The ads will run both on television and in print, so there are cameras and lights all over the place, a director trying to track down his assistant, and a woman on at least two cell phones at once who has transformed the table just outside the dining room into a kind of command center. A mild-mannered professor of organizational management from Argentina is also on site, conducting research on how elBulli structures its staff so as to foster creativity. In other words, it is a normal day at elBulli.</p>
<p class="indent">When Ferran first began cooking professionally, the age of the celebrity chef had not yet dawned. Certainly there were chefs who were known and revered—Paul Bocuse had launched a brand of sorts from his home base in Lyon, and Ferran himself worshiped Michel Guérard—but the modern incarnation of the chef as superstar still lay in the future. In fact, it would take another decade before anyone began to refer to “celebrity chefs,” and even then the phrase had a slightly oxymoronic ring to it. As late as 1992, when Wolfgang Puck opened an outpost of his buzzy Los Angeles restaurant Spago in the culinary desert that was Las Vegas, everyone thought he was crazy. Crazy too the cable <a id="page_234"/>channel (today’s Food Network) that launched a few months later in the remarkable belief that audiences would watch twenty-four hours a day of food programming. The same word would also apply across the ocean, to a brash chef named Marco Pierre White, who by 1993 had not only become the youngest to earn three Michelin stars but had also earned another kind of reputation. “Those stories you heard about him, about how he would be shagging someone’s wife upstairs while her husband was eating in the dining room downstairs,” says Jay Rayner, a restaurant critic for the British newspaper <span class="txit">The Observer</span>. “That was the start of the rock star chef.”</p>
<p class="indent">Twenty years later, the realm of the chef has expanded exponentially. Television shows, food festivals, outposts in Vegas and Tokyo and Dubai, cookbooks, spaghetti sauce labels, cutlery—even shoes and toothpaste—bear the names of some of the best chefs in the world; all this is part of the profession today. Chefs have become both brands and celebrities, to be sought equally by manufacturers eager to hawk their latest products and by fans (call them groupies) eager to track everything from a cook’s latest dish to his latest failed love affair. In the process, the profession has changed tremendously, until it is almost unrecognizable to those who started in it just ten or fifteen years ago.</p>
<p class="indent">Of all the chefs in the world, perhaps none is as famous as Ferran. When he speaks about his latest dishes at chefs’ conferences, people in the always-packed auditorium rise to their feet and cheer as if he were Mick Jagger. In his office, a wall twenty feet long is plastered with the magazine covers he has graced, and folding library stacks hold all the other stories written about him. He—or, better put, his effigy—makes a regular appearance on a satirical show on Spanish television in which public figures are played by puppets and gently mocked. When he makes an announcement about the future of his restaurant, every major media outlet in the world covers the news. He has achieved all of this without ever starring in a television show or opening any restaurants besides elBulli. But in order to keep his restaurant afloat—like most three-stars it loses money—he takes on lectures, sponsorships, and other paid gigs that, in turn, only spread his fame. He has served as a consultant for a <a id="page_235"/>Spanish fast-food chain called Fast Good and one of the largest hotel chains in the country, NH. He has his own line of dishware, called Faces, and markets the Xantana and agar-agar used in the restaurant under the brand Texturas. He has hawked Lavazza coffee, Lays potato chips, and Pikolin mattresses.</p>
<p class="indent">And seemingly each year a new film or book about the restaurant comes out. In 2008, it was the coffee-table book <span class="txit">A Day at elBulli</span> (list price: 40 euros); in 2009, it was an eight-hour documentary for Spanish television on the history of the restaurant. Nor has he contented himself with the by now conventional ways of augmenting his reputation; as in everything else he does, Ferran is pushing even further the boundaries of the chef as public figure. In 2009, he was named the new face of a major Spanish tourism campaign and engaged in negotiations with a minor Middle Eastern country to launch a gastronomic campus there.</p>
<p class="indent">But perhaps the clearest sign of his fame is the stack of requests that each day, David López and Pol Perelló lay on his table in the kitchen. A woman sends a handwritten letter, begging Ferran to find a place in the kitchen for her son, who adores him (he invites the boy to visit for a day). Another fan writes to request a discarded chef’s jacket. Every day also brings a flood of offers: to speak at a conference in Shanghai, to open a restaurant in Dubai. A law firm in Alicante, having heard about his “ecological shark fin,” wonders if he has considered patenting the invention and requests a meeting. A publisher who sent Ferran an unsolicited book writes back to complain that that the chef hasn’t acknowledged receipt. “In all my years of publishing the only person who never thanked me was Mother Teresa,” the publisher writes in a tone of barely contained outrage. “And that’s because she was dead by the time the volume reached her.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">To the great amusement of Oriol and Eduard, Roger Alcaraz’s parents are goat farmers. Early in the season, he brought in samples of the cheese and yogurt his family makes on their farm in the Pyrenees, and although the two chefs appreciated the product, they appreciated the <a id="page_236"/>humor even more, since “goat” in Spanish has all kinds of connotations, from asshole (<span class="txit">cabrón,</span> or “big goat”) to cuckold (<span class="txit">poner cuernos,</span> or “to hang horns on”) to hick (<span class="txit">cabrero,</span> or “goat farmer”). “Did you know that Roger’s parents are <span class="txit">cabreros</span>?” Oriol would ask innocently. “No really,” he would say, and then hold up a log of goat cheese as proof.</p>
<p class="indent">Twenty-three years old, with thick, curly brown hair and sideburns that reach nearly to his jaw, Roger looks as though he has heard it before. He was a teenager when his parents decided they had grown tired of the pressures of Barcelona life. In a reversal of the decades of demographic movement that had brought Spaniards from the countryside into the city, leaving abandoned villages all over rural Spain, Roger Alcaraz (senior) and Teresa Lagrava left their jobs—she was a secretary, he a water inspector for the city—and bought a goat farm high in the Pyrenees mountains, near the border with Andorra. The couple knew nothing about raising animals or making cheese, but a course organized through the local extension office helped resolve that. They started with sixty head and, within two years, were making a cheese that won a prize for the best in Cataluña. When the family left Barcelona to go live at the farm, young Roger took some ribbing from his friends. But much to his surprise, he found he liked living in the mountains and even liked tending the goats. He helped with the milking and in the winter fed the animals and cleaned out their barn. More than anything, he liked the quiet, the way he could walk out into the valley and feel utterly at peace.</p>
<p class="indent">When he was growing up, Roger’s family was never into food. They might have lived in one of the culinary capitals of the world, but they never ate out—“pizza, if we were lucky,” he says. His parents were terrible cooks. “Everything was bland, the spaghetti was always overcooked,” he recalls. “Nobody cared about it. At home, eating was about getting full, not about taste.” But one generation back, things had been different. Both his grandmothers were excellent cooks, specializing in the earthy casseroles—chicken with salsify and pigs’ feet with snails—that characterize traditional Catalan cuisine. One of his grandmothers sold vegetables in the Boqueria market. At week’s end, she would bring home the remnants, plus a nice rabbit or piece of beef for which she <a id="page_237"/>had swapped some tomatoes and lettuce. Standing in her kitchen as a boy, he would watch her go through the excruciating steps to a good casserole: slowly cooking down the tomatoes and onions into <span class="txit">sofregit,</span> slowly simmering a few bones and root vegetables into broth, frying the vegetables separately in oil, preparing the <span class="txit">picada</span>—a mix of nuts, garlic, and parsley that serves as both thickener and flavor booster—by hand in her mortar, and then mixing them all together and letting them come to the lazy simmer called <span class="txit">xup-xup</span> in Catalan. As tantalizing aromas rose from the dish, he remembers marveling at her patience.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">“Only ten services left,” Jorge says to Andrea one December morning as they share a ride up to work. They’ve just returned from their last four-day break, and they’re not the only ones counting. “Do you know where I’ll be exactly seventeen days from now?” Sunny taunts Gabriel. “Sitting in a café in Amsterdam.” “Sixty-five thousand,” Katie declares, having spent the morning doing calculations in her head. “That’s how many pieces of chocolate we’ve made so far.”</p>
<p class="indent">During this final sweep, the character of the restaurant changes once again. It’s as if somehow, with only ten services left to go, the kitchen has reverted to those first days, when everyone was moving with exaggerated speed but without a very clear sense of where they were going. Or maybe they’re just moving to keep warm. When the decision was made to stay open until December, no one apparently took into consideration that it’s cold in December. Really cold. And the restaurant, which is expertly constructed in order to keep the kitchen cool in summer, has absolutely no insulation to keep in warmth in winter. When they’re near the stove, the cooks are fine, but otherwise they’re freezing. Everyone has sweaters on under their chefs’ jackets, and the waiters are all running around in scarves and gloves as they set up the dining room. Oriol keeps going up to the stagiaires and telling them to feel his nipples—they’re hard from the cold.</p>
<p class="indent">With the exception of Terry, the returned stagiaire who is still working with the pedantic vigor that has earned him the ire of many <a id="page_238"/>of the current ones, all of the short-term cooks who cycled through in November are now gone. In their place are friends of the house, come for a few days’ visit to see what their buddy Ferran is up to. Each of them—and these are among the best chefs in Spain—will have a meal at the restaurant, but their real reason for coming is to go behind the scenes. Paco Roncero, of the two-star Terraza del Casino in Madrid, is there for a couple of days, lifting pot lids and watching with fascination the process for making the rose, which, upon eating, he too had thought was artichoke. Poking through the ingredients on the pass awaiting creativity, he opens one particularly unappealing <span class="txit">taper</span> and makes a face. “Every time I come here there’s a fish in water on the pass,” he says. Nandu Jubany, whose restaurant Can Jubany is famous for its game dishes, comes for dinner one night, then shows up the next with two recently shot wild hares as a thank-you. The start of service is less than five minutes away, but when Jubany offers to demonstrate how to skin them, Ferran, Oriol, Eduard, and a few others clear a space in the small kitchen and watch with as much fascination as if he’d just brought in a unicorn for butchering. Albert Adrià, who hasn’t been seen since his birthday dinner, is back in the kitchen too wearing his chef’s coat and experimenting with a new, show-stopping dessert that he plans to serve at a chefs’ gathering in January. Marc has also returned, keeping track of everyone’s coming and goings and overseeing the photo shoot for the year’s catalogue, which means not only that a corner of the kitchen has been given over to camera, photographer, photographer’s assistant, light kit, and backdrop but that a sample of every plate and bowl is now strewn across the kitchen table as Marc tests which setting best shows off each dish.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s chaos, in other words. Yet those disturbances are nothing compared with the two days when Juan Mari Arzak and Pedro Subijana come to visit. Both are three-star chefs from San Sebastián; together, they were responsible for first initiating the new Basque cuisine that would eventually give birth to Spain’s food revolution. Although older—Juan Mari is eighty; Pedro is sixty-two—they are two of Ferran’s dearest friends, the people he spends his days off with. Subijana is the more <a id="page_239"/>subdued of the pair. He confines himself largely to observing the kitchen from in front of the pass and uses the time to reflect on what elBulli has achieved. On the subject of the restaurant’s menu, for example, which he and Arzak will eat their way through that night, Subijana notes that he is envious. “A set menu allows you to be more organized and to control quality better because you always know exactly how much product you need. An à la carte menu can be more fun, because it’s always unpredictable, but the products won’t be as fresh. The problem is that ninety-nine percent of restaurants can’t have a set menu because the client rebels; a set menu is the chef saying ‘I know better than you what you should eat.’ ElBulli gets away with it because it’s elBulli.”</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="367" src="../images/f0239-01.jpg" width="550"/></p>
<p class="caption">Cigarette break after family meal (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent">If Subijana takes an intellectual approach to the kitchen, Arzak is all about the sensory experience. He strolls past the flattops with a camera strapped across his chef’s jacket like a jolly tourist, lifting pot lids, snapping photos, sticking in a spoon and tasting a sauce, constantly interrupting the cooks to ask what they’re doing. He jokes with the male <a id="page_240"/>stagiaires and tries to get the female ones to kiss him, complimenting them extravagantly on their beauty. He then ambles over to the table where Ferran and Pedro are working and reports on what he has discovered. Noticing that Ferran is going through a stack of photographs of his dishes posted online, Juan Mari begins to opine on what he calls “those damn bloggers.” “But what the fuck do they think they’re doing?” he asks indignantly. “Doesn’t anyone come to a restaurant just to eat anymore?” (Although Ferran shares Arzak’s disdain for bloggers, he also makes use of their work. Every so often, one of his staff will present him with a stack of photos downloaded from Flickr. The images are of dishes snapped at leading restaurants around the world. “This way I keep up with what everybody else is doing,” Ferran says. “Though I almost never find anything new.”) Then Juan Mari is up again because, out of the corner of his eye, he has noticed someone doing something interesting with a squash. “What is that thing?” he asks no one in particular. Eduard is ready with its name, an obscure variety of squash. “Comes from Austria, thirty euros a half kilo, the pata negra of squash,” he says, referring to the label given the best <span class="txit">jamón ibérico</span>. Overhearing the exchange, Subijana whistles in wonder—not at the squash but at Eduard. “You keep all that in the hard drive, huh?” he asks, tapping his temple. Eduard actually blushes.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence of the two great chefs makes everyone a little giddy. Most of the stagiaires have heard of Arzak and Subijana but have never met them or eaten in their restaurants; to be working in their presence is like having the Beatles drop by your high school band class. Even Oriol is excited. “They’re maestros,” he says. “To have them here, asking me questions, trying to learn from me, is incredible. I should be learning from them.” For his part, Ferran is amused by the uproar Arzak and Subijana cause. Watching Juan Mari interrogate a stagiaire about how to open a cockle, then insist on posing for a photo with him, Ferran chuckles. “It’s like the Marx Brothers in here.” That afternoon, when Diego comes out of Small Kitchen to announce that yes, <span class="txit">señores,</span> there are leftovers, he is wearing a huge Basque beret in honor of the guests.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_241"/>Maybe Roger’s memory of his grandmother helps explain what happened to the Alcaraz family, because the family who never used enough salt and boiled their pasta too long all ended up, in some form or another, in the food industry. There are his parents and their goat cheese, but his sister too has felt the call; she is in culinary school, studying to become a pastry chef. Roger’s own trajectory started when he was sixteen. Until then he had planned to become an engineer and was taking the necessary preparatory classes in high school. To earn a little extra cash, he took a summer job waiting tables at a friend’s restaurant and, for the first time, saw what food could be—how it could be more than just sustenance or homey comfort. The restaurant served typical Catalan restaurant food: fresh seafood, omelettes, sausages. But for the teenage Roger, one dish stood out. “It was just grilled sardines,” he recalls. “But the cook topped them with <span class="txit">requesón</span> [a kind of cottage cheese] and honey.” That dish, with its unlikely ingredients melding brine and sweetness, its combination of oily flesh, crisp skin, and creamy cheese, excited Roger. He asked his friend, the restaurant’s owner, if next year he could come back and work in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="indent">Before he knew it, he was enrolled in culinary school. He was an average student, but he managed to get an externship first at a restaurant on the island of Menorca and then at La Broche in Madrid. It was a tense time to be there. The restaurant’s founding chef, Sergi Arola, had just left the restaurant, and although by Michelin rules it was La Broche that had earned two Michelin stars and not Arola, few believed that the restaurant could maintain its ranking without its star chef. Roger’s boss was the new chef, Angel Palacios. Between the pressure of living up to the bar set by his predecessor and his appointment as the Spanish candidate for the Bocuse d’Or, Palacios could have created a horrible environment for his new young cook. But thrust into this pressure cooker, Roger thrived. It was his first exposure to avant-garde cuisine, and it turned out that he had a talent for the exacting work it required.</p>
<p class="indent">That year, La Broche lost both its stars. Roger didn’t care; he wanted <a id="page_242"/>to stay and work, but with his restaurant flailing Palacios couldn’t afford to keep him on. The chef suggested, however, that if Roger really wanted to get ahead in the profession, a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli would do the trick. He called Marc to recommend Roger personally.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">The arrival of famous chefs is not the only source of disruption at elBulli in December. Luca, who during November’s long break suffered a second bout of uncertainty about returning, has indeed seen out the season. But Iosu has suddenly disappeared. He calls Marc one night to tell him he isn’t feeling well and asks for a day off. A few minutes later, he calls back, asking this time to speak with Marc the following day. That morning, Marc comes in to find Iosu and his father waiting outside the restaurant’s back door. As Marc recalls it, Mr. Sainz told him that Iosu was suffering, that he felt stressed out all the time. He has made few friends within the group and has lost a lot of weight. There isn’t much time left in the season, but Iosu doesn’t want to see it out; he abruptly resigns. His father asks for a letter of recommendation for his son, but Marc declines. “What am I going to say, that we’re pleased with his work?”</p>
<p class="indent">Gaël, too, has suddenly departed. One afternoon, about halfway through mise, he was called to the phone at the restaurant. His mother was on the line, telling him that his eighty-five-year-old grandfather was near death and not expected to live more than a few more days. Oriol told him he could leave right away, but Gaël decided to work through service and waited until the following morning to return to Switzerland. His departure was so abrupt that he didn’t have time to say good-bye to many of his peers. It was also sudden enough to lead some of the stagiaires to speculate that Gaël was freaked out by being offered the chef de partie position and couldn’t figure out a way to decline it. Even Marc has his doubts; for a few days he wonders if they’ve made the right choice in selecting the young Swiss cook.</p>
<p class="indent">In these last few days, several of the stagiaires fall sick: Sunny, who says he’s never missed a day in any of his other jobs, is suddenly out <a id="page_243"/>with the flu. “I wouldn’t have stayed home if it weren’t the end of the season,” he says, “but I figured I deserved it.” César, too, after another run-in with Mateu, has been abruptly felled by illness. “At least that’s what we think,” says Katie, who notes that he’s been out for a couple of days. “But someone said they saw him walking around town.” With no creativity tests left to do, Andrea is biding her time during the day by typing up data for Oriol before preparing to work in the front of the house for the last five days of the season, a request she made months earlier because she wanted the chance to at least vicariously experience a meal at elBulli. Andrés Conde, Mateu’s assistant in Pastry, has finally returned to work after a motorcycle accident a few weeks earlier, but in his absence the pastry crew has learned to work without him, and there’s not much for him to do. Especially since Luis Arrufat, who has been floating in the main kitchen since returning to work in August, is now in Pastry, preparing for next year, when he will take over Andrés’s job. In order to let Jacobo practice running Cold Station, which is what he’ll be doing when he returns as chef de partie in June, Aitor has been moved to Starters I, where he is still working despite the agony caused by his kidney stones.</p>
<p class="indent">With him there, Kim has been moved back to the center table. She’s been away from it for five months now, and many of the tasks are new to her. But it doesn’t take more than a day before she is as bored as everyone else. The lentils in particular drive her crazy. “That has to be the worst project ever invented by Ferran Adrià,” she says. The roses also vex her; she can’t believe how much faster Sunny is at laying out the petals than she is. “I’m watching him, thinking, how is it possible he can be getting three done for every one I do? And I keep going faster and faster but I never catch up, and it’s making me more and more frustrated.” The other stagiaires watch this unspoken competition with amusement. Finally someone lets her in on the secret: Sunny is making small roses, and the petals, which are also smaller, are easier to mold. The larger petals, which is what she’s working with, are floppier and therefore take longer. To pass the excruciatingly slow time, she, Sunny, and Emma start a game to see who can get the others to laugh. “But it <a id="page_244"/>has to be real laughter—enough to get us into trouble with Eugeni,” she says. “Whoever wins, the other two have to name their next pet after.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">At elBulli, Roger was in heaven. Placed initially at the center table, he was one of the few stagiaires who was never bored with the work. He loved the emphasis on perfection, the unsurpassed organization, even the commitment to cleanliness; he had never seen a restaurant so dedicated to its own betterment. “They never stop trying to improve,” he said. It’s true that he could find the labor tedious—he disliked having to open the cockles in particular because you had to pay such close attention to ensure that each piece was good—but there were plenty of tasks that allowed him to let his thoughts wander. The chestnuts, for example, required only minimum attention, which meant he could spend the time peeling them daydreaming about the bars he had gone to with his friends on their last day off or the cute girl with the bright pink hair working next to him.</p>
<p class="indent">That is how it started with Laia. They had been at elBulli only a few weeks when each started noticing the other across the center table. Their seats were assigned, so they didn’t get to sit next to each other at family meal, but afterward, when both would run outside for a cigarette, they increasingly found themselves hanging out near each other. Finally, one night at L’Hort, it became clear that they were interested in each other. They’ve been together ever since. Even once she left the restaurant and returned to culinary school, they saw each other on his days off.</p>
<p class="indent">But romance wasn’t the only reason Roger was happy at elBulli. He felt as though his efforts were being noticed; that because he worked really hard, he was beginning to stand out from the pack. He didn’t have a relationship with Ferran (“He seems pretty distant and focused on his own thing,” Roger said. “I’ve never heard him ask anyone, ‘How was your weekend?’”), but Eduard and Oriol had complimented him on occasion, and even Eugeni was coming around. “At first it seemed like he would just get in your face for the sake of it,” he says. “But then I realized that he has to be on top of everyone all the time and that <a id="page_245"/>he’s in charge of family meal, too. So I respect him.” The feeling was apparently mutual; in August, Eugeni named Roger as his assistant. The job entailed preparing the tasks for center table—pulling out the right knives or scissors, bringing out the product, thinking ahead to the next job so that everything would be ready by the time the stagiaires had completed the previous one. There was a reason for everything, he learned. Sergio had to have the Parmesan obulatos earlier in the day because they needed time to dry. The rabbit brains could be done whenever, but the chestnuts had to be peeled in time for them to be roasted and cooled. As he mastered the rhythms of the center table, he felt skilled and competent. Of course, he still made mistakes: one day he peeled a dozen lemons as instructed, only to discover that the skins were supposed to be sliced into long, spaghettilike threads, rather than the short, irregular strips he had cut. Eduard used him as an example: “This,” he announced to the whole kitchen, “is why you always bring your work to one of us for approval. These were just lemons, so it doesn’t matter, but imagine if they had been lobsters.” But it happened only once; all in all, Roger felt that he was becoming known among the chefs as a stagiaire they could rely on.</p>
<p class="indent">And then something terrible happened to ruin all that. He got promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">“Someone’s stolen my notebook!” Andrea whispers urgently to Oriol, her face pale with distress.</p>
<p class="indent">“What? Are you sure?” Oriol knows exactly what notebook she’s talking about.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, I’m sure. I know where I left it, and now it’s gone!”</p>
<p class="indent">To Andrea, this is a catastrophe of unprecedented dimensions. All season long, she has been carefully noting, in her clean, looping hand, the precise proportions of and instructions for the final versions of the dishes that make it onto the menu. Hers is not the official copy—Oriol takes notes too. But his are scribbled and more haphazard; he employs a shorthand that makes sense to him alone (which is okay, since he <a id="page_246"/>is also the primary reader). Unfamiliar with many of the techniques that Oriol takes for granted, Andrea’s notes are fuller, more exact. She uses her own version when it comes time to enter the recipes into the computer.</p>
<p class="indent">“Maybe someone moved it accidentally.” Oriol is reluctant to assign malice, but Andrea has no such compunctions. “I’m telling you, it was stolen!” she cries.</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea’s notebook has always been an object of longing for the other stagiaires. In it, after all, are the secrets of elBulli, the quantities and directions that are the expression of Adrià’s greatness. To have a copy of that would be to have the key to the hundreds of dishes he and Oriol have tested that year, well before they are published. A young cook could make his name with the recipes included in that notebook or pass off as his own the dishes that, because Ferran had deemed them less than “magic,” will never make it onto a menu or into the catalogue. He could even sell the thing. As the weeks have wound down, more and more cooks have asked if they could borrow it, just “to take some notes.” Javi has even asked if he could have it for a day and get it copied. Andrea always turns them down. “It’s my work,” she says. “And it’s taken me a lot of effort.”</p>
<p class="indent">Halfway through service one evening, Andrea puts the notebook upstairs in Oriol and Eduard’s room, on the desk where she will be entering its information into the computer. At the end of the night, she is changing to go home when she remembers she doesn’t have it with her. But when she enters Oriol’s room, it is gone. “It was stupid of me,” she says. “I knew that there were always cooks coming and going in there—Eduard complains that their room feels like a phone booth some times. But I didn’t think someone would actually take it.”</p>
<p class="indent">She runs to Oriol, feeling herself becoming more and more upset with every step. He tells her to calm down, go home, get some sleep. “It’s fine. It’s just some recipes,” he says.</p>
<p class="indent">Mateu is listening to the exchange, and jumps to Andrea’s defense. “No, it’s not fine,” he says understandingly. “It’s her work. It’s the whole season.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_247"/>Oriol pauses to consider Mateu’s words. “Okay, we’ll do whatever it takes. Don’t worry, we’ll find it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea is glad to be taken seriously, but she isn’t consoled. Someone has stolen it, so why would he or she give it back? She is convinced the notebook is gone for good.</p>
<p class="indent">The next day she arrives early at work early to search. Oriol tells her that she doesn’t have to do creativity that morning—she can just look for the notebook. At the staff meeting he is firm, urging whomever has taken it to come forward and telling the stagiaires that the restaurant considers the disappearance theft. But still, all through mise and family meal, there is no sign of it. It isn’t until halfway through service that night that Pablo Pavón, the chef de partie for Small Kitchen, comes up to Andrea with what she calls “a weird look on his face.” He hands her the notebook. “Diego found it in the bathroom,” he says. No one asks either Pavón or Diego about the incident, which bothers Andrea a bit; she thinks whoever took it should be punished. Asked later what had happened, Pavón says he doesn’t know who took it but that he wasn’t surprised by the turn of events. “This happens every year—someone thinks they’re going to re-create elBulli by taking the notebook and getting it Xeroxed,” he confides. “They don’t realize they’re just notes on paper.” No one communicates that to Andrea, however, and in the end she doesn’t press further.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">When Toni Moraga left to work at Velódromo, the chefs de cuisine didn’t have to debate who they wanted to take over Starters II. By now Roger had been working as Eugeni’s right-hand man for more than a month and had proven himself to be a hard worker. He had also worked service as Toni’s assistant, so he knew the dishes. Not all the other stagiaires understood the choice (“He’s so young,” said one), but that might have been jealousy talking. Early in September, Roger found himself with his own station to run.</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly his days, which had been so orderly and modulated, turned frantic. On a good day, Eduardo, one of the stagiaires from Mexico, would <a id="page_248"/>help him during mise. On those days, the two would crowd around their station, which was, in truth, nothing more than the cart pushed to the end of the Starters stove top. Together they roasted dozens of sweet potatoes for the gnocchi, scooping out the hot flesh and removing any fibrous strings before puréeing it in the Thermomix. They melted down the fat pared from legs of <span class="txit">jamón</span> for the canapé. They puréed the ginger to make the lemongrass sauce for the chicken canapé, a dish of which Roger was particularly fond. (“Where else in the world,” he wondered, “could they get you to eat a chicken bone?”) Sometimes they divided the labor for a while. And then, in the final minutes before the start of family meal, with the clock ticking down, they went down the list together to make sure that all their mise was done and all of it was in the right place.</p>
<p class="indent">On a bad day, Roger had to do all that by himself. Arriving in the morning, he never knew if it was going to be one of the days that was an unceasing sprint to the finish line of service or one of the days that was an unceasing sprint to the finish line with one leg tied to the other. All he knew was that he felt he was never on top of things, could never keep up. He tended to go through mise in a wrestler’s half crouch, always poised to move, his mouth open in concentration. He would season food with both hands, just to get the salt in faster, and had no idea, he would freely admit, of what was happening in other parts of the kitchen. The need for perfection drove him crazy. Things were already ridiculously tight, and one mistake—a bit too much salt in the lemongrass sauce, a cockle-flavored air that wasn’t stiff enough—meant throwing out the whole batch and starting over.</p>
<p class="indent">The most amazing thing to him was that he hadn’t realized it would be like this. He had stood by Toni’s side for months, always there during service and sometimes called upon, like Eduardo now, to help during mise. He had done exactly as Toni had told him, even occasionally noting the beads of sweat that would form on Toni’s ample forehead but attributing them to the heat of the flattop. “I didn’t know what it was like to be responsible for a station then, I was just doing what I was told,” he says. “But now I’m responsible for everything. If something goes wrong, it’s my fault.” There might have been forty-five other people <a id="page_249"/>in that kitchen, but Roger has learned that being a chef—even if it’s just a chef de partie—means ultimately being alone.</p>
<p class="indent">To help him prepare, he carries a list with him at all times, even outside the restaurant, so that he won’t forget anything he has to do the next day. Most days it functions as a kind of security blanket, making him focus as he writes down items, helping him feel that he’s on top of the day’s chores. But then there are the days he walks into the restaurant, thinking he’s got all the mise he needs prepared for that day’s sea cucumber dish, only to have Eduardo tell him that the <span class="txit">espardenyas</span> looked especially good that morning, so he’s added ten more.</p>
<p class="indent">Service, in comparison, is a breeze. “All I do during service is heat things up,” he says. “Except the <span class="txit">espardenya.</span> That I have to sear.” The leadership aspect—the ordering others around that was so vexing to Kim—is hardly an issue, despite the fact that it is his first time overseeing other people. “It was a little hard when Lucho was my assistant because we started at the same time. But Eduardo came later, so it’s easy to tell him what to do.” It’s true that he misses the camaraderie of the center table a bit, that he feels a little isolated. He remembers thinking how devastating it was when Eugeni would yell at him for forgetting to smell a clam or what a pain it was to have to muck around with those tiny sticks they used to clean the pig’s tails. Now those problems seem like nothing, he says. For everyone else, “things get easier and easier every day, but for me they just get harder.” Sleep isn’t even an escape. Almost every night, Roger has horrible dreams about the restaurant, in which he is always behind and nothing is ever done properly. “Look at me,” he says one morning, his hands shaking as he tries to grasp a coffee cup. “I’m a nervous wreck.”</p>
<p class="indent">When Roger originally learned that he was being offered a full-time position as chef de partie for 2010, he was excited. “To be able to say that you work—that they pay you to work—at the best restaurant in the world, that’s really something,” he says. But now he is having doubts. He would never back out of his commitment; the job is too good a launching pad for that. But he might remake his vision for the future. He had thought that he wanted, if not exactly what Ferran has, at least something that <a id="page_250"/>would leave open the same possibilities—a restaurant that serves haute cuisine, that is acclaimed for its food, that gets attention. But now he has come to realize that the one essential feature that makes a chef renowned—that he stands out, alone, from the rest—is precisely what is making him miserable.</p>
<p class="indent">“I want to do something calm and relaxing,” he says. “I don’t want to go to bed anymore thinking about whether I have enough ham fat for the next day.” Maybe by the time he returns to elBulli in June, he will have learned how not to get so stressed out by the work. “But sometimes I wish I could go back to that first day, when we were all sitting at Si Us Plau,” he says wistfully. “If I could go back to the beginning, I wouldn’t have worked so hard to stand out. If I could have just done my job and stayed quietly on the center table, I would.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Few of the stagiaires will admit to longing for the kind of fame that Ferran has. “I just want to make people happy” is how Jacobo puts it, and his words are echoed, more or less exactly, by most of the apprentices. Nico is an exception. He dreams of one day owning a number of restaurants, all of them distinguished for their cuisine and all of them reinforcing the brand that his name will become. He dreams, in other words, of being a celebrity chef. “But not to be famous for fame’s sake—to be famous for how good a chef I am. Like Ferran.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s not always easy to maintain the distinction. Mario Batali may have initially risen to the forefront of the culinary scene for his delicious, updated take on authentic Italian cuisine, but he is at least as well known today for his vast restaurant empire, his television shows, his cookbooks, his friendships with the likes of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow and the musician Michael Stipe, and those damn orange shoes. Something similar has happened with David Chang; if chefs are today’s rock stars, few of them more closely fit the model than the thirty-three-year-old behind the extraordinarily popular Momofuku restaurants in New York. In the six years since opening his first, Chang has been accosted by autograph seekers while working out at the gym, read reports (all <a id="page_251"/>untrue) of restaurants he is supposedly opening in Seoul, Tokyo, and London, listened to Martha Stewart inquire on air about his love life, and had his underwear preferences publicized in <span class="txit">Vanity Fair</span>. In a tone equally bemused and distressed, he expresses amazement with it all. “Sometimes, I just look around and think, Holy shit, how did I become this guy?”</p>
<p class="indent">Chang got into cooking originally, he says, because it seemed like “the last honorable profession,” a job like shoemaking or glassblowing where quality and craftsmanship mattered. But these days, as he fends off investment offers from around the world and grapples with the ever-present question of whether to do his own television show, he wonders if he got it wrong. His health is suffering from the stress, and he hardly ever cooks anymore. He still cares about making delicious food, but now he sees his primary responsibility as taking care of the people who work for him, including helping them set up their own restaurants so that they, with any luck, can become famous too.</p>
<p class="indent">By all accounts, Ferran has managed his relationship with fame extraordinarily well. He lives modestly—“I’m not driving around in a Mercedes,” he likes to point out. Although he has endorsed products, he has escaped the accusation of selling out, perhaps because he’s never done a television show. He oversees a single restaurant and is there almost every night it is open. He can grow weary of the relentless barrage of requests for yet another interview and the constant demands on his time. Yet even now, with all those magazine covers and awards and invitations behind him, he still clearly enjoys the spotlight, especially when it opens new kinds of doors, such as the opportunity to teach at Harvard, participate in a prestigious art exhibition, or cook for the world leaders who gather for the semisecret Bilderberg meeting. Along with a number of other forward-minded celebrity chefs, he has been able to use his recognition to expand his role into a growing number of arenas—public policy, social welfare, environmental activism—not traditionally open to those who cook for a profession. Celebrity brings its own stresses, but for those who navigate its shoals well, Ferran suggests, it’s an exciting time to be a chef.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_252"/>The final days of the season witness a decline from what had been a gradual relaxation of standards to a relative free-for-all. On the penultimate day of service, Javier doesn’t show up until 4:30 <small>P.M.</small>, and no one even seems to notice. Everyone’s aprons and pants are filthy; no one can be bothered to do laundry at this point. Oriol gets whacked in the head when Nico rounds a corner with a pile of trays without saying <span class="txit">“Quemo.”</span> The restaurant’s gossip mill starts running overtime. Quiet, unassuming Mizuho, who already confessed to kissing César early in the season, is now rumored to have hooked up with Eugeni. “I think he’s cute,” she says. No one in the restaurant seems to know if a relationship between a stagiaire and a chef represents some kind of breach of employee relations. Instead, Oriol, who is by now staying nightly at Eugeni’s because of the cold and thus has an eyewitness view of the blossoming relationship, denies knowledge of it. “Who told you that?” he asks when queried. Something romantic seems to be going on between Begoña and Tato. They hardly seem to be hiding anything—at one point Tato swoops in to kiss her as he passes her in the small kitchen. The other stagiaires tease her mercilessly, sophisticated jokes along the lines of “Guess you don’t need to go to the staff party since you can have your own private celebration, huh?” Begoña hushes them. “A little respect, please.”</p>
<p class="indent">About ten days before the last service, a sheet is taped to the dressing room door. <small>SIGN UP FOR STAFF PARTY</small>, it reads, and describes both the location (a bar and restaurant in Empuriabrava, a few kilometers from Roses) and the contents (hors d’oeuvres; a choice of pork loin, steak, or calamari in their ink; flan, apple tart, or ice cream for dessert) of the final dinner. The party will begin at 10 <small>P.M.</small> on December 20, just a few hours after the end of elBulli’s last service, and, because the restaurant has a club upstairs, is expected to last late into the night. Some of the stagiaires begin excitedly to list their names before they notice the fine print: they have to pay for dinner. The cost is 27 euros a person.</p>
<p class="indent">The news provokes outrage in the dressing room. “I find it incredible that after six months of working for him for free, Ferran Adrià can’t <a id="page_253"/>cough up the money to buy us all dinner,” says one stagiaire, as he hurries to get into his chef’s jacket.</p>
<p class="indent">Aitor tries to defend the restaurant. “There are over seventy of us. At twenty-seven euros apiece? That’s nearly two thousand euros. That’s a lot of dough.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What? You think Ferran can’t afford it? Look at what he’s charging the clients!”</p>
<p class="indent">“It doesn’t matter how much it is. The fact is, we’ve been working for free for him. And he can’t buy one fucking dinner?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, we always knew he was cheap.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He’s not cheap, he’s running a business.”</p>
<p class="indent">And so it goes. Some talk of boycotting the party altogether: “Wouldn’t it be great if no one showed up?” Others fan the outrage with the rumor that Ferran usually does not attend but has decided to make an exception this year because the German documentary crew will be back filming and it’s a good chance for him to make a speech for the cameras. “It’s a photo op, in other words.” Kim and Daniel declare that they’re not going. “It’s insulting that they would charge us,” Daniel says. “Plus, after six months of working for free, we don’t have a spare twenty-seven euros apiece.” Gabriel, tears in his eyes, also says he can’t afford to go.</p>
<p class="indent">But later in the day, the list is nearly full.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">As she winds up her time at elBulli, Katie hasn’t worked out the details of her romantic future. She and Felix are still engaged, and she is flying to Los Angeles to meet him for Christmas; from there they will drive cross-country to Asheville, North Carolina. They will move into the same new house as her parents and begin planning the restaurant. But no date has been set for the wedding.</p>
<p class="indent">In the absence of a contract from elBulli, Luke has secured one from Mugaritz, but it won’t start until late in the spring of 2010—provided his visa comes through. Until then, he will go home in Korea to spend time with his mother and brother and to teach at a Seoul culinary school. He wants, he says, “to help spread avant-garde cuisine in my country.” <a id="page_254"/>Before, he thought that the class would focus solely on Ferran Adrià and what he had learned at elBulli. But with his idol gleaming a bit less brightly than before, he plans to include some of Andoni’s techniques as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea and her husband, Andrés, are also still waiting on their visas—Paco Pérez has yet to come through for them. Although the chef has promised them work when his restaurant reopens for its own season in March, he still hasn’t turned in the paperwork, and therefore they can’t legally remain in Spain past the end of the year. Andrea is distraught, both at the thought of moving to Asia—which now seems more likely—and at the thought of leaving Spain. “Andrés loves Asia, and I know that for him going there is like being in Spain is for me. But that doesn’t make it any easier,” she says one day after work. For the first time in a long time, she feels uncertain, and a little lost, about what the future holds. They will go back to Chicago for Christmas and see what happens from there.</p>
<p class="indent">When his grandfather died, Gaël calls Marc to say that he was ready to return. It is the proof Marc had been waiting for: now he knows that the grandfather story wasn’t a ruse and that Gaël really is dedicated to elBulli. By then, however, there are only two services left in the season, so Marc tells him not to worry. They will see each other next year.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, Hans Välimäki offers both Dan and Kim jobs at his restaurant in Helsinki. Dan is excited, but Kim keeps putting off the decision. And not just putting it off: she won’t even talk about it. “I’m kind of getting the message she doesn’t want to go there,” Dan admits. “But what am I going to do? Leave her to go work there on my own?” The two will end the season with no clear plans for their future, beyond spending the holidays with their families.</p>
<p class="indent">And Roger? He is so stressed out by the last few months that he has decided to retreat for at least part of the time before he returns to elBulli. “I’m going to go back to my family’s farm,” he says. “Maybe I’ll take a job with the village butcher. Someplace quiet and tranquil.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_255"/>The last service of the year is a lunchtime meal. That morning, Kim stops at the bakery to pick up bread. Knowing that the last few days were likely to be crazy, she and Dan had “done a week’s worth of mise,” as she puts it, for the meals they would eat when they got home from work. Today’s menu, on the last day of service, is sausage and peppers, which is why she needs the bread. Does that mean they’re really not going to the party that night? She says they still haven’t decided.</p>
<p class="indent">Service the night before had been rough. Two different servers dropped plates, and Ferran became furious. Rafael Ansón, the Royal Spanish Gastronomic Academy president, was back—that was his other tradition, to come at the end of the season as well as the start—and that increased the pressure as well. One table showed up about an hour late, which meant that no one left until 2 <small>A.M.</small> But here it is, 9 <small>A.M.</small> on a cloudy, chilly December 20, and the dressing room is raucous. Stripping off their jeans and sweaters as quickly as they can against the cold, the cooks prepare for their last day of work by making promises about how much they’re going to drink that night. Some of them convey this information in a weird, singsong voice. Yesterday Juli came into Small Kitchen and half sang something, and ever since, the cooks—first those in Small Kitchen and later everyone else—have been imitating it, transmitting even the most matter-of-fact information in an irritatingly cloying tune.</p>
<p class="indent">For the final meeting, the stagiaires take their regular places around the edge of the kitchen. Marc is waiting for them, ready to explain what the days after the restaurant’s close will be like. Yes, there’s a party tonight, but remember, he says, tomorrow is a workday, and we expect you here at 10 <small>A.M.</small> Both Monday and Tuesday, in fact, will be full days dedicated to cleaning the kitchen completely, breaking it down, and packing things up until next year. Eduard offers his own warning: “Let’s have fun tonight, but I don’t want anyone losing his head.”</p>
<p class="indent">Mise en place comes off without incident, though just to keep things interesting, an eight-person film crew is on site, shooting a feature film in the dining room, complete with 1940s period dress. Later, the director plans to turn the cameras on in the kitchen during service. Family meal that day is a hodgepodge of leftovers: potato salad, guacamole, roast <a id="page_256"/>chicken from two days ago. The air is humming. As they line up to receive their meal for the last time, someone says, “It smells like a party,” and a little cheer runs through the line. Today the stagiaires have only fifteen minutes to eat, but they interrupt the meal to take pictures of one another and horse around.</p>
<p class="indent">With food out of the way, Ferran calls everyone back into the kitchen. An immense cake has appeared on the bar, designed and delivered by the famous Barcelona <span class="txit">pastelería</span> Escribà. It has the name of every stagiaire—including Luke’s real one—piped on an individual piece of white chocolate. Ferran lights the candles, which shoot off flames like firecrackers, and everyone claps. He makes a little speech. “I want to thank you for all the effort and all the passion you have brought to your work. It’s people like you, the ones who have passed through this kitchen, that make elBulli what it is. I know working here is hard, but now you can say you worked in the place that changed the face of gastronomy.” With that, he passes the knife off to Eugeni, who cuts the cake into slices. The stagiaires file by to pick up a slice, looking for their white chocolate name tags. And then, as they are still wiping the crumbs from their faces, Eduard steps to the front of the kitchen. “Okay, <span class="txit">señores,</span> let’s begin.”</p>
<p class="indent">Uncharacteristically, no clients are waiting at the gate when the restaurant opens. For a long ten minutes, Ferran Adrià stands alone at the pass like a premonition, waiting. Finally the first table walks in. For this last service, all the stagiaires are more or less back in their regular places. Jacobo has called in sick, so Aitor has returned to the head of Cold Station. Kim, in turn, takes back the reins at Starters I, and because Ivan had left a few days earlier, Nico acts as her assistant. Roger is in his regular half crouch, ready to sprint through the marathon of service. In Pastry, Katie is again on the pass, the same place she was when she started the season. One of Luke’s wishes has come true, and he is working in <span class="txit">cuarto frio.</span> Emma never did get the chance to learn spherification, but she has taken over Luke’s place making yubas and Parmesan ravioli skins during mise and finds the work to be some consolation. “I don’t know what it is, maybe having responsibility for something, but I feel like I’m in a whole different restaurant.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_257"/>Each dish that goes over the pass that day marks the end of something. First to go are the <span class="txit">cañas,</span> the sugarcane cocktails that were elBulli’s signature opener from the first night of the 2009 season. As Diego inserts mint leaves into their ends and places the marinated sticks in their heap of ice, Pablo runs to his side and issues a sort of papal blessing. There are still a few sticks left in the bag, however, so Diego hands out <span class="txit">cañas</span> to everyone in the small kitchen, then rushes over to Sergio’s station to begin bartering with the rest. “I’ll give them to you if you give me some <span class="txit">ortiguillas</span>,” he says, then thinks again. “Or the mimetic peanuts.” By now Txema is finishing up the yubas on the soy plate. “Txema,” says Lorenzo, passing by, “those are the last three yubas of your life.” Roger rushes by, saying “<span class="txit">Quemo</span>. For the love of God, <span class="txit">quemo,</span>” but you get the sense that even he, at this point, is kidding. Sergio, who has a free moment, pokes his head into the small kitchen to sing, in that same annoying tune, “This is all over.” Txema responds in kind, “We already know that.”</p>
<p class="indent">The season’s signature dishes keep coming: now it’s the rose, which Begoña paints with tiny squares of silver; then it’s the lentils. “This is the fastest service ever,” says Kim as she rushes by on her way to the <span class="txit">plonge.</span> Before they know it, the first dishes in the game series are going out, and here, miraculously, is the meringue raft that Oriol couldn’t get right at the beginning of the season; it has been reincarnated as a bed for the woodcock. The kitchen fills with the scent of shaved truffles—a sign that the savory dishes are almost done. And sure enough, at 4:45, Small Kitchen starts breaking down. Andrea rushes by, dressed not in her chef’s whites but in the black servers’ jacket. Weeks earlier, she asked to work the front of the house in the hope of understanding what a dinner at elBulli was like for the diners. Now she is ecstatic. “It’s so amazing watching their faces as they try these new things,” she gushes. “I feel like I have a whole new understanding of what happens here. I feel like I finally get why it matters.” Listening to her enthusiasm, Kim can’t refrain from a wisecrack: “Just remember, Andrea. When you’re walking through the dining room with a tray in your hands?” She pauses for emphasis. “Don’t <span class="txit">quemo</span> the clients.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_258"/>By 5:45, the main kitchen is breaking down. There’s a carelessness to the staff now—Roger breaks a plate as he cleans his station, and Oriol somehow manages to cut himself, dripping blood all over his apron. Fifteen minutes later, Mateu sends out the first chocolate <span class="txit">pañuelos,</span> those crisp but undulating sheets that so vexed Katie. Now he tells her to keep focused—she’s been cleaning instead of finishing up the plating. A waiter rolls up the gold cloth on the main pass. Jacobo takes the leftover ice <span class="txit">estanques</span> out of the freezer, and Lorenzo and Mike take turns cracking them with a spoon. After several minutes in the walk-in, Kim staggers out. “I just ate half an ounce of caviar,” she says. But it is Eduard who signals the end with what may be the most shocking breach of self-imposed protocol yet: he begins to snack on some leftover pistachios. A server comes up and shakes his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The party goes off just as expected. From the moment it starts, the atmosphere is determinedly riotous, and almost everyone, including—or especially—Eduard and Oriol is quickly drunk. The <a id="page_259"/>German film crew is indeed there, but as guests—the only cameras are the ones the stagiaires themselves have brought. The women from the front of the house show up looking more voluptuous than anyone has ever seen them, decked out in high heels, skintight dresses, and lots of makeup. The Catalans break into song every few minutes, and the Americans try to retaliate with a hastily composed ditty built around an infelicitous mix of the word <span class="txit">quemo</span> and the Village People’s classic “YMCA.” No one notices the food. Ferran is there, dressed in a sports coat and slacks, a little awkward as he stands alone for much of the party—this might be his family, but they aren’t his friends. Nonsensical prizes are awarded, and a lot of drunken confessions of fraternal love are made. At 4 <small>A.M.</small>, the party is still going strong.</p>
<p class="indent">The next day, no one arrives at the restaurant on time, not even Oriol, who staggers in fifteen minutes late wearing a sweater and jeans. Mateu goes straight for the coffee machine and starts turning out <span class="txit">cortados</span>. Even Katie, normally so punctual, oversleeps and has to frantically call around Roses in the hopes of getting a ride (she still manages to get there before anyone else). The rest shuffle in over the next hour. Marc is there handing out certificates (“I get a lot of people calling to check references of people who say they worked here but haven’t,” he notes dryly). It is a bitterly cold, drizzly day, and as the stagiaires go to work scraping a season’s worth of grime from the smoke ducts, scrubbing down the refrigerators, and wrapping plates, the kitchen seems unrecognizably melancholy.</p>
<p class="indent">The night before, at the party, Ferran made another a speech. Once again, he thanked everyone for their efforts and then went through each of his permanent staff and thanked them personally. The front of house, he said, was the best in the world—something his clients were always telling him. He congratulated Eugeni on having proven himself through hard work and welcomed him to the ranks in which he considered the chefs de cuisine—as one of “ours,” as a permanent responsibility. Of Eduard he said, “This is the person whose labor is least rewarding, who has to be the bad guy so that I don’t. He fights every day so that we are all better.” Mateu came in for similar accolades as Ferran praised him for his masterful running of pastry that year and for his own, burgeoning <a id="page_260"/>creativity. Of Oriol he said, “I’ve had the great luck to work with two geniuses in my time: my brother Albert and Oriol Castro. People who have had the fortune to work with him will never be the same.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was a surprisingly intimate speech, tinged, no doubt, by Ferran’s knowledge of elBulli’s future. As he spoke, the stagiaires glanced around at one another. Clustered along the edges of the room, they were in much the same positions they took during the morning meetings, and it wasn’t hard to imagine their thoughts. They knew now who the strongest among them were, and each had his or her own opinion on who from their group would be the next Redzepi or Achatz. They had differing ideas of what the past six months had meant; most were grateful for the experience, though some, it is true, wished they had never come. But they knew that they too, now, were part of history. And if they felt as though they had come through a trial by fire, at least in that moment of wine-fueled bonhomie and congratulations, they felt they had triumphed.</p>
<p class="indent">And so, despite all the disappointments and exhaustion, they watched Ferran with the same rapt attention they had brought to that first meeting six months earlier. Turning away from his chefs, Adrià addressed the group at large, noting that they would all be hearing news about the restaurant at the end of January. He wanted to assure them now that any future changes detracted not one bit from the sacrifices they had made and the meaning of the work they had done. The changes, he promised, would all be made with the welfare of those who had fought for elBulli in mind. Then he said something that, in their discussions the next day about the party and in the weeks and months to come, the stagiaires would all remember, though few of them at the time understood what he meant. “Be brave,” he said looking around the table at their young faces. “Because the world is not for cowards.”</p>
