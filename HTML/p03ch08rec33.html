<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Galicia, Asturias, and Cantabria share similar fish stews and soups. Not long ago, all the men in the little fishing villages dotting the Atlantic coast went out to fish at night. The name</span> caldereta <span class="italic">comes from the pot,</span> caldera, <span class="italic">in which they cooked some of their catch on board their small boats. Nowadays fishermen take pizza along to sustain them, while their stews have developed into prestigious dishes. Serve this one with sliced and toasted country bread brushed with extra virgin olive oil.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 red or green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 to 5 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups dry white wine or oloroso sherry</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups water</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup Cognac or other brandy</p>
<p class="qun">14 ounces monkfish or other firm white fish fillets</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">7 ounces small scallops</p>
<p class="qun1">⅓ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onion and pepper in the oil in a large pan over low heat, stirring often, until soft. Stir in the garlic and cook for a minute or so, then add the tomatoes and cook for about 10 minutes, until reduced. Add the wine, water, sugar (to mitigate the sharpness of the wine), and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">Heat the brandy in a tiny saucepan. Carefully ignite it with a long match placed on the edge of the pan, and when the flames die down, pour it into the broth. Add the monkfish and cook for 8 minutes (other fish may take less time). Add the shrimp and scallops and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, turning them once, until the shrimp turn pink and the scallops are opaque.</p>
<p class="summary">Serve the soup sprinkled with the parsley and accompanied by toasted bread brushed with olive oil.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• For a slightly more substantial version of this stew from Galicia, peel 2 or 3 potatoes, cut them into small pieces or slices, and add them with the wine and water.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Put ½ chile pepper, seeded, into the broth and take it out when the broth is hot enough to your taste.</p>
