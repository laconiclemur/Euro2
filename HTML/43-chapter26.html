<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">A specialty in the province of Córdoba, salmorejo is essentially a thicker version of gazpacho <a href="42-chapter25.html#page_60"><span class="red">(see page 60)</span></a>. As in gazpacho, tomatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, and vinegar are three obligatory ingredients. But instead of being thinned with water, salmorejo has a significant amount more olive oil added as well as some bread puréed into the mixture to thicken it. Whereas gazpacho is a light, warm-weather favorite, <em>salmorejo</em> is eaten just about year-round.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     This is adapted from a generations-old recipe of the Núñez de Prado family, which has been producing olive oil on their single-family estate since 1795. The old mill and compound still dominate one side of the main square in Baena, a lovely, ancient town 38 miles/61 km southeast of Córdoba. After a morning in their olive groves during a recent harvest with one of the brothers who runs the company, we returned for a lunch prepared by the family cook that included this dish.</span></strong></p>
