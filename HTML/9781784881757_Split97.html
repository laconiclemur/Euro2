<p class="tx2"><b>This is the pasta recipe we always use and recommend (you can also find it in our Sicily book). It is: 1 egg to 100 g (3½oz/scant 1 cup) ‘00’ flour. Ideally, roll the pasta on a wooden surface, as the tiny particles of wood that project from the surface add texture, helping the pasta to absorb the sauce that will eventually coat it. Many Italians use a tablecloth for the same purpose. To save time, the pasta dough can be made in a food processor</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES ENOUGH PASTA FOR 6 AS A STARTER/4 AS A MAIN</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz/1⅔ cups) ‘00’ flour, plus a little extra if necessary</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 medium free-range eggs (preferably corn-fed, for colour)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Pour the flour into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the well. Using a table knife, gradually mix the flour into the eggs. Keep mixing the eggs and flour together until they form a thick paste.</p>
<p class="tx">Use the fingertips of one hand to incorporate the rest of the flour and form a ball of dough. Discard the dry little crumbs. The dough should form a soft but firm, flexible ball. If it is still sticking to the palm of your hand, add a little more flour - but be careful to stop adding flour as soon as it stops sticking. If it’s really dry and has many cracks, add a drop or two of water - do this in a bowl or the food processor.</p>
<p class="tx">Knead the pasta for 5–10 minutes, or until it springs back to the touch, the colour is uniform and, when cut open, the ball of dough is full of small air bubbles; this means you have kneaded it for long enough. Leave the pasta to rest for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 day, lightly dusted with flour and wrapped in cling film (plastic wrap) to prevent it from drying out while it rests.</p>
