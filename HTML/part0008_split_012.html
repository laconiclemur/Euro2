			<p class="rec-intro">This old-fashioned rice dessert is timeless in my view and is a long way away from the stodgy rice pudding that’s often passed off as a classic. There’s quite a bit of work involved but it’s well worth it.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 10–12</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">120g round pudding rice</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">360ml milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 vanilla pod, split</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="for-the">Crème anglaise</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 medium free-range egg yolks </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">375ml milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 gelatine leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250ml whipping cream, whipped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil, for greasing</p>
			<p class="for-the">dried Fruit</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250ml water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">180g mixed dried fruit (apricots, prunes, cherries, to taste)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp pistachio nuts</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">Kirsch, to taste</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">First soak the dried fruit. Make a sugar syrup by boiling 250ml of water with the 100g sugar, then add the fruit, pistachios and a splosh of Kirsch to taste. Leave for a couple of hours or overnight.</p>
			<p class="body">Put the rice in a pan and cover with plenty of water. Bring it to the boil and cook for 5 minutes, then drain. Tip the rice back into the pan with the milk, split vanilla pod and 50g of sugar. Simmer until all the liquid has been absorbed, then cover and leave to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the crème anglaise, whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Bring the milk to the boil, pour it on to the eggs and sugar and mix well. Return the mixture to the pan and cook gently until thickened. Do not let it boil or the eggs will scramble. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the gelatine in a dish of cold water to soften, then squeeze dry and add it to the hot crème anglaise. Pass the mixture through a sieve – set the vanilla pod aside to use as decoration if you like. When the crème is cool, add it to the rice mix, then fold in the whipped cream. </p>
			<p class="body">Lightly oil a mould such as 1.5-litre pudding basin. Pour in half the rice mixture, add some of the drained, soaked fruit (reserving the rest and the syrup), then cover with the remaining mixture. </p>
			<p class="body">Leave the pudding in the fridge to set overnight, then decorate with a few of the soaked fruits. Serve with the rest of the fruit and syrup.</p>
