    <p class="nonindent"><a id="page100"></a>Autumn in France means wild mushrooms (in particular, <em>cèpes—Boletus edulis</em>) and game. In Italy, it also means the glorious white truffle, which is best raw, and shaved generously at the moment of serving over a hot preparation, such as pasta and butter or chicken breasts rapidly sautéed in butter. It is not true, as some pretend, that the white truffle is better or less good than the black truffle—it is a divinity apart.</p>

    <p class="indent">From mid-September to just before Christmas (when fancies turn to <em>foie gras</em> and truffles), the French open markets far outdo the Dutch still-life painters in their festive display of game. A wild boar or deer is usually the centerpiece, and rows of pheasant, partridge and woodcock are strung around, punctuated by an occasional splash of wild-duck color. Hare, wild rabbit, garlands and piles of thrush, larks and “blackbirds” (unrelated to the American blackbird) enter into the composition, and, at this season, guinea fowl is often left in its feathers simply to keep it in the spirit of things.</p>

    <p class="indent">Unless hunters number among one’s family or friends, the problem of game in America is difficult, for that killed within the country may not be commercialized. Songbirds are protected by law so no recipes are given for the thrush, whose flesh is as lovely as its song (should one pass by the kitchen of an unscrupulous reader, it, like the woodcock, should be roasted rare, unemptied but for the gizzard, which may be replaced by a juniper berry).</p>

    <p class="indent">Gastronomic growing pains, at least among those of loyal academic inclination nourished on the literature of Brillat-Savarin and Grimod de la Reynière, inevitably include experiences with “high” game. I have, fifteen years later, a painfully vivid memory of an extremely well-seasoned pheasant that I dutifully stuffed with fresh truffles a <a id="page101"></a>day in advance to “permit all the fumes to intermingle.” When the creature was put to roast, the odors that escaped from the kitchen were unbelievable. Before coming to table, everyone was slightly uneasy, and after we all poked a bit at the food, queasiness took over. I doubt if any of my guests ate pheasant again that season. I did not. Knowledgeable analyses treating the difference between the aging of meat and putrefaction cannot change the fact that a dead animal when hung for several weeks is rotten. I do not suggest that one eat the thing while still in the throes of rigor mortis. The flesh must be somewhat aged, just as any other meat, or it will be dry, tough and tasteless.</p>

    <p class="indent">Any bird that has been badly damaged by gunshot, particularly in the intestinal region, should be plumed and cleaned immediately. In other cases, a pheasant will be much improved if hung for about four days (a partridge for three days) in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place. These birds should be plumed, cleaned and dressed only shortly before being put to use, although, dressed, they may be kept in the refrigerator for a day or so without suffering. Wild duck and quail are at their best when eaten the day after having been killed or, at least, freshly cleaned and dressed immediately and kept refrigerated for only a short time.</p>

    <p class="indent">Venison should be hung, whole, for from five days to a week. If cut up when freshly killed, the unskinned legs may still be hung, providing the open flesh is protected from contact with air and insects (rubbing with oil and covering with plastic wrap should do the trick—I have never had the opportunity to try it). The hind legs and saddle of young deer are best roasted slightly rare, unmarinated—or, at most, marinated for only a few hours in nothing more than a bit of white wine, olive oil and a pinch of herbs. The remaining parts may be prepared in identically the same way as <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c31_r1.htm#page413"><em>Daube à la Provençale</em></a> or <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c14_r1.htm#page239"><em>Boeuf à la Bourguignonne</em></a>. The last method is incorrectly called <em>civet</em>.</p>
