<p class="author1"><span class="txit">antipasto di cannellini</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This dish is great served as an antipasto along with several other hors d’oeuvres—a selection of olives, roasted peppers, soppressata, and Parmesan, or goat’s or sheep’s milk cheese—or as a lunch dish accompanied by a tossed green salad. Our favorite variation is the shrimp, presented on a bed of lettuce with a slice of focaccia on the side.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>

<p class="noindenta">In a serving bowl, toss the beans with the olive oil and red onions. Remove the rosemary leaves from the stems and add to the beans. Toss, then add the vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Toss again before adding the basil. Just before serving, toss the beans once more and test for seasoning.</p>
