<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is an Easter sweet from the Costa del Azahar (the Orange Blossom Coast) of Valencia, made with sweet orange-fleshed pumpkin. It looks like a pyramid spiked with almonds and has a soft moist texture and an unusual flavor. If you love pumpkin, you will love</span> arnadí, <span class="italic">but it will depend on the taste of the pumpkin. You can use other types of squash. Andresito (see page 534) had lots of huge pumpkins growing in his garden. This is his recipe. He sometimes mixes some boiled and mashed sweet potatoes (</span>boniato<span class="italic">) with the pumpkin.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8 TO 10</span></p>
<p class="qun">A 2-pound slice of orange-fleshed pumpkin (or 1½ pounds cleaned pumpkin or butternut squash, without peel, seeds, or stringy bits)</p>
<p class="qun">About 1¼ cups sugar, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups ground almonds</p>
<p class="qun">2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup blanched whole almonds</p>
<p class="qun1">2 to 3 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">To prepare the pumpkin, if necessary, scrape away the seeds or stringy bits. The rind is thin but very hard. It is more easily removed if you first cut the slices into large chunks, then lay the chunks on the cutting board, and cut it away, pressing down with force with a large heavy knife.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cut the pumpkin flesh into 1¼- to 1½-inch pieces. Put them in a large saucepan with 1 cup water and cook, tightly covered, so that they steam over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until the flesh is soft. (Check to make sure that all the water has not evaporated before it is soft, and add a little if necessary.) Drain and mash with a potato masher.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Return to the pan and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar (the amount depends on the sweetness of the pumpkin), then continue to cook, stirring often and making sure that the puree does not burn, until nearly all the moisture has evaporated. This can take 15 to 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the ground almonds, eggs, lemon zest, and cinnamon and mix very well. Shape the pumpkin and almond paste into a pyramid in a shallow baking dish. Stick the blanched almonds half in on their pointed ends in lines down the sides. Dust the whole thing with confectioners’ sugar. Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 50 minutes. Let it cool, and serve at room temperature.</p>
