			<p class="rec-intro">The French love soups or <span class="italic">potages</span> and each region, even each town in some parts, has its own version of the classics. Puy lentil soup is delicious on its own with just a drizzle of cream and fried croutons, but to make it even more special I like to make this soup with game stock and serve it with little quenelles of pheasant. It’s best to use a cock pheasant, as hens are for roasting and would be wasted for this recipe. Cock birds tend to be tougher but cheaper.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 cock pheasant</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range egg white</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">360ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">freshly grated nutmeg </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 onion, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 carrot, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 sprig of thyme </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 bay leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 litres water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">80g smoked streaky bacon, sliced very thin (keep any trimmings) </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g puy lentils, washed</p>

			<p class="body">Remove the breasts from the pheasant and trim off any skin and sinew. Place the breasts in a blender with the egg white and blitz until smooth. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl set over ice, then beat in 240ml of the cream. Season with salt, pepper and a grating of nutmeg, then set aside.</p>
			<p class="body">Chop up the legs and carcass of the pheasant. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan, add the pheasant bones and fry until they are just starting to caramelise. Add the onion, carrot, thyme and bay leaves to the pan, cook for 5 minutes, then cover with 3 litres of cold water and add any bacon trimmings. Simmer for an hour, then pass the stock through a sieve. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the lentils into a clean pan, add 2 litres of the pheasant stock and simmer until cooked. Remove a few spoonfuls of lentils and set them aside to use as a garnish, then blitz the rest of the soup with the remaining cream until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat the remaining stock in a pan. Shape the pheasant breast mixture into neat quenelles (egg-shaped spoonfuls), add them to the stock, a few at a time, and poach for 3 minutes. Grill the bacon slices until crisp.</p>
			<p class="body">To serve, place some cooked lentils in each bowl, add a couple of pheasant quenelles and a slice of crispy bacon, then pour in some hot soup. </p>
