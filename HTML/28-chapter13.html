<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Ships returning to Spanish ports from the New World in the sixteenth century unloaded many new products—from peppers to pumpkins to chocolate. Chocolate was almost immediately popular (unlike tomatoes, which took time to catch on), and Spaniards consumed it in a variety of ways. (<a href="215-chapter156.html#page_306"><span class="red">See page 306</span></a> for hot Spanish-style drinking chocolate.) Today, some cooks still occasionally treat chocolate like a spice and crush a piece with nuts. In this dish, dark chocolate forms part of the picada that is stirred into the lentils toward the end of cooking to add body as well as a subtle hint of sweet, nutty fruitiness.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large, heavy pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and bread and cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove when done and reserve. In the same oil, prepare a sofrito with the onion and tomatoes, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Meanwhile, put the lentils in a large bowl and pick them over for any debris. Rinse and drain.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> When the sofrito is ready, add the lentils to the pot along with the saffron and pimentón, season with salt and pepper, and stir to blend. Cover with 6 cups/1.5 L water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and gently boil until the lentils are tender but not mushy, 40 to 50 minutes. Add more water if necessary to keep the lentils loose.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Meanwhile, prepare a picada with the reserved garlic and bread, the almonds, chocolate, and parsley, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Stir the picada and the vinegar into the lentils and cook for a final 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. Ladle into bowls and serve hot.</p>
