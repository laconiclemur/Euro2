  <p class="nonindent">No people in the world like meat more than the Germans do, whether it is pork, beef, veal or lamb, the important thing is that it be served in enormous portions. One favorite, braised veal shank (Kalbshaxe), is served in a standard portion that looks like enough for four people. Fresh pork (Schwein) and smoked or cured ham or bacon (Schinken or Speck) are probably the most popular meats in Germany, especially if one takes into account the eastern section of the country that is now a part of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik. But veal (Kalbfleisch) and beef (Lende when it is cut from the loin; Rind when it is from any other part) are very close behind pork in popularity and appear even more frequently on upper-class restaurant menus, as they are regarded as being a little more special. Lamb (Lamm) and mutton (Hammel) are not nearly as important in the German cuisine, though a few traditional recipes have developed around them. Incidentally, the mutton in Germany is just about comparable to our lamb, as our animals are allowed to grow much larger than those in Europe. Mutton requires longer cooking than lamb and its stronger flavor seems ta call for a little more garlic or other seasoning; beyond that, you may use the two meats interchangeably.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Germans take variety meats and innards (Innereien) very seriously, and have some delectable ways of preparing them. The liver (Leber), lungs (Lungen), tongue (Zunge), kidneys (Nieren), sweetbread (Bries or Kalbsmilch), brains (Hirne) and heart (Herz) of pigs, <a id="page140"></a>calves, steer, lamb and sheep are considered great delicacies. So are the head, hocks, feet, tail and, in some cases, the ears and the cheeks. Baked udder (gebackenes Euter), ox palate (Ochsengaumen), calves’ spleen (Kalbsmilz) and the fried blood (geröstetes Blut) of calves, pigs and chickens are all favorites, found in homes rather than in restaurants. Stomachs and intestines of various animals are used for sausage casings and to hold pudding-stuffings that are steamed. It is said that the Germans eat every part of the pig except the squeak; the same might be said of the moo and the baa and the bleat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Recipes for many of these innards and variety meats are included in this chapter, but I have used only those ingredients that are readily available and would be more generally popular.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although there is a great variety of meat served in Germany, there is less variety in preparation. The meat may be grilled or broiled (gegrillt), boiled (gekocht) and fried (geröstet or gebraten) or sometimes roasted. However, most meat in Germany is braised, or pot-roasted, a process which goes by a number of different names. Meat that is lightly browned and cooked with almost no added liquid is gedünstet or gedämpft; when a great deal of liquid is added, it is gebraten or geschmort; or if that braising is done in the oven it is sometimes called, again, geröstet. A braised steak is a Rostbraten. The more German cookbooks one reads, the more confused the situation becomes, and differences in the processes are virtually indiscernible when reading recipes. These terms are included here just to give you a rough idea of what to expect when you order from a German menu.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>GENERAL RULES FOR BRAISING MEAT</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">To braise meat, brown it slowly on all sides in hot fat, sauté onions and other root vegetables in the same fat, then add liquid and cover the pot tightly. The meat should simmer very, very slowly but steadily until it is done. That is the basic braising process. Variety comes from the meat used, the kind of fat, the vegetables and seasonings, the liquid used for cooking and the additions to the gravy. Braising is usually done on top of the stove, but it can also be done in the oven. Although the latter assures an even heat on all sides, the gravy tends to be thinner and greasier and needs more skimming and thickening.</p>

  <p class="indent">The pot used for braising is extremely important. It should fit the meat as closely as possible so that no heat is dissipated in empty spaces. It should also have a tight-fitting lid and be made of a very heavy material that holds heat and distributes it evenly. Enameled cast iron is the best material for this. An oval or round Dutch oven is best for braising. The oval shape wastes less space, since most of the meats you braise will be long and narrow, but you should also have one round Dutch oven for cuts such as brisket. A 5-quart and a 7-quart oval, plus one 3-quart round Dutch oven or casserole would be an excellent combination to own.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since it is important that the meat does not lose its juices while braising, it should never be pierced with a fork. Have the butcher tie some <a id="page141"></a>string around it securely to serve as a handle for turning the meat in the pan. Also, be sure that the meat is well seared and golden brown on all sides. If it is not seared, it will lose juices; if it is seared black, the same thing will happen, as the charred covering will come off during the cooking. Meat must be cooked at a very slow simmer, or it will also lose juices. If you cannot lower the flame sufficiently to keep the sauce at a low simmer, place an asbestos mat under the pot to cut and distribute the heat. Braised meat shrinks and becomes hard and dense when its juices cook out.</p>

  <p class="indent">Braised meats are great favorites in Germany for two reasons. In the first place they enable the housewife to use less tender, less expensive cuts of meat. Second, they provide delicious gravies to go with the boiled potatoes and dumplings that Germans love so much. I suppose we could play “which-came-first-the-dumpling-or-the-gravy?” but it hardly seems to matter; as long as they’re both here, let’s enjoy them.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">A long marrow bone is often added to pot roasts to enrich the gravy. Although it adds to the flavor, it tends to make the gravy very fatty. However, if you would like to add the bone, brown it first, either by roasting it in the oven or browning it in the pan fat, before you sauté the vegetables.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is a tremendous favorite in Germany, either as an appetizer or canapé topping, or as a main course. It is always an expensive item on a menu as it requires top-quality ingredients. Since nothing is cooked, sauced or seasoned, there is absolutely no margin for error, and a Beef Tartar Feinschmecker can immediately spot meat that is not as fresh or of the quality that it should be. In Germany, the meat and its condiments <a id="page142"></a>are always served separately and everyone mixes his own, according to his taste. This is often a ceremony worth watching.</p>

  <p class="indent">The beef is, of course, the most important part of this dish. It should be filet or sirloin and absolutely without any fat. Ideally, this beef should be scraped, not ground. In Germany and other parts of Europe, there is a little metal knife made specially for this purpose. Here, you can try the same thing with a silver teaspoon, though it is not nearly as good. The meat is scraped so that none of the sinew or other tissue finds its way into the final result. As a second choice, use a food processor, or, a third choice, put meat through the medium blade of a grinder. It is best to grind meat for tartar yourself just before serving, so it does not have to be refrigerated. Come as close to that as you can. There is another very sound reason for grinding meat at home when you plan to eat it raw. A butcher grinds all his meat in the same chopper, pork included. There are certain to be particles of pork left in the machine, some of which may well go into your beef, along with any trichinae that the pork may contain. Since the meat will not be cooked, this is very risky business indeed.</p>

  <p class="indent">The meat patties may be served directly in the center of a dinner plate, or from a large platter or wooden plank. The condiments can be arranged around the meat, or served in separate dishes; the second method is preferable, although the first might look better. If all of the condiments are directly on the plate, it may be difficult to exclude those one does not want. The raw egg yolk that is so traditional with Tartar looks very pretty if it is served in half an egg shell set in an egg cup. If you are sure your guests want the egg yolk, one can be nested directly in the center of each meat patty.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>For each serving:</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ to ½ pound raw, lean scraped or ground meat (sirloin or filet)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg yolk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon finely minced raw onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon capers</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon freshly grated horseradish (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 gherkins (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 anchovy filets (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt, preferably coarse</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>black pepper, served from a mill</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>toast or Westphalian-style pumpernickel</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare meat as directed above, either by scraping or grinding as close to serving time as possible. Shape into a patty as for hamburger. Let each guest grind pepper directly onto the meat. Serve toast or bread on the side.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Steaks from the loin (Lende) cuts are either grilled in a broiler or pan-fried in a little butter. They are then sprinkled with salt and pepper and served. In Germany, they are almost always served on large platters surrounded by all sorts of vegetables; and, generally, they are topped with some onions that have been sautéed in the butter in which the steak was fried. Béarnaise Sauce or parsley butter is usually served on the side. Creamed or stewed mushrooms, grilled tomato halves, potatoes both boiled and French-fried and buttered carrots are often included in the arrangement. If the cook is in a more exotic frame of mind, the steaks may be topped or surrounded by mandarins (tangerines), pineapple chunks or slices, fried banana slices or any other fruit that suggests the tropics.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>STEAK SEASONING (Steakwürze)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Steak is often prepared in Germany with this highly seasoned mixture in which the meat marinates for varying lengths of time, usually 1 hour for every inch-thickness of steak. A flank steak intended for London Broil should marinate 8 hours.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>For a 2- to 3-pound sirloin steak:</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons hot prepared mustard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons olive oil, or other vegetable oil</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon curry powder</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ clove garlic, crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>generous pinch of freshly ground black pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon brandy</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon soy sauce (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Mix all ingredients well and spread on both sides of a steak, or on chunks of meat to be broiled on skewers. For a flank steak, double the recipe. During barbecue season, when you might want to use the seasoning often, make up a jar full of it, cover tightly and store in refrigerator or in a cool cupboard. Omit garlic and mix it with sauce just before spreading it on meat, or rub meat with a cut clove of garlic before spreading sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page144"></a><em>ROAST BEEF (Lendenbraten)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Sirloin or filet of beef is a great favorite in Germany, although its high cost makes it a dish for only the most special occasions—so much so, in fact, that it is in the class of delicatessen. Paper-thin slices of rare roast beef are used for canapés and elegant appetizers but are main courses only in the wealthiest homes. Most often it is prepared English style (englischer Art). This is nothing more than a boned and rolled rib roast, a top sirloin or a filet rubbed with softened butter and then seared on all sides in a 450° oven about 25 minutes. The heat is then lowered to 325° and the meat is roasted 18 minutes per pound if it is to be rare; 20 minutes per pound for medium rare; 23 per pound for medium; and 28 per pound for well-done. The meat is basted with pan juices every 20 minutes. The only gravy served with this is the pan juice. The fat is skimmed off and a tablespoon of butter is swirled in. It is then brought to a boil in the roasting pan on the stove so that the coagulated juices can be scraped into the gravy with a wooden spoon. The meat is seasoned with salt and pepper after it has been sliced.</p>

  <p class="indent">When it is not “English,” roast beef in Germany is cooked with more of an eye toward gravy. It is buttered and seared in the same way, but once brown, a cup of water or beef stock is poured into pan; this is used for basting. When the roast has 30 to 40 minutes of cooking time to go, a diced onion and a cut tomato are added to pan. When meat is done, the gravy is brought to a boil in roasting pan on stove and the coagulated juices are scraped into it with a wooden spoon. It is then strained into a clean saucepan and excess fat is removed. The gravy is thickened with a little cornstarch dissolved in cold water, or ½ cup sour cream blended with a tablespoonful of flour. Salt and pepper are added to taste and gravy is heated thoroughly.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_8"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BOILED BEEF (Gekochtes Rindfleisch)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 to 5 pounds beef for boiling (first-cut flanken, brisket or chuck)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 veal knuckle or marrow bone (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pot vegetables, left whole or in large pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon salt, or as needed</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The meat should be tied with string so that it will retain its shape. Bring 3 to 4 quarts of water to boil in a kettle. Place tied meat and bone (if <a id="page145"></a>used) in large soup kettle or Dutch oven and pour boiling water over it. There should be about 6” of water above surface of meat. If you prefer, you can start to cook meat in cold water; this will give the broth a better flavor but the meat will lose some in the process. Cover pot and simmer slowly but steadily 2 hours, skimming as necessary. Add pot vegetables and simmer another 2 hours, or until meat is tender and can be pierced easily with carving fork or skewer. When meat is done, taste broth and season as needed. Slice meat onto heated platter, spoon a little soup over it and slice pot vegetables around it.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For broth with a stronger flavor and a slightly darker color, both bone and onion can be browned in oven before being added to soup.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. If you want to serve more vegetables, cook them in salted water until almost done and then finish in broth along with meat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Boiled beef goes by many names in Germany and neighboring Austria, depending on cut of meat used, the vegetables cooked in stock and the sauce served with it. Boiled Beef with Horseradish Sauce (Gekochtes Rindfleisch mit Meerrettichsosse) is Badisches Ochsenfleisch in Swabia. In Hanover, a few cloves are added to stock, and the sliced beef is served garnished with boiled white onions, halves of hard-cooked eggs, slices of dill pickle and mayonnaise thinned with a little caper vinegar and then mixed with capers and a little anchovy paste.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Corned Beef Brisket (Gepökelte Rinderbrust), or smoked corned beef brisket, is cooked in the same way as Boiled Beef. It is then sliced and served with vegetables, or with sauerkraut or cabbage.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>POT ROAST OF BEEF (Rinderschmorbraten)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4-to 5-pound pot roast of beef (rump, top, bottom or eye round or brisket)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>bacon or salt pork for larding, if necessary</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter, bacon fat or lard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large carrot, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 leek, sliced (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small parsley root, scraped and sliced (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ small knob celery, peeled and diced (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>heel or ½ cup crusts pumpernickel or sour rye bread (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water or beef stock, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 or 2 tablespoons tomato purée (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page146"></a>If meat is lean, it will need larding. Either you or your butcher can do this, using strips of bacon or salt pork. Have a string tied around meat to keep it in shape and to serve as a handle for turning so you don’t pierce surface of meat with a fork. Rub meat with salt and pepper and dredge lightly with flour on all sides. Heat fat in a 5-quart Dutch oven or casserole. When fat is hot, add meat and sear slowly to mellow golden brown color on all sides; do not let it turn dark brown or black. This should take about 15 minutes. Remove meat and add all cut vegetables to hot fat. Sauté slowly, stirring from time to time so they soften and turn bright yellow. Return meat to pot, placing it on top of sautéed vegetables. Add bay leaf and bread and pour in about 1 cup of water or stock; there should be just about 1” of liquid on bottom of pot. Cover with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer very slowly as described for braised meat. Turn meat several times during cooking, using string as a handle. Add more liquid to pan if necessary as meat cooks. Simmer very slowly but steadily 3½ to 4 hours, or until meat can easily be pierced with a carving fork or skewer. Remove meat to a heated platter. Strain gravy, rubbing vegetables and bread through the sieve. Return to pot, skim off excess fat. Stir in sour cream and add tomato purée if you want to use it. Check seasoning. Return meat to pot and heat thoroughly about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. You can brown the pot roast without dredging it and thicken the gravy before serving with flour dissolved in cold water, or ½ cup sour cream blended with 1 tablespoon flour. Tomato purée may be used or eliminated.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Smaller cuts can be used. Buy a 2”- or 3“-thick steak cut from the round or rump and pound to tenderize it. It may then be seasoned, browned and braised with vegetables in the same way as the pot roast. You will need much less water and the meat will be tender in 1 to 1½ hours of slow, steady simmering. You can flour meat before browning it, or thicken sauce with flour when it has finished cooking and been strained. To serve, cut crosswise slices of meat and serve with sauce. Prepared this way, a 2-pound slice of meat will serve four fairly generously.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 pounds fresh brisket of beef</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large clove garlic, cut in half</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter, bacon fat or beef drippings</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large onions, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><a id="page147"></a><em>1 heel of sour rye bread</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup water or beef stock, or as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour, if necessary</em><br />
  <br /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Have brisket tied with string so it will hold its shape and be easy to turn. Rub all sides with cut garlic clove and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat fat in a Dutch oven or deep heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Place meat in hot fat and brown very slowly on all sides. This should take about 15 minutes and meat should be golden brown. Use string as a handle for turning meat; do not pierce its surface with a fork. Remove meat and add onions to hot fat, sautéing slowly until soft and pale yellow. Return meat to pot, placing it on top of onions. Add rye bread and water or stock. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily 3 to 4 hours. If you cannot get heat low enough to keep gravy simmering, place an asbestos mat under pot. Add more liquid if necessary; there should be just enough to keep onions and meat from scorching. The meat is done when it can be pierced easily with carving fork or skewer. Remove to heated platter. Strain gravy and return to pot. Skim off excess fat and if necessary, thicken with 2 tablespoons flour dissolved in a little cold water. Check seasoning. Return meat to gravy and simmer about 10 minutes. Slice meat onto heated platter and serve gravy in heated sauceboat.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">For a rich paprika sauce, sprinkle liberally with sweet paprika before browning and add 1 tablespoon paprika to onions when you sauté them. Follow rest of recipe, but eliminate rye bread and instead stir in 2 or 3 tablespoons sour cream after gravy has been strained and excess fat removed. One tablespoon flour can be mixed into sour cream before it is added to gravy to thicken sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Next to frankfurters and sauerkraut, Sauerbraten is Germany’s most famous food specialty. Every cook and every province has a different version of this dish, but in my travels, none compared to the Sauerbraten found along the Rhine. Its distinguishing characteristics are the white raisins and the velvety, golden-brown, sweet-sour sauce that bears absolutely no resemblance to the watery, vinegar-sharp gravy served in German and Austrian restaurants in the United States.</p>

  <p class="right"><a id="page148"></a><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5-pound rump of beef (top or bottom round can be used but they are not quite as good)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>bacon or salt pork for larding salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 cups white vinegar (approximately)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 cups water (approximately)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 bay leaves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 cloves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon pickling spices</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large carrot, scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 slices bacon and 2 tablespoons butter, or 5 tablespoons bacon fat, kidney fat or beef drippings</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large onions, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 cloves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup white raisins, soaked in warm water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>tomato purée or sour cream (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rump or round of beef should be well larded with thin matchstick strips of bacon or salt pork. This can be done by you or your butcher. Tie meat firmly with string in several places so it will be easy to turn without piercing and will hold its shape. Rub well with salt on all sides and place in deep, close-fitting glass or earthenware bowl. Combine vinegar and water and add onion, bay leaves, cloves, peppercorns, pickling spices and carrot. Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes. Cool marinade and pour over beef. The meat should be completely covered by marinade; if it is not, add equal amounts of water and vinegar until it is. Cover and place in refrigerator for 3 to 5 days; the longer it stands, the more piquant the roast will be, so adjust time to suit your own taste. Turn meat in marinade 2 or 3 times each day, using the string as a handle. Remove meat from marinade. Strain marinade and reserve. Dry meat thoroughly on all sides with plenty of paper toweling. The meat will not brown properly if it is wet, so dry it as much as you possibly can. Dice bacon and fry it slowly in butter in a 5-quart Dutch oven or casserole. If you prefer lard, dice it and fry instead of bacon, but eliminate butter. When fat is hot, add meat and brown slowly. Using the string as a handle, turn so meat is well seared and golden brown (but not black) on all sides. This should take about 15 minutes. Remove browned meat and add sliced onions to hot fat. Fry, stirring from time to time, until onions are deep golden brown, but not black.</p>

  <p class="indent">Return meat to pot, placing it on top of onions. Add marinade until it reaches about halfway up sides of meat. Add bay leaf and cloves (not those used in marinade). Bring marinade to a boil, cover pot tightly with a heavy close-fitting lid, reduce heat and simmer very, very slowly but steadily 3½ to 4 hours, turning meat two or three times during cooking. Add more marinade to pot if it is needed. If you cannot lower heat enough to keep sauce at a slow simmer, place an asbestos mat under pot. The meat is done when it can be pierced easily with a long-pronged fork or skewer.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page149"></a>Remove meat to a heated platter and strain gravy. Skim off excess fat and return gravy to pot. Melt butter in saucepan and when hot, stir in flour and sugar. Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly until sugar mixture turns a deep caramel color. Be very careful doing this, as sugar burns all at once, and if it becomes black, you’ll have to start this part of the operation all over again. Add the sugar-flour to the hot gravy and stir through briskly with a wooden spoon or, preferably, a wire whisk. Season with lemon juice to taste; gravy should have a mild sweet-sour flavor. Add raisins, which have been soaked and drained. Return meat to pot, cover and simmer 10 minutes. If sauce becomes too thick, add a little more marinade. A tablespoonful tomato purée or sour cream can be stirred in and heated through 4 or 5 minutes before serving time. The latter is used more in Bavaria than along the Rhine. The tomato purée enriches the color of the gravy. Use one or the other or neither; never both. Check gravy for seasoning. Slice meat and arrange on a heated platter and mask with a little gravy, serving the rest in a heated sauceboat.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. 6 or 8 crumbled gingersnaps or Lebkuchen are often added to this gravy for last ½ hour of cooking. They add flavor and richness.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. You may change marinade to suit your own taste. Use more or less water or vinegar, depending upon how sour you like it, and you can also substitute wine for vinegar. Any dry red wine, German or otherwise, will do.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. If you would like to try a Sauerbraten other than Rheinischer, use same marinade and methods of cooking, but do not use sugar in the thickening and do not add lemon juice or raisins. Other vegetables such as parsley and celery roots are added and a heel of rye bread is used instead of gingersnaps in last hour of cooking. Slice vegetables and sauté them in the fat, along with onions, before adding meat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Any meat can be cooked Sauerbraten style—lamb, mutton or pork. The latter should not be larded. Veal is an exception and will not make a good Sauerbraten.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. For a very rich gravy, brown a marrow bone along with vegetables and cook it with meat.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The pot roast should be well larded with strips of salt pork or bacon by you or your butcher. Tie meat into a compact shape with string, so that you can turn it without piercing its surface with a fork. Sprinkle on all sides with salt and sugar. Place in a deep, close-fitting earthenware or glass bowl. Add cloves, peppercorns, caraway seeds, juniper berries, bay leaf, garlic, onion and carrot slices, parsley root and parsley. Combine olive oil and beer and pour over meat. Marinate in refrigerator 10 or 12 hours, turning several times.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove meat from marinade. Strain marinade and reserve. Dry meat very thoroughly with plenty of paper toweling, or it will not brown. Heat beef drippings or butter in a 5-quart Dutch oven or casserole. When fat is very hot, add meat, reduce heat a little and brown on all sides, using the string for turning the meat. This should take about 15 minutes. The meat should be well seared and a deep golden-brown color, but not blackened. Drain browning fat from pot and add enough strained marinade to cover the bottom of the pan—about ½ cup. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer very, very slowly, but steadily 3½ to 4 hours, turning meat two or three times during cooking. The meat is done when it can be pierced easily with a long-pronged fork or skewer. If you cannot get flame low enough to keep liquid bubbling slowly, place an asbestos mat under the pot. Check during cooking to see if more marinade is needed. Add heel of rye bread during last hour of cooking.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove meat to a hot platter and skim excess fat from cooking liquid. Heat butter in a saucepan and in it brown flour, very slowly, stirring constantly over low heat. When flour is color of cocoa, add cupful of cooking liquid to it and stir vigorously or beat with a wire whisk, over very low heat, until mixture is smooth and about as thick as sour cream. Pour this into rest of cooking liquid, stirring it in with a wooden spoon or wire whisk. Simmer slowly and keep hot until serving time. Slice meat and arrange on a heated platter. Check gravy for seasoning and serve in a heated gravy boat.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 GENEROUS SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2½ pounds round steak, thinly sliced as for veal scallopini (about ¼″ thick)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 slices bacon, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large onions, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>generous handful minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter, bacon fat or kidney fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="indent">1 <em>carrot, sliced (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup water or beef stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sour cream (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons tomato purée (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The round steak should be pounded to almost paper-thinness by you or your butcher. Slices should then be cut into pieces approximately <strong>3”</strong> wide and <strong>4”</strong> to <strong>5”</strong> long. They may be more or less oval to rectangular in shape. There should be approximately 12 to 16 strips from 2½ pounds of meat if it has been pounded thinly enough and cut more or less as described.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fry the bacon slowly with the minced onion and parsley until vegetables are soft but not browned. Sprinkle one side of each meat slice with salt and pepper and spread with bacon-onion-parsley mixture. Roll meat tightly and tie with kitchen string or secure with toothpicks. Dredge each beef roll in flour. Heat fat in a shallow wide fireproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid. When fat is hot, brown beef rolls lightly, a few at a time, turning so they are seared on all sides, removing them as they are done. When all the meat has been browned, add minced onion and carrot and brown slowly, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring several times. When vegetables are golden brown, place beef rolls on top of them. Add water or stock. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer very slowly but steadily 1 to ½ hours, or until beef rolls are tender. Add liquid if necessary as meat cooks. Remove beef rolls to a heated platter. Strain sauce and return to casserole. Skim excess fat from surface and stir in sour cream and tomato purée, if you are using either or both. Check seasoning, adding salt and pepper as necessary. Return beef rolls to sauce and heat thoroughly before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. A little prepared mustard can be spread on beef rolls before onion mixture.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For paprika sauce, add 1 tablespoon to onion and carrot as they brown in pan.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. If you use ½ cup red wine and ½ cup water for your cooking liquid, add wine to browned onion and carrot and simmer a minute or two before adding beef rolls and water.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page152"></a>4 Vegetable Stuffing: Sprinkle meat slice on one side with salt and pepper, spreading with a little mustard first if you wish to. Cut a scraped raw carrot in half lengthwise and then in half again, and lay one of these quarter strips on each meat slice, along with a lengthwise quarter-strip of dill pickle and a thick slice or wedge of raw onion. Roll, tie, dredge with flour and proceed with recipe as described, adding a small bay leaf to cooking liquid.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. Sausage Stuffing: Mix ½ pound country-style pork sausage with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, some chopped parsley and 1 medium-sized onion minced and sautéed in butter or fat. A little thyme can be added for flavor as well.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">6. Hunters’ Beef Rolls Stuffing (Jägerrouladen): Brown 4 tablespoons pumpernickel breadcrumbs, 1 finely minced onion and 4 slices diced bacon in a combination of butter and some of the bacon’s own fat.

  <p class="nonindent">The hamburger comes from Hamburg, where it is known as Deutsches Beefsteak.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 HAMBURGERS: 3 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds ground beef (chuck and round combined in equal parts make a good mixture for this)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 medium-sized onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons salt pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter, melted</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter or other fat for frying</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 onions, sliced and separated into rings</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Put ground meat through fine blade of food chopper along with onion and parsley. Mix thoroughly with eggs, salt, a dash or two of pepper, melted butter and flour. It is best to mix this through with your hands, as the ingredients will be more thoroughly blended. Shape meat mixture into 6 oval patties. Heat butter or fat in a large, heavy skillet. When fat <a id="page153"></a>is hot (butter should not begin to brown), add meat patties. Fry until first side is rich brown; turn and brown second side. If you want hamburgers rare, fry first side 4 or 5 minutes, and second side 3 or 4. If you want hamburgers well done, fry slowly or they will be too brown by the time the centers are finished. When hamburgers are done, remove to a heated platter. Add onion rings to pan and sauté a few minutes until soft and bright yellow, but not brown. Spoon sautéed onion rings over hamburgers. If you would like a little sauce with this, pour ½ cup hot water or beef stock into pan; let it come to a boil once or twice as you stir and scrape coagulated pan juices into it. Pour over hamburgers with the onions.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. These hamburgers can also be made with a combination of raw ground meats : beef with pork, beef with veal, or equal parts of all three. If you use pork, hamburgers should be served well done.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. In Bavaria, where these meat patties are known as Fleischpfanzel, flour is not used in meat mixture. Instead, rolls or bread, soaked in water or milk and squeezed as dry as possible, are ground in with meat, and a little water is added during mixing. Use 1 large roll or 2 thick slices of bread with ingredients called for above. A little dried basil and grated lemon peel may be added along with other seasonings listed.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Hamburger, Bremen Style (Bremer Beefsteak) is made by mixing 2 pounds ground beef with 2 tablespoons thick sour cream, 1 medium-sized boiled and mashed potato, 2 teaspoons salt and a dash of pepper. Shape into 6 oval patties. Slice a large onion thinly and separate into rings. Sauté rings until soft and deep yellow in butter or fat, remove to a heated platter and then fry hamburgers in same fat in which onions were sautéed. Remove finished hamburgers to a heated platter. Add ½ cup water or beef stock to frying pan and let it come to a boil once or twice as you stir and scrape coagulated pan juices into it. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hamburgers topped with sautéed onion rings and pan gravy.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4- to 5-pound rump of veal, boned, rolled and tied</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 cloves garlic, cut in slivers</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 or 6 anchovy filets, cut in half</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 strips of bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups beef or veal stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour or 2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sour cream or sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons capers, drained</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 375°. Lard veal with garlic slivers and anchovy filet pieces, tucking them into folds of meat. Rub roast on all sides with lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. The bacon can be cut in strips and larded into meat, or it can be slipped under the strings so that it covers the roast. Heat butter in a deep open roasting pan on top of stove and when butter is hot, brown veal on all sides slowly. This should take about 15 minutes. Use the string to turn meat; do not pierce it with a fork.</p>

  <p class="indent">When the roast is brown, slip a rack under it and pour stock into pan. Roast in oven, basting every 20 minutes with pan juices. Allow about 30 minutes per pound or use a meat thermometer. Veal should be well done and white all the way through. If pink juices run out of meat when <a id="page160"></a>pierced, it is not done; juices must be clear and colorless. Remove finished roast to heated platter or carving board. Skim excess fat off pan juices. To thicken gravy, either stir dissolved cornstarch into it, bring to a boil and let simmer a minute or two, or do the same with flour. As you bring gravy to a boil in roasting pan, on top of stove, scrape coagulated pan juices into gravy with a wooden spoon. Finish gravy by stirring in 1 cup sweet or sour cream and letting it simmer a few minutes until hot and thick. Season with salt and pepper as necessary, then stir in well-drained capers before serving.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4- to 5-pound veal rump, boned and rolled</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>bacon for larding, if necessary</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 quarts buttermilk, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 or 6 slices bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>piece of rind and about 1 cup of trimmings from smoked ham, preferably raw</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 parsley root, scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large carrot, scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon basil</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon thyme or marjoram</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups sweet cream, milk or half-and-half</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>white wine to taste (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The veal should be firmly tied with string. The butcher should not trim off much of the fat; if veal is very lean, lard in six or eight places with strips of bacon. Place veal in a deep close-sided bowl and cover completely with buttermilk. This will take between 1 and 2 quarts, depending on width and depth of bowl. Marinate 4 or 5 days. After 2 to 2½ days, pour off original buttermilk and replace with fresh.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat oven to 450°.Remove marinated veal and dry very well with paper towels, removing as much buttermilk as possible. Sprinkle meat on all sides with salt and pepper. Place a rack in an open roasting pan and cover with 3 or 4 slices of bacon. Set roast on top of rack; add butter and ham trimmings to pan. Roast meat in preheated oven 20 to 30 minutes, turning once or twice so that it will be golden brown on all sides. Baste or brush with melted butter from pan, every 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to 350° and put 2 or 3 strips of bacon over top of meat. Add prepared vegetables and herbs. Continue roasting, allowing about 30 to 35 minutes per pound or until a meat thermometer reaches 175° <a id="page161"></a>(Insert thermometer after meat has browned.) Baste with pan drippings every 15 to 20 minutes. If vegetables seem to brown too quickly, add a little water to pan from time to time so they will not burn.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove finished meat to a heated platter and take rack out of pan. Pour off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat from roasting pan. Set pan on stove over low heat. Sprinkle in flour and blend into fat. Simmer, stirring constantly, over low heat 4 or 5 minutes, or until flour just begins to turn golden brown. Pour in milk or cream, all at once, and bring to a boil 2 or 3 times over low heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon, scraping all the coagulated pan juices into gravy so it will be a rich brown color. Strain into a clean saucepan, pressing through as much gravy as possible. If a great deal seems to cling to vegetables, pour a little extra milk or cream through sieve and work gravy into pan. Taste gravy, adding salt and pepper as needed, and a little white wine if you care to. If gravy seems too thick, a little more milk or cream can be added. Heat thoroughly before serving.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 breast of veal, 3 to 4 pounds, with pocket cut for stuffing</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>stuffing, as below</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to 1 cup water or meat or veal stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 or 2 tablespoons flour or 2 or 3 teaspoons cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rub inside of veal pocket with salt and pepper. Fill with one of the stuffings described below and sew opening or close with skewers and kitchen string. Heat butter in a Dutch oven and in it brown veal lightly on both sides. Remove meat and sauté onion in hot fat until it begins to soften and turn bright yellow. Return veal to pot, placing it on top of onion. Add just enough water or stock to keep onion from burning. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily ½ to 2 hours, or until veal is tender. Add more liquid if necessary during cooking. Remove finished veal to a heated platter. The gravy may be strained or not, depending on your preference. Skim off excess fat and thicken with flour or cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water. Simmer a few minutes until sauce is smooth and thick. Stir in sour cream. Check seasoning, return veal to gravy and simmer together 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. The veal can be dredged with flour before it is browned. In that case, you will probably not have to add any flour or cornstarch to thicken <a id="page162"></a>gravy. You can also thicken gravy by stirring flour into sour cream before adding cream to gravy.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Omit any thickening and serve a clear pan gravy flavored with a little white wine.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Add 1 tablespoon sweet paprika to minced onion and sauté together. This will give a paprika-sour cream sauce gravy.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. A little marjoram and/or thyme can be added to gravy.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. In Bavaria a few root vegetables such as carrot, leek, knob celery and a parsley root are generally sliced or chopped, sautéed with onion and then cooked with rest of sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">No single cut of meat is more beloved in Germany than the Schnitzel—literally a slice or cutlet, and always from the veal leg. It is the same long, flat, palm-shaped cut that the Italians call scallopini, and the French, escalope. The meat is cut with the long grain, or, more exactly, at a slight diagonal to it, so that it does not fall apart when it is pounded. It is this pounding, done with a wooden mallet, that gives the Schnitzel its tenderness and delicacy. After being cut, the slice of veal is placed between several thicknesses of waxed paper and is then pounded to about ⅙” to ⅛″ thickness. The butcher can best do this for you. If you ever have to do it yourself and have no wooden mallet, sandwich each slice of veal between waxed paper, lay on a board and flatten with the bottom side of a dinner plate.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>GENERAL RULES FOR PREPARING SCHNITZELS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1 The breaded cutlets should be allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before being fried.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Be sure the fat is hot enough before you put the Schnitzels into it, otherwise the breading will fall off.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. A Schnitzel should be golden brown on both sides and thoroughly cooked in 8 to 12 minutes; it should be turned only once. If it takes longer than that, it is too thick and may need to be fried twice on each side.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Keep finished Schnitzels hot in a low oven (250° to 275°) while the others are being fried. Never cover the fried Schnitzels, or the breading will steam and get soggy.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. Although Schnitzels are most often fried in butter, they can also be done in vegetable shortening or lard; the latter produces the crispest, driest crust, but many people dislike its flavor. If you like lard, and can get it very fresh without any preservatives, use it for frying breaded Schnitzels.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="indent">Vienna’s Schnitzel is a standard on menus all over the world and is just as popular in Germany as in its homeland, Austria. It was, by the <a id="page165"></a>way, the forerunner of northern Italy’s great specialty, Veal Cutlet Milanese.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">3 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 veal cutlets, pounded</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to 1 cup flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons salad oil (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 generous cup dry, fine breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 to 5 tablespoons butter, lard or vegetable shortening</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Veal cutlets may be marinated in a sprinkling of lemon juice for 30 minutes before they are breaded. Whether or not they are marinated, sprinkle with salt on both sides before breading. Measure flour onto a sheet of waxed paper or a flat plate. Beat eggs and water in wide flat bowl; beat in oil if you are using it. The oil is supposed to hold breading on securely and help to make it crisp. Measure breadcrumbs onto a sheet of waxed paper or a flat plate. Dip salted cutlets lightly into flour on both sides, and then into beaten egg. Let excess egg drip off and dredge cutlets with breadcrumbs. Let stand at room temperature 15 to 30 minutes. Heat fat in a large skillet. There should be enough in pan for cutlets to “swim.” Do not crowd cutlets into pan. Do 2 or 3 at a time, or as many as you can fit into your largest skillet. Add fat if needed. Put cutlets into pan when butter is very hot and bubbling starts to subside. Fry first side slowly until golden brown. Turn over with spatula or flat turner; do not pierce with fork. By the time second side is golden brown (allow 4 to 6 minutes for each side) the cutlet should be finished. Place finished cutlets on a platter, pan or sheet of aluminum foil, in a 250° to 275° oven, so they will keep hot while the rest are being fried.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The cutlets for this Schnitzel dish should be a little thicker than for Wienerschnitzel—say about Sprinkle with salt, dredge one side of each cutlet with flour. Heat fat and in it brown first the unfloured side of the cutlet. Turn after a few minutes and brown the floured side. Keep finished cutlets hot in a slow oven and make the following sauce. Stir 2 tablespoons butter into skillet in which veal was fried. When it begins to bubble up, pour in ½ cup beef or veal stock, or water, and as this simmers, scrape coagulated pan juices into the sauce with wooden spoon. Flavor sauce with salt, pepper and a dash of lemon juice. If you have used water instead of stock, stir in about ½ teaspoon beef extract. Bring the sauce to a boil and pour over the fried cutlets.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Naturschnitzel will always bring back pleasant memories of a most delightful friend, Ferenc Gunczy, a dashing gentleman who was born and raised in a great, pre-World War I Viennese household. He was both a gourmet and a cook, and on one occasion, took several of us to dinner at his favorite Viennese restaurant in New York—a place, unfortunately, now out of business. Ferenc ordered Naturschnitzel and became furious when it arrived. It had, he told us, been floured on both sides and was therefore not a Naturschnitzel at all. He explained to the captain that a true Naturschnitzel is floured on one side only, the floured side being browned first. If both sides were floured, the second to be browned was certain to be soggy. The captain apologized on behalf of his cook and replaced the offending Schnitzel with the correct version. I could not be at peace with my conscience unless I gave you Ferenc’s ruling on this dish.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is prepared very much like Wienerschnitzel, with the following exceptions. Dip salted cutlets into lightly beaten sour cream and then into flour and egg. Instead of using breadcrumbs for the last coating, substitute 1 cup grated, blanched almonds. Allow cutlets to stand 15 to 30 minutes and then fry in hot butter. They will probably need an extra minute or two of cooking on each side as almonds make a slightly heavier coating. Another way to serve Almond Schnitzel is to fry Wienerschnitzel <a id="page167"></a>and serve topped with blanched, slivered almonds sautéed in butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rub tied leg of pork generously with black pepper. Place on a platter or in a bowl, cover with foil or waxed paper and keep in refrigerator 2 days. Salt roast on all sides. If the pork has a good deal of fat around it, it can brown without adding more. If the fat seems thin, heat butter, bacon or lard in a large Dutch oven or casserole and when, hot, add pork. Brown well on all sides, turning with string. Do not pierce surface of meat with fork in turning. It should take about 15 minutes for meat to brown on all sides. Add water, cover pan tightly and simmer slowly but steadily 2 to 2½ hours, or until pork is tender when pierced with a carving fork or skewer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lay pork on rack in open roasting pan; cover top and sides with one-third of the Lebkuchen. Roast in upper third of 450° oven until crumbs turn golden brown. Baste with sauce in which pork was braised and cover with another layer of crumbs. Brown again, baste with sauce and cover with a third layer of crumbs.

  <p class="hanging1"><em>powdered ginger</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water or stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour or 2 teaspoons cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 or 2 tablespoons sweet or sour cream, optional and to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon red currant jelly, optional and to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Have butcher cut a pocket down one side of meat. Parboil prunes 10 minutes in water to cover. Drain, cut in half and remove pits. Combine prunes and apples. Stuff meat pocket with prunes and apples and rub outside lightly with salt, pepper and ginger. Tie meat closed with string. Heat butter in a Dutch oven or heavy casserole and when hot and bubbling, brown meat on all sides, using string to turn it. It should be golden brown in about 10 minutes. Keep heat moderate so butter does not burn. When meat is browned, add just enough water or stock to cover bottom of pan. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and braise slowly but steadily about ½ hours, or until meat is completely tender when pierced with a carving fork or skewer. Add more water or stock as needed. Baste frequently with pan juices. Remove meat to heated platter. Skim excess fat from pan juices. Thicken with flour or cornstarch, bring to a boil and simmer 2 or 3 minutes until gravy is smooth. Stir in cream and currant jelly, if you like.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For twice as many people, get 2 pork loins and instead of having pockets cut in them, place filling between them and tie together, one on top of the other. Proceed with recipe, allowing an extra 35 to 45 minutes cooking time. Turn roast several times during cooking.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. You can also use stuffing for a boned leg or shoulder of fresh pork. After meat is boned, lay it out flat and spread stuffing on cut side. Roll jelly-roll fashion and tie into shape. Braise as described, adding more liquid as needed and increasing cooking time to 3 to 4 hours.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. As an alternate stuffing, use the one for Stuffed Pork Chops, Holstein Style.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>11- to 14-pound suckling pig</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>marjoram</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>caraway seeds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup melted butter or bacon fat, or ½ pound sliced or unsliced bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bottle beer, preferably dark</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><a id="page180"></a><em>1 to 2 cups water or stock, if necessary</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour or 2 teaspoons cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sour cream (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">In Germany, suckling pig is seared in a hot oven and then roasted in moderate heat. To do this, preheat oven to 450° and after 20 minutes, reduce heat to 350°. Nevertheless I have found that pigs brown more evenly and shrink less if roasted at even, moderate temperature throughout. To do this, preheat oven to 350° and roast, following instructions below. Allow 25 to 30 minutes per pound for roasting. The meat should be white, without any pink in the juices.</p>

  <p class="indent">Have the pig eviscerated and cleaned by your butcher. Wash it well under running cold water and pat off excess moisture with paper towel. If you do this a day or hours ahead and pig has dried, wipe with damp cloth before seasoning so moisture holds the spices onto skin. Rub inside of pig with salt, marjoram and caraway seeds. Since this pig will not be stuffed, it will sink in slightly as it roasts, so stuff body cavity firmly with crumpled aluminum foil or clean white wrapping paper. This is only necessary for appearance of pig when served. The opening along bottom of pig does not have to be trussed closed. Tie front legs forward so feet come under the head. To tie back legs forward, bring them around under body on each side. Tie securely with kitchen string so they remain in place during roasting. Rub outside of pig with salt, marjoram and caraway seeds. Cover ears and tail with greased brown paper or double thicknesses of aluminum foil to keep from burning. Prop the mouth open with a block of wood or raw potato, so that you will be able to stuff it with an apple or lemon later. Pierce skin all over with a sharp-pronged fork, a larding needle or a skewer, so fat will drain off.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lay pig on a rack or across two long wooden inverted spoons in open roasting pan. Pour in enough water to cover bottom of pan. To keep pig well greased as it roasts, either brush it every 10 to 15 minutes with melted butter or bacon fat, or lay strips of bacon across its back and replace them as they become crisp; or rub pig with a large, unsliced chunk of bacon. Place pig in a preheated oven and allow 25 to 30 minutes per pound for roasting, using either searing or even-temperature method described above. Brush or rub with fat every 10 to 15 minutes and add more water to pan as needed. When you baste, prick skin again to keep fat draining. If pig browns too quickly, cover it with greased brown paper or a double thickness of aluminum foil and lift this cover for basting. When there is still ½ hour cooking time left, remove paper from ears and tail, and from pig itself if it has been covered. Continue roasting and baste 4 or 5 times with beer to give skin a crisp golden glaze.</p>

  <p class="indent">To serve pig, cut trussing from legs and place pig on a large wooden carving board or platter. Remove the block or potato from mouth and put in a whole small apple or unpeeled lemon. Show whole pig <a id="page181"></a>at the table, but unless you are very skilled and experienced, carve in kitchen. If you want to carve it at the table, cut a circle around the neck, and cover this with a wreath of leaves or, at Christmas, holly.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Bavaria, a very simple gravy is served with this. Skim excess fat from pan juices and add some water or stock if there is very little gravy left. Bring to a boil in roasting pan on stove and scrape coagulated pan juices into gravy with a wooden spoon. Thicken by stirring in flour or cornstarch dissolved in cold water and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until sauce is smooth and thick. Sour cream can be stirred in for creamier sauce. Season as needed and serve in heated sauce-boat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is one of Germany’s most renowned specialties. Usually the town of Kassel, between Frankfurt and Hanover, is credited with its origin. Actually, it was created in Berlin by a butcher named Kassel. Today it is a specialty of Berlin and Frankfurt, though it appears everywhere in Germany. The pork loin is smoked in a strip and cooked either in a large section, or sometimes in chops. It may be cooked with sauerkraut, as in Pork Chops and Sauerkraut, or the whole strip may be boiled like Smoked Tongue. It may be boiled, cut into chops and prepared cold in aspic like Pork Chops in Aspic. For special occasions, a double strip of loin (what we would call a saddle or carré) is roasted (see recipe below). To serve, the meat is carved loose from the bone and then sliced.</p>

Sauté and stir over low heat until apples begin to turn golden brown and soft. They should not become completely soft or lose their shape. This should take about 6 or 7 minutes. Sauté only one layer of apple slices at a time. When all the apples are sautéed, chop them coarsely or dice. Add raisins and rum in which they soaked. Add breadcrumbs or small croutons and toss together lightly but thoroughly with a fork. Taste the stuffing and flavor with cinnamon and sugar. You can also add a little more rum if you like. The stuffing should be only slightly moist. Stuff chops with apple mixture and close with toothpicks or sew with kitchen thread. Arrange chops in a baking pan with a cover. Add just enough water to cover bottom of pan. Bake covered 30 minutes. Add more water to pan if it is needed during baking.

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg white</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg shell, cracked</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 envelope unflavored gelatine softened in ¼ cup cold water</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cover pork in deep pot with water or mixture of wine and water. Add a little salt. Cover pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily. Skim foam from surface as it rises. After about 15 minutes, add all vegetables, spices and vinegar and continue cooking slowly 1 to ½ hours, or until meat is tender when pierced with a carving fork or skewer. It should not be falling away from bones, so do not overcook. Remove meat from stock, let cool and cut into four separate chops. Trim off excess fat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Set pot of stock in very cold water and skim fat off as it rises to surface. Season with salt and a little more wine or vinegar, as needed. Beat egg white with crushed shell and add it with 2 or 3 tablespoons cold water to stock. Heat skimmed stock, stirring, until it comes to a boil. The egg white will coagulate and clear stock. Set pot in cold water again. When stock is cool and clear, skim off surface and strain through a fine clean cloth or a fine mesh sieve. Bring 2 cups of this clarified stock to a boil and stir in soaked, softened gelatin. Stir until gelatin dissolves completely.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use metal cutlet molds if you have them; otherwise any sort of shallow, portion-size, square, oval or round molds or bakers will do. <a id="page186"></a>Rinse molds in cold water, pour in about ½ inch of stock and refrigerate 15 or 20 minutes, or until stock has set. Arrange an attractive design, using a slice of carrot and hard-cooked egg, slices of gherkin, a small dab of grated horseradish and a little clump of parsley. Use any or all these, as you like. Arrange pattern on set stock, remembering that mold will be inverted when served and you are doing the design face down. Lay chop on jelled stock and pour enough stock over it to fill mold completely. If aspic begins to set and you cannot pour it easily, heat it again and let cool slightly, but not so much that it resets. Place filled molds in refrigerator 2 hours or until set. To unmold, loosen edges of aspic with a knife blade rinsed in hot water. If mold will not turn out, wipe the bottom with a cloth wrung out in hot water. Suggestions for garnishes are: sliced carrot, hard-cooked egg, grated horseradish, parsley.</p>

Add sautéed <a id="page189"></a>onion to meat along with all other ingredients, except parsley root, flour or bread crumbs and butter for frying. This should be mixed to a very smooth forcemeat consistency. Add more sour cream or another egg if necessary to make mixture completely smooth. It is best to use your hands for this mixing as they do the most thorough job. With wet hands, shape meat mixture into small cakes, about 1” to 1½″ thick. They should be about the size of the heart of a loin pork chop. Stick a strip of parsley root into one end of each meat cake, to imitate bone in a lamb or pork chop. You can dredge these meat cakes lightly with flour or breadcrumbs or you may fry them as they are. Heat butter in a large heavy skillet and when hot and bubbling add the “chops.” Fry over moderate heat, turning once so that both sides become golden brown. They should be done in about 15 to 20 minutes. Pour butter from pan over chops to serve.</p>

Lard liver well with these strips and sprinkle lightly on all sides with salt and pepper and dredge with flour. Heat butter or other fat in a Dutch oven and when hot, add liver. Brown slowly on all sides, turning with a wooden spoon so you do not pierce surface of meat. It should be sufficiently seared on all sides in 10 minutes. Remove liver and add vegetables to hot fat. Sauté until they begin to soften and turn golden brown, stirring frequently.</p>

  <p class="indent">Return liver to pot, placing it on top of the vegetables. Add stock, cover and simmer slowly but steadily about 2 hours, turning liver once or twice during cooking. Check to see if more liquid is needed as meat cooks. To test liver for doneness, pierce it with a skewer; if no blood oozes out, it is done. Do not test it before 2 hours. Remove liver to a heated platter. Skim excess fat from sauce if there is any. Stir in cream and season to taste with salt and sugar.

  <p class="nonindent">The basic preparations are the same for ox, beef, calf, pig or lamb tongue. The tongue is boiled, or more exactly, simmered, until tender and then prepared and served according to any one of the specific recipes that follow. Although ox tongue is used very often in Germany, it is difficult to get here. Beef tongue is the most popular in the U.S. as well as in Germany. The only difference between that and ox tongue is that the former is much larger, has coarser texture and a stronger flavor. Beef tongue may be had fresh, pickled or smoked. The fresh usually has to be ordered <a id="page201"></a>in advance, while most butchers have the other two on hand at all times. You can generally get especially good uncooked pickled tongues at kosher-style delicatessens and butcher shops. All tongues are cooked whole, with the heavy, bony throat end (Schlund) intact. This, and the skin, are trimmed off after cooking.</p>

  <p class="indent">A beef tongue weighs between 4 and 5 pounds and will serve 6 to 10 people, depending upon the size of their appetites and the way in which the tongue is sliced. Cutting the tongue on the diagonal results in larger slices and much less waste. The Schlund is considered a choice morsel for the cook to pick over, or if it is a smoked tongue, it can be used to flavor a pea or lentil soup, just as a ham bone might. The tongues of calves, lambs and pigs are much smaller, and one would be just about enough for two people, although for hearty eaters, plan one tongue per person. These tongues are peeled and split in half lengthwise, or are sliced, depending on the way they are to be finished. They will cook in 1 to ½ hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">To test any tongue for tenderness, press the tip between your thumb and forefinger. If it gives easily, the meat is done. A beef tongue is usually done when the small bones slip out of the Schlund end, but test the tip to be sure. Tongue should never boil too rapidly, as it will shrink and become hard. It is easier to skin a tongue while it is warm, so it can be allowed to cool just enough to be handled. To speed this process, run the cooked tongue very quickly under running cold water; that will cool the skin but not the meat. It is a good idea to peel a tongue over a wide bowl or rimmed platter, as a great deal of cooking liquid will run out of it.</p>

  <p class="indent">To cook a pickled beef tongue, wash it and place in a deep pot with cold water to cover. Cover pot, bring water to a boil and reduce heat to slow, steady simmer. Skim foam that rises to surface during first ten minutes of cooking. When no more rises, add 1 large whole peeled onion and 1 tablespoon mixed pickling spices. Simmer covered 2½ to 3½ hours, or until tongue tests done.</p>

  <p class="indent">To cook a fresh or smoked beef tongue, follow procedure for pickled tongue but do not use pickling spices. Use a large onion, a bay leaf, and, if you like, any or all the pot vegetables. The onion can be studded with cloves if that flavor will blend with sauce you plan to serve.</p>

  <p class="indent">To cook calves’, lamb or pigs’ tongues, which are always fresh, never smoked or pickled, follow procedure for fresh or smoked beef tongue. Cook 1 to ½ hours, or until tender.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Fresh, pickled or smoked tongue can be boiled, peeled and sliced onto a hot platter, then served with mustard or any one of the sauces noted <a id="page202"></a>below. Where stock is called for in sauce, use tongue’s cooking liquid. If it is too strongly flavored, combine with equal amount of water.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fresh tongue can be prepared with a caper sauce, as described for Calves’ Tongues in Caper Sauce or with any of the hot or cold horseradish sauces in <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Sher_9780307754578_epub_c013_r1.htm">Chapter XIII</a>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pickled tongue is also good with horseradish sauces, or with Brown Sauce made with madeira.</p>

  <p class="indent">Smoked tongue is very good with Mustard Sauce, with Polish Raisin Sauce, made with either beer or madeira, or with Sweet-and-Sour Bacon Sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Almost every housewife or chef has a different version of this. Parboiled sweetbreads cut in fork-size pieces may be simmered in the sauce and sometimes parboiled cauliflower rosettes are also included. A dash of lemon juice can be added as a final touch, and in some cases, cheese is eliminated but a dash of powdered cloves flavors the sauce. Small pieces of braised veal and/or diced smoked ham are considered musts according to some experts, while in Bavaria the sauce is finished off with some sour cream and an egg yolk or two beaten in just before serving. The finished ragout can also be turned into a buttered soufflé-type baker, sprinkled with cheese, dotted with butter and browned in the oven for a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Brains and sweetbreads are so alike in flavor and texture that they require much the same preparation and are almost completely interchangeable <a id="page205"></a>in recipes. They are easy to cook, delicate in flavor, relatively inexpensive and so nutritious it’s a pity Americans do not make more frequent use of them. Although all young animals have sweetbreads (a gland known as the thymus that disappears in grown animals), only those of the calf and lamb are commonly eaten, those of the former being the most popular of all. The calves’ brains are again the most popular, but those of steer, lamb, sheep and pigs are also fairly commonplace on German tables—much more so in homes than in restaurants. Both brains and sweetbreads come in pairs; 1 pair (2 connected lobes) is 1 brain or 1 sweetbread—that is, the brain or sweetbread of one animal. If you are serving them as appetizers, 1 pair of sweetbreads will serve four people, as will 2 pairs of brains. For a light main course, 1 pair of sweetbreads will serve two; for heartier eaters serve 1 pair of sweetbreads per person. When serving brains as an entree, plan on 1 pair per person for light eaters; 2 pairs per person for those with larger appetites. Recipes here refer to calves’ brains, 1 pair of which equals ½ a beef brain or 3 pig, lamb or sheep brains.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>PREPARATION OF BRAINS AND SWEETBREADS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Both brains and sweetbreads require some cleaning and advance preparation before they are used in any of the recipes that follow. They spoil very quickly when absolutely raw, and so the following preparation should be done as soon as possible after getting them home. Once prepared, they may be kept in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.</p>

  <p class="indent">Wash brains or sweetbreads quickly under running water and then soak in icy water 2 or 3 hours. The water should be changed once or twice during soaking and a little lemon juice or vinegar added with last change of water. If bowl is placed in refrigerator during soaking process, water will remain cold enough. After they have soaked, gently pull off as much of membrane and blood streaks as possible, but do not cut into the meat itself or break it into tiny bits. They may be soaked again in ice water, another hour, and then trimmed even more, or, if they seem very clean, they can now be blanched.</p>

  <p class="indent">To blanch sweetbreads, put them in saucepan and cover well with cold water. Add about 1 teaspoon salt and the juice of ¼ lemon to water. You may also add a few slices of onions and celery with the leaves, a sprig of parsley, a bay leaf and a few peppercorns, if you wish. Any or all of these vegetables may be used or eliminated, depending on the flavor you want sweetbreads to have. Simmer, very slowly, uncovered, 15 minutes. Place in icy water a few minutes and trim off any remaining connective tissue or white tubing. The sweetbreads may now be cooked, or they may be kept in refrigerator. Usually they are pressed between two plates for 3 hours so they will flatten and fry or sauté more evenly and be more attractive when sliced and served.</p>

  <p class="indent">To blanch brains follow same procedure as for sweetbreads, with following exceptions: Bring water to a boil with any vegetables you plan <a id="page206"></a>to use and then add brains, salt and lemon juice. Simmer 15 to 20 minutes, or until brains look completely white and solid. A beef brain will require 25 to 30 minutes’ cooking time. Remove brains from liquid and cut away any remaining connective tissue and white tubing. Strain cooking stock and let brains cool in it. If they are to be stored a day or two, they should be covered with stock and refrigerated. As with sweetbreads, brains may or may not be flattened between two plates.</p>

  <p class="indent">You will find varying procedures in different cookbooks for above preparations, although, basically, all are the same as to soaking, trimming and blanching. If you have never prepared these meats before, you may wonder which is correct and what will happen to you if you follow the wrong instructions. The answers are simple : all are correct and nothing will happen, even if you were to eat these meats raw, a prospect that may not sound appetizing to you but which nutritionists think is a superb idea—something to do with B vitamins, I believe. Follow whichever method seems easiest to you, but do soak in ice water and remove blood streaks before blanching (or eating raw). If you find it easier to remove membranes after blanching, then do so. If you find it easier to cut white tubing away <em>before</em> blanching instead of after, do that too.</p>

  <p class="indent">Brains and sweetbreads freeze very well. It is a good idea to soak and remove membranes and blood streaks before freezing. Wrap in aluminum foil or freezing paper, and freeze. Thaw meat as you blanch it, but simmer 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until completely thawed and cooked. Never freeze sweetbreads after they are blanched or cooked.</p>

Heat fat in a small heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid. When hot, add heart and brown slowly on all sides. Add water, cover and simmer slowly but steadily 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until heart is completely tender when pierced with a carving fork or skewer. Turn once or twice during cooking and add more water if necessary. When heart is tender, blend flour into sour cream and stir into pan juices.

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 cups cooking stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash lung well under running cold water. Put in a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid and cover with 6 cups water to which you add a little salt. Add prepared pot vegetables, onion, lemon, peppercorns, bay leaf and vinegar. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily ½ to 2 hours, or until lung is completely tender. Drain and reserve stock. Press lung flat under a weighted plate and refrigerate several hours. When it is cold and very flat, cut into fine noodle strips. Strain stock and pour it over strips; marinate in refrigerator 24 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Melt butter in a large saucepan and when hot and bubbling, stir in flour and sugar. Sauté slowly, stirring constantly until Einbrenne turns a rich brown coffee color. Do this very slowly and watch carefully, as sugar turns brown all at once and can burn suddenly. Pour 3 cups of cooking stock into Einbrenne and stir in with a wire whisk or wooden spoon, over low heat, until you have a smooth sauce. Add lung strips and season sauce with salt and pepper. If sauce becomes too thick, add more stock. Cover and simmer slowly about 30 minutes. Season with a little more vinegar if necessary. Serve with Bread Dumplings.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>vinegar or lemon juice to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>sugar to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons sour cream (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page211"></a>The coating of fat and the outside membrane should be removed from kidneys by you or your butcher. This must be done carefully so that the meat itself is not broken. Most of the extra knob of fat on kidney underside should be trimmed away as well. Cut in half lengthwise. Pork kidneys should be washed under cold running water a few minutes. This is not necessary with lamb or veal kidneys. Cut kidneys into thin, crosswise slices. Heat butter in a skillet with a cover. When hot and bubbling, add kidney slices and sauté over high heat about 3 minutes, or until kidney slices turn gray. Remove to a heated platter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add onion to fat; sauté and stir until it becomes transparent and takes on a yellow color. Sprinkle with flour; stir and sauté over low heat until flour is absorbed and begins to turn bright yellow, about 3 or 4 minutes. Return kidneys to pan, add stock or water, cover and simmer about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper and flavor with enough vinegar or lemon juice to give sauce a decided sharp edge. Add a little sugar if necessary. You may serve kidneys at this point, or stir in sour cream if you want to use it.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">It is very important that kidneys do not sauté for more than 3 or 4 minutes; if they do they will become tough and leathery. It is better for them to be a little underdone as they will finish cooking in sauce.</p>

Since this dish is such a special and typical Sunday dinner feature in the farmhouses of the Rhine Palatinate district, it seemed worth including. Naturally, the thing to drink with it is one of the golden Rhine wines of the area.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 GENEROUS SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">There are several interesting dishes to be made from a calf’s head and all require the same basic preparation. You will probably have to order the head from your butcher several days or a week in advance. Have him clean it and remove the snout. The tongue and brains should also be taken out and cooked separately, as they require far less cooking time than rest of head. One head will serve about 12 people. In some neighborhoods, where this is very popular, it is possible to buy half a head. The head is boiled as follows, before the meat is used for any of the other dishes in this chapter.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>BASIC PREPARATION FOR CALF’S HEAD</strong></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 calf’s head, cleaned</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion studded with 4 or 5 cloves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 knob celery, peeled and sliced, or 4 stalks celery with tops</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 sprigs parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 carroty scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 to 10 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Place head in a deep pot with water to cover. Bring to boil and cook rapidly about 10 minutes, skimming surface of water as scum rises. Add all vegetables and seasoning to pot, reduce heat, cover and simmer slowly but steadily for ½ hours. Add tongue and continue cooking about 2½ hours more, or until meat is tender and begins to fall away from bone. To cook brains, prepare as described, but use some of the liquid in which head cooked instead of plain water. The head, tongue and brains should be removed from cooking liquid, then drained and cooled. Proceed as described for specific recipes below. The stock should be strained and reserved for making soups, gravies, etc. The sliced meat of veal, tongue and brains can be made into a Sülze, as described. Substitute head meat and use cooking stock for an aspic, adding gelatin or a calf’s foot so it will jell.</p>

Cut brains into fork-size pieces. While still warm, cover with <a id="page214"></a>a double recipe of a good vinaigrette dressing. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours and then refrigerate 1 hour before serving. This is very good as an appetizer or light entree.</p>

Pick pieces of meat off head in long strips, and peel and slice tongue and brains if you want to prepare them this way. Dip each piece of meat in egg beaten with a little water and then dredge with breadcrumbs. Heat some butter or lard in a skillet and when hot, add breaded meat. Fry over moderately high heat, turning once so both sides are golden brown. Drain quickly on paper towel, sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.

  <p class="nonindent">In addition to being made into Sülze calves’ feet are cooked the same as the head. Feet should be scraped, scrubbed, washed, blanched in boiling water 10 minutes, split and then boiled in water to cover along with vegetables and seasonings. They will be cooked in about ½ hours, or when meat begins to fall away from bone. Drain and cool. Pick meat from bone and prepare as described for Calf’s Head Vinaigrette or Browned Calf’s Head (above). Strain stock and reserve. It is excellent for making aspic dishes.

  <p class="nonindent">Literally, Labskaus (lobscouse in English) means “scow refreshment.” It is a sailors’ stew or hash that dates back to the days of the windjammers, when galleys had to be stocked with foods that were not perishable, hence the use of pickled meat and salt herring in this dish. Labskaus still appears in the “big three” cities of the Hanseatic League—Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck, as well as in such major Hansa outposts as Bergen, Oslo, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and London. In Germany, the meat and potatoes for Labskaus are so finely ground that the consistency is close to a porridge; in Scandinavia the ingredients are cubed or diced and the results are closer to a stew. As you might expect with a dish that has such a long history, dozens of versions have developed, each avowed to be the only authentic one by its particular enthusiasts. The best Labskaus I had in Germany was in the Schiffergesellschaft in Lubeck. Again, they were kind enough to let me have this recipe along with the variations that follow it. Although Labskaus is really a family-style entree, not suitable for elegant entertaining, it would make a very unusual and tempting main course for a Sunday-brunch party.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 1½ pounds corned beef or pickled pork</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 white peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small matjes or salt herring, chopped</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 anchovy filets, minced, or 2 teaspoons anchovy paste (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup chopped, drained, pickled beets</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cook peeled potatoes in <em>unsalted</em> water to cover, until done. Drain well and return potatoes to pot. Shake back and forth gently several times over low heat until dry and mealy. Mash or purée in a food mill. Grind meat through finest blade of food chopper. Also grind onions and peppercorns. Heat butter in heavy casserole or stew pot and when hot and bubbling, add ground onion and peppercorns. Sauté over low heat 2 or 3 minutes or until mixture just begins to turn yellow. Stir in meat and continue sautéing until it loses its bright red color, but do not let it brown. Stir mashed potatoes into meat and onion mixture until well blended. Mixture should be fairly stiff. Mix in chopped herring, anchovies or anchovy paste, if you are using either, and pickled beets. Cover and simmer over low heat, adding just a little water as needed to keep mixture from scorching. Simmer 15 to 18 minutes, or until completely cooked. Season with salt and more ground white pepper if needed. Each portion should be topped with an egg fried in butter and a slice or two of sour pickle.</p>
