<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">In many ways, this popular paella is a variation on paella valenciana, the authentic and original paella from around Valencia. This one has just rabbit, leaving out the snails, and instead of green beans calls for artichokes. When the artichokes are in peak season in winter, Tía Encarnita—one of the “aunts” in the ancestral village of my mother-in-law, who frequently prepares dazzling paellas (always outside over embers, and always served in the center of the table to be eaten from the pan with a spoon)—likes to make this one. This paella is particularly nice over embers. To prepare it outside for smokier, earthier flavors, and an all-round most festive experience, <a href="100-boxnote17.html#page_143"><span class="red">see page 143</span></a>. You can substitute bone-in chicken for the rabbit. Before preparing, see my list of hints, suggestions, and techniques on <a href="97-boxnote16.html#page_136"><span class="red">page 136</span></a>.</span></strong></p>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Cut the rabbit into eight or nine pieces, following the directions on <a href="254-chapter190.html#page_342">page 342</a> (or have your butcher do it). Season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Fill a large bowl with cool water. Cut the lemon into wedges, squeeze them into the water, and then drop them into the bowl. Trim the artichokes following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>, making sure the tough outer leaves have been stripped away. Cut the artichokes into eighths and drop in the lemon water to keep from darkening until ready to cook.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a 16- to 18-inch/40- to 45-cm paella pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the rabbit and cook, turning frequently, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Move the rabbit pieces to the outside of the pan (watching that they do not burn) and begin making a sofrito in the center of the pan: Drain the artichokes and add along with the bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, garlic, and 2 pinches of salt and cook, continuing to stir frequently, until the tomato begins to darken, <a id="page_139"/>about 8 minutes. If it begins to dry out, splash in a bit of water. Mix the rabbit into the sofrito and continue to cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the tomato is pulpy and has lost its acidity.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> When the sofrito is ready, sprinkle in the pimentón, letting the flavors meld for a just few seconds while stirring constantly, and then immediately add 1 cup/300 ml of the stock. Simmer over medium heat until the liquid is just about evaporated and the rabbit is quite tender, about 30 minutes. Add in a touch more water if necessary to keep it moist.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Add the remaining 7 cups/1.7 L of stock with the saffron, increase the heat to high, and bring the liquid to a boil. When the liquid comes to a boil, sprinkle the rice around the pan. With a wooden spoon, check that the rice is evenly distributed and that the grains are below the surface of the liquid. Do not stir again.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Cook uncovered for 10 minutes over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook uncovered for 8 to 10 minutes more, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice grains are tender but still have an al dente bite to them. If all the liquid has evaporated and the rice is still not done, shake tepid water tablespoon by tablespoon over the rice where needed and cook for an additional few minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Remove the paella from the heat, cross wooden spoons over top, cover with paper towels, and let rest for 5 minutes to allow the rice—particularly the grains on top—to finish cooking and the starches to firm up.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">8.</span> Carry the paella to the table and serve from the pan.</p>
