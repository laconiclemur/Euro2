<p class="nonindent" id="p1">What are tapas? Tapas are a way of eating, and a way of living. When you visit Spain, you realize this right away. Over the last twenty or thirty years, a tradition that started in southern Spain has spread across every region of the country, and ultimately around the world. Today it’s one of the most original ways of eating, a shared experience that is more sociable and more affordable than any fancy, sit-down restaurant. More often than not, people in Spain eat their tapas standing in bars and chatting with their friends.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p2">You may have heard stories about how tapas started out as something to cover a glass of wine in taverns. The word <span class="italic">tapa</span> means lid, and the idea is that the food (perhaps a slice of ham) was used to protect a drink from flies or other foreign objects. Yet there are no historical accounts or records of any such thing. Many people think this story is just a myth, even if it’s been widely repeated over time. What we do know is that tapas are a part of Mediterranean culture, not so different from Greek and Turkish <span class="italic">mezze</span> or the multiple dishes at a Moroccan feast.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p3">Initially tapas were just a few olives, anchovies, or mussels on a small plate. But they’ve ended up being almost anything served in small portions. In the Basque country, they’re called <span class="italic">pinchos</span>, after the toothpick that holds them together. The most famous is called Gilda, after the Rita Hayworth movie of the 1940s: an olive, a guindilla sweet pepper in vinegar, and a marinated anchovy, all held together by a toothpick. More commonly, <span class="italic">pinchos</span> rest on a small round slice of bread. When you walk into a bar like Bergara in a town like San Sebastián, you’ll find platters of <span class="italic">pinchos</span>—of foie gras with mango, and mushrooms in seafood sauce—sitting on the countertops, waiting for you to help yourself.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p4">For me, tapas are something to share and mix. There are no rigid rules about separating meat and chicken, fish and vegetables. There are no appetizers and entrees. You can build a whole meal around a series of dishes that you like. You’ll find egg dishes <a id="page14"/>that are perfect for brunch, salads that are great for a summer lunch, and meats that are perfect for dinner. Or you could just as easily eat the salads for brunch, the meats at lunch, and the eggs for dinner. Try mixing dishes according to your taste. With tapas, the eating and sharing are just as important as the food you’re serving. And if you like the tapa and don’t want to make other small dishes, you can easily double the quantities in these recipes to make an entree for four people.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p5">To help select your tapas, this book is organized by ingredient, like cheese, eggs, onions, potatoes. They’re all foods you can find at your local supermarket. Some ingredients are particular to Spanish cooking, like the sweet, smoky paprika called <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, which gives our chorizo sausages such a wonderfully intense flavor. For these few Spanish specialties, there’s a list of suppliers at the back of the book.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p6">Since I arrived in the United States, Spanish food has become more widely distributed than ever. You can find real Manchego cheese in Safeway and real wood-roasted piquillo peppers in Whole Foods or Wegmans. <span class="italic">Jamón serrano</span>, our dry-cured ham, is one of the best in the world and worth seeking out from a specialist. Spanish meat producers have perfected the curing technique better than anyone else, and even our more affordable hams are superior to their international rivals. As for Spanish olive oil, it’s the essence of Spanish cooking. Just as Spanish wine reflects the authentic flavor of the land and climate of Spain, our olive oil is rooted in Spanish tradition and is at the heart of many of the tapas you’ll find here.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p7">Spanish wines are themselves becoming more and more widely available. With each tapa, I’ve recommended a wine, including its area of origin in Spain and the grape variety. From the classic red Tempranillo grape (used in Rioja and Ribera del Duero) to the Alvariño white grape, Spanish wines have an incredible range and versatility, which are great to explore alongside the recipes in this book. And don’t forget the exquisite sherry wines, which remain underappreciated by the wider world.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p8"><a id="page15"/>There was a time when many Italian foods were hard to find and Moroccan couscous was an exotic rarity. Now you can find them everywhere, and I believe that many Spanish ingredients will soon find their rightful place on the shelves of American supermarkets across the country. In the meantime, my first suggestion is to buy plenty of extra-virgin olive oil (a Spanish one, of course). You’ll be using a lot of it in these dishes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p9">This book is aimed at the home cook, not the professional, because tapas are for eating at home or with friends. It doesn’t demand special expertise, even if there are techniques that might seem a little new. And it doesn’t require any expensive equipment, although you might consider investing in good candy and meat thermometers, as well as a mortar and pestle (if you don’t already have them). I hope you enjoy exploring Spanish food, and enjoy the life of tapas. <span class="italic">Buen provecho!</span></p>
