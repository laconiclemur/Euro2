Under correct conditions, bacteria reproduce rapidly and the populations can grow very large. Temperature and time are factors that affect bacterial growth most. Below 45° F (7° C) bacteria grow slowly and at temperatures above 140° F (60° C) they start to die. In the so called “danger zone” between 40-140° F (6 - 60° C) bacteria grow quite well. Most bacteria will grow exponentially at temperatures between 70° F and 120° F (21-49° C). Bacteria don’t grow in size but reproduce by dividing. It is assumed that under ideal conditions bacteria divide every 20 minutes. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">What is Botulism?</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Botulism, once known as a sausage disease, is a rare but serious food-borne disease that can be fatal. Food borne botulism can be especially dangerous because many people can be poisoned at once. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Clostridium botulinum</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> is found in soil and aquatic sediments all over the world. The bacteria can form a spore that is very resistant to heat and chemicals. Like plant seeds, it can lie dormant for years. The optimal temperature range for the growth of botulinum bacteria is 78-95° F (26-35° C) and it significantly slows down at 118° F (48° C). At 140° F (60° C), botulinum spores do not develop into toxins, although they are heat resistant. They will survive in boiling water (212° F, 100° C) for up to 5 hours.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">How To Prevent Botulism</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The answer lies in the use of nitrates/nitrites. When present, they prevent the transformation of </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">C. botulinum</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> spores to toxins. It is almost like applying a vaccine to eliminate a disease. Nitrates are cheap, commonly available, and completely safe in amounts recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. So why not use them? All commercial plants do. Nitrates are needed only when smoking meats. You don’t need nitrates when barbecuing or grilling, as the temperatures are high enough to inhibit or kill botulinum spores. Botulinum spores will die in a matter of minutes at 250º F (121º C).</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Trichinae</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Trichinae is an illness caused by the consumption of raw or under cooked meat infected with </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">“trichinella spiralis.”</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> It is a round worm that can migrate from the digestive tract and settle in the form of cysts in various muscles of the body. The disease is almost non-existent in American pigs due to their strictly controlled feed, but it can still be found in wild boar and wild game. Trichinae in pork is killed by raising the internal temperature of meat to 137°F (58º C). The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations requires pork to be cooked for 1 minute at 140º F (60º C). We can not apply these procedures to a product that is not supposed to be cooked. Fortunately, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">storing pork at low temperatures also kills trichinae.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9, Volume 2, Citr: 9 CFR318.10 requires that pork intended for use in processed products be frozen at:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Group 1</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> - comprises product in separate pieces not exceeding 6 “ (15 cm) in thickness, or arranged on separate racks with layers not exceeding 6” (15 cm) in depth, or stored in crates or boxes not exceeding 6” (15 cm) in depth, or stored as solidly frozen blocks not exceeding 6” (15 cm) in thickness.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Group 2</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> - comprises product in pieces, layers, or within containers, the thickness of which exceeds 6” (15 cm) but not 27” (68 cm) and product in containers including tierces, barrels, kegs, and cartons having a thickness not exceeding 27” (68 cm).</span></p><table border="1" class="calibre4" valign="top"><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_27" colspan="4" valign="top"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_28">Table 1.

Any invading bacteria will be destroyed by the animal’s immune system. Most bacteria are present on the skin and in the intestines. The slaughtering process starts introducing bacteria into the exposed surfaces. In a large piece of meat the outside surface serves as a natural barrier preventing access to bacteria. Every time we create a new surface cut with a knife we create an opening for bacteria to enter the meat from the outside and start spoiling it. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The more cuts, the more spoils of meat and that is the reason why ground meat has the shortest shelf life. In a stressed animal bacteria are able to travel from the animal’s gut right through the casing into the meat. Duties like cutting meat, grinding, mixing or stuffing all increase meat temperature and should be performed in the kitchen at the lowest possible temperatures and as fast as possible. Otherwise we create conditions for the growth of bacteria and that will decrease the shelf life of the product. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">To sum it up make sure that:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Meat is very fresh and always kept cold.</span></span></span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Facilities and tools are very clean.</span></span></span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Working temperatures are as low as possible.</span></span></span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Take only what you need rule always applies.</span></span></span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Temperature Control </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">If you live in a tropical climate without air conditioning, try to process meat in the evening or early morning hours and work with a small portion of meat at one time.
