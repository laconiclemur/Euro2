<h2 class="h2b">CÔTES DE BOEUF AVEC OIGNONS ROUGES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Ribs of Beef with Red Onions and Garlic</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>France is a nation of carnivores, and the Provençaux are no exception. Steak and chips are eaten and loved here as much as any of the fish and vegetables. The favoured way of cooking ribs or any cut of beef is grilling them over vine trimmings outdoors. Although I enjoy the intense smoky flavour this gives the beef, I always miss the wonderful caramelised bits that get stuck to the bottom of the pan which make the base for a wonderful jus or, as here, flavoured butter. This is a garlic lovers’ recipe so if it looks like being a little strong for your taste just halve the quantity</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2 wing ribs of beef, 1.25kg (2lb 12oz) each<br/>
60g (2¼ oz) beef dripping<br/>
100g (3½ oz) butter<br/>
4 red onions, peeled and quartered<br/>
8 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed<br/>
1 large bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks<br/>
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.</p>
<p class="normala">Trim the ribs of beef, keeping any bits to help with the jus. Heat a large pan or roasting tray with the dripping. Season the ribs well and pan-fry them for a couple of minutes on each side, adding half the butter after a minute or so, until they are a wonderful golden brown.</p>
<p class="normala">Lift the ribs out on to a warmed plate and toss the quartered onions and any beef trimmings into the tray. Fry these for a few minutes, then put the ribs back in the pan along with any juices that have escaped and roast them in the preheated oven for about half an hour for medium rare, or a little longer for medium.</p>
<p class="normala">Take the ribs out and let them rest in a warm place for about 10 minutes, then add the remaining butter to the pan and scrape any caramelised juices off the bottom. Add the garlic and sweat it for a minute, then throw in the parsley leaves along with some salt and pepper. Stir all of this into the onions, carve the beef, and serve.</p>
