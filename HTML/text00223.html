 ROSE &amp; PISTACHIO DACQUOISE FLOWER</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_Dlavd" id="nad0002365">
<em>It took me longer to work how to pronounce ‘dacquoise’ than to actually make it! A dacquoise is essentially a meringue, but with crushed nuts folded through. Not too dissimilar to a macaron, but a lot easier. It’s a light dessert that takes a bit of work, but the results are spectacular. Whether you have guests coming over or you are taking this to a friend’s house, it’s one of those creations where everyone can see you’ve made an effort. The fragrant combination of rose and pistachio adds even more wow factor.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002384">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the pistachios into a food processor and blitz until they are coarsely ground. Place them in an even layer across a baking tray and place in the oven for 10–12 minutes, making sure to stir them every 3–4 minutes. The nuts need to be toasted and dried out.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002385">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Take the nuts out of the oven, put into a bowl and leave them to cool completely. Reduce the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/gas 2.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002386">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Once the nuts are cold, stir in 100g of sugar and the cornflour and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002387">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Line three baking trays with baking paper. Draw a 20cm circle on one piece. Now draw 4 lines across the circle so that they intersect in the middle, to divide the circle into 8 equal wedges – the way a cake would look if it was cut into 8 slices. Round off the edge of each wedge so that they are petal-shaped. Do the same on the other two pieces of paper, using the first as a template to trace over. Turn the paper over so it is pencil-side down.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002388">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk for a few minutes, until frothy and increasing in volume. Now add the remaining 200g of sugar, a tablespoon at a time, still whisking, until you have used all the sugar. The mixture should now be stiff and glossy.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002389">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Add the pistachio mix to the meringue and fold it all in gently, making sure there are no dry nut bits.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002390">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Fit a piping bag with a plain 1.5cm nozzle and stand it inside a tall glass. Put the mixture into the piping bag and pipe the meringue inside the pencil lines, to fill in the flower shapes on all three trays.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002392">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Place all three trays in the oven and bake for 1 hour, making sure to swap the top and bottom trays over halfway through, to ensure an even <a id="pg272"></a>
 bake.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002393">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Once the hour is up, turn off the oven and open the door. Leave the meringues in the oven for at least an hour before taking them out. If you can wait longer, leave them until the oven is totally cold.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002394">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile make the rose custard. Put the milk into a pan and bring to a simmer, then take off the heat and set aside. Put the egg yolks, sugar, rose syrup and cornflour into a bowl and whisk together. Slowly pour in the milk in a slow stream, making sure to whisk all the time. This is where you may need someone else to help.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002395">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>12.</strong>
</span>
 Once all the milk is added, pour the mixture back into the pan on a low heat and bring to a simmer, whisking all the time. Then continue to whisk for 2–3 minutes, until it thickens. The custard needs to be thick enough to spread on the sides of the dacquoise.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002396">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>13.</strong>
</span>
 Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool completely. Once cool, the custard will be quite thick, so you’ll need to whisk it gently to loosen it just a little.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002397">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>14.</strong>
</span>
 Once the rose custard is cooled, whip up the cream to soft peaks. Add half the whipped cream to the cooled custard and fold in. Then fold in the rest of the cream. Set aside in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002398">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>15.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile choose the best of your flower meringues and put it aside to make the top layer of the dacquoise. Brush the melted white chocolate over the tops of the other two meringues – the chocolate will stop the moisture from the rose custard seeping through.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002399">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>16.</strong>
</span>
 Once the chocolate has set, it’s time to assemble. Divide the rose custard into two batches, one for filling, one for covering the sides. Put the second batch aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002400">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>17.</strong>
</span>
 Using the first batch, place one of the meringues on a serving dish, chocolate side up, and spread with a thin layer of the rose custard. Place the next chocolate-covered meringue on top and cover with more rose custard. Place the third and final meringue, the one you set aside, on top.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002401">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>18.</strong>
</span>
 Using an angled spatula, cover the sides of the dacquoise with the second batch of rose custard. This will hide any imperfections. Take your time to make it all neat.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002402">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>19.</strong>
</span>
 Now mix the blitzed rose petal and pistachio crumbs. Using your hands, press the crumb mixture all over the sides of the dacquoise.</p>

 <em>To make homemade crystallized petals, brush organic rose petals (having made sure they are clean) with egg white, then cover them with caster sugar and leave them to dry.</em>
