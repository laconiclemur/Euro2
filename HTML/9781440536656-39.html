				<p class="recipesidebarhead">Soak Your Cod</p>
				<p class="recipesidebar">To cook with salt cod, it must be soaked overnight to remove the excess salt that is used to preserve it. Soak it in cold water, changing it several times. Drain and rinse it and it will be ready to cook. Simmer the cod in milk (2 cups per 1 pound of salt cod) and water to cover for 20 minutes. Drain the cod, separate it into flakes, and remove any bone or skin. Your salt cod is now ready to use in recipes.</p></div>
