<p class="tx2"><b>The batter for this pancake needs to be made three hours before it is used. During this time the flour soaks up the water. It is often served with freshly ground black pepper, chopped rosemary and fresh Pecorino or ricotta, Brie or Camembert on top. It is a useful gluten-free recipe for those in need.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 8 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>150 g (5 oz/1⅔ cups) chickpea (gram) flour</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2¼ cups) cold water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 sprig of rosemary, leaves picked</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) Pecorino, ricotta, Brie or Camembert, thinly sliced, to serve (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Line a 25 cm (10 in) tart tin with baking parchment. Put the flour, water, salt, ¼ teaspoon of pepper and the oil into a large bowl and whisk, either by hand or using an electric mixer. Cover with cling film (plastic wrap) and leave to rest at room temperature for 3 hours.</p>
<p class="tx">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Pour the <i>cecina</i> batter into the prepared tin and scatter over the rosemary leaves, discarding the stem. Bake in the oven for around 50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and starting to crisp. Remove the pancake from the oven and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before removing it from the tin and peeling off the paper. Top with some more black pepper and thinly sliced cheese, if using, then serve warm, cut into triangles.</p>
