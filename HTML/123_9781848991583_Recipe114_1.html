<p class="normal"><b>I am not a vegetarian, but I do eat a lot of vegetarian dishes, especially in the spring and summer, when I really like like the colors, taste and freshness of them. The only downside is I am often left wanting more, so I like to make generous portions. That’s what you’ll find with these spring vegetables complemented with a modern watercress dressing and some perfectly poached quail eggs.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus making the dressing</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 50 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 bunches watercress, main stems discarded</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup French Dressing (see <a href="012_9781848991583_Recipe6.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 ounces Chantenay or other young carrots, scrubbed</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 ounces baby leeks, trimmed</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 ounces baby turnips, trimmed</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 ounces baby zucchini</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 ounces baby corn cobs</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small bunches thin, young asparagus, trimmed and cut in half</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups thin, young green beans cut in half</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 ounces baby new potatoes, scrubbed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 bunch scallions, white part only, green part kept for another dish</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 ounces baby chargrilled artichokes in olive oil, drained</p>
<p class="acktxt">16 quail eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put 2 small handfuls of watercress leaves to one side. Bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the remaining watercress and blanch 30 seconds. Drain and refresh the leaves in ice water, then drain again quickly so there’s still water on the leaves. Put them into a spice grinder or small blender and blitz to a fine puree. Pass the puree through a fine strainer, pressing down into the strainer to release as much juice as possible; there should be about 6 tablespoons juice. Whisk the juice into the French dressing, season with salt and pepper and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the carrots and blanch 2 to 5 minutes until they are just tender. Use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the pan, then drain and refresh in ice water, drain again and tip carefully into a bowl. One at a time, blanch all the other vegetables, except the artichokes, in the same way in the same water, then transfer them to a bowl. Keep the saucepan of water for reheating when you are ready to serve.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Bring another small saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the vinegar and then crack the eggs into the water and return it to just above a simmer—you want the water to be bubbling so the eggs don’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Simmer 2 minutes, then lift out the eggs and cool them in a bowl of ice water. Drain them on paper towels, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Return the saucepan of vegetable water to a boil. Add all the vegetables, including the artichokes, and cook 2 minutes, or until they are hot. Lift them out of the pan using a slotted spoon and put on paper towels to drain. Add the quail eggs to the pan of water and heat through 15 to 20 seconds until hot, then drain and pat dry.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Drizzle the vegetables with the watercress dressing, and top with the quail eggs, then serve with a scattering of watercress leaves.</p>
