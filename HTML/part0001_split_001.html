			<p class="rec-intro">The addition of rice to this soup makes it wonderfully creamy and smooth. Bacon fat gives a lovely depth, but you can use vegetable oil if you prefer and if you’d like to keep the soup vegetarian, make it with good vegetable stock (see <a href="part0010_split_001.html#Vegetable-stock">here</a>). There are many stories about the origins of the name of this soup, but it could be linked to the famous Battle of Crécy, fought between the French and the British in 1346. Legend has it that the battle took place on a field of carrots. </p>

Pour in the stock and simmer for 20 minutes until the rice is cooked. Slice the heritage carrots into thin slivers on a mandolin and set them aside.</p>
