<p class="nonindent">Melt-in-the-mouth venison steak is never better complemented than with port.</p>
<p class="hanging01">generous 1/2 lb. venison steak, trimmed</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 sprigs fresh thyme</p>
<p class="hanging">4 juniper berries, smashed</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, roughly crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">7 tbsp. port</p>
<p class="hanging">scant 1 cup homemade beef stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1 stick cinnamon</p>
<p class="hanging">1 3/4 cups milk</p>
<p class="hanging">9 oz. celeriac, peeled and cubed</p>
<p class="hanging02">dash red wine vinegar</p>
<p class="nonindent">Season the venison generously all over with salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a heavy skillet over medium heat, heat oil and half the butter. Fry the venison for 2–3 minutes until browned on all sides. Add the thyme, juniper berries, and garlic to the pan, and cook on low heat for 10 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the venison from the pan, set aside, and cover to rest for 10 minutes. Deglaze the skillet with the port, then add the beef stock and cinnamon, and gently reduce over medium heat. Meanwhile, season the milk well with salt and pepper and gently poach the celeriac until tender. Drain the celeriac, reserving the cooking liquid. Add the celeriac and the remaining butter to a blender with a splash of the cooking liquid and blend until completely smooth. Add a dash of vinegar to the port sauce to sharpen the flavor. Remove the cinnamon and juniper berries. Slice the venison into 4 pieces and serve on a bed of celeriac puree with a liberal drizzling of port reduction.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Quail with a Middle Eastern influence, coated in five-spice powder and finished in piquant pomegranate molasses and seeds.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 medium quail (about 5 oz. each)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. five-spice powder</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">good drizzle of olive oil, plus 1 tbsp.</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. pomegranate molasses</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. pomegranate seeds</p>
<p class="nonindent">Rinse the quail under cold running water and pat dry. Rub the skins vigorously with the five-spice powder and plenty of salt and pepper, then cover and set aside for 1 hour for the flavors to really mingle with the meat.</p>
<p class="extract">After 1 hour, preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the quail, breast-side down. Cook for 3–4 minutes until lightly browned, then transfer to a roasting pan, breasts facing up. Finish cooking in the oven for 6–8 minutes. To test that the meat is juicy but not raw, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the breast. If the liquid runs clear, remove from the heat and keep warm while resting.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, heat the pomegranate molasses, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and cinnamon in a small saucepan. Carve the quails into quarters, removing and discarding the backbone. Serve the quail pieces on a platter, drizzled with a little pomegranate sauce and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The classic cassoulet is slow-cooked beans with duck and Toulouse sausages, but there is no reason not to be slightly creative with the term. Here, we have a rich bean cassoulet topped with perfectly cooked pheasant and seasoned crumbs.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 young plump-breasted pheasant, skin on</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. olive oil, plus extra for topping</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">scant 1/2 lb. cubed bacon</p>
<p class="hanging">1 3/4 cups dry white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">1 3/4 cups homemade chicken stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bay leaf, bruised</p>
<p class="hanging">3 sprigs fresh thyme</p>
<p class="hanging">1 (14–oz.) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</p>
<p class="hanging">zest and juice of 1/2 small lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup fresh white bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tsp. butter, melted</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the oven to 350°F. Pat dry the pheasant’s skin with paper towels and rub all over with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">In a large, heavy Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons oil until very hot, then brown the pheasant on all sides. Remove the bird and set aside. Lower the heat to medium. In the remaining oil, fry the onion and bacon until the onion is soft and the bacon cubes are lightly golden. Pour in the wine and let it bubble down for 1 minute to burn away the alcohol. Give the mixture a good stir to scrape up any pheasant scraps stuck to the bottom of the pan, then add the chicken stock, bay leaf, thyme, beans, and lemon zest and juice. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, mix together the crumbs, parsley, butter, and a little olive oil. Return the pheasant to the pot, pushing it down till halfway submerged in the cassoulet. Sprinkle with the crumb mixture and cook in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and cook, uncovered, for a further 10 minutes until the pheasant juices run clear when poked with a skewer. Serve right from the oven, in the Dutch oven, with everyone just grabbing a fork and digging in.</p>

<div class="dis_img"><img alt="" src="images/9781416207306_134.jpg"/></div>
<h3 class="section"><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c08_r1.htm#page222">see variations</a></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Wild boar has a much gamier flavor than pork, but it still feels like you’re eating the same beast. So for game novices, this is the one to start with. As in the theory that what goes together grows together, I always imagine wild boars snuffling at wild mushrooms, thus making the perfect pairing.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 cloves garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 shallots, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 fresh bay leaves, bruised</p>
<p class="hanging">1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">4 juniper berries, lightly pounded in a pestle and mortar</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup red wine</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">generous 1/2 lb. wild boar shoulder, diced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups homemade chicken stock</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1 oz.) canned chestnuts, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">10 oz. wild mushrooms</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tbsp. light cream</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a large bowl, make a marinade for the meat by mixing the garlic, 3 tablespoons olive oil, shallots, celery, fresh herbs, juniper berries, half the wine, and salt and pepper. Whisk well until the marinade has emulsified. Add the boar meat and toss to make sure it is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 300°F. Over high heat, heat a Dutch oven and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Remove the meat from the marinade and brown it well in the hot oil. Set meat aside, add the flour to the pot, and cook for 1 minute. Add the reserved marinade and cook until softened and the vegetables are beginning to caramelize. Return the meat to the <a id="page209"/>pot along with the stock and chestnuts. Bring to a boil, cover, and place in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Just before serving, melt the butter in a skillet and fry the mushrooms for 4–5 minutes or until brown. Stir into the casserole with the cream and serve right away with crusty bread.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Normally to make a ballotine — a boned and rolled joint — is considered a little bit tricky. So get your butcher to do the hard work of boning the meat, leaving you the easy task of stuffing and rolling. The result is fantastic juicy meat with aromatic stuffing.</p>
<p class="hanging01">3 sprigs fresh rosemary, plus extra for the beans</p>
<p class="hanging">1 whole rabbit, deboned and in 1 piece</p>
<p class="hanging">4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 lb. chopped lean pancetta slices</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 lb. pancetta cubes</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">7 tbsp. homemade chicken stock</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 (14–oz.) can cannellini beans, drained</p>
<p class="nonindent">Lay the rabbit on a working surface, skin-side down, and spread the herbs and chopped pancetta slices along the length of the breast at one end. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. To make the ballotine, fold the breast over the stuffing and roll up tightly in plastic wrap, twisting the sides securely. Bring a large pan of water to a boil, put the wrapped ballotine in the water, and simmer for 25 minutes to poach. Remove, set aside, and let cool slightly Unwrap the ballotine. Heat a medium-sized skillet over medium to high heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, and fry the ballotine until golden all over. This will take about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and let it rest. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat the remaining oil and fry the pancetta cubes until golden. Add the wine and allow to reduce by two-thirds. Pour in the chicken stock, 2 halved rosemary sprigs, and cannellini beans. Let cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring gently now and again, being careful not to break up the beans. Slice the rabbit ballotine into 8 thin rounds. Serve the slices with any juices on top of the hot beans.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Pedro Ximénez is a really thick, syrupy sweet sherry. Chicken livers are balanced perfectly by this sweetness, and this finished dish is all pulled together by the crisp saltiness of the Iberico ham (dry-cured Spanish ham).</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">4 thin slices Iberico ham</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">3 oz. fresh chicken livers, fat removed</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/3 cup Pedro Ximénez sherry</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the butter and oil in a large heavy pan until really hot and the butter is foaming. Fry the ham quickly for 1 minute, until it begins to crisp up. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Season the chicken livers well and cook for 30 seconds on each side. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Add the Pedro Ximénez to the pan and reduce by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="extract">Pile the livers on a plate and top with the crisp ham. Serve drizzled with a few spoonfuls of the sherry reduction.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This Spanish and much finer version of the classic liver with bacon and onions is enriched with sweet sherry, which makes it the most delicious way to serve calf’s liver.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">4 baby onions or small shallots, peeled and halved</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup sweet sherry</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">4 slices Serrano ham</p>
<p class="hanging">4 oz. calf’s liver</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. generously seasoned flour</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a medium, heavy saucepan, melt the butter and fry the onions or shallots until golden all over. Add the sherry, season with salt and pepper, and reduce the heat to a medium simmer. Allow the onions to cook in the slowly reducing sherry until tender and the liquid is a thin syrup. Broil the ham slices until they begin to crisp at the edges. Set aside and keep warm. Season the liver on both sides with salt and pepper and then coat lightly in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the liver and cook over high heat for 2 minutes on each side. Remove it from the pan when the liver is browned on the outside, but still pink and juicy on the inside. Slice the liver and serve with the onions and sherry reduction. Top with a scattering of bits of the crispy ham.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Pan-fried foie gras is fairly opulent, but for those who love it, it’s worth every penny. The sweet and boozy raisins make a wonderful pairing for the creamy foie. Enjoy.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 tbsp. raisins</p>
<p class="hanging">3 1/2 tbsp. sherry</p>
<p class="hanging">2 slices raw foie gras, veins removed (best sliced with a hot knife)</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">4 small slices sourdough bread, toasted</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a bowl, mix the raisins and sherry, cover, and set aside for at least 4 hours until the raisins have swollen up and are plump.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat a large nonstick skillet to very hot, and add the slices of foie gras, cooking for 40–50 seconds per side for medium-rare. Remove and place momentarily on paper towels to soak up excess fat, then move to a new plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the raisins and excess sherry into the hot pan and with a spoon scrape up the fatty residue to make a sticky sauce.</p>
<p class="extract">Divide the foie gras between the toasted sourdough, top with a few soaked raisins and a drizzle of sauce, and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">These sweetbreads are magnificent coated in the sticky king of sherries — Pedro Ximénez — and veal jus. Eating sweetbreads when dining out is really trendy, but few realize quite how easy it is to cook them at home.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tsp. vegetable oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small carrot, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 onion, chopped</p>

<p class="hanging">3 1/2 tbsp. Pedro Ximénez sherry</p>
<p class="hanging02">2/3 cup homemade beef stock or veal jus</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the oil, vegetables, garlic, and bay leaf in a medium saucepan. Add the sweetbreads. Fill the pan with cold water and bring to a boil. Once the water is at boiling point, lower the temperature and simmer for 6 minutes. Remove the sweetbreads from the water and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle, peel the membrane from the sweetbreads and discard. Dredge the sweetbreads in flour, shaking off any excess, then fry in the butter for 4 minutes until golden on the outside and firm. Remove from the pan and set aside, covered, to keep warm.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the Pedro Ximénez and beef stock into the pan and stir until reduced by half. To serve, toss the sweetbreads with the Pedro Ximénez sauce to evenly coat them and pile them on a platter.</p>
