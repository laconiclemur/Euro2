<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_92"/><b>Heirloom Beet “Tagliatelle”</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Carpaccio</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Heirloom beets come in fantastic colors—from ruby red to vibrant yellow—and heir earthy, nutty flavor goes really well with the freshness of the chervil. Try not to overcook the beets though, because they will break when you cut them into thin slices. They should be soft, but still with a slight crunch. You can scatter some small, crisp lardons or bacon over the top instead of the goat cheese, if you like, and serve with some crusty bread.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 1½ hours</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 heaped tablespoons sea salt, plus extra to season</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 beets, different colors if possible</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons beet juice</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small bunch chives, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ teaspoons chervil leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 handful yellow frisée lettuce</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 handful corn salad</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ ounces soft goats cheese log, such as Ste. Maure, rind removed, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">crusty bread, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 315°F. Take a 20- x 12-inch piece of aluminum foil and sprinkle the sea salt over the middle in a thick layer. Put the beets on top of the salt, then fold the foil over and scrunch the edges to make a secure package. Put the package on a baking sheet and roast 1½ hours, or until the beets are just tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Remove the package from the oven and leave the beets, still wrapped, until cool enough to handle. Open the package and discard the salt, then peel the beets and leave to one side until ready to use.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> While the beets are cooking, make the dressing. Pour the beet juice into a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to low and simmer about 10 minutes until the juice reduces to about 2 tablespoons. Whisk in the balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste, then leave the dressing to cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Thinly slice 3 of the cooked beets, then put the slices on a serving plate and brush with the oil. Season with salt and pepper and scatter the chives and chervil over the top.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Using a mandolin or sharp knife, cut the remaining beet into very fine julienne strips to make “tagliatelle,” then spoon half the beet dressing over the strips. Spoon neat piles of beet “tagliatelle” in the middle of the beet carpaccio. Toss the frisée and corn salad in a bowl, spoon the remaining dressing over and toss again until the leaves are coated. Scatter the leaves over the top of the beets, sprinkle with the goat cheese and serve with crusty bread, if you like.</p>
