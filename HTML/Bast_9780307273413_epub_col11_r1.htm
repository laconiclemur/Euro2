    <p class="nonindent">Basilicata, known locally as Lucania, hits the sea at the arch of the boot of Italy. If you’ve seen <em class="calibre4">The Passion of the Christ</em>, which was filmed in and around the city of <span class="small1">MATERA</span>, you will recognize the territory. The porous <em class="calibre4">tufa</em> stone of Matera was excavated for centuries, and thousands of cave dwellings were dug into the mount, like the honeycombs of a beehive. Chapels and even some spacious churches were created this way by the monks. Today, the <em class="calibre4">sassi</em> appear as if from a distant past. Elaborate fresco cycles decorate some of the religious caves, and the largest cave, Santa Maria della Valle, even has a garden. The cave dwellings were inhabited as late as the early 1950s, after which the government ruled it illegal.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Melfi</strong> is famous for its chestnuts, but it also has one of the most beautiful Norman castles. Set apart on a large expanse of land, atop a gently sloping hill, the castle is enormous in size, yet simple in design and decoration. As austere as the outside is, the interior reflects the sumptuous lifestyle of the nobles who lived there for centuries after its original construction in the eleventh century. The Rapolla sarcophagus (<span class="small1">A.D.</span> 165), housed inside the castle, is one of the most beautiful Roman sarcophagi I have ever seen. The carving is sublime, and, judging by the beautiful young woman sculpted on the top, the deceased must have been gorgeous.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Lagopesole</strong> Castle still retains the spirit of Frederick II. Sitting high on a hill, this is the last castle he built (mid-thirteenth century), and he used it for one of his favorite pastimes, hunting. The sandy-colored stone with which the castle was built appears to me at the same time warm and stark in the blazing sun of the region. The spirts of Manfredi and Elena, fourteenth-century inhabitants of the castle, are said still to occupy it. The chapel inside, with some fresco remains lingering on the walls, is colossal and beautiful in its austerity.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Venosa</strong> Castle was built during the Angevin period (fifteenth century). Surrounded by a moat and with a drawbridge, this is a fun castle to take the kids to. Mine loved looking at the writings on the walls, by prisoners who were held way up in the towers of the castle. In Venosa, Horace’s birthplace, I enjoy the eerie feeling I get at the unfinished church of Santa Trinità, which is behind the (completed) abbey church. At first it appears as if Santa Trinità has been destroyed, but really it was never finished. The twelfth-century monks began this huge construction borrowing stone from the nearby Roman amphitheater.</p>

    <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page318"></a>The hilltop town of <strong class="calibre13">Maratea</strong> is a jewel that maintains its local flavor. It overlooks the glimmering blue sea below, and the climb to get down to its beaches is well worth the effort. The small port below reminds me of Portofino, except that it isn’t filled with tourists.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Metaponto</strong> has some impressive Roman temple remains, in particular the Temple of Hera. One of the most important cities in Magna Graecia, Metaponto played a crucial role when allied with Hannibal against Rome. There are ruins of a Greek amphitheater, and nearby some of Italy’s best white sand beaches. If you are really interested in archaeology, see the sites and remains of the Siris and Heraclea colonies. Siris is well known for being founded by the Trojans.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
