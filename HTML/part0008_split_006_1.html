  <h3 class="h3a">Fresh pasta strips with cannellini beans and olives</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">I love cannellini beans, especially the dried beans that need to be soaked overnight. Once the beans are soaked, this dish is really easy to make, and the beans and prosciutto give a wonderful aroma as they cook together. The addition of fresh crunchy celery, olives and tomatoes makes this fresher and lighter than a typical <em class="calibre4">pasta e fagioli</em> (pasta and beans) dish. Delicious served next day and can also be enjoyed cold.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz/1½ cups dried cannellini beans, soaked in water overnight</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz piece of prosciutto, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">20 green olives, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tomatoes, deseeded and finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz fresh pappardelle, roughly chopped into 10cm/4-inch long strips</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz Parmesan, grated, plus extra, shaved, to serve</p>

  <p class="ing1">a small handful of basil leaves, torn if large</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="para">Rinse the beans and put them in a large saucepan with the prosciutto; add 2 litres/3½ pints/2 quarts cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, partially cover with a lid and cook on a very low heat for 1 hour, or until the beans are tender but not falling apart.</p>

  <p class="para1">Combine the celery, olives, tomatoes, rosemary, garlic and olive oil and add to the beans. Increase the heat, bring to the boil and add the pasta, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2–3 minutes, until the pasta is al dente. Remove from the heat, stir in the Parmesan and basil, taste for seasoning and leave to rest for 5 minutes. Serve with black pepper, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a few Parmesan shavings.</p>
