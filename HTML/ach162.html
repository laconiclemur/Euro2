<p class="author1"><span class="txit">cozze in bianco</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The first time my mother made this dish was on a visit to Cape Cod with my father, her sister Grace, and her sister’s husband, Tony. They went to a protected cove on the ocean side of the Cape. “As the tide went out, thousands of mussels appeared,” my mother recalls, “clinging to the rocks in the shallow water. We gathered up a bucketful of the shiny black mollusks, scrubbed them clean, and steamed them in a delicate wine sauce with delicious results.”</p>
<p class="indentb">Cockles can be substituted for mussels in this dish, which I recommend as a main course at lunch or as an appetizer before a special meal. Be sure to have focaccia or crusty bread on hand to soak up the sauce. This dish may also be served over cooked linguine.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley.</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Warm the olive oil and garlic in a large pot set over medium heat. When the oil is warm but not smoking and the garlic is still pale, not browned, add the wine and mussels. Cover and cook until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. Stir once or twice during the cooking time, bringing the mussels on the bottom of the pan up to the top. Add the parsley halfway through the cooking time. Spoon the cooked mussels into four soup bowls, discarding any unopened ones. Distribute the sauce among the bowls and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_321"/><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> My mother’s sister Grace cooks mussels in beer. In a large saucepan, combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, chopped, 4 sprigs fresh parsley, and 1 can beer. Add the cleaned 2 pounds of mussels and toss. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Simmer until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels and serve immediately as a first course.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Mussels cooked in marinara are excellent served over linguine. Follow Grace’s recipe above, substituting 1 cup <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a> for the beer.</p>
