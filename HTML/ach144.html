<p class="author1"><span class="txit">rollatina di pollo con mozzarella affumicata, spinaci, e prosciutto</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe calls for smoked mozzarella, although any cheese of a similar tender consistency may be substituted. The breasts may be stuffed, rolled in aluminum foil, and refrigerated for several hours before baking, making this a quick and simple dish to serve. It was inspired by Gianni’s aunt Angela, who relied on this practical recipe to make a satisfying meal for him and his siblings while his parents were cooking and serving guests at the Scappin family trattoria in Mason Vicentino.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound spinach, washed well and tough stems removed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 thin slices prosciutto, cut into short <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-wide strips</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound smoked mozzarella, cut into small dice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 teaspoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 teaspoons mixed chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, rosemary, and/or sage</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon diced shallots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup Marsala wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Place the spinach in a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat with a small amount of water. Cover and cook to wilt, about 5 minutes. Drain the spinach and squeeze out all of the water. Coarsely chop and place in a small bowl. Add the prosciutto and mozzarella, season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_284"/><span class="red">3.</span> Trim off any fat on the chicken breasts. Remove the white tendon and discard. Spread one whole breast flat on a sheet of waxed paper or plastic wrap, slightly overlapping the halves of the breast in the center. Cover with another sheet of waxed paper or plastic wrap, and pound the breast to flatten into a circular shape that is about doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Spread one quarter of the spinach filling on one half of the breast. Fold the other half on top, sandwich style. Firmly roll the chicken into a sausage shape. Brush the top lightly with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the fresh herbs over the chicken. Wrap snugly in a single layer of aluminum foil. Repeat this procedure with the remaining three whole breasts.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Place the wrapped rolls in a baking dish and bake until cooked through, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before unwrapping.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> While the chicken is resting, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium-size sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the wines. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced to <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup. Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into the sauce to thicken it slightly. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Slice each cooked breast on the diagonal into 6 to 8 pieces. Arrange several slices in a fan shape on each plate. Spoon some of the sauce on top, and serve immediately.</p>
