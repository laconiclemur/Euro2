<p class="summary1">Samfaina <span class="italic">is like the ratatouille</span> <span class="italic">of Provence. It is served as a hot accompaniment to fish, chicken, or meat and is also good as a cold starter, with bread. Many countries around the Mediterranean have a similar dish. In Catalonia, they cut the vegetables small and cook them until they are very soft and jammy; they do not usually include zucchini. I too prefer it without. Catalans say the dish originated with them, and that is very likely, since they were the first to put eggplants and zucchini, which came with the Arabs, with the peppers and tomatoes they brought back from the Americas.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 red or green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into ½-inch cubes</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch cubes (skin on)</p>
<p class="qun">1 zucchini, cut into ½-inch slices or cubes (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">2 large tomatoes, halved crosswise and grated, or peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the onion in the oil, in a wide skillet, covered, over low heat, stirring often until soft. Add the bell pepper and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the eggplant and zucchini, season with salt, and cook, covered, stirring and turning the vegetables often, for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the tomatoes, season with salt, and cook, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the vegetables are so soft they have lost their shape and much of the liquid has disappeared.</p>
