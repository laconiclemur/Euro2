<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_176"/><b>Poached Chicken</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Lemon Zest</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Black Olives</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Here I have modernized a classic poulet au pot, bringing in Mediterranean flavors with olives and lemon. You would normally serve the bouillon first as a soup, then the garnish—the vegetables— with the chicken as the main course. But here I have taken some of the liquid and reduced it to a sauce, then added olives, thyme and lemon zest, which makes it very refreshing. Try both and see which one you prefer; that would make a really interesting comparison. Let me know what you decide.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 1½ hours</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 chicken, about 3 pounds 5 ounces</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 carrots, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 small turnips, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 small new potatoes, such as Charlotte, scrubbed</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 baby leeks</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 thyme sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large handful of pitted ripe olives</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon thyme leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Tie the chicken legs together at the top of the cavity with a piece of kitchen string. Put the chicken in a large Dutch oven, cover with cold water and bring to a boil. When the water starts to simmer, skim off any foam that rises to the surface; this helps to keep the soup nice and clear.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Add the carrots and cook over very low heat 15 minutes, just keeping the water simmering. Add the turnips and cook 15 minutes, then the potatoes and cook 15 minutes. Finally add the leeks and thyme sprig and cook 15 minutes longer, by which time the chicken will have simmered 1 hour in total and should be cooked through, so the juices run clear when the thickest part is pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, and the vegetables all perfectly tender.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Remove the pot from the heat and ladle 1¼ cups of the cooking liquid straight into a sauté pan. Put over low heat, add ½ cup of the cream, bring to a simmer and simmer 10 to 12 minutes until the liquid reduces by half.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Whip the remaining cream in a small bowl, Add it to the sauce, return to a simmer and then remove the pan from the heat. The sauce should just be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the olives, lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice, then taste before adding any more lemon juice; it should just be slightly lemony, but not acidic. Add the thyme leaves and stir through.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Lift the chicken and potatoes out of the broth (you can use the broth and remaining vegetables to make a soup). Discard the string, cut the chicken into 4 portions and put straight onto a serving plate. Crush the potatoes with a little extra virgin olive oil and serve alongside, then spoon the sauce over the top.</p>
