<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">The nearest thing we have to the tiny ever-so-tender chops of very young lamb you get in Spain is small rib chops from a rack of lamb. Here they are served on a bed of sautéed potatoes with onion. You can prepare the potatoes ahead and reheat them before serving. It is good served with</span> alioli <span class="italic">(page 141).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE POTATOES</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into slices about ¼ inch thick</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup chicken stock, or more as needed</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE LAMB CHOPS</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 rack of lamb (7 to 8 chops)</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="recsum">For the potatoes, fry the onion in the oil in a large covered skillet over low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft. Add the potatoes and cook over low heat, stirring and turning them with a spatula and adding salt and pepper, until the potatoes and onion are lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and cook, covered, over low heat for about 15 minutes, until the stock is absorbed and the potatoes are tender, adding more stock if necessary.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, cut the rack of lamb into chops with a heavy knife or cleaver. Brush them all over with the olive oil.</p>
<p class="summary">Just before serving, heat an oiled <span class="italic">plancha</span> (flat griddle) or heavy skillet over high heat and cook the cutlets for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, just until they are browned on the outside but still very pink and juicy inside; do not overcook them. Cut into one to test—they are best served medium-rare.</p>
<p class="summary">Season the chops with salt and pepper and serve beside or on top of the potatoes.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• For a garlic and vinegar dressing, stir 2 to 3 garlic cloves crushed to a paste in 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a small pan over low heat for seconds only, until the aroma rises; do not let the garlic brown. Off the heat, add 1 tablespoon vinegar and ¼ teaspoon sugar and mix well. Drizzle a little over each chop.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Sprinkle the lamb with plenty of garlic slices fried in olive oil until golden and crunchy.</p>
