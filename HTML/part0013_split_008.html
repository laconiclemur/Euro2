  <h3 class="h3a">Wild mushroom and ham pizza</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">The secret to this pizza base is the sticky dough; it makes the resulting cooked pizza lovely and light. Don’t worry about it being too sticky to handle, you don’t have to knead it – if you prefer, wear some well-oiled latex gloves and you won’t get the dough all over your hands. Make sure the top of the dough is well oiled before covering, otherwise the clingfilm (plastic wrap) will stick to it. Another tip when making this sticky dough is to use solid-based round or square baking sheets rather than the pizza trays with holes. In season, mixed wild mushrooms go really well with speck, a smoky cured ham from the Tyrolean region of northern Italy. If you can’t find wild mushrooms, cultivated ones are delicious, too.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 2 large pizzas</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/4 cups strong (bread) flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">5g/1 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">10g/¼oz fresh yeast or 1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing">450ml/16fl oz/2 cups lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the topping</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to grease and drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ red chilli, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz mixed wild (or cultivated) mushrooms, cleaned and roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 slices of speck (or other smoked ham), roughly torn</p>

  <p class="ing2">100g/3½oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="para">Put the flour and salt in a large bowl, crumble in the fresh yeast (or add dried) and gradually add the water to make a sticky dough. Cover the bowl with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to rest in a warm place for about 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Generously grease two round baking sheets, about 33cm/13 inches in diameter, with olive oil.</p>

  <p class="para">Divide the dough in half and place each piece on a greased baking sheet, drizzle some olive oil over the dough, spread well, cover with clingfilm and leave to rest for at least 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, make the topping. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and chilli and sweat for a minute or so. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and stir-fry for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 230°C/450°F/gas mark 8.</p>

  <p class="para1">Loosen the clingfilm over the pizza dough and use the clingfilm to spread the dough out on the baking sheet. Drizzle the dough with a little more olive oil, top with the mushrooms, ham and Parmesan. Bake the pizzas for about 7–8 minutes, slice and serve hot.</p>
