<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0000856"><a id="pg213" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>CHICKEN IN GARLIC SAUCE</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000857"><em class="calibre9">Pollo al ajillo</em> is something I’d often have as a kid. But it’s not just for children: for me, this is the quickest and best way to cook chicken. The flavours are balanced: there is acidity and freshness from the lemon and parsley that are added at the last minute, and a slight kick from the chillies. It’s versatile too: it makes perfect finger food, or you could add some salad and bread on the side to make it more of a main. The sauce that is created from the chicken juices and oil is made for dipping, so bread – as always – is important.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000858">A wok isn’t Spanish, obviously, but it’s good for cooking this recipe, as you need to keep everything moving, and with a wok the oil stays in the pan. Even my mum has a little wok!</p>

<h5 class="serves">FOR 4</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000859">80ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000860">1 chicken, about 1–1.2kg, jointed, then cut into 50p size pieces (or 1–1.2kg thighs/legs/breasts) – skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000861">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000862">16 cloves of garlic, skin on, smashed with the back of a knife</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000863">2 fresh red chillies, sliced in half lengthways (keep the seeds)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000864">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000865">zest and juice of 2 lemons</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000866">1 bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley (approx. 50g), roughly chopped</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000869">Put the olive oil into a wok or a large frying pan on a medium heat. When smoking, add the chicken to the pan and season a little. Cook, tossing, until every part of the chicken gets really caramelized and golden brown (this should take around 12–15 minutes) and the skin is very crisp.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000870">Halfway through this time – so, after about 6 minutes – add the smashed garlic. When the garlic starts to get a little golden, add the chillies and bay leaves. Cook for a minute, keeping everything moving in the pan, then add the lemon zest and juice, with the parsley.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000871">Take off the heat, season to taste, and serve.</p>
