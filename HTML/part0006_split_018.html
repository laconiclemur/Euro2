			<p class="rec-intro">This is a classic dish from the Aquitaine region, where some of the best prunes are grown and they make wonderful brandy too. I like to serve it with a gratin Savoyard as well as the braised lettuce. Unless you are confident of your butchery skills, ask your butcher to bone out and trim the saddle of rabbit, keeping it intact. You also need the liver and kidneys for cooking with the lettuce.</p>

			<p class="body">Open out the saddle of rabbit and set the liver and kidneys aside for later. Season the meat with salt and pepper and place the prunes in a row down the middle. Roll up the saddle neatly and wrap it tightly in cling film to make a sausage. Tie it securely with string. Bring a pan of seasoned water to simmering point, add the rabbit and poach for 8 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Leave the rabbit to cool a little, then remove the cling film. Heat most of the butter in a frying pan until foaming, then roast the rabbit in the pan for 4–5 minutes, until golden. Remove it and set aside to keep warm. Add the chopped shallots to the pan, then pour in a splash of brandy to deglaze. Stir well, scraping up all the sticky bits, then add the veal stock and cook until reduced and thickened. Stir in the rest of the butter to finish the sauce.</p>
			<p class="body">For the braised lettuce, cut the little gem into quarters and season. Fry it briefly in a knob of butter until lightly coloured and just cooked but still crunchy. Add the rabbit liver and kidneys and sear them quickly in a little butter until browned but still pink inside. </p>
			<p class="body">To serve, cut the rabbit into thick slices and place on warm plates with the lettuce, liver and kidneys and sauce. Turn out a gratin on to each plate. </p>
			<p class="alt-head">Gratin Savoyard</p>
			<p class="body">Cut the potatoes into neat rounds. Heat the butter and oil in a pan with the garlic and herbs, then fry the potatoes until cooked and golden. Remove and pat them dry. Boil the cream in a small pan until reduced by half. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Take a couple of small chef’s rings, about 4cm high. Starting with potato, build the gratins with alternating layers of potato, cream and cheese, finishing with cream and cheese. Bake for 5–6 minutes, then glaze them under a hot grill.</p>
