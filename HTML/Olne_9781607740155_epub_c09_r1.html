  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page178"></a>THE GARLIC SOUP</h2>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Aïgo-bouido</em> is Provençal for “boiled water.” It is believed to be a cure-all. The rustic accompaniment is always dried bread crusts. The simplest version—reserved for those who are seriously ill—is nothing but a couple of cloves of garlic boiled in a quart of water with a branch of thyme and a sage leaf, strained over some olive oil-soaked crusts of dried bread. A step or two up the ladder, a bay leaf and a few more cloves of garlic are added and the strained liquid is beaten into a mixture of olive oil and egg yolk (traditionally, olive oil is cooked in the soup, but its flavor and digestibility both suffer from this treatment). A rich <em>aïgo-bouido</em> (more garlic and egg yolks) is an obligatory course (along with the 13 desserts) in every Provençal Christmas Eve menu. The following recipe is a “super” version, as <em>aïgo-bouidos</em> go. For those who fear raw garlic, it cannot be too highly recommended. Whether or not one likes raw garlic, there is no doubt that it is powerful and aggressive in flavor and difficult to digest (although good, they say, for the heart). Cooked garlic is delicate and subdued in flavor, an aid to digestion and a “calmative.”</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c09-s33"><em><span class="color">Garlic Soup</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Soupe à l’Ail (Aïgo-bouido)</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 or 3 sage leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a healthy pinch of thyme</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>10–15 cloves garlic, smashed, peeled and chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Binding pommade:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 whole egg and 2 yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese (or mixed Parmesan and Swiss Gruyère)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page179"></a><em>freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup olive oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the water to a boil and add all the ingredients except those of the <em>pommade</em>. Cook, covered, at a gentle boil, for 40 minutes, strain through a sieve, discard the herbs and pass the garlic through into the liquid. Taste for salt.</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine the egg, the yolks, the grated cheese, and the pepper in a bowl, stir and then beat with a small whisk until creamy. Slowly pour in the oil, beating all the time, then add, continuing to whisk, a ladleful of the bouillon. Stir the contents of the bowl into the bouillon, transfer it to a saucepan and whisk it over a low to medium flame until it thickens slightly—just enough to be no longer watery. Pour it over a handful of broken-up dried-out crusts of bread in a preheated soup tureen and serve immediately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE GRILLED LAMBS’ HEARTS AND BABY ZUCCHINI</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Lamb (or mutton) hearts, alone, have a distinctly individual flavor. The anonymous veal or beef heart is attractive and delicious either roasted or braised whole with a highly seasoned stuffing, but the quality of the dish depends on the supplementary elements. Lambs’ hearts may just as well be tossed rapidly in butter or grilled beneath the broiler. The only detail that must be respected to avoid their becoming tough is that they be kept slightly rare.</p>

  <p class="indent">Zucchini squash, barely deflowered (the wilted flower often still attached to the tip), no more than an inch in diameter, 4 inches long, and firm to the touch, are exquisite. They should always be cooked in the simplest and most rapid manner possible, and should never touch boiling water; try them sliced coin-thin, seasoned, and rapidly tossed in very hot olive oil with a couple of cloves of garlic. Discard the garlic cloves and sprinkle with a few drops of lemon juice and some chopped parsley.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c09-s34"><a id="page180"></a><em><span class="color">Grilled Lambs’ Hearts and Baby Zucchini</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Grillade de Coeurs d’Agneau et Petites Courgettes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 lambs’ hearts</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of mixed herbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 zucchini</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>olive oil, salt, pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Slice through the outer wall of each heart from both sides so that it may be unfolded into a more-or-less regular single slice. Sprinkle with the herbs and enough olive oil to thinly coat them and leave to marinate for an hour or so. Remove the tips and stem ends from the squash, split them in half and sprinkle with oil. Neither hearts nor squash should be seasoned until just before putting them to grill. One should have a fairly vivid bed of hot coals, and the grill should be preheated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Count 4 or 5 minutes’ cooking time for the hearts (once turned, they are done when rose-tinted droplets appear on the surface) and about 10 minutes at a less intense heat for the zucchini. These may be begun, placed face down, at the heart of the grill and, after 3 or 4 minutes, when the face is nicely colored, turned, removed to an area of less intense heat, and replaced by the hearts. The zucchini are done when the flesh offers no resistance to the sharp point of a small knife. Both squash and hearts should be lightly basted with olive oil just after they are turned. Care should be taken that no oil drops onto the hot coals, lending an unpleasant smoky flavor.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE FRENCH PANCAKE JELLY ROLLS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Crêpes are served folded or flat. When rolled, usually cut in two at a bias, the ends trimmed to match, they become <em>pannequets</em>.</p>

  <p class="center3">Pannequets à la Confiture</p>

  <div class="block">

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>jam or jelly, preferably of an acid fruit—currant, apricot, wild plum, raspberry—and not too sweet</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Butter a shallow baking dish that will be attractive on the table and sprinkle the bottom with sugar. Butter the crêpes lightly, spread each with a teaspoonful of jam or jelly, roll them up and place them side by side in the baking dish. Sprinkle the surface with sugar and put into a hot oven long enough for the sugar on the surface to melt and form a glaze.</p>
