			<p class="rec-intro">This Burgundian dish was another recipe I first encountered when I was working at the Élysée Palace in Paris during my military service. It was President Mitterrand’s favourite – he liked it for breakfast. You need a good strong red wine – preferably from Burgundy of course.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bottle of strong red wine </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g smoked bacon (in one piece)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml veal stock (see <a href="part0010_split_005.html#Veal-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of sugar </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">125g unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">12 cocktail onions, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g button mushrooms, wiped and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50ml double cream </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp clarified butter (see <a href="part0010_split_018.html#butter-sauce" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 thick slices of brioche</p>

			<p class="body">Crack the eggs into separate cups. Bring the red wine to the boil in a large pan. Stir to get the wine swirling, then carefully slip in the eggs and poach them for 4 minutes or until cooked but with soft yolks. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place them in iced water to refresh, then set aside until later. Keep the wine for the sauce.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°/Gas 6. Cut 4 thin slices from the bacon, place them on a baking tray and cover with another baking tray. Cook in the preheated oven until crisp. Put the rest of the bacon in a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, then cut into small lardons and set aside. </p>
			<p class="body">Pour 250ml of the red wine into a pan and boil to reduce to a sticky glaze. Then add the stock and reduce again until it has the consistency of a sauce. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar if necessary, then add a little of the butter to shine the sauce.</p>
			<p class="body">Melt a knob of butter in a frying pan, add the onions and cook them until tender. Add a little of the sauce to glaze. </p>
			<p class="body">Sweat the chopped shallots and mushrooms in butter until cooked, then season with salt and pepper. Add the cream and continue to cook until the mixture is thick. Pan-fry the bacon lardons until golden.</p>
			<p class="body">Cut the brioche into 5cm circles and fry in the clarified butter until golden but not dry. Drain and set aside. </p>
			<p class="body">Now, put everything together. Gently reheat the eggs in a steamer over simmering water for about 3 minutes until warm but not overcooked. Place each egg on a slice of brioche on warm plates. Add neat spoonfuls of the mushroom mixture, lardons, onions and crispy bacon, then spoon on some sauce. Serve immediately.</p>
