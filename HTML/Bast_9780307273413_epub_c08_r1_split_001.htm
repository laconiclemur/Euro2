  <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span> I <span class="small1">LOVE THE PEOPLE OF ABRUZZO. THEY ARE WELCOMING, GIVING</span>, and jovial—and usually there’s a concertina at hand so they can give expression to their feelings. The food of this mountainous region reflects the character of the people—sincere, warm, inviting, gutsy, and full of flavor. From the resilient dry pasta to the handmade <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em>, from the tender roasted lamb to the complex richness of the pecorino they make and the golden, aromatic saffron they harvest, all these flavors of Abruzzo are hard to forget.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was a misty late-autumn day in 2007, and the peaks were white with snow, when Mario and I drove up and up the serpentine road leading to the village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio, nestled between the hills of the Appennini that rise to their highest peak, the Corno Grande of the Gran Sasso d’Italia Massif. And then it appeared: from the distance we could see the church steeple and the round stone tower of Santo Stefano di Sessanio on top of a hill, and beneath, the white stone houses of the town, huddled like mushrooms in a protective mass. (This tower is now rubble, after the April 2009 earthquake.) As we neared Santo Stefano, we saw that the dwellings had been built side by side to form a wall of houses, a defensive and forbidding perimeter typical of the mountain villages.</p>

  <p class="indent">Inside the town, the feeling changed. We strolled the shining cobblestoned streets that spiraled up to the tower with magnificent terrazzas overlooking the valleys of Pescara and Tirino below. White smoke billowed from the chimneys of the fourteenth-century houses, and when we peeked through the lace curtains of the small wood-framed windows we saw people moving about their kitchens, and out wafted the delicious aromas of soup perking on the stove.</p>

  <p class="indent">Santo Stefano di Sessanio is famous for the small, tender lentils grown in the surrounding fields, and I am sure that in some of those huddled stone houses, on the central hearths, the pots were of lentil soup. And I thought there would be <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em>, the traditional local crâpes, to serve in the soup, or to be stuffed with spinach, mushrooms, or meat, or perhaps sweetened for dessert.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now hungry, Mario and I found our way to the one open café. The town was half empty, many shuttered houses awaiting the return of summer, when families drive up from big cities to recapture their past, living and cooking the ways of the mountain. Fortunately, there is an <a class="calibre8" id="page223"></a>ever greater demand for this kind of setting; many abandoned houses are now being refurbished by local entrepreneurs and sold as small summer units.</p>

  <p class="indent">We had a very different adventure in another mountain valley, the Valle Scannese, outside of the picturesque town of Scanno. Here we discovered some of the best pecorino cheese I have ever tasted—and there are countless local pecorinos to try—made by Gregorio Rotolo and family. The “madman of cheese,” as he is known in the Valle Scannese, Gregorio is passionate about his animals. What makes good cheese, he says, is the milk. His cows, goats, and sheep graze in pastures at two thousand meters (more than sixty-five hundred feet), and the diversity of the plants and flowers at that altitude is what imparts the flavor to the milk, and hence the cheese. It is all organic, and the cheese is made of unpasteurized milk. I had an extraordinary <em class="calibre4">pecorino scorza nera</em> and <em class="calibre4">ricotta scorza nera</em>, pecorino and ricotta rubbed in black all-vegetable ash. As the cheese aged, it absorbed the subtle flavor of the ash, and there was a creaminess and complexity to the ricotta I have never experienced before.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gregorio and his sister, with her family, also run the Bio Agriturismo Valle Scannese, an agricultural hostelry for tourists, where, in a simple setting, everything they serve is organic, produced either by them or by neighboring farms. The walls of their dining room are decorated with extraordinary photos of Scanno and its residents, taken by a local photographer, Cesidio Silla. And while we were enjoying the food offerings on a late Sunday afternoon, we were fortunate to see the herds of cows, sheep, and goats slowly descending the hills, heading back home for the night. It was a sight, particularly in that setting, with the good cheese and other food, that I will cherish all my life.</p>

  <p class="indent">But why would I travel to these mountains in the fog and cold of late fall, you might wonder.</p>

  <p class="indent">The answer is that I had to travel to satisfy a curiosity that had been growing in me for years—a curiosity about saffron. I had cooked with it and delighted in its flavor, color, and aroma for many years, and wanted to experience its harvest from the crocus plant.</p>

  <p class="indent">So that is why I was out in the fields of Navelli early one frosty morning, watching the women wrapped in shawls, and the men with their old-fashioned country caps on, all with baskets hanging over their arms, bent over rows of crocus plants. They were selectively picking the still-unopened buds of the crocus flower, which had sprouted overnight. Only the unopened ones were picked, before the morning sun had a chance to cast its warm rays on the delicate stigmas; this way, the maximum aroma is preserved, and it is easier to extract the precious golden saffron thread. If touched by the sun, like Cinderella by the stroke of twelve, the saffron might lose its magic. And then, just as the sun rises, they go home and empty the baskets of crocuses, in a pile on the table.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page224"></a>Not long ago, this precious commodity was becoming extinct; the young were not willing to undertake the hard work of cultivating the crocus. But Silvio Sarra, now in his seventies, a native of Civitaretenga, in the commune of Navelli, believed in the tradition of his ancestors, and thirty years ago formed the Cooperativa Altopiano di Navelli, with a handful of producers, and revived in the area the tradition of cultivating the crocus. He and his sister Gina run a small local agriturismo in Civitaretenga, Casa Verde, where one can enjoy the local flavors—especially in late October, when the crocus blooms.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was in the Casa Verde that Silvio and Gina showed us how to <em class="calibre4">sfiorare</em> the saffron—that is, to pluck the stigma from the crocus flowers. It is mostly the women who do the work, seated around the table chatting as their hands move fast to pull out the yellow threads from the mound of purple crocus flowers in front of them. Eventually, small mounds of golden threads pile up in front of them on the table, as the plucked purple flowers drop to the floor. There is always a fire crackling in the hearth. The man of the house, Silvio, at least during my visit, collects the little mounds from each woman and spreads them on the mesh of a sieve, which he then hangs, at a distance, on top of the coals. By the time the women have accumulated another pile, in twenty minutes or so, the batch of saffron is dried. And so for a week or more the harvest and drying of saffron happens on the kitchen tables, in the houses of the little towns of the <em class="calibre4">altopiano di Navelli.</em> As we descended from the mountains, heading toward the sea, we entered the lower hill country of Abruzzo, quite a different realm, of fields and vineyards. Here, too, we made some wonderful discoveries and friends. Although not considered one of the premier wine regions in Italy, Abruzzo produces four DOC varieties—the Contro Guerra, Trebbiano d’Abruzzo, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, and Montepulciano d’Abruzzo Colline Teramane (which was recently elevated to DOCG status). I’ve enjoyed the wines from some of the more established Abruzzese producers (usually brought to my attention by my son, Joe), but I’ve really become convinced that world-class wines are coming from the region after meeting Leonardo Pizzolo, from Valle Reale in Popoli, on my last visit.</p>

  <p class="indent">Leonardo comes from the Veneto region, not too far from my own origins, and one evening over dinner he confessed that he fell in love with the unspoiled beauty of Valle Reale, situated between the soaring Apennine peaks of the Gran Sasso range to the north and the Majella range to the south, and decided to plant grapes, build a winery, and live here. Less than a decade old now, his Azienda Villa Reale is already producing award-winning wines like his San Calisto—100 percent Montepulciano, from old vineyards, aged in oak casks. A well-made Montepulciano is always a great pairing for the gutsy <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page225"></a>As much as I love the terrain and food of inland Abruzzo, I was delighted to reach the coast on my last visit and find many treats that I’d never discovered before. As we traveled south from Ortona along the seashore, I was thrilled by the sight of the <em class="calibre4">trabocchi</em>, the traditional fishing huts built on stilts at the end of long narrow wooden walkways that protrude into the sea. From these huts, fishermen cast their nets and catch fish as they swim by—a mixture of small to medium fishes, which are mostly baked or fried and used in soups or <em class="calibre4">brodetto.</em></p>

  <p class="indent">The regional maritime gastronomy of Abruzzo is deliciously simple and is known for the <em class="calibre4">brodetto</em> of assorted local fish cooked in an earthenware dish, as well as the <em class="calibre4">scapece</em>, a fish specialty cooked and preserved in vinegar with abundant saffron, which gives it its golden-yellow color. And there is not a more elegant combination than the artisanal dry pasta from Abruzzo called <em class="calibre4">paccheri</em> tossed with the sauce of the <em class="calibre4">brodetto</em> from coastal Abruzzo.</p>

  <p class="extract">The tragic earthquake in Abruzzo in April 2009 not only shook the ground, but also shook my heart. Many of the places I have come to enjoy are now rubble. Thank goodness, all the people I have enjoyed are fine and, in true Abruzzese fashion, have taken on the task of toiling to rebuild their lives.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Zuppa di Lenticchie e Castagne <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes 3½ quarts, serving 8 or more</p>

  <p class="extract">Legumes are a specialty of growers in L’Aquila, the big inland province of Abruzzo, and the pride of the region is the small, tender lentils grown in the mountain village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio. Since my recent visit to this remote, rugged settlement, I have had no doubt that it was in just such a place that this hearty and warming winter soup, thick with lentils and chestnuts, was created. These native foods, so good together, can surely sustain one through long cold winters in the high country.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unfortunately, the delicious <em class="calibre4">lenticchie</em> of Santo Stefano di Sessanio are a limited commodity and not available here. Instead, I recommend using lentils from Castelluccio in Umbria in this soup. Ordinary lentils are fine as well, though some larger types may need soaking or longer cooking time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chestnuts, grown along the length of the Apennines, are also essential to Abruzzese cuisine. In season, they’re enjoyed in everything from pastas to desserts, and then, like lentils, dried for winter cooking or milled into flour. Though this soup can be made with fresh (or frozen) chestnuts, I use dried chestnuts, as is often the case in Abruzzo. These are available year-round and spare you the work of peeling. I also like the way they cook slowly without disintegrating, giving the soup a particularly nice texture. They do require an overnight soak, however, before you start cooking.</p>

Bring to a boil over high heat, then set the cover ajar and cook at a gentle boil, reducing gradually, until the chestnuts have softened and have started to crumble, about 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Rinse the lentils, and stir them into the soup along with the salt.

  <p class="extract">A <em class="calibre4">minestra paesana</em> of humble ingredients, this is a delightfully satisfying and flavorful soup. The soup base is built on a <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, a bit of tomato, and, if you have one, a piece of hard rind left from grating cheese. (I hope you save these! They are a great addition to almost any soup or stock.)</p>

  <p class="indent">One of my favorite vegetables, celery—and lots of it—gives the soup a delicate yet distinctive taste. And just before serving, a few handfuls of ditalini (or other short pasta) cook in the broth, to provide texture and substance. Don’t add the pasta until you are almost ready to serve, because it becomes soft and soggy left in the soup. In Abruzzo, as elsewhere in Italy, only <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> pasta should grace a soup bowl—and that’s what this recipe will give you.</p>

  <p class="extract">These crispy, savory balls, simmering in tomato sauce, are delicious and surprising: though they have all the texture and flavor that a meatball-lover would ask for, there’s not a bit of meat in them—just eggs, grated cheese, and bread crumbs plus garlic and basil.

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Beat the eggs well in a large mixing bowl. Heap the bread crumbs, grated cheese, salt, chopped basil, and garlic on top of the eggs, and mix everything together well, first with a big spoon or spatula and then with your hands. The dough should come together in a soft mass, leaving the sides of the bowl. If it is very sticky, work in more bread crumbs a bit at a time.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Break off tablespoonful pieces of dough, and one by one roll them in your palms into a smooth ball. Place the <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> on a board or tray covered with wax paper or parchment—you should get about sixty balls total.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour ⅛ inch oil into the skillet, and set over a medium flame. When the oil is hot enough that a test ball starts sizzling on contact, lay in as many <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> as will fill the pan with clear space around them—you should be able to fit in twenty or thirty. Adjust the heat so the oil stays hot and the rounds are sizzling and browning nicely but not burning. Turn them frequently, so they fry on all sides. When the balls are evenly browned and crispy, lift them from the pan, let the oil drip back in for a moment, then lay them on paper towels to drain.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fry all the <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> in batches this way, adding more oil as needed. As a snack or hors d’oeuvre, serve each freshly fried batch while hot and crispy.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To finish and serve <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> with tomato sauce, heat 6 cups of the sauce to a simmer in the big saucepan. Drop in all the balls, and return the sauce to a simmer, gently turning the <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> so all are submerged and coated. Cook for about 5 minutes, or just until the <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> are heated all the way through.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Immediately spoon out the balls in portions: Heap ten or so in warm pasta bowls, with sauce on top, for main-course servings; garnish with a sprinkle of grated cheese and a basil leaf. As a first course, serve four to six <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> on plates, in a pool of sauce. Or pile all the balls up high in a deep platter to share them family-style. Sprinkle cheese over the top, and serve right away.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> A note of advice: Keep in mind that the longer the <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em> stay in the sauce the more they will absorb it and become soft—quite delicious, but delicate to handle. Plan to serve them as soon as they are heated through. If they’ve soaked up most of the sauce in this time—or if your guests are late—heat up about 1 cup more, spoon it over the <em class="calibre4">polpettine</em>, or pass it at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract">Italians have many local and regional names for <em class="calibre4">crespelle</em> (what the French, and most Americans, call crâpes) and innumerable ways to enjoy them. In Abruzzo, these traditional thin pancakes are called <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> and are the versatile foundation for both savory and sweet dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Here’s a typically simple casserole of spinach-filled <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em>, lightly dressed with tomato sauce and a shower of grated cheese. Serve bubbling hot from the oven as an appetizer or a fine vegetarian main dish (even meat-lovers will be satisfied).</p>

  <p class="indent">The batter for these <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> is a bit thicker than the usual <em class="calibre4">crespelle</em> batter, but it is easy to work with and produces a pancake with fine texture. The Abruzzesi use them in all sorts of creative ways: layered with cheeses and sauce like a lasagna or a <em class="calibre4">pasticiatta</em>, rolled and stuffed and baked like manicotti. A popular technique is to stack and slice the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> into thin, tagliatelle-like ribbons. These ribbons are often used as a soup garnish (see box), or in clever desserts, as I show you later in this chapter.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> batter with an electric mixer: Put the eggs and salt in the mixer bowl, and whisk on medium speed until foamy. Lower the speed, mix in the water, then stop and sift the flour on top. Whisk on low just until smooth. Follow the same mixing procedure if using a hand whisk. You should have about 3 cups of batter.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Brush the crâpe pan with a thin coating of butter. Set over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Ladle about ¼ cup of batter into the pan, then quickly tilt and swirl the pan so the batter coats the bottom. Let cook about 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the bottom is lightly browned all over. Flip with a spatula, and cook another 30 seconds or so, until that side is lightly browned. Flip the <em class="calibre4">crespella</em> onto a dinner <a class="calibre8" id="page231"></a>plate. Cook all the <em class="calibre4">crespelle</em> in the same way—a dozen or so total—stacking them on the plate when finished. Brush the pan with butter if it becomes dry or the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> are sticking. If you won’t be using the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> right away, wrap them in plastic wrap when cool, so they don’t dry out. Refrigerate, well wrapped, to use the next day (or freeze).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the spinach filling: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add all the spinach at once, stir, and cover the pot. Blanch until tender, about 4 or 5 minutes, then drain in a colander. Let the spinach cool, firmly squeeze all the moisture from the leaves, and chop them coarsely. (This step can be done ahead of time: cool and refrigerate chopped spinach for use the next day.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you are ready to fill and bake the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em>, heat the oven to 425° and arrange a rack in the center.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in the large skillet over medium heat. Scatter the spinach in the pan, and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, for a minute or so, just enough to heat the spinach through.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the tomato sauce in a small pot until bubbling, then turn off the heat and whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter until incorporated. Spread another 2 tablespoons of butter, or as needed, in the baking dish, coating the bottom and sides well.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To fill each <em class="calibre4">scrippella:</em> Lay it flat, scatter about a tablespoon of chopped spinach in the center, and sprinkle ½ tablespoon or so grated cheese on top. Fold the <em class="calibre4">scrippella</em> in half and then into quarter-rounds. Repeat until all the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> are filled and folded.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread ½ cup of the tomato sauce in the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Arrange the filled and folded <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> in the dish in overlapping rows, with the pointed ends covered and the pretty fanlike edges visible. Spoon the remaining sauce on top of the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em>, in streaks down the center of the rows—don’t try to cover them completely. Sprinkle the remaining grated cheese (or a bit more if needed) lightly all over the top.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cover the pan with aluminum foil, making sure the foil doesn’t touch the cheese. Bake for about 15 minutes, remove the foil, and bake until the sauce is bubbling and the <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em> topping is golden and crispy, about 10 minutes more. Serve very hot, right from the dish.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">A delicious soup becomes a great dish when it gets the right garnish. In Abruzzo, cooks use <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> to give their fine soups an extra dimension of taste, texture, and substance.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">A favorite technique (which I recommend to you) is to slice the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> into thin strips like pasta, let them dry, then drop them into soups (or into the bowl before the soup goes in) to become marvelous instant noodles. For even more flavor—and great crunch—fry these <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> ribbons until very crisp in a skillet, and use them as a garnish.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">Another wonderful method is to grate a bit of good pecorino over a round <em class="calibre4">scrippella</em> and fold it in quarters (just as the pancakes are folded for the spinach casserole). Place one of these packets in each bowl, pour over it the steaming soup, and serve. As I hope you will soon find, the pleasure of even the plainest broth is immeasurably increased through this simple touch.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">Some of you are probably wondering, “Do I really need an imported <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> to make this <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>?” I say yes. You and your family will find it great fun to cut pasta dough through a <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> and then enjoy the pleasures that only fresh homemade <em class="calibre4">maccheroni’</em>s distinctive textural character can give.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">Fortunately, it is now easy to find and purchase a sturdy <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> (some made in Abruzzo) for under $50 in the United States. I recommend a traditional <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em>, with two sets of strings on the frame, which allows you to cut very thin pasta strands (especially nice for cooking in soups) as well as perfect thick, four-sided <em class="calibre4">maccheroni.</em> Make them once, and I am certain you will use your <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> often! (And remember that, just as a guitar needs to be tuned before playing, so does the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni chitarra.</em> Before each use, pluck on the strings and make sure they are taut and properly set in their notches on the <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> frame. Most <em class="calibre4">chitarre</em> have instructions for tightening the strings, usually a simple matter of turning the knobs that hold them.)</p>

    <p class="textbox2">If you don’t yet have a <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em>, though, you can make the pasta dough, roll it, and cut strands with the cutting attachment of your pasta machine or by hand. And if you only have dry pasta, you can certainly use what you have in place of fresh <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> with any of my sauce recipes. Spaghetti or linguine will always work well, and recently I’ve noticed that many top pasta manufacturers now make long dry “<em class="calibre4">spaghetti alla chitarra</em>,” with thick, square-cut strands that resemble <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> cut on a <em class="calibre4">chitarra.</em> Although they will never replace homemade <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> in my kitchen, they are a fine pasta to use in any of the recipes here.</p>

  <p class="extract">The dough for <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> has to be slightly firmer than usual for fresh pasta; it requires a bit more flour, so it will cut neatly when pressed against the <em class="calibre4">chitarra.</em> If you have a kitchen scale, weighing the flour is best: start with 10 ounces of flour, equivalent to 2 cups of unsifted flour, slightly packed, and add more as needed. Though I always tell you that you can make fresh pasta dough by hand (because it is so easy!), here I recommend the food-processor method, to incorporate the greater amount of flour quickly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Beat the eggs with the salt in a spouted measuring cup. With the food processor running, quickly pour in all the eggs through the feed tube. Process continuously, as a dough forms and gathers on the blade and cleans the side of the bowl. If the dough does not come together or clean the bowl after 30 seconds or so, stop the machine, scrape down the sides, and sprinkle in a couple of tablespoons more flour. Process for a few more seconds—and add more flour if necessary—until a fairly firm ball of dough forms.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for a minute or more, until it is smooth and firm. If it’s at all sticky, incorporate more flour as you knead. Press the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for at least ½ hour. (You can refrigerate the dough for up to a day, or freeze for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.) Cut the dough in four equal pieces.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If using a pasta machine: Roll each piece through the machine at progressively thinner settings, to form long wide strips, about ⅛ inch thick (no thinner) and as wide as your machine allows. If the strip grows longer than the strings of your chitarra, cut it crosswise into two shorter strips.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To roll by hand: Lightly flour the work surface and your rolling pin. Flatten each piece of dough into a rectangle with your palm, and roll it from the center, gradually lengthening it into a broad strip about ⅛ inch thick. Don’t roll the dough too thin or longer or wider than the strings of your chitarra.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cut <em class="calibre4">maccheroni:</em> Lay a strip of dough over the strings of the <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> (on a two-sided <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em>, use the more widely spaced strings). Using gentle but constant pressure, roll your pin lengthwise up and down the pasta, so the strings cut it cleanly into strands of <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> that fall onto the tray of the <em class="calibre4">chitarra.</em> Dust the freshly cut strands with flour, and gather them into a loose nest on a floured tray. Cut all the strips into <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, and collect them in floured nests. Leave the tray uncovered at room temperature until you are ready to cook the pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook a whole batch of <em class="calibre4">maccheroni:</em> Bring to boiling a large pot of well-salted water (at least 6 quarts with a tablespoon or more of salt). Using your hand or a colander, shake excess flour off the nests of <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, and drop them into the pot. Stir and separate the strands as the water returns to a rolling boil, then cook the pasta for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> (See the many sauce recipes that follow for instructions on dressing <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra.</em>)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To freeze the cut <em class="calibre4">maccheroni:</em> Set the whole tray in the freezer. When the nests are solid, seal them in airtight plastic bags and pack in a container, so they don’t get crushed.

  <p class="nonindent">Though many distinctive foods of Abruzzo are relatively little known outside of the rugged region, the fresh egg pasta called <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> is famous all over Italy and beyond. No doubt it is primarily known for the unique way it is made: sheets of rolled-out pasta are pressed against the taut strings of a <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em>—a guitar—and fall apart into long strands.</p>

  <p class="indent">This cutting method is not just a charming old custom, however. The <em class="calibre4">chitarra</em> makes pasta strands that, when cooked, have wonderfully satisfying texture and substance. In my opinion, this sensation of mouth-feel is one of the great gustatory pleasures, and <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> provides it in every bite.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Abruzzesi are unabashed in their enjoyment of their signature pasta (which they always call <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, never <em class="calibre4">spaghetti alla chitarra</em>), cooking it up for quick dinners and grand holiday meals. And if they don’t have time to make it themselves, they’ll buy a fresh-cut batch from a small local <em class="calibre4">pastificio</em>, or pasta shop, on the way home.</p>

  <p class="indent">In these pages, I’m giving you a taste of this rich regional pasta tradition with the preceding recipe for homemade <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em>, as well as a variety of typical dressings, both simple, uncooked condiments and more elaborate cooked sauces. These are but a small sample of the many <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> dishes you’ll find in Abruzzo, enough to provide you with many fine meals and, I hope, spark your own creativity with one of the world’s great pastas.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">The resourceful cooks of Abruzzo are never at a loss for quick and delicious ways to dress <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> or the excellent dry pastas made in the region. As these recipes for uncooked dressings show, they can take whatever’s on hand—locally pressed olive oil, a few cloves of garlic, their beloved hot pepper, a cluster of fresh herbs, a pinch of saffron, a handful of nuts, or other native ingredients—and produce a wonderful sauce in minutes.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">The foundation for these simple sauces—and the endless variations you might enjoy in Abruzzo—is the distinctive fruity olive oils of the region. Extra-virgin oils from the provinces of Teramo, Pescara, and Chieti have achieved DOP (name-protected) status and are available here. Certainly these superb oils will give your <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> (or other pasta) a truly authentic Abruzzese flavor, but any top-quality Italian extra-virgin olive oil will make a delicious sauce, too.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">Please don’t limit your enjoyment of these sauces to pasta, because they are marvelously versatile condiments for meats, fish, poultry, and vegetables, too. They need only a whirl in the food processor and they will keep for weeks. I hope you try them all!</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Pesto di Noci e Basilico <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 1½ cups, enough for a pound of <em class="calibre4">Maccheroni alla Chitarra</em> (preceding recipe) or other pasta</p>

  <p class="extract">This distinctively flavored pesto is a superb dressing for <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em>, spaghetti, or linguine, or a short dry pasta such as gemelli, lumache, or rigatoni. It’s a great condiment, too: put a spoonful on fish or chicken hot off the grill for a real treat. Make extra pesto when basil and parsley are plentiful, in summer, and freeze it in small containers to use through the winter.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you’re using the pesto right away to dress <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> (or other pasta), heat a large pot of salted water to a boil before processing the sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the pesto: Heap the basil, parsley, garlic, walnuts, and salt into the food processor. Pulse several times, to chop everything together coarsely, then, with the machine running, pour in the ½ cup olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Stop and scrape down the sides of the work bowl, and process to a uniformly fine bright-green pesto.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put all the pesto into a large, deep bowl, big enough to toss all the pasta in. Meanwhile, start cooking the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> or other pasta. Shortly before it is done, ladle ½ cup or so of the boiling pasta water into the bowl, and stir to warm and loosen the pesto—use only as much water as needed to bring the pesto to tossing consistency.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> is perfectly <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>, lift it from the pot with tongs and a spider, drain it for an instant, then drop it into the bowl. Toss the pasta and sauce together thoroughly. Sprinkle a cup or so of grated cheese over it, then toss again. Serve immediately in warm bowls, with more cheese at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To store and use the pesto later: Scrape it from the food processor into a small jar or container. Smooth the top surface, and cover it with a thin layer of olive oil or a piece of plastic wrap to prevent discoloration. Refrigerate for a week, or freeze for several months; warm to room temperature before using.</p>

  <p class="extract">This recipe actually gives you two flavorful sauces, to use as a dressing for pasta or to give a fresh accent to all sorts of dishes, from steamed vegetables to roasted meats. The basic sauce is a simple, loose parsley pesto, quite good and easily whipped up any time of year. In summer, I cut ripe, sweet tomatoes into small pieces and mix them into the pesto. The juices and flesh of the tomatoes merge with the parsley sauce, creating a new dressing with multiple dimensions of flavor and texture.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the basic sauce: Put the parsley leaves, garlic, peperoncino, and 1 teaspoon salt in the food-processor bowl. Pulse several times to chop the leaves coarsely, then, with the machine running, pour in all the olive oil in a steady stream. Stop and scrape down the sides of the work bowl, and process to a fine-textured, very loose pesto. Use this parsley sauce right away to dress pasta or as a condiment. To store, scrape the sauce into a small container, cover the top surface with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for a day (or freeze for later use; defrost at room temperature).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For parsley sauce with tomatoes: Prepare the tomatoes before processing the basic sauce. For full-sized round tomatoes, cut out the cores, slice the tomatoes in half, and squeeze out the seeds, then cut the flesh into 1-inch chunks. For cherry tomatoes, simply slice them in half. Put all the cut tomato pieces in a deep bowl, and toss with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Let the tomatoes sit for a few minutes to release their juices while you process the parsley sauce, as detailed above. Pour the freshly made parsley sauce over the cut tomatoes, and toss together well. Use within an hour or two. If it waits longer the freshness and bright color of the parsley vanishes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To dress the pasta with either the basic parsley sauce or the parsley-tomato sauce: Put the sauce in a bowl big enough for tossing. Cook the pasta until <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>—take some of the boiling pasta water to loosen the parsley sauce only if it seems too dense to toss. When the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> is done, drain and drop it into the bowl with the sauce. Toss well, then sprinkle over it a cup or so of grated cheese, and toss again. Serve immediately in warm bowls, with more cheese at the table.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">What made my visit to the saffron-producing region of Abruzzo particularly exciting was learning that the threads gathered there are considered one of the finest saffron varieties in the world. Grown only in a handful of highland fields in and around Navelli, the <em class="calibre4">zafferano d’Aquila</em> (saffron from Aquila) is prized for its intense fragrance, flavor, and color.</p>

  <p class="indent">As I learned from Silvio Sarra, the wonderful man who welcomed me to the harvest, the high quality of <em class="calibre4">zafferano d’Aquila</em> was recognized as early as the thirteenth century, when the saffron crocus was introduced to Navelli. Soon traded all over Europe, the spice became a mainstay of the region’s economy, and for seven centuries, hundreds of acres of crocuses were cultivated in Aquila Province. During the twentieth century, though, changing world markets nearly wiped out Navelli’s saffron industry, with its labor-intensive methods and high costs.</p>

  <p class="indent">However, there were some who did not want the crocus fields and the saffron of Aquila to disappear. Silvio Sarra himself, along with other local farmers determined to save their agricultural traditions, continued to grow and harvest saffron. Together they established a consortium to preserve the uniqueness of <em class="calibre4">zafferano d’Aquila</em>, ultimately earning a DOP designation, which protects the crop’s cultivation zone, methods, and standards. We hope the Consortium for the Protection of Zafferano d’Aquila will allow us to enjoy this precious culinary commodity for generations to come.</p>

  <p class="indent">I am happy to tell you that genuine Aquila saffron is now imported and sold here. Because of its scarcity, though, you can expect it to be considerably more expensive than other saffrons. Lower-priced good-quality saffron will certainly work fine in my recipes, but now that you know about <em class="calibre4">zafferano d’Aquila</em>, I think that you will find it well worth its price. Just a few fragrant threads will impart great flavor to your dishes, and they’ll connect you to the beautiful plains of Navelli, where they were grown.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">I learned this little trick about enhancing the aroma of saffron from the elders in Navelli who cook with the saffron that they produce. Carefully drop the saffron strands (as much as the recipe calls for) into a metal spoon. Hold the spoon over a low open flame for just a few seconds, toasting the threads very gently—the perfume will tell you it’s working! Before they overheat, spill the threads out of the spoon into a bowl for steeping or grinding, as called for in the recipe.</p>

  <p class="textbox1">One reason I feel such an affinity for the cooking of Abruzzo is the generous use of peperoncino—hot red chili pepper, fresh or dried. Lavish spiciness is typical of southern Italian cuisines, and although I am from the north, I love it, and it makes me feel right at home.</p>

  <p class="textbox2">The Abruzzesi refer to their favorite red chilis as <em class="calibre4">diavolicchio, diavolillo</em>, or <em class="calibre4">diavolino</em>—all of which mean “little devil”—and when you taste them you’ll know why. Often, these devilish peperoncini are steeped in olive oil, creating a spicy-hot condiment called <em class="calibre4">olio santo</em> or “holy oil.” If you love heat, a drizzle of this oil makes a good dish more heavenly.</p>

  <p class="textbox2"><em class="calibre4">Olio santo</em> is an indispensable condiment in Abruzzo, set on the table so that everyone can regulate the level of heat in a dish to his or her own taste. Whether it’s a soup, a pasta, or a main dish, if you want more heat, all you need to do is sprinkle over it a teaspoon of holy oil, give it a stir, and get immediate results.</p>

  <p class="textbox2">To make your own <em class="calibre4">olio santo</em>, pour a cup of good extra-virgin olive oil into a glass jar, and drop in a teaspoon of kosher salt and 2 tablespoons of small whole dried peperoncini, about ten little peppers. Cover tightly, and let the oil infuse at room temperature for at least 2 days. Give it a good shake, and use. Store in the sealed jar, in a cool place, for a month or more.</p>

  <p class="textbox2">(If you are a peperoncino-lover, too, be sure to try the heavenly pasta from Basilicata, Fiery <em class="calibre4">Maccheroni</em>. Its peperoncino-paste dressing is also a hot all-purpose condiment.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the toasted saffron threads in a small dish with 2 tablespoons of hot water, and let them steep.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page244"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni:</em> heat a large pot of well-salted water (6 quarts or more) to the boil.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Trim the zucchini, slice them lengthwise into thin strips, then cut the strips into thin 2-inch-long matchsticks. If you have zucchini flowers, trim off any remnants of stem, pull out the inside filaments (the flower’s stigmas), and chop the flowers into fine shreds.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big skillet, turn on medium-high heat, and stir in the chopped onion. Cook the onion for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until wilting and translucent but not browning. Ladle in ½ cup or so of the hot water or stock, and cook the onion in the bubbling liquid for a few minutes more, to soften.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Before the liquid evaporates, scatter the zucchini matchsticks (and, if using, the shredded zucchini flowers) into the skillet, and stir them in with the onion, then add the chopped scallions and the salt. Cook over high heat, stirring, as the zucchini releases more juices. Let boil and reduce for a couple of minutes—again, don’t let the pan get dry—then ladle in another 2 cups hot water, stir well, and mix in the saffron threads and saffron-infused water, and the chopped parsley. Bring the sauce to a boil, let it reduce for a couple of minutes to tossing consistency, then lower the heat to keep it barely simmering while you cook the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For cooking and finishing the pasta: With the pasta water at a rolling boil, shake excess flour off the fresh <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, and drop the strands into the pot, stirring and separating them.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with a small wire whisk, and gradually whisk in the last ½ cup of hot water, to thin and temper the yolks.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the pasta is cooked, lift out the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, drain briefly, and drop them into the skillet.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, and immediately pour the tempered egg yolks in a thin stream all over the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni.</em> Keep tossing and tumbling the pasta, to amalgamate the yolks in the sauce and cook them in the residual heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Next, sprinkle a cup or so of grated cheese over the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, toss well, then finish with a drizzle of olive oil.

  <p class="nonindent1">Maccheroni alla Frentana <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 6 cups, enough for 2 pounds of <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> or other pasta</p>

  <p class="extract">I love ground-meat sauces that cook slowly for hours, allowing an exchange of flavors between the meat, cooking liquids, and seasonings and concentrating them into a dense, delicious dressing. Emilia-Romagna is famous for such sauces, the classic <em class="calibre4">Ragù alla Bolognese</em> and <em class="calibre4">Ragù di Carni Bianche</em> among them. This Abruzzese sauce is quite similar in its procedures, though it uses only pork rather than a mixture of ground meats. It also has some of the typical flavoring touches of the region, notably a generous dash of peperoncino and a greater volume of tomatoes, rendering it a bit more acidic and definitely more lively than a conventional, mellow Bolognese. It’s a great dressing for homemade <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em>, and wonderful with other pastas, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">At home, whenever I’m preparing a dish like this that takes a long time—and yields such delicious results—I make more of it than I need for one occasion. Another great, effortless meal is a good reward for the hours and effort devoted to cooking the sauce. That’s why I have formulated this recipe to yield enough <em class="calibre4">ragù</em> to dress a pound of <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em> or other pasta on the day it is cooked, with an equal amount to pack away in the freezer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big saucepan, and set over medium-high heat.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lower the heat to medium, drop in the bay leaves, then scatter the ground pork into the pan, again breaking up any clumps of meat with your fingers. Sprinkle the remaining teaspoon salt over it, and stir everything together. Keep tossing the meat and breaking up any clumps until it starts sizzling and releasing its juices. Raise the heat a bit, and cook until all the meat juices have evaporated—about 15 minutes—stirring frequently.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the meat is dry and lightly caramelized, pour in the white wine, stir well, raise the heat a bit more, and simmer until the wine has evaporated completely, about 2 or 3 minutes. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, and stir with the meat. Slosh the tomato containers with 2 cups of hot stock or water (to get all the good juices), and stir this into the sauce along with the chopped basil. Set the cover on the pot, and bring the sauce to a simmer, then set the cover slightly ajar, and adjust the heat to keep it bubbling gently.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Simmer the sauce for about an hour, letting it reduce slowly, then stir in another cup or so of hot stock, so the meat is just covered by liquid. Let the sauce cook and reduce for another hour, then stir in the fourth cup of stock, or more if needed, and simmer for another hour—3 hours total. If the sauce is thin, uncover the pot and cook over higher heat, stirring, to reduce and concentrate to a consistency you like. Adjust the seasoning, stirring in more salt to taste. You can use some or all of the sauce right away, or let it cool, then refrigerate or freeze any amount. Cooled or chilled sauce will have thickened; reheat it slowly, stirring in more stock or water to loosen it.</p>

  <p class="textbox1">Grabbing a package of ground meat from the supermarket case is a convenience that all of us are accustomed to. For this pork <em class="calibre4">ragù</em> and other recipes with ground meat, however, I always prefer to grind my own meat or ask the butcher (if there is one) to grind a selected piece of meat (or whole pieces of different kinds of meat for a blend).</p>

  <p class="textbox2">I recommend this practice for several reasons. First, buying whole meat allows you to determine its freshness and quality, an impossibility when it has been ground and sealed in plastic. Second, because illness-causing contamination spreads easily in ground meat—especially in bulk commercial processing—you can minimize the health risks by grinding a small, selected batch yourself (or having it done while you watch). Further, you can choose meat cuts that have the percentage of fat you want in your dish and grind them to the ideal texture, a great advantage since most supermarket meat is ground to the same mushy fineness.</p>

  <p class="textbox2">Grinding meat in your kitchen is easy, whether you use a stand-alone grinder (electric or hand-cranked) or a meat-grinding attachment for a heavy-duty electric mixer, which is what I use. All of these are widely sold and reasonably priced. Be sure you get several disks (or dies), with various sizes of holes, for coarse and fine grinds.</p>

  <p class="textbox2">Here’s what to do for a great pork <em class="calibre4">ragù:</em> Start with a 2-pound chunk of boneless pork butt (actually cut from the shoulder), which has fine flavor and suitable fat content. I <em class="calibre4">always</em> look for certified, organically raised meat, too. Cut the meat into chunks, and grind it once through a coarse die, then grind a second time either through a finer die or through the coarse die again. That is what I do—two coarse grindings—for a <em class="calibre4">ragù</em> with the chunky, meaty texture I love.</p>

  <p class="extract">This wonderful country-style pasta dish requires almost no cooking, but fresh, flavorful ingredients are essential. Most important is to find fresh whole-milk ricotta (not the processed, packaged variety), often sold in good Italian markets and whole-food stores. If you can find artisan-made sheep’s- or goat’s-milk ricotta, that would be best of all.</p>

  <p class="indent">Another key ingredient is dry pasta made from farro, a kind of wheat berry usually cooked as a whole grain (try my Farro with Roasted Pepper Sauce). Farro pasta is quite popular in Abruzzo and is manufactured there, in many shapes, by both small artisanal <em class="calibre4">pastifici</em> (pasta factories) and the big pasta companies. Look for it in your market, or order it online either ziti or spaghetti would be my choice for this dish. It is delicious, nutritious, and moderately priced.</p>

  <p class="indent">You’ll also need tender <em class="calibre4">rucola</em> (arugula), good grated pecorino, and excellent extra-virgin olive oil. Once you have all your ingredients, the preparation is fast and easy.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As the pasta cooks, pour 4 tablespoons of the olive oil into the big skillet, and set it over low heat.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, sprinkle the grated cheese and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil on the pasta, and toss well again.

    <p class="textbox1">Ricotta is produced from whey, the liquid left after milk has been curdled to make cheese. In America, ricotta is usually made from the whey of cow’s milk, most of it manufactured into the bland, moist product you find in the dairy case. Fresh whole-milk ricotta is drier and tastier. Containing no preservatives, it is usually hand-packed into containers to be sold within a day or two. Such fresh ricotta can be quite good—it is what I use at home—but it still can’t match the flavor of fresh ricotta in Italy, where more strongly flavored whey from sheep’s milk, water buffalo’s milk, or goat’s milk is the foundation. In the hands of a master cheesemaker like my friend Gregorio Rotolo, near Scanno in Abruzzo, ricotta can become a true delicacy.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">The good news for us is that a new generation of artisan cheesemakers in America are producing fine sheep’s- and goat’s-milk ricottas. Look for them at farmers’ markets and specialty shops. Or, for a treat from the Old World, you can order fresh sheep’s-milk ricotta flown in from Italy, delivered to your door (see Sources, for these products).</p>

  <p class="extract">On my recent visits to Abruzzo, I have been impressed as never before by the region’s Adriatic coast, with its picturesque <em class="calibre4">trabocchi</em>, the little fishing shacks that hover over the water at the end of long wooden piers, and by the fresh coastal cuisine we enjoyed, meal after meal.</p>

  <p class="indent">Here’s a recipe inspired by the delightful lunches of that visit, which we sometimes ate in view of the <em class="calibre4">trabocchi</em>, where the smoke rising from the ends of the piers told me the fishermen were cooking lunch, too. It is just the kind of fresh-from-the-sea dish they make, lots of shellfish quickly cooked in garlicky tomato sauce, then tossed with a pasta that traps the nuggets of fish and sauce in its hollows. My choice are the fat tubes called <em class="calibre4">paccheri</em>, a sort of giant rigatoni. In my opinion, there is no greater gustatory experience than the marvelous squirting that fills your mouth when you bite into <em class="calibre4">paccheri</em> full of sauce and juicy seafood.</p>

  <p class="indent">This <em class="calibre4">pasta di trabocchi</em> also has the distinctly Abruzzese touch of saffron (picked in the high plains of Navelli) to add complexity and depth to the sauce. And for me, saffron has a magical effect on the palate, creating the illusion of distant, mystic places. It’s a fitting flavor in a dish of the sea, and a symbol for those that travel the sea, the mariners of the Abruzzo coast.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, at least 6 quarts with 1 tablespoon of salt, for the pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour 3 tablespoons of the olive oil into the big skillet, toss in the crushed garlic and peperoncino, and cook over medium-high heat until the garlic is fragrant and lightly colored. Scatter the cut scallops in the pan so the pieces are all separated, let them sizzle and sear for a minute, then stir and turn them over. Cook another minute or so, only until the flesh is opaque, and remove with a slotted spoon.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Immediately pour in the crushed tomatoes (and ½ cup water sloshed in the tomato container to rinse). Raise the heat to high, stir in the salt, and bring the tomato sauce to a boil. Adjust the heat to keep it bubbling steadily (but not spattering) for 8 minutes, to develop flavor and reduce slightly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For cooking and finishing the pasta: Meanwhile, start cooking your pasta at approximately the same time the tomato sauce starts to bubble—from that moment, the sauce will take about 12 minutes to finish, and <em class="calibre4">paccheri</em> (or other pasta) may need a few minutes more or less. As a guideline for coordinating your cooking, plan to boil any pasta for 2 minutes <em class="calibre4">less</em> than the package suggests.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the tomato sauce has bubbled for 8 minutes, drop in the scallops, clams, mussels, and the saffron and soaking water; stir quickly to distribute the shellfish in the sauce, and cover the pan.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook 2½ minutes, or just until the shells have opened. Toss the shrimp into the pan, and stir them into the sauce. Let it come back to a boil, then turn down the heat so the sauce is barely simmering.

  <p class="extract">This is a lovely, careful way to prepare thick lamb chops—quite different from the usual fast grilling approach—and it makes them extraordinarily flavorful and tender. The chops brown gradually in a heavy skillet over relatively low heat, steadily building the flavors of caramelization, and then cook covered with a small amount of liquid and seasoning elements.</p>

  <p class="indent">This short period of moist cooking doesn’t draw the meat juices into the liquid (as it would in long stewing or braising) but instead brings the seasoning flavors more intensely into the meat itself. Here, lemon, olives, and oregano give the chops the tangy taste of Abruzzo. For a great winter meal, accompany them with something cozy, like polenta, mashed potatoes, or smothered cabbage or cauliflower. In summer, a tossed green salad is all you need.</p>

  <p class="indent">Either rib chops or loin chops are suited for this recipe, though my choice is the loin chop, which offers portions of both the loin and the tenderloin muscles (like a T-bone steak). You could use lamb shoulder chops, too, but they’d need nearly twice as much time to cook covered. They wouldn’t be as amazingly tender as loin or rib chops, but they would be delicious (and cost a lot less). With any kind of chop, a heavy cast-iron pan is perfect here, because of its steady heat-retaining qualities, but it must be well seasoned, so the meaty caramelization is not lost on the pan bottom.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the cast-iron skillet, and set over medium-low flame to heat slowly.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the pan and oil are hot, lay in the chops—they should all fit snugly in one layer. Let them cook gently for 3 minutes or longer, until lightly browned on the first side, then flip them over and brown the second side gradually. As they cook, drop the crushed garlic cloves in the spaces between them, to sizzle and caramelize in the pan bottom—turn the cloves as they darken (and don’t let them burn). Turn the chops again a couple of times, giving both sides another 2 or 3 minutes of browning, until well browned all over—about 10 minutes in all.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Adjust the heat to keep the juices bubbling gently and slowly concentrating.

  <p class="extract">Slowly braised meats are a specialty of cooks in the high country of Abruzzo. With a fire always burning in the hearth or on a stove, it makes sense to keep a pot stewing. And from the ubiquitous flocks of sheep there’s always some mutton or lamb that will benefit from long cooking. Here’s a typically tasty example: a leg of lamb, bone removed, laid open in a flat slab (what we call “butterflied”), then slathered with a savory bread filling, rolled and tied up, and cooked for hours in a savory tomato sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is a great dish for a festive occasion, because a big leg will easily serve eight or more. To savor it Italian-style, I encourage you to present this in two courses, using the sauce to dress <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> or other pasta for a <em class="calibre4">primo</em> (first course), and serving the sliced lamb leg as the main course. Mashed potatoes and braised broccoli or chicory would be excellent accompaniments to the meat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Keep the recipe procedure in mind when purchasing boneless leg of lamb. You want a leg that’s been butterflied but preferably left untied. However, do ask the butcher for a length of the netting, or meat stocking, that slips over a rolled leg to hold it in shape; this will come in handy once the meat is stuffed and ready to cook. If the butcher is accommodating, specify that you want the leg butterflied to lie flat with an even thickness, so you can coat the meat generously with the bread seasoning and roll it up neatly. Should you end up with meat that is too thick in places, you can flatten it yourself with a meat mallet, or by butterflying, that is, sliding a knife into the thick muscle and opening it up.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the filling: Put the bread cubes in a mixing bowl, and pour in enough water to cover them. Toss the cubes in the water, and let them soak it up for a few minutes. When they’re saturated, dump the cubes into a strainer (along with any water remaining in the bowl), and squeeze the bread to get out most of the water. Put the soft, wet bread back in the bowl, tearing it into shreds with your fingers. Scatter the grated cheese, chopped garlic, and parsley over the bread, and stir everything together vigorously (or work together with your hands) into a spreadable paste.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page255"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lay out the butterflied lamb leg, and trim any thick fat from the outside surface (a few traces are okay). If the boneless leg was rolled and tied by the butcher, cut away the strings or netting, then unroll it and trim any thick fat. Turn the meat over so the inside of the leg (where the bone was) faces up, and arrange it to form a flat, solid oblong slab. If necessary, pound or butterfly thick muscles so the meat slab is evenly thick.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drop mounds of the bread paste on the lamb, and spread it to cover the whole surface, leaving a margin around the edges (so it won’t ooze out). Now roll up the meat to form a snug, loaf-shaped roll. Loop short pieces of twine around the roll every few inches along its length, to keep it in shape, and knot securely. Press and tuck in the flaps of meat at the ends of the roll, and secure them with twine looped lengthwise around the roll and tied tight. If you have butcher’s netting, slip it over the rolled meat, and stretch first, then tie it securely. Season the outside of the tied roll with 1½ teaspoons salt.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big pan, and set over medium-high heat. Lay the meat in the hot oil, and let it sizzle for a minute or two without moving, until browned on the bottom. Rotate the roll, and brown more of the meat surface for a couple of minutes, then rotate again, until the lamb leg is nicely caramelized all over.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Push the meat to the side of the pan, clearing as much space in the middle as possible, and spill in the chopped onions. Stir and spread them in the pan as they start to sizzle, scraping up the bits of caramelization from the pan bottom; shift the lamb to stir the onions all around. After 4 or 5 minutes, when the onions have softened, drop in the bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme, and stir for another minute, to toast the herbs.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Move the meat to the center of the pan, and pour the crushed tomatoes around it. Slosh out the tomato bowl and cans with 2 cups water, and pour that in, along with more water if needed, until three-quarters of the rolled lamb is submerged in the liquids. Sprinkle the remaining 1½ teaspoons salt all over, and stir the tomatoes, water, onions, and seasonings together. Cover the pan, and bring the braising liquids to a boil over high heat, then adjust the flame to keep a steady, gentle bubbling around the lamb. Cook, tightly covered, checking the liquid level occasionally to see that it is not cooking too fast or reducing rapidly. Every 40 minutes or so, rotate the meat so the top of the roll gets submerged, and add water, if needed, to maintain the level of braising liquids. Reduce until the liquid covers three-quarters of the lamb.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook the lamb for 2 to 2½ hours, or until a long fork can pierce the thickest part of the leg and slide out easily. If the sauce is concentrated and velvety, the dish is done; turn off the heat, and let the leg rest in the sauce for 30 minutes or longer before serving.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If the meat is tender but the sauce is too thin, transfer the meat to a platter (in a warm place) and cook the sauce uncovered, reducing it to a velvety consistency. If you want to dress pasta with the sauce, however, don’t let it get too thick. Turn off the heat, and replace the lamb in the sauce to rest.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page256"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After the rest period, remove the lamb leg and finish the sauce: Pick out the herb stems and bay leaves, skim off any fat that has collected on the top, and taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the sauce as is, or pass it through a food mill if you want it to be smoother (and to remove the rosemary leaves).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve the lamb: Cut and remove the twine or netting. Slice the leg crosswise into ½-inch-thick slices, and arrange them, fanned out or overlapping, on a warm platter. Moisten the slices with spoonfuls of warm sauce, and pass more sauce at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> This braised lamb also makes an excellent <em class="calibre4">primo</em> (pasta course). To serve as a <em class="calibre4">primo:</em> Put 2 cups of sauce (for each pound of pasta) into a big skillet, and heat to a simmer while the pasta cooks. Drop the drained <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> pasta into the sauce, and toss until coated, then shut off the heat, and toss with grated pecorino or Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano. Serve immediately in warm bowls.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the lamb a few hours or even a day in advance, let it cool in the sauce and refrigerate overnight. To serve, slice the meat while it’s cool. Put a shallow layer of sauce in a wide skillet, and lay in the lamb slices. Slowly heat the sauce to bubbling, spooning it over the meat until heated through. Arrange the slices on a platter.</p>

  <p class="extract">This special dessert is so good—and so much fun to prepare and serve—I hope you’ll be persuaded to make and keep <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> (crâpes) on hand all the time, as they do in the kitchens of Abruzzo. Here, you slice the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> into strips (they look like fresh fettuccine!) and toss them in a hot caramel, apricot, and citrus sauce that you’ve got bubbling in a skillet. Serve the beautifully glazed ribbons still warm, with whipped cream melting on top.</p>

  <p class="indent">This recipe calls for a full batch of the thin pancakes (the same ones used for the savory <em class="calibre4">Crespelle</em> with Spinach), but it is easy to adjust the amounts to make a larger or smaller dessert. Even if you have only a couple of extra <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> in your freezer, you can still transform them, with this basic technique, into a treat for two.</p>

  <p class="indent">Let your creativity loose: Just like pasta, <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> ribbons can be dressed for dessert in countless ways. Add rum or liqueur to this caramel sauce, or vary it with other fruit preserves or juices. Shape the ribbons into a little nest for a scoop of ice cream. Or drizzle melted chocolate over the warm ribbons, sprinkle with chopped toasted hazelnuts, and top with a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet or sauté pan, 10-inch diameter or wider</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the ribbons: Stack three or four cooled <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> evenly, and roll them up into a cylinder, about the size of a cigar. With a sharp knife, slice the roll crosswise every ⅓ inch (for thin strips like tagliatelle) or every ⅔ inch (for wider strips, like fettuccine). Separate and unfurl the cut pieces into ribbons. Continue to slice up all the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> this way.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the sugar in the skillet, pour ⅓ cup water over it, and shake the pan a bit to spread out the moistened sugar. Set the skillet over medium-high heat, and, without stirring, let the sugar dissolve into a syrup and come to a boil. Don’t stir or shake the pan as it bubbles away, evaporating all the water, and nearing the temperature of caramelization—this can take 10 minutes or more. Have the remaining <a class="calibre8" id="page258"></a><a class="calibre8" id="page259"></a>sauce ingredients (butter, apricot preserves, and citrus juices) near at hand, as well as a long wooden spoon for stirring, and thick kitchen towels for holding the pan.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_081_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page260"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the syrup bubbles become noticeably thicker, watch closely for it to take on color, usually near the edge of the skillet. At the first signs of darkening, lower the heat and swirl the syrup, so it caramelizes evenly to a deep-golden color. Still over low heat, drop in the butter and the apricot preserves, and stir steadily as they melt into the caramel. Pour in the lemon and orange juices, stirring carefully, because the caramel will bubble and splatter.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Raise the heat, and bring the sauce back to a boil, stirring steadily. Adjust the heat to keep it at a simmer, and drop in the <em class="calibre4">scrippelle</em> ribbons. Toss and tumble the strips with tongs or long-handled utensils, for a minute or more, until they’re heated through and glazed all over with the caramel sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, lift out one serving of ribbons, and drop it onto a dessert plate—giving the ribbons a twist as you release them to make a pretty nestlike mound. Top each serving with a big spoonful of whipped cream and a scattering of pine nuts. Drizzle any sauce left in the skillet over and around the ribbons, and serve right away.</p>
