<p class="h2title">October, or <span class="scalasans">Expression</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">O</span>ne morning Eduard stops Gaël as he enters the kitchen. The stagiaire looks as though he’s had a rough night: the flip he mousses into his blond hair is a little lopsided, and his thick-framed, rectangular glasses are a little smudged.</p>
<p class="indent">“There’s a package for you.” Eduard says.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Comment?”</span> Gaël’s Spanish has not progressed much. If he concentrates, he remembers to say <span class="txit">“Quemo”</span> and <span class="txit">“Vale”</span> and <span class="txit">“Oído,”</span> but, caught unprepared, the twenty-two-year-old slips back into his native French. Even now, four months into the season, when Eugeni tells him to do something, the chef stops for a moment and scans Gaël’s face to see if he’s understood.</p>
<p class="indent">“A package,” Eduard repeats, then grasps for the word in French. <span class="txit">“Un cadeau?”</span></p>
<p class="indent">Gaël doesn’t quite know what to make of this news, but he dutifully follows Eduard into the office, where, sure enough, a neatly wrapped brown package is waiting for him. He looks at the handwriting. “<span class="txit">C’est de maman,</span>” he says, blushing slightly.</p>
<p class="indent">Eduard tries to suppress a smile. “Well, open it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_167"/>Inside are two tightly wrapped pieces of cheese and a number of jars and bottles. His mother, it seems, has sent him a care package. There’s a note as well. <span class="txit">“Recette”</span> it says on the envelope in elegant blue ink.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s a recipe for fondue,” Gaël whispers, his cheeks flushing even more.</p>
<p class="indent">“Great,” Eduard says. “You can make it for family meal.”</p>
<p class="indent">Gaël takes the box downstairs and unloads its contents on the pass. A block of Gruyère; a slightly smaller one of Vacherin; a thin bottle of kirsch. Next to them he places several jars, each capped with red-checked fabric and tied with raffia. The labels on them are written in the same neat hand as the <span class="txit">Recette</span> envelope: cornichons, pickled mushrooms, pickled garlic. They are the condiments to eat with the finished fondue; Gaël’s mother has canned them herself. They will sit on the pass that day next to the Szechuan buttons and the marinating fish livers and the prehistorically large cardoons, an incongruous jolt of home.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_168"/>In October, it begins to rain. The temperature drops, and with it the lower needles of the scruffy pines on the road up to elBulli start turning brown. The cutting wind that Catalans call the <span class="txit">tramuntana</span> picks up, and the tree-bending force of its gusts, coupled with the shorter days, make the journey to and from the restaurant a wholly different experience. Suddenly the lovely, if dramatic, drive along the coast becomes a more perilous adventure: it is dark, the sharp curves in the road around the cliffs are slick, and the winds are strong enough to make you wonder if cars are ever blown over the edge. With the tourist season over, you can make the entire drive without ever passing another car. The sun is setting much earlier too, so that the clients no longer just leave the restaurant in darkness but arrive in it. To them the restaurant, with its warm yellow lights shining at the end of an otherwise unlit road, must seem inordinately welcoming.</p>
<p class="indent">Listening to the wind howl, Ferran is gleeful. “This is much, much better,” he exults, congratulating himself on the decision to change the time period during which the restaurant is open. “Much better for creativity. So much more tranquil.” Much better too, he thinks, for increasing the sense of risk that accompanies a meal at elBulli. He loves the idea that the dark, rain-soaked drive might unnerve some diners. He loves the coziness of their being seated indoors on their banquettes while the wind whips outside. And he loves the fact that with the vacationers gone, his clients are much less likely to be the type who have come to elBulli simply to check another restaurant off their list. There are now, he says, a lot more serious diners, and indeed, the reservation list seems to bear him out. In a one-week period, critics from Spanish, Italian, and British newspapers all come to eat (there is no such thing as anonymity at elBulli), as do Diane Kennedy, an authority on Mexican cuisine, and the chefs Johnny Iuzzini and Heston Blumenthal. So too does Barbra Streisand; Oriol, still building his collection, gets her to sign a plate. But not all of the restaurant’s diners are famous or wealthy. When one reservation cancels at the last minute, the table is given to a taxi driver in <a id="page_169"/>Roses, who each year saves up his money for a meal at elBulli and waits hopefully for the call.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the guest most valued that month—if not all season—is Ferran’s brother Albert. Early in October, he comes to dinner, along with Silvia, his partner, and eight friends, to celebrate his fortieth birthday. Until that year, he would never have chosen to hold the festivities at elBulli—after all, it was where he worked, and besides, before 2009, it was never open when his birthday came around in the fall. But now that he has left the restaurant, it is the perfect location. The staff sets up the table in the back room, and Ferran ensures that a steady line of courses—everything in the current lineup, plus a few dishes still in development—flows out to it. All in all, the party eats forty or so different courses before it is time for cake. Hardly a service goes by at elBulli without a birthday, and normally they are celebrated with a plate of artfully arranged fruit and a massive card that unfolds to display a cake with candles (after so many courses, no one wants to eat a slice of yellow cake with chocolate frosting). But this time, Ferran has Albert and his friends led into the kitchen where, in the dark, all the cooks stand in a row, each with a lit candle, and burst into “Happy Birthday.” “It’s a living birthday cake,” Ferran says excitedly as he embraces his brother. Albert looks thoroughly touched, but Ferran is even more emotional. “I’ve never seen him so happy,” says Andrea.</p>
<p class="indent">The fall menu is now in place. Gone are the mimetic almonds, made from an almond praliné and encased in a thin, hard shell of mannitol; they have been replaced with mimetic pistachios. Corn is out of season, which means, mercifully, that the stagiaires no longer have to squeeze out its germ for risotto. Instead, they have to separate out the pulp of mandarin orange flesh in order to make a risotto from that. “They’re always coming up with something like that for us to do,” comments Lucho dryly. The pond and the artichoke rose are still there, but much of the rest of the menu has been given over to decidedly autumnal dishes. It’s exactly what Ferran said he wanted to do back when he made the unprecedented decision to change the season from spring and summer to summer and fall. But the possibilities opened up by the season’s <a id="page_170"/>products, and the success of the dishes created with them, surprises even him. Fresh cèpes are wrapped like gifts in a cellophane papillote and cooked in tiny iron skillets. Orange daubs of puréed squash are spooned into the shape of sea urchin flesh. Woodcock is on the menu, and that sweet potato gnocchi. A translucent, chestnut-colored liquid is brought to the table in a snifter, where the server mists it with Armagnac—the diner thinks she is getting liqueur, but she is, in fact, drinking a perfectly clear squab consommé, redolent with the scent of the autumn hunt.</p>
<p class="indent">The corps of stagiaires has undergone more changes. Saurabh Arora, a cook from Bangalore, joined the group at the beginning of the month—elBulli’s first Indian stagiaire. One of the Mexican apprentices, Victor, has gone home—his <span class="txit">stage</span> lasted only a month. But Luca is still there. Contrary to everyone’s predictions, including his own, he returned to work after his crisis of faith and economics, a decision motivated both by his own sense of responsibility and his extensive knowledge of just how small and gossipy the restaurant industry is. “If I start something, I want to finish it,” he says. “Plus, I don’t want to get a reputation for being unreliable. Chefs talk to each other.”</p>
<p class="indent">In some ways, the kitchen has become more rigid, more set in its ways. The stagiaires on the center table can no longer get their own water, for example; they have to ask Lucho, who is now Eugeni’s assistant, to bring it to them. And whereas before the cooks could simply tell Eugeni when they were going to the bathroom, now they have to ask him for permission. For some of the apprentices, there have been subtle improvements. Emma, for example, has finally risen in Eugeni’s esteem. Although during the first three months he targeted her frequently for criticism, by October he is holding her up as an example to the others, praising her work ethic when he spies others slacking off. Her assignments have improved as a result. A semihidden hierarchy of tasks exists at the center table, and by now, all of the full-season stagiaires are fluent in its calibrations. For not always obvious reasons, some tasks within the self-enclosed world that is the center table have acquired greater prestige. “If you’re good, you get upgraded,” Emma explains. “When Eugeni moved me from mandarins to bone marrow, I knew I was doing well.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_171"/>Other stagiaires are beginning to show signs of the strain. Katie’s mother comes to visit from the United States, and they spend her four-day break visiting potential sites for her wedding reception and checking out florists and photographers as well. It’s fun, but it also feels rushed. “I feel like I have four days to plan my whole wedding,” says Katie. “It’s a little stressful.” Stress wears on Iosu as well, although in his case it seems more closely tied to work. He doesn’t socialize much with the rest of the group and seems to live only for his girlfriend’s monthly visits from Bilbao. He’s been losing weight and muttering to himself in the kitchen; he flinches visibly when one of the chefs corrects him. Meanwhile, half the kitchen is sick (and, yes, still working; it is only when a stagiaire begins vomiting that he may decide to stay home), and things get so bad that a morning meeting is devoted to the restaurant’s version of health care. Oriol takes it upon himself to do another hand-washing demonstration, while Eduard warns the stagiaires not to stand too close to one another when talking. (At that, Lorenzo and Antonio exchange glances. Don’t stand too close? They spend fourteen hours a day pressed shoulder to shoulder.) Eduard himself falls ill one day but, in his typically stoic way, works through the pain. The only sign he is off his game is the way he occasionally clutches his temples during service.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran’s enthusiasm for the new season, then, is perhaps not echoed by the stagiaires. They are certainly pleased to be working with new dishes and thrilled with many of the new recipes, but they are also growing increasingly tired of the grinding routine. Still, all the weariness and influenza in the world can’t hide the fact that the season is halfway over, and that fact alone gives a lift to many of the stagiaires. “It’s all downhill from here, “ says Mateu as he pipes one more sheet of mint leaves with chocolate. Mizuho, César, and Daniel, all within earshot, smile to themselves. “I’m counting the days,” says Sunny.</p>
<p class="indent">The stagiaires are starting to think about what comes next. Emma knows she will eventually be working as sous chef when Corey Lee, her former chef at the French Laundry, opens his new place in San Francisco—she’s just not sure when that will be. Katie has her own restaurant to plan. Txema will take over his parents’ restaurant in the <a id="page_172"/>Basque Country. And Alfonso knows he’ll be going back to the navy. But other than that, few of the apprentices have plans.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">At twenty-two, Gaël Vuilloud is one of the youngest stagiaires. Tall and skinny, he has imperfect posture that at times makes him look like a walking question mark. Outside the restaurant, he wears sleeveless sweatshirts and artfully ripped jeans, but inside he is one of the apprentices whose jacket is always perfectly pressed. His thick blond hair, swooped up in a flip at the front, and his glasses, with their thick rectangular frames, can make him seem like either the coolest of hipsters or the nerdiest of geeks. But Gaël is definitely not a geek. Within the admittedly insular world of Swiss cuisine, he is already a star.</p>
<p class="indent">Before he came to elBulli, Gaël had never lived more than a few miles from his home in Monthey, Switzerland. Located a bit inland from Lake Geneva and the elegant, well-manicured resort towns of the Swiss Riviera, Monthey is more working-class than its neighbors but still offers spectacular views of the Alps and enough proximity to the world headquarters of Nestlé in nearby Vevey that many of his friends’ parents worked for the multinational food conglomerate. Indeed, in that part of the world, a preoccupation with food is almost unavoidable. In addition to the bountiful bakeries and <span class="txit">traiteurs</span> that seem to dot each of Vevey’s streets, there is a giant fork, designed by the Swiss artists Jean-Pierre Zaugg and Georges Favre, its tines plunged into the water of Lake Geneva, and, thanks again to Nestlé, a popular museum dedicated to the history of food. Growing up in that environment, Gaël knew he wanted to be a chef. His earliest memories are of standing by his mother, who worked as a hairstylist but nevertheless cooked all the family’s meals, and begging her to let him light the stove. The family couldn’t afford to dine out very frequently, but they ate well at home: not only Swiss classics like fondue and rösti, a potato pancake often prepared with onions and bacon, but also roast chicken and veal navarin. His mom even made pizza—“the best pizza in the world,” he says—from scratch, following a complicated recipe that took the better part of a day to complete.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_173"/>His father, an electrician, was not initially pleased with the thought of his only son spending his life in a kitchen. When Gaël was thirteen, M. Vuilloud did the only thing he could think of to dissuade his son from his chosen profession: he got the boy an apprenticeship as a cook in a local pizzeria owned by a friend. Every day after school, Gaël would go to the restaurant and put in several hours chopping vegetables for sauce and preparing dough. It was a lot of work for a boy who was still in school, and he got to hang out with his friends a lot less than the average teenager. But he was ecstatic. “I just loved being in the kitchen,” he says. “At the end of each night, I would walk home with this huge smile on my face.”</p>
<p class="indent">If his father was disappointed that his plan to distract Gaël from his chosen career had failed, he didn’t show it and, from that point on, played an active role in helping his son prepare for his professional future. The following year, he helped the boy get a full-time <span class="txit">stage</span> during the Christmas holidays at the Hôtel Restaurant Le Saint-Christophe, in Bex, a town located southeast of Lake Geneva, near several important ski resorts. The chef there, Mauro Capelli, was impressed enough with Gaël’s work to offer him a full apprenticeship, though because Gaël was so young, he needed his parents’ permission to accept it. The offer opened the door to becoming a real chef; in Switzerland as in France, the usual launch for a career in the kitchen is with a formal apprenticeship that begins usually when a boy is still in his early teens.</p>
<p class="indent">Gaël’s parents took the decision seriously: they traveled to Bex to meet Chef Capelli and see the working conditions to which their son would be committing himself. In his eagerness to accept the apprenticeship, Gaël didn’t notice any problems, but his mother was another story. Mme. Vuilloud didn’t appreciate the chef’s apparent disregard for women (he insisted on addressing only Gaël’s father, not his mother) and promptly put an end to Gaël’s fledging career. “That,” she said tartly as the family got back into their car, “is not what I want my fourteen-year-old exposed to.” Her husband took up the search for a new apprenticeship.</p>
<p class="indent">He eventually found one at the Auberge de Vouvry, an inn not far from home, with a formal restaurant and one Michelin star. Gaël spent a <a id="page_174"/>month in the kitchen as a stagiaire before Martial Braendle, the auberge’s owner and chef de cuisine, offered him another salaried apprenticeship. With only a blessed few months of obligatory schooling left, Gaël quickly accepted. He soon learned, however, that he wasn’t done with studying; Switzerland, like many other European countries, strictly regulates apprenticeships, and budding chefs are required to spend one day a week at culinary school. There he received three hours’ instruction in mathematics and language studies and six hours in culinary theory. “That part was boring—I already knew how to cook,” Gaël says. “Most of the other students couldn’t even chop an onion.”</p>
<p class="indent">The practical lessons he received at the Auberge de Vouvry were much more to his liking. With its classical menu, the auberge has its apprentices spend a good deal of time peeling potatoes for dauphinoise and shucking oysters for bisque. But gradually Gaël worked his way up and began moving through the restaurant’s different stations: garde-manger, sauces, fish, meat. Along the way, his salary jumped, from a risible 400 euros a month to an almost livable 800 euros. He was such an apt pupil that in 2002, Braendle entered his young protégé in a contest for the best apprentice chef in the French-speaking cantons. When he was interviewed for the local paper about Gaël’s chances, the chef replied, “Gaël is a very fast learner. And more important, everything he makes tastes great. He knows immediately what’s missing in a dish—that’s a crucial quality in a chef, and either you have it or you don’t.” In the contest, at least, Gaël had it. Required to prepare two rabbits and some vegetables for eight people, as well as invent his own interpretation of an orange bavaroise (a cold egg custard), he impressed the judges with his well-balanced flavors and won first prize—an eating trip to Paris.</p>
<p class="indent">Culinary competitions are important in Europe, and several countries, such as Norway, France, and Sweden, expend huge amounts of money and energy to send their top young chefs to the Bocuse d’Or, a biennial event held in Lyon, France, that is the world’s most prestigious cooking contest. With his initial success, Gaël found himself being pushed in that direction. He competed in three more contests before entering, at age nineteen, the Junior Culinary Olympics, for the chance to represent <a id="page_175"/>Switzerland. By then he had finished his apprenticeship and entered the ranks of the profession, working full-time at the auberge as chef de partie. In his time off, he prepared for the contest. Most competitions require participants to prepare a dish around an assigned ingredient, and this one was no exception: Gaël was required to work with <span class="txit">fera,</span> a mild white fish indigenous to Lake Geneva. After several trial runs, Gaël hit on his dish: he would serve the fera raw, in a tartare, with a sauce made from Noilly Prat vermouth. It came out perfectly, the fish cold and sweet, its flavor balanced by the acidity of the sauce. As the competition wound down, rumors were flying that Gaël would win. But when the judges announced their decision, he learned he had come in second. The problem, he would later hear, lay with one of his garnishes: he had adorned the plate with cubes of gelée made from Campari. Some of the more traditional judges, it seemed, didn’t like the texture of the cubes—they considered them too avant-garde. But others, more open to innovation, secretly came up to the young cook after the contest was over and told him he should have won. The Olympics would be his last competition. If he couldn’t win by cooking in his own style, he decided, he didn’t want to compete.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Having established himself so clearly as an artist, Ferran is often viewed as a genius detached from any context, national or culinary. Yet he is, of course, the product of his environment. Even after he took over the kitchen at elBulli, he was a “normal” chef for many years, working within the boundaries set by nouvelle cuisine. His culinary transformation began in 1989, when he experimented with that most iconic of Spanish dishes, gazpacho. By deconstructing the soup so that its components were discrete entities exposed on the plate, he initiated a process of inquiry—<span class="txit">What are our expectations of food?</span>—that continues to inform what he does in the kitchen. Yet, as he is the first to explain, any rupture he may have provoked was simultaneously an evolution, a gradual turning away from nouvelle cuisine’s repertoire and toward something new.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_176"/>Culinary history provides a context for what Ferran does, but so does European history. It is probably no coincidence that he shares many traits with that other internationally recognized Spanish artist, the filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar. Their media are, of course, different—spherified olives and Parmesan air for one; sex, drugs, and neurotic women in stilettos for the other. But the reckless joy of their careful creations, the provocative art disguised as humor and excess, are the same. So too is their shared drive, relentless but unstrained, to continually create anew. Only a few years before they burst onto the scene, Spain was ruled by Francisco Franco, one of only two World War II–era dictators to see his authoritarian regime survive into the 1970s. In the course of his nearly forty-year rule, Franco had managed to transform Spain into a staunchly Catholic, nationalistic country. Women were not allowed to work without their husbands’ or fathers’ permission, while homosexuals, regionalists, and political dissidents were routinely thrown into prison. Spain’s food, to judge by the stuff that makes up the classic cookbook of the late Franco era, Simone Ortega’s <span class="txit">1080 Recipes</span> was almost as staidly depressing as the culture: cauliflower in béchamel; tuna canapés; paella made with canned peas.</p>
<p class="indent">Almodóvar and Adrià changed all that. Although they worked in spheres distinct from the politicians who enabled the peaceful transition to democracy, they nonetheless participated crucially in Spain’s liberalization in the years following the dictator’s death in 1975. Whatever else it may be, the unique intensity of their creativity is undoubtedly a powerful response to the grim atrocities and quotidian frustrations of the Franco dictatorship. Together their work represents one face of repression’s effects: radical invention as a rejection of conformity, unbridled exuberance in the face of numbness and fear, a quest for absolute liberty.</p>
<p class="indent">Movies are different from food, of course. However important motion pictures may be to how we think about ourselves and the world, we don’t expect them to represent tradition, to nurture and comfort us, to carry the weight of identities both national and individual. Almodóvar may have initially shocked his viewers with his explicit but celebratory films <a id="page_177"/>about masochists and heroin-addled hookers, but he was still doing what directors have always done, which is to tell a story. With Adrià, it wasn’t so clear. If he was a revolutionary, a genius, an artist, could he still do what chefs do, which is to feed people? If his dishes were art, could they still be dinner?</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Not long after he came in second in the runoffs for the culinary Olympics, Gaël experienced another break in his professional trajectory. Switzerland requires its young men to serve in the military, and at age twenty, he was conscripted. He would spend the eight months working as an army cook, but he has little memory of the work. He does remember getting drunk on his days off—so drunk that, when he showed up at home wasted one weekend, his furious mother pushed him into the car and drove him straight back to the base. Only one good thing, he says, came out of his experience in the military: it gave him time to reassess the path he had been on since childhood. He had always known he wanted to be a chef and had taken steps as early as possible to make that happen, but he had never considered <span class="txit">what kind</span> of chef he wanted to be. “I had never really thought about it,” he recalls, “never thought about how I wanted to cook or what was good.” Now, as his time in the army drew to a close, he found himself pondering a question his chef, Braendle, had asked him before he enlisted: What do you want to do next? He knew he could go back to the auberge and continue to work his way up the brigade. Or he could try something new, push himself further. He wasn’t sure which path to take until Braendle intervened. “Why don’t you go work for my friend Denis?” the chef suggested. “He doesn’t have the same conception of food as I do, but at least you’ll get to see something different.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Denis in question was Denis Martin, who, a few months before Gaël joined him, had earned two Michelin stars for his eponymous restaurant in Vevey. Swiss cuisine in its <span class="txit">haute</span> incarnation is practically indistinguishable from French, but Martin had broken with tradition by looking south for inspiration rather than north and west. Here was a chef who used siphons to create airy mousses without gelatin and a <a id="page_178"/>Pacojet to turn escargot into frozen “dirt.” Some of his menu items, such as the “Gin Tonic,” read as if they could have come straight from elBulli. Yet there were marked differences. Martin says he began experimenting thirty years ago, which would mean his experience with avant-garde cuisine predates Ferran’s. Although his dishes display the same cleverness found in some of elBulli’s creations, the humor in them is broader and less cerebral, more Adam Sandler to Adrià’s Woody Allen. His Gin Tonic, for example, comes in the form of a globe that fits into the palm of a man’s hand, and that, remarkably, glows in the dark. There is a dish called Nothing, the culinary version of John Cage’s “4' 33"” composition (which consists of four minutes, thirty-three seconds of silence), in which an invisible substance is poured into the bottom of a shallow bowl. When the diner takes up the spoon and puts it in her mouth, she very clearly tastes dill and cucumber. To serve the final savory course in Martin’s twenty-two-plate tasting menu, waiters hand each diner an airmail envelope. Its contents make it lumpy and disconcertingly warm. Inside is a second envelope, this one plastic, which is to be cut open with an artistically designed pair of scissors. In truth, the plastic is a sousvide bag, which contains a perfectly cooked squab breast in a rosemary-scented reduction. The dish’s cleverness derives from its plating and its name: it is called Homing Pigeon.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin’s restaurant is more irreverent—and makes more of a show of its irreverence—than elBulli. Fond of music metaphors, when asked whether he considers himself to be cooking in the same style as Adrià, Martin responds, “Do U2 and AC/DC make the same kind of music? Of course not. But they’re both rock and roll.” Here, instead of flowers, a plastic cow noisemaker—turn it over and it moos—tops the tables, and a meal ends with diners popping big, brightly colored circus balloons to release the white chocolate and pepper candy inside. But his method of working (he has a test kitchen on-site) and his desire to use cuisine to provoke memories and emotions are similar. He has adapted a distiller created for the giant food conglomerate down the street, for example, so that it produces a clear, tasteless liquid that smells deeply and perfectly of the ingredient—lemon, strawberry, toasted bread—from which it is drawn.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_179"/>Gaël was entranced. Before arriving at Denis Martin, he’d had only one exposure to the phrase “molecular gastronomy”: a newspaper article that featured a dish composed of lines of wasabi and an almond foam, served on a black slate plate. He found it extraordinary; the idea that food could be about more than sustenance and simple gustatory pleasure had never before occurred to him. But at Denis Martin, it didn’t take long before he had assimilated the concepts that gird avant-garde cuisine: food as provocation, food as art. Before long, Martin was encouraging him to experiment on his own and giving him greater responsibility. At the time, the restaurant was open for both lunch and dinner, and Gaël would work from 9 <small>A.M.</small> until 1 <small>A.M.</small> “I think he was just glad to have a new kid in there, because there was too much work,” says Gaël. But soon, he discovered that he shared his chef’s enthusiasm for innovation. In 2007, Gaël came up with a dish that is still on Martin’s menu: a savory cornet, tinted black with squid ink, filled with an herbal mousse, and topped with strips of fried calamari—a play on the boardwalk newspaper cone filled with fried fish. Not long after that, he began making regular public appearances with his chef, first at culinary conferences in which he would demonstrate dishes for other professionals and later on a Swiss television show called <span class="txit">Imitate the Chef.</span> There, as Martin watched approvingly, asking questions and complimenting his technique, Gaël prepared a barely poached ravioli in which the filling was made from regular button mushrooms but the “pasta” was thinly sliced pieces of kohlrabi. As he cooked, he calmly explained what he was doing and why, unnerved by neither the camera nor the watchful gaze of his chef. He moved with the graceful confidence of a veteran.</p>
<p class="indent">They had conflicts, nonetheless. “Gaël is very stubborn, very strong,” says Martin, no slouch himself in the backbone department. Once when his chef corrected him, Gaël snapped back, an unthinkable breach of kitchen protocol and hierarchy. Martin immediately froze and gestured menacingly to his cook to follow him. He took Gaël, whose moment of pique had by now transformed itself into abject remorse, down to the wine cellar—the confessional, as Martin calls it. It was cold and dark in there, and Martin couldn’t tell if Gaël was shaking from the temperature <a id="page_180"/>or from fear. “Look, you want to take me on, we can do that,” the chef said to his protégé. “We can fight, and I’ll throw you out. Or you can decide to respect me and do what I say, in which case, I’ll continue to help you.” Gaël chose the latter. He survived the Oedipal conflict intact.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin held up his end of the bargain. He knew that Gaël was still somewhat drawn to the traditional cuisine he had prepared at the auberge, and this concerned him—not because he had anything against classical cooking, but because he was worried that Gaël’s unwillingness to invest himself wholly in one style of cuisine would prevent him from fully developing as a chef. One day he took the twenty-one-year-old aside and told him he needed to try other places so that he could make a decision. “I said that if he was leaning toward traditional cuisine, I would get him a <span class="txit">stage</span> at Guy Savoy or some other classic three-star,” Martin recalls. “But if he wanted to commit to avant-garde cooking, to my style of cooking, he should go to elBulli.” Gaël chose the latter.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">When the backlash against Adrià came, it was deeply shocking—even traumatic—to many members of Spain’s normally convivial fraternity of chefs. Receiving a prize in May 2008 for his new book, <span class="txit">The Kitchen Laid Bare,</span> the three-star chef Santi Santamaria, who himself had greatly shaped Spain’s culinary history from his restaurant Can Fabes, about ninety minutes down the road from elBulli, criticized his colleagues for “legitimating forms of cooking that distance them from the traditional” and railed against “cooking with chemicals like methylcellulose whose consumption could be dangerous.” In case anyone missed the reference, he got specific: “I have an enormous conceptual and ethical divorce from Ferran; he and his team are going in a direction contrary to my principles.” It wasn’t the first time Santamaria had played the Rabelaisian populist, speaking earthy truth to gastronomic power (the previous year, he had told a chefs’ conference that “All good meals end with a good shit”). But this time his words—so clearly intended to provoke—were met with outrage. Within days, Euro-Toques International, a European chefs’ organization, issued a statement expressing its indignation at <a id="page_181"/>Santamaria’s “act of aggression.” Fermi Puig, Ferran’s old navy buddy and today the chef of Barcelona’s Drolma, wrote in <span class="txit">La Vanguardia</span> that the debate had pushed the public’s respect for chefs back a decade. Sergi Arola, a former elBulli protégé who holds two stars for his restaurant Sergi Arola Gastro in Madrid, accused Santamaria of mounting a personal vendetta “out of envy.” Was it petty rivalry that was driving him? The quest for publicity for his book? Or did he really believe this stuff? In some ways it didn’t matter, because the end result was the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran tried to avoid a public response but eventually went on the record as saying that he regretted the damage Santamaria’s comments would do to Spanish cuisine’s reputation abroad. And indeed, although at home the press was confined largely to delighted chortles over the so-called War of the Stove Tops, in other countries, such as France and Italy, things soon took a more pernicious turn. Although Joël Robuchon, possibly France’s most important living chef and an early and steadfast elBulli supporter, went out of his way to defend Adrià (in an interview, Robuchon declared, “I eat at elBulli all the time, and my health is impeccable”), others used the occasion to resurrect the pettiness and ire first provoked in 2003, when <span class="txit">The New York Times Magazine</span> had crowned Spanish cuisine—and especially Ferran’s—the most exciting in the world, thereby displacing the French, who had held that title since pretty much forever. Now some French chefs took the opportunity opened by Santamaria to denigrate the use of additives as “not really cooking.” In Italy, a documentary-style television program went undercover in the kitchen of Massimo Bottura at the avant-garde Osteria Francescana in Modena and filmed the chef adding methylcellulose to a sauce. The show’s air of shocked outrage—what insidious foreign corruptions were contaminating Italian food?—was persuasive. In 2009, the Italian government banned the use of hydrocolloids and other additives from restaurants (despite the fact that they were still permitted, and widely used, in industrial food), and it wasn’t long before the <span class="txit">carabinieri</span> were busting into restaurants and confiscating cans of Texturas—the collection of additives sold under the Adrià name.</p>
<p class="indent">The virulence of this reaction pushed Ferran into a stance he never <a id="page_182"/>wanted. He had begun his career cooking what was essentially French food, and he continues to see the kind of avant-garde food he now makes not as emerging from an abrupt break with the past but as a natural evolution from nouvelle cuisine. It isn’t he who is saying classic French cuisine is dead (that would be <span class="txit">The New York Times</span>); in his mind all he has done is open up the category of haute cuisine to include new, liberated forms. He is also accustomed to the suspicion that molecular gastronomy excites among some critics, and he long ago grew used to their mockery of the foams and liquid nitrogen that are now ubiquitous in restaurants throughout the world. But this latest incarnation of antagonism has forced him to defend himself.</p>
<p class="indent">Now when journalists show up, eager to see the wizard at work, he quickly dashes their expectations. One day an unsuspecting reporter for a French newspaper is in the kitchen, doing a story on the latest dishes. Ferran marches over to him as he stands at the pass, notebook at the ready. “Do you see any test tubes?” he demands. “Any Bunsen burners?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No,” the reporter replies a little nervously.</p>
<p class="indent">“What about machines? Do you see any big, scary machines you don’t recognize?”</p>
<p class="indent">The reporter admits that he does not.</p>
<p class="indent">“This is another of the great myths about elBulli,” Ferran says, his words rushing together as he warms to his subject. “That I’m a mad scientist and this is my laboratory. Does this look like a lab? Do I look like a mad scientist?”</p>
<p class="indent">At this particular moment, Ferran’s untrimmed, disheveled curls are bouncing and he is animatedly making a characteristic gesture—his erect index finger <span class="txit">thwop</span>s along the bridge of his nose—that makes his eyes look as though they might pop from his head. He also has a bit of sauce on his face from a recent tasting. The reporter makes no comment.</p>
<p class="indent">The additives at elBulli, he points out, are flavorless and used in minute quantities—a gram here, a smidgen there. “And they’re natural. What is Xantana made from? Corn. How is that more processed than sugar? Do you know what they do to get sugar? Or wine?” Here he retrieves a bottle and turns it to expose the label.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_183"/>“What does that say? Sulfites.” He nods insistently. “Eh? I’d much rather eat a little Xantana than a sulfite.”</p>
<p class="indent">The reporter scribbles furiously, afraid, perhaps, that he will be made to do just that. But Ferran is on to another topic of outrage.</p>
<p class="indent">“Everybody says that I don’t cook, that I just use technology. Do you want to see my technology?” he demands. “There’s my technology.” With that he pulls the reporter behind the pass and takes him to the center table, where the stagiaires, their fingers red and sore, are meticulously shelling fresh pistachios.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Gaël was only twenty-two years old when he left for Spain, but he had already spent seven years in the restaurant business and was chef de cuisine at a Michelin-starred restaurant, where he earned roughly 3,000 euros a month. So it came as something of a shock to be reduced once again to shucking oysters as an unpaid stagiaire at elBulli. Still, the indignation would come later; his first sensation was fear. He was one of the youngest cooks there, for one thing, and his language skills were severely lacking; Eugeni would get after him during training, telling him to listen, listen, but all the listening in the world didn’t matter if Gaël couldn’t understand the words being spoken. “When I got to Spain, the only words I knew were <span class="txit">gracias</span> and <span class="txit">cerveza,</span>” he says with a smile. “I couldn’t understand a fucking thing they were saying to me.”</p>
<p class="indent">It wasn’t until the first service that his fear began to give way to anger. As Ferran called an early dish, Gaël joined the scrum at the center table to begin plating it. But Eugeni, convinced that the stagiaire’s lack of Spanish comprehension meant he didn’t know what he was doing, took the cup out of his hand and told him to get behind the group and watch. “I understood what to do,” recalls Gaël indignantly. “And I wasn’t there to just watch. I wanted to do things.”</p>
<p class="indent">It took a while before the permanent team realized that Gaël’s lack of proficiency with Spanish was not equivalent to a lack of proficiency in the kitchen. Convinced that the Swiss stagiaire was a bit slow, Eugeni kept urging him to go faster at tasks, whether peeling nuts or shucking <a id="page_184"/>oysters. Watching this exchange one day, Oriol proposed a little test. “Eugeni,” the chef de cuisine called out, “let’s see who can do them faster—you or Gaël.” A pile of shellfish was placed in front of each man, and on Oriol’s signal they began to shuck as quickly as they could, taking care not to nick the flesh inside. Gaël, who had spent years of his apprenticeship perfecting this particular skill, won easily. “Eugeni wouldn’t speak to me for the rest of the day,” he says with a small smile.</p>
<p class="indent">Gradually, through actions more than words, Gaël convinced the chefs at elBulli that he knew what he was doing. Eugeni made him his assistant for a while, and Oriol and Eduard began to give him more responsibility. The artichoke rose, for example, became “his” dish. After Emma moved on to the center table, Gaël took over the blanching and pressure cooking of the petals and found that he liked the precision of the dish. “You have to have an intuition for it,” he says. “A bit too short, and they’re raw. A bit too long, and they’re overcooked. It’s a matter of seconds.” Over time the chefs would look to him to say how many roses he would need for service each night. Even Ferran noticed. “He seems like he’s spaced out,” he said one day in reference to Gaël. “But he’s actually paying attention to everything.”</p>
<p class="indent">Well, not everything. Gaël was frequently so focused on what he was doing that he failed to notice things going on around him. The night Jorge was burned, for example, Gaël was assisting at the Starters II station and was so deep into the task of cooking the ham canapé that he had no idea the accident had taken place—even though it occurred about three feet away. “I didn’t even hear anything,” he recalled. Nor did the tensions and outbursts of a normal service bother him. “For one thing, whenever someone starts yelling, I can’t understand what they are saying,” he said. “But I also like stress. I like it when someone gives me shit if I fuck up. Don’t say, ‘Oh you poor thing, are you having a bad day?’ Get in my face.”</p>
<p class="indent">In August, he began to consider putting his name in for a job the following year. It would mean leaving Vevey, his job and his girlfriend for another six months. But a position as chef de partie at elBulli would also offer a challenge that was hard to resist. “I want to see if I can do it,” <a id="page_185"/>he said, explaining his decision. “I want to see if I can run a station in the best restaurant in the world.”</p>
<p class="indent">Run a station and further his artistry. At Denis Martin, where he was already chef de cuisine, Gaël played roughly the same role that Oriol did at elBulli, coming up with new dishes, testing new ideas. This to him was the whole point of cooking, the thing he hoped to get better at by returning to Roses. He already knew how to treat food as an evolving canvas, so that it might surprise, delight, unnerve. But another stint at elBulli, one in which he was in charge of something, might teach him, he thought, the responsibility of an artist. “Some people, they just want their food to be about love,” he said. “But that’s not enough for me. I want it to express me, my ideas, my vision.” Like Oriol, Gaël had no desire to own his own restaurant one day. “I don’t want to run a business,” he said. “All that worrying about costs and staff and keeping the building maintained—I’m not good at that. I just want to cook.” I just want, he might as well have said, to create. Like Oriol, he imagined he would be happier alone in his lab, testing new ideas, than in the messy, mediated job of running a restaurant.</p>
<p class="indent">Like almost everyone producing avant-garde cuisine, Gaël dislikes the phrase “molecular gastronomy.” (“What does that even mean?” he asks. “All food is made up of molecules.”) But he loves the opportunities it affords to experiment, to confound expectations. And he wholly embraces the idea that a chef can be an artist. Cooking, in his mind, is like painting—there are house painters, and then there are painting painters. He sees himself fitting into the latter category. “I don’t want to be cooking to feed people. I want to cook to shock them.” Asked if he ever questions his talents—about whether he is good enough to be a painting painter, he says he has no doubt. “I’ve never met anyone with more passion for cuisine than I have.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Along with the issue of additives, a new—or at least newly chic—direction in haute cuisine has increased the scrutiny to which elBulli’s food is subjected. Although European chefs have practiced locavore, or <a id="page_186"/>farm-to-table, cuisine for centuries, an emphasis on exotic ingredients and year-round availability in recent decades had displaced what was once a necessary tradition. Now, as that old kind of eating becomes fashionable once again and an ever-growing number of chefs seek out heirloom vegetables and pastured meat, the product itself has assumed greater importance. Santamaria, who has always featured local, Catalan ingredients and techniques in his cooking but certainly isn’t averse to serving a tomato in February or importing oysters from Normandy, appropriated the rhetoric of this new movement in his attack on avant-garde cuisine.</p>
<p class="indent">Here too, Ferran feels compelled to defend himself against misconceptions about what goes on in his kitchen. Yes, he serves Japanese tofu and Ecuadoran roses and Dutch succulents and French smoked butter. “But did you taste this?” he will ask, holding out a raw leaf, or smearing an uncooked dab onto your hand. “It’s the best in the world.” Like any other decent chef, Ferran can get very excited by a product that does nothing more exotic than taste good. And he can be just as disappointed when it doesn’t live up to his expectations, no matter how rare or unusual it is. When a shipment of Lola tomatoes that he tasted a few weeks earlier finally comes in—the fruit elongated like a jalapeño and packed preciously in straw—he opens the box with the joy of a child at Christmas. Immediately, he grabs a knife and starts slicing into a tomato. One piece, then two, then another; the tomato has disappeared, and still he can’t stop eating. He starts in on another.</p>
<p class="indent">He pauses to issue the usual verdict. “These are the best tomatoes in the world,” he says before taking another slice.</p>
<p class="indent">This time, however, something stops him, and he pauses in midchew. “There are seeds in this. Last time there weren’t seeds.” He chews a little more, then picks up a whole tomato and looks at it skeptically. “They’re good, or even very good, but . . .” His thoughts trail off, but he closes the box; for the moment, Lola tomatoes don’t look to have a future at elBulli. “This is the most stressful part,” he shrugs. “You never know what the product will be like.”</p>
<p class="indent">Lola tomatoes come from a producer a few hundred kilometers down <a id="page_187"/>the Mediterranean coast, in Alicante. Does that make them local or not? The question doesn’t trouble Ferran. His policy has always been to start close to home and work his way out, letting quality, more than any other factor, including price, be the chief determinant. If he can get better-tasting tomatoes from Alicante than he can from a farmer in the nearby town of Figueres, he will choose Alicante. And in fact the shopping list for the restaurant forms a series of concentric circles expanding ever outward in space and time—daily shopping at the market in Roses, every other day in Figueras, twice weekly at the Boqueria in Barcelona, once-a-week shipments from everywhere else. If the restaurant imports its organic milk from Germany but gathers pine nuts from the trees just outside the kitchen door, it is because those products, he says, are the best.</p>
<p class="indent">Amid the snark and the side taking of the Santamaria <span class="txit">escándalo,</span> one important point about elBulli’s cuisine has been obscured. It is not uncommon for critics to characterize some of Ferran’s most iconic techniques—the foam, the spherification, the liquid nitrogen—as mere novelty for the sake of novelty or showmanship for the sake of showmanship. But ask him why he invented these techniques, and his answer will always come down to the chef’s holy grail: flavor. Foam, that early revolution, was designed in the quest to make a mousse without gelatin or cream. Liquid nitrogen creates a sorbet without the sugar that would normally be necessary to keep it from forming hard, icy crystals. Xantana allows a cook to thicken a sauce without flour or butter. Spherification permits the diner to eat liquids, not drink them. The things that chefs traditionally add to a preparation to transform its texture—butter, sugar, cream, vegetable purée, flour—may be delicious, but they also dilute the flavor of the primary ingredients. Yet if you add Xantana to chicken stock, you’ll have a sauce that tastes of nothing but chicken. Turn the juice from shucked oysters into foam using nothing more than a siphon, and you’ll have a mousse that tastes solely of the sea. Freeze a mango purée with liquid nitrogen, and you will get a sorbet that tastes shockingly of only ripe fruit.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran uses hydrocolloids and high-tech machines because they <a id="page_188"/>allow him to make a product taste more like what it is. But he is just as likely to set those additives and technologies aside if they don’t bring anything to the plate. Although it took a few years, he has by now learned that he doesn’t necessarily need them to create the provocative, magical dishes he adores. One of the most beloved dishes of the 2009 season, for example, perfectly captures the essence of autumn and enchants diners by forcing them to reexamine their preconceptions, but is also startlingly simple: a large, empty wineglass filled with a scandalously abundant amount of fresh white truffle, shaved tableside. It is a ridiculously luxurious dish, made all the more so by the fact that the diner isn’t meant to eat the unadorned truffle, only smell it. Truffles don’t have any real taste, Ferran explains, only aroma; smell them deeply, and you’ll have a fuller experience. Chef Denis Martin, who tried the dish on his annual visit to elBulli, agreed. “It’s a cretinous idea—truffles alone in a glass!” he ranted. “Idiotic! Stupid! But it’s pure genius.” Especially because, after the table has had its fill of the scent, the servers bring out plates of sweet potato gnocchi, sauced with butter and sprinkled with more truffle shavings. The diners sniff the glass, then take a bite, intensifying the flavor of what is in their mouths into a near frenzy of truffle-ness. On this, as with the liquid nitrogen sorbet or Xantana-thickened stock, the point is always the same. “It’s about purity,” Ferran says. “Purity of flavor.”</p>
<p class="indent">With those words, he exposes the lie behind the now-common tendency to position what we might call a cuisine of the product against a cuisine of elaboration. In its most virulent form, the tendency pits “organic,” “farm-fresh” cooking that “respects” the ingredients against cooking that is “technical,” “molecular,” “manipulated.” (The virulence runs both ways—not long ago David Chang provoked a minor firestorm in culinary circles when he accused San Francisco chefs of doing nothing more than setting some “figs on a plate.”) But as Ferran points out, all cooking—even splitting open those figs and drizzling them with a little honey—is manipulation, and to attempt to assign a value to the degree of elaboration that occurs in the kitchen is an impossible task. Product versus Manipulation is a false dichotomy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_189"/>Yet Ferran is not content simply to emphasize flavor. If he were, he would be serving that liquid-nitrogenized mango sorbet alone in a bowl. He combines pure flavors in new, provocative ways and brings new techniques to the same task not just because they are amusing or taste good but because, in doing so, he allows his diners to reexamine their expectations of what food is and what it can be. Manipulation, in other words, is where the art happens. It is this ambition, this sense that his dishes are reaching for something more than simply tasting good, that irks his critics. His crime is less that he breaks or refuses to acquiesce to long-established rules (savory comes before sweet; sauce is liquid, not solid) than that he dares to ask, <span class="txit">demands</span> to ask, really, can food be art? Behind the rivalries both personal and nationalistic, the purportedly antagonistic ideologies of manipulation versus product, lurks this question.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="txit">Can</span> food be art? Adoring diners have declared chefs since Marie-Antoine Carême worthy of the title <span class="txit">artist,</span> but it sometimes seems that until Ferran, no one really took the question seriously. Indeed, when Ferran was invited in 2007 to participate in Documenta, an important contemporary art fair held every five years in Kassel, Germany (his contribution was to serve dinner to a couple chosen daily from among the fairgoers in Kassel and sent to elBulli for the night), his inclusion prompted outrage among some critics precisely <span class="txit">because</span> he was being treated like any other artist. Skeptics complained that including a cook signaled the banalization of Documenta. “Both Adrià’s participation and contribution seem ridiculous to me,” sniffed the art critic Robert Hughes, adding definitively, if reductively, that “food is food.” Even the show’s organizers seemed unwilling to make a conclusive statement on the question. “We aren’t saying that cooking is a new art form. We’re saying that Ferran Adrià shows artistic intelligence,” said the curator, Ruth Noack. “And besides, compared to [Jeff] Koons, who’s banal? Banality in art isn’t a question of medium but of complexity.” Although Ferran is frequently and commonly compared to Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Antoni Gaudí—all three radical innovators with ties to Catalonia—the question “Is he an artist?” still circles back on itself, never conclusively <a id="page_190"/>resolved, yet impossible to avoid, and occasionally polarizing in its implication that one chef, at least, is more of an artist than any other.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran’s own evolution on this question has been striking. During the early years of his renown, he was most closely identified with scientists. Much of this reputation was surely enflamed by the media, who loved to depict the chef holding bubbling test tubes aloft or working fixatedly with centrifuges. But Ferran himself encouraged the connection by actively seeking relationships with scientists, especially the chemist Pere Castells, who first introduced him to xanthan gum. In 2004, he became a founding member and director of the Alicia Foundation, a Catalan institution dedicated to studying the intersections of science and food. He still remains involved with the scientific world; in 2010, he helped teach a course in Harvard University’s science department. Yet over time, he has moved slightly away from this identification or at least complicated it; he has in fact admitted that his original hope for Alicia—that the foundation would advance the technique of haute cuisine—has not borne fruit. His formerly close relationship with science has been, if not replaced, at least pushed aside to make room for a connection with the art world.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of Documenta, when he was asked whether he saw himself as an artist, he refused to answer the question clearly. He took care to emphasize that other media, like photography, had encountered artistic resistance when they were first introduced, but overall said he preferred to stay out of the debate about whether what he does is art or not. “That’s for other people to decide,” he said at the time. “Cooking is cooking. And if it exists alongside art, that’s wonderful.” But that was in 2007. These days his primary connections outside the culinary world proper—at least the ones that most excite him—are with the arts. In 2009, he was invited to participate in more than a dozen arts conferences, was the subject of a well-received Parisian opera, and has been involved in a couple of films that have little to do with cooking per se. “I could fill my entire schedule just with the art shows I’m invited to participate in,” he said one morning, clearly pleased with the development.</p>
<p class="indent">The stagiaires who come to elBulli are drawn by Adrià’s creativity. <a id="page_191"/>Like everyone else, they refer to him as a genius, an artist, and they spend their six months of indentured servitude hoping that some of the talent that has made him unique will rub off on them. But most of them say they do not want to cook like him. It is a curious truth that although they are thrilled to acquire the techniques and fight to have the opportunity to learn to use the Pacojet or the alginate bath, the great majority of stagiaires have no plans to produce avant-garde cuisine themselves. Sunny is typical. “Nah, I want to go back to basics,” he says one day when he has arrived at the restaurant early so that he can go down to the beach to meditate before the start of mise en place. “Delicious food, beautiful ingredients, made with love.” Begoña, from Bilbao, echoes his words, albeit in a different cultural context. “A good stew, a creamy rice” is how she describes what she wants to cook. “Food you eat with a spoon.” There are exceptions—Luke adores the most conceptual of Spanish cuisine, and Nico is always jotting down ideas in his notebook for cocktails that separate into layers before the diner’s eyes—but asked about their own style, most of the stagiaires work in the words “good,” “product,” and “love.”</p>
<p class="indent">What is interesting is that they see it as a choice, an either/or, between the avant-garde and something more nurturing and delicious. In other words, they unwittingly subscribe to the dichotomy laid out by Santamaria. Yet, as many elBulli alumni have discovered, a chef need not choose. Having come through elBulli, Andoni Luis Aduriz, René Redzepi, Paco Morales, and Nuno Mendes have all chosen to weight the balance a little more toward the product, but they also judiciously use modern, “molecular” techniques to heighten flavors. Their food is less self-consciously artistic than Adrià’s, and because all of these chefs maintain gardens and forage for wild ingredients, it tracks closely with the locavore movement. But a foam here, a frozen sand there, “dirt” made from ground burned hazelnuts—all owe a profound debt to elBulli. Theirs is, in other words, a third way.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the stagiaires don’t seem to realize that they don’t have to choose between one and the other. “I’m interested in learning about molecular gastronomy,” says Emma. “But it’s not me. I want to really <a id="page_192"/>cook.” “Really” cook. What does that mean? Is it not “really” cooking if it involves a distillatory or a centrifuge? If it includes hydrocolloids or sulfites? If it requires you “only” to put some well-grown vegetables on a plate? Yet however much they may reject Ferran’s approach to cuisine, the stagiaires have nonetheless internalized the ethos that drives it. Like the young women who accept without question the gains in employment and opportunities that feminism has brokered but reject the moniker “feminist,” they expect their food not only to make others happy but to say something about themselves. They see cooking, in other words, as a form of self-expression equal to writing poetry or painting sunsets. Even if they are loath to call it by that name, they have come to see cooking as art.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">As Gaël struggled to decide whether he wanted to apply to return to elBulli, the question of art weighed on his mind. He had come to Roses already experienced in the ways that food could shock and amuse. But his time in Adrià’s kitchen had given him a larger context for that knowledge. Like a provincial painter who finds himself in the workshop of a great master, he saw now that, for a chef, cooking could be about even more than expressing your own vision. It could also articulate a more global vision, a profound challenge to the status quo. But for food to do that, and do it consistently, required the unswerving determination and dedication of a revolutionary. Did he want to be part of a revolution?</p>
<p class="indent">All day, that row of homely ingredients for fondue sat on the pass: the cheese, the garlic, the raffia-tied jars, each of them somehow out of place next to the dark-tinted bottles scrawled in obscure alphabets, the unlikely vegetables, the mysterious pastes oozing from their cellophane. Finally Eduard pulled Gaël from the line and told him to start cooking. Although he had made fondue countless times before, the Swiss stagiaire was nervous as he prepared it and worried that he would make a mistake. Always so intently focused on his own work, he didn’t realize that he was not the first stagiaire to suffer this anxiety. At other points in the season, other apprentices had found themselves in the simultaneously <a id="page_193"/>exhilarating and terrifying position of having to cook a typical dish from home for Adrià and his staff. For Luke it was kimchi, for Katie it was her grandmother’s barbecue sauce. Luca had had to prepare tiramisù, only to have Ferran and Oriol set about deconstructing it in an effort to come up with a savory version.</p>
<p class="indent">Now it was Gaël’s turn. Oriol sent Andrea over to watch, instructing her to take careful notes of everything the young Swiss cook did. So, as he worked, Gaël explained each step, just as he had on the television shows he had shot with Chef Martin. He lined up all his ingredients—the cheese, the kirsch, a bottle of white wine, cornstarch, pepper, a clove of garlic, a little baking soda. He grated the cheese and put it into a stainless-steel pot but noted that a clay one would have been better. Fondue, he said, should never be stirred with a metal spoon, only a wooden one. And it had to be stirred thoroughly, to ensure that no <a id="page_194"/>cheese remained undisturbed on the bottom of the pan, where it would burn. As Gaël talked and cooked, Eugeni, Eduard, Oriol, and even Ferran wandered over to observe. From the intensity of their interest, you would have thought that Gaël was at work on an elaborate preparation of some rare and unprecedented dish, like spherified ortolans. But no, it was just melted cheese. Still, for these Spanish chefs, fondue was unexplored territory. They stood at the stove top with Gaël, dipping their cubes of bread into the finished sauce and laughing as they licked gooey cheese off their fingers.</p>

<p class="caption">The Easter egg is frozen in liquid nitrogen (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent">Did Gaël recognize something valuable in the moment? Or did making fondue remind him of the kind of cooking he didn’t want to do? The next day, he asked Marc to consider him for chef de partie the following year. A few days later, his fondue inspired a new version of the Easter Egg, this one made with Gruyère cheese.</p>
