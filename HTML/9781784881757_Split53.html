<h1 class="chapter">black kale bruschetta</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Daniela Fiaschi, the chef from Agriturismo La Mandriola in Lajatico, showed me how to eat sautéed black kale (cavolo nero), the winter cabbage that originates from Tuscany, in her favourite way.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE SAUTÉED BLACK KALE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 head cavolo nero leaves, washed and roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>fresh red chilli, to taste, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 × 400 g (14 oz) tin cannellini beans (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 thick slices of crusty bread</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 garlic clove, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ lemon, for squeezing</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add the cavolo nero. Cook the cavolo nero for 5–10 minutes until soft, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water, and set aside.</p>
<p class="tx">Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped garlic, chilli, and a pinch of salt and pepper, and fry for 2 minutes, taking care not to let the garlic brown. Add the cavolo nero, and toss well to combine. Cook for a few minutes, adding a little of the cooking water if necessary so that the cavolo nero doesn’t burn. When the leaves are soft and tender (try one) it is ready. If using the beans, warm them in a small pan in the liquid from the tin, then drain in a sieve.</p>
<p class="tx">Toast the bread on both sides, rub with peeled garlic and pour over a little of the remaining olive oil. Top with the cavolo nero, the beans (if using), a squeeze of lemon juice, to taste, and the remaining olive oil.</p>
