<p class="nonindent">This simple recipe, translated as “chicken fried with garlic,” is a staple on any traditional tapas menu. Do not allow the garlic to overcook and become too brown as the flavor will turn unpleasantly bitter.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 boneless and skinless chicken thighs</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">4 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup good-quality dry sherry (such as fino)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. brandy</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cut the thighs into 4 pieces each. Season with salt and pepper and then coat with flour. In a skillet, heat the oil and add the garlic. Gently fry until the garlic begins to turn golden, then remove and set aside. Add the chicken to the pan. Fry for 3 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Return the garlic to the pan.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour in the sherry and brandy. Flambé if you’re feeling brave, or just let the alcohol bubble away until only about 1–2 tablespoons are left in the pan. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Harissa is a piquant spice mix particularly popular in Moroccan cooking. Rose harissa is a similar spice blend with the addition of rose petals, which gives it an appealing aromatic depth. These flavors work beautifully as a rub on any meat but give a particular interest to the subtleties of chicken.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 chicken thighs, boneless, with skin</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. harissa (rose harissa is my favorite)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">zest and juice of 1 lime</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">lime wedges to serve</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the chicken thighs in a bowl. Add the harissa, oil, garlic, lime zest, salt, and pepper. Let marinate for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat a griddle on high heat until it begins to smoke. Lay the chicken thighs, skin side down, on the griddle. Cook for 3 minutes on each side or until lightly charred and cooked through. For the last minute, sprinkle with the lime juice. Transfer to a serving dish and serve sprinkled with more sea salt and lime wedges.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Cordon bleu is a gastronomic term meaning of the highest class. Therefore, this moist chicken wrapped in ham with oozy cheese is just about as delicious as you can get. To make sure this recipe has a real Spanish flair, it uses the quintessentially Spanish ingredients of manchego cheese and Serrano ham.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 skinless and boneless chicken breast</p>
<p class="hanging">1 6–inch-long, 1/8–inch-thick slice manchego cheese</p>
<p class="hanging">1–2 slices Serrano ham</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup all-purpose flour, seasoned with salt and pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 egg, whisked</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/4 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the chicken breast between pieces of waxed paper. With either a meat mallet or a rolling pin, flatten the meat, like a schnitzel. Lay the cheese on top and then the slices of ham on top of the cheese. Tuck the ham around slightly to encase the cheese.</p>
<p class="extract">Set out the flour, egg, and bread crumbs in different bowls. First coat the chicken in flour, then egg, and then bread crumbs. The cheese needs to be totally encased, so you may need to repeat the last steps to be sure.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the oil in a skillet, add the breaded chicken, and pan-fry for 3–4 minutes on each side or until golden, crisp, and cooked through. Drain on paper towels and then carve into fingers. Place in a serving dish and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Making your own gnocchi might seem a little daunting, but I assure you, once you have eaten fresh gnocchi, you will never go back to store-bought.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 chicken breast, with skin on and wing tip in</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup shredded cavolo nero (black kale)</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the gnocchi</p>
<p class="hanging">4 medium floury potatoes (such as russet), baked and still hot</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup Italian “00” (or all-purpose) flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 tsp. fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/2 tbsp. finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. white truffle paste</p>
<p class="hanging">1 egg yolk, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the sage &amp; truffle butter</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="hanging">4 large fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tsp. truffle-infused olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then lay it skin-side down in the skillet and fry for 2–3 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden. Turn it over, then place in oven for 8–10 minutes or until cooked through. Remove and let rest, covered, to keep warm.</p>
<p class="extract">To make the gnocchi, scoop out the flesh of the baked potatoes. Mash potato in a large mixing bowl. Form a well in the center and add the flour, salt, and Parmesan. Stir, and mix in the truffle paste and beaten egg yolk. With clean, floured hands, press the mixture together to form a dough, adding a little more flour if the mixture is too wet. Do not overwork. Put the dough on a floured surface and shape into a long log. Cut into 1–inch lengths and press <a id="page107"/>down the tops with a fork, then gently press the sides to resemble pillows. Cover with plastic wrap so the gnocchi does not dry out while you make the sauce.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, put the butter and sage in a small pan over medium heat. Let the butter cook until it is golden brown and smelling nutty. Remove from the heat and stir in the truffle oil. Keep warm. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Poach the gnocchi and kale for 1–2 minutes or until the gnocchi has risen to the surface. Drain, then add to the sage and truffle oil butter sauce. Return the pan to medium-high heat and toss until the gnocchi is well coated and browning in some spots. Transfer to a serving dish. Carve the chicken and arrange pieces on top of the gnocchi. Drizzle with the chicken juices and any remaining butter sauce.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Serrano ham or “mountain ham” is a typical dry-cured Spanish ham. This means it is generally served raw in thin slices, but when cooked it crisps up beautifully, creating a rich salty flavor that complements the chicken, zingy lemon, and herbs.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 skinless and boneless chicken breast</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1–2 slices Serrano ham</p>
<p class="hanging">2 fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="hanging">1 lemon slice</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. butter</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 cup dry Marsala wine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Put the chicken breast between pieces of waxed paper and, using a meat mallet or rolling pin, flatten to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Lay a slice of ham on top of the chicken and put a sage leaf on top. Cover the sage with a slice of lemon and secure the whole thing with a toothpick. Lightly dust with flour on both sides. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet. Cook the chicken for about 3 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Add the Marsala to the pan and quickly bubble down until thickened and reduced by about half. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish and pour the sauce on top.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This quick sticky stew is a hearty, rustic, and homey dish that is really satisfying when you want something light but comforting. The grating of the orange zest at the end gives an interesting twist to the flavor.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 boneless and skinless chicken thighs</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</p>

Return the garlic to the pan, and add the olives and potatoes.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour in the sherry and brandy, flambé if you’re feeling brave, but otherwise let the alcohol bubble away until only about 1–2 tablespoons are left in the pan. Stir in the parsley and orange zest, and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The delicate and perfumed flavor of quince is a great match for earthy duck. Cooking the fruit in this selection of spices gives a subtle, exciting twist to the sauce.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 1/4 cups dry or sweet white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">1 quince, peeled and cut in small chunks</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch ground mace</p>
<p class="hanging">1 star anise</p>
<p class="hanging">2 whole cloves</p>
<p class="hanging">1 duck breast</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter, cubed</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pour the wine into a saucepan and add the quince, vinegar, sugar, and spices. Bring to a boil, and continue gently boiling for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let cool while you cook the duck. Score the duck breast skin and remove the fat. Place skin-side down in a dry skillet and cook gently over a low heat, for roughly 8 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 3–4 minutes. At this point the duck should be cooked to medium doneness. Remove from the heat and rest while you complete the dish.</p>
<p class="extract">Discard the rendered duck fat from the pan, add 1/3 cup of the quince cooking sauce and the quince chunks, and cook down, turning the quince as you go, and reduce until you are left with a strong sauce. Whisk in a few cubes of cold butter, cube by cube, until the sauce is velvety and thick.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the duck breast into strips and serve on a warm plate with pieces of quince and some sauce poured on top.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This unusual salad is made especially striking due to the quantity of strong but complementary flavors involved. Pickled walnuts, a treat often found at Christmastime, go perfectly with meaty duck and sweet beets.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the dressing</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. walnut oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tsp. red wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the salad</p>
<p class="hanging">1 duck breast</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">4 pickled walnuts, cut into quarters</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup watercress, large stems removed</p>
<p class="hanging">1 scallion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 head Belgian endive, separated into leaves, the core sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small orange, peeled and segmented</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 1/2 cups cooked beets (canned beets are fine), cut into wedges</p>
<p class="nonindent">Combine the dressing ingredients and set aside. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the duck and place it in the pan, skin-side down, and fry for 8 minutes. (During this time a large amount of fat will come from the skin and the skin will turn golden, but the flesh shouldn’t cook too much.) Turn the duck over and cook for about 3–4 minutes on the other side. The duck should be cooked to medium doneness. Remove the duck from the pan and set aside to rest.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the walnuts and dressing to the pan and turn off the heat. The dressing should bubble and reduce a little in the remaining heat. Put the watercress, scallion, and endive in a bowl, and coat with half the dressing. Pile onto a plate with the oranges and beets, then scatter with the walnuts. Slice the duck, arrange on top of the salad, and drizzle with the remaining dressing and any juices from the duck.</p>
