<p class="normal1a" style="margin-top:1em;">I could almost have started this book with a story:</p>
<p class="normala">Once upon a time in Franche-Comté, a young boy was walking through the kitchen at his great-aunt’s house. Suddenly he stopped in his stride, looked up and shouted,</p>
<p class="normala">“When I grow up, I want to be a cuisinier.” He was five years old. At that time, nobody thought anything about it and life went on as usual. But, some time later …</p>
<p class="normalb">… that young boy did, indeed, become a chef. And I am sure you know who I am talking about!</p>
<p class="normal">I have always enjoyed my profession and, after many years, I still love it. It’s challenging, exciting and fun. It gives me the chance to work with some fabulous people—dedicated, knowledgable and hard-working—some with considerable experience and others young and eager to learn and experiment, always keen to try new techniques, new produce, new ideas.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Back to my roots</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">But that is moving ahead. From as long ago as I can remember, I was surrounded by gourmands. Food was very important in our house and I learned all the time from my mom—for I watched her constantly. Mom was passionate about food, always testing, asking me what I thought, or calling Dad to make him try this sauce or that new dish. She went to so much trouble to cook for all of us and was always totally focused. She hated it when something wasn’t right, even to the point of starting again from scratch if it was for the Christmas dinner, or another special day, and she was not happy with the dish.</p>
<p class="normal">The style of cooking reflected the classic cuisine of France, but even more it followed the traditional style of Franche-Comté. All the time, we followed the seasons and enjoyed the freshest produce at its best. Dad used to hunt, so Mom cooked whatever was in season, with fresh vegetables from our garden and fruit from the orchard. To this day, my favorite dish is gibelotte de lapin, farm rabbit casserole—always a delight.</p>
<p class="normal">When I was fifteen, I went to catering college for a year, and after that I began a three-year apprenticeship to learn the skills of my craft. That was really hard work, with the long hours, strict discipline and so much to learn. You had to stay focused every moment, which was very tiring at times. But that is something that never changes in a good kitchen. Dedication, focus, discipline and passion are vital if you want to be a good chef, and if you want to be successful.</p>
<p class="normal"><a id="pageid_9"/>When I qualified, I clearly remember the first day I started work. It was in the Luxeuil-les-Bains Hotel, in Beausite. The chef just put three large boxes of spinach leaves in front of me, showed me how he wanted them prepared and off I went. And, I’ve never looked back. I loved cooking from the start, even though it was tough—like cleaning the stove and replacing the coal early in the morning, in winter, when I was being punished for not coming up to scratch. Luckily for me, though, that was the last winter before the coal-fired stove was replaced with a modern version.</p>
<p class="normal">When I finally emerged into the culinary world of France, I was imbued with the classic principles of French cuisine and I applied them rigorously. I strove for perfection in everything and honed my skills and experience in restaurants in France, Britain, Singapore and Portugal, among other places. Having settled in Britain in 1986, I gained a Michelin star in four different restaurants, and then was finally appointed executive head chef at The Vineyard in 2009.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>French brasserie cooking</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">If I felt very fortunate to have advanced my career to such a level, I felt even more so in 2010 when I was offered the opportunity to publish my first book. As soon as we set to work on my French Brasserie Cookbook, I knew exactly what I wanted the concept to be and what I wanted the recipes to look like. This book would represent my childhood memories of cooking: using the seasons, featuring local specialties, the grandmother way. I wanted it to be totally French, very regional and to paint a picture of the way we cooked in my home in Franche-Comté.</p>
<p class="normal">Setting the idea in a broader context, I had always believed that brasserie cooking had developed from that very same style of home cooking, but that the link hadn’t been made completely, and when I researched the idea I found it to be true. So the project not only allowed me to revisit so many of the recipes from my childhood, but also gave me the chance to learn so much more about where brasserie food originally came from, when it was created and why it has become so popular.</p>
<p class="normal">It is difficult to describe the emotions when you actually hold your first book in your hands. And what I love in particular is all the positive feedback. It pleases me enormously that you are out there cooking my recipes and enjoying them, so, please, do continue to cook—and to tell me all about your successes.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><a id="pageid_10"/><b>Looking back … looking forward</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">When I started to think about a new book, I decided a complete change of perspective was needed. French Brasserie Cookbook was a book focused on my roots in French cooking, looking back to recapture the past traditions of my childhood, with some modern twists along the way, of course. But things have changed in cooking in France, as they have in countries all around the world, and I wanted to reflect those changes. This book, I decided, would have its gaze fixed firmly on the future.</p>
<p class="normal">It used to be the case that classic French cuisine was the cuisine—everything else was just cooking. French food stood alone as establishing the principles of how to cook: the ingredients, the methods, the presentation. Absolute rules were laid down on how you would make each recipe and chefs never strayed from those rules—there was one way to make a particular dish and that was the only way to do it. French style and technique set the benchmark for all cooking; it did not just consider itself superior, it was in a class of its own and, while some might have begrudged its eminence, most people agreed.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>The rumblings of discontent</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">Slowly and surely, however, things began to change in the world of food and cooking. People began to travel farther afield and try new ingredients and new flavors they then wanted to reproduce when they got home. As restaurants became more varied and accessible, an increasing number of people took advantage of the opportunity to dine out, and to experiment with new flavors and styles. The culinary public was becoming more knowledgeable and more sophisticated.</p>
<p class="normal">At that time, many ingredients that are now so easy to find in any supermarket were only available to the privileged few living in major cities. It seems strange now that it was not so long ago that sun-dried tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, pistachio nuts and even crème fraîche—to name just a few—were difficult to come by! Subsequently, however, supermarket chains began to change, too, broadening their scope and offering some of these new, “exotic” ingredients.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Man the barricades</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">And so the real revolution began. Quietly at first, but gaining increasing momentum, both chefs in restaurants and cooks at home began to experiment. They started to wonder if they could make dishes they enjoyed on vacation—even if they adapted them to suit the ingredients available—and it worked. Cooks tried different international cuisines and learned from them, mixing European with Asian, or African with Caribbean. They took full advantage of the exciting options in supermarkets and cooking became a playground for freedom and experimentation. And didn’t we love it!</p>
<p class="normal"><a id="pageid_11"/>Many home cooks were spending more money on excellent-quality food, taking more time in the kitchen, especially at weekends, cooking for themselves or entertaining friends. Looking to expand their knowledge and broaden their skills, they absorbed recipes, techniques and ideas as fast as they could from the new food magazines and the flood of cooking shows on TV. Their kitchen shelves displayed a selection of excellent cookbooks in which chefs shared their recipes, complete with beautiful photographs to illustrate the final results.</p>
<p class="normal">Blowing with these winds of change was another gust of fresh air: the move toward lighter, healthier foods with lower fat and less sugar.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>The winner emerges</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">Emerging from this revolution came the less prescriptive, more eclectic style that is how we cook today. French cuisine first lost its unique status, then fell out of favor and began to fade into the background. Did we really need all that cream and those heavy sauces? Why should there be just one right way to make a dish when it could be delicious made in different, often simpler, ways? Why did cooking have to be so time-consuming if quicker techniques gave the same results? Why should cooks feel under pressure to do everything “right” by the book, when cooking was meant to be fun? French cuisine was dismissed as outmoded—we had moved on.</p>
<p class="normal1a" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>The foundations remain</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">Meanwhile, I was enjoying this new way of cooking for a more modern, knowledgeable, relaxed audience, but I never abandoned my roots in classic French cooking. At The Vineyard, we were introducing innovative ideas all the time, making our food lighter and more modern, trying to improve our offering and chime in with this modern zeitgeist. Our simpler techniques made cooking more fun and more accessible. Guests loved trying our taster menus and giving us their feedback on particular successes.</p>
<p class="normal">But just because something needs to change, it does not mean that it should be abandoned entirely. While we all need to break away from our parents and make our own way, the values and standards we have learned from them remain vitally important. We might have shaken loose from the constraints of classic French style, but the foundations remained intact: quality ingredients treated with care and respect to create a range of delicious dishes.</p>
<p class="normal"><a id="pageid_12"/>And that is what this book sets out to do: show you just how wonderful French food can be when used as a sound and secure foundation on which to build. I have taken the best of French style and given it new twists and innovative touches that rejuvenate and energize this fabulous cuisine.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Liberté, égalité, fraternité</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">So, what are we trying to achieve here? Having established the concept for this new book, it seemed only logical to use the motto of the French Revolution to define its heart: liberté, égalité, fraternité. The three main chapters of the book bring a unique slant to modern French cooking. Each original recipe uses an unusual marriage of flavors with unexpected twists and surprises, plus I even let you in on some professional secrets.</p>
<p class="normal">Liberté showcases recipes that have been released from the shackles of traditional French cooking, replacing complex traditional French techniques with simpler ones and bringing fresh, new ideas to the table. One I particularly like is a beautiful pork shoulder steak, a dish that seems so simple but is made sublime with the innovation of fresh cabbage, still crunchy and full of flavor, cooked with fresh chili and gingerroot to give it strength, and drizzled with honey to lift the dish (see <a href="040_9781848991583_Recipe33.html#pageid_50">page 50</a>).</p>
<p class="normal">Egalité brings democracy to the recipes by elevating humble ingredients to take the starring roles. Ingredients like the common Jerusalem artichoke become the basis for an imaginative recipe rather than being a scarcely noticed side dish—witness my Jerusalem Artichoke Velouté with Truffle Oil and Chive Cream (see <a href="069_9781848991583_Recipe61.html#pageid_97">page 97</a>).</p>
<p class="normal">Fraternité celebrates traditional brotherhoods by creating dishes that bring innovation and style to classic combinations of ingredients. My Chocolate, Chili and Lemongrass Tart (see <a href="134_9781848991583_Recipe125.html#pageid_208">page 208</a>), for example, beautifully illustrates this chapter of the book.</p>
<p class="normal">In each of these chapters, I have used ideas we have been developing in our restaurant to make sure they are right up to date. That did raise the issue of whether they were too complicated for home cooks, or perhaps needed professional equipment that home cooks did not have, so I also thought about how easy the food would be to make at home. Recipes that are too daunting to attempt would have no place in my book! So, I adapted the techniques to make sure any competent cook would be able to recreate them without any problems. You won’t need expensive, professional equipment. You will need a reasonably well-equipped kitchen, however, including kitchen scales, a few small tools like a thermometer and a timer, a good blender, a steamer and a wok (we are going to use that for your smoking ingredients—how exciting is that?), but nothing out of the ordinary. Mind you, I do not promise all the recipes are simple, because some are not, but they are all achievable—and they all have a very interesting twist. Just follow the methods carefully and enjoy both cooking and eating the food.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><a id="pageid_13"/><b>Beyond the barricades</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">Hopefully you will agree we have thrown open the door to a whole new range of interesting opportunities for home cooks to expand their repertoire and test their culinary skills.</p>
<p class="normal">I think you are going to really enjoy cooking the recipes in this book; they are different, entertaining and fun. I know every chef says the same, but I am confident I am right! And the fact my friend Heston Blumenthal has written the foreword for this book (as he did for my first book) is, for me, very flattering and humbling, and makes me think that he, too, likes the way I have presented these recipes for you. Because, trust me, Heston is no stranger to this type of cooking, as he has proved so many times.</p>
<p class="normal">Holding my French Brasserie Cookbook was a dream come true for me. Now another dream has come true, because, if you are reading this, you are holding my second book in your hands. Enjoy!</p>
