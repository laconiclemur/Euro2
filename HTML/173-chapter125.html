<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">I like this dish for the way the flavors accent each other. I like the way it smells when it’s cooking on the stove, once the tenderloin’s juices begin to run into the simmering orange juice. And I like how it looks on the plate, and for this reason always arrange the medallions on a white platter to show off the brilliant glistening deep-orange sauce that is ladled over the top. There are a number of ways to make this dish more complicated—adding some Cointreau to tighten the orange flavor, a piece of orange peel—but the simplicity here is another reason why I like it so much.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 TABLESPOON EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>2 PORK TENDERLOINS, 14 OUNCES TO 1 POUND/400 TO 455 G EACH</li>
<li>2 CUPS/480 ML FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE</li>
<li>1 CUP/200 G SUGAR</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/70 G PINE NUTS, DRY-TOASTED <a href="247-chapter183.html#page_340">(SEE PAGE 340)</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over high heat. Add the tenderloins and sear on each side, turning with tongs, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter and cover with aluminum foil tented in the middle to keep warm.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Add the orange juice to the skillet and bring to a boil. Stir in the sugar, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer into a loose, runny glaze that can coat the back of a spoon, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Return the tenderloins to the pan and cook, turning from time to time, until done but still rosy on the inside, 10 to 15 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the tenderloin. An instant-read thermometer poked into the center of the tenderloin should read at least 145°F/63°C.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Transfer the loins to a cutting board and let them rest for 3 minutes before slicing into finger-thick medallions at a slight diagonal angle. Arrange on a long serving platter, spoon the sauce over the top, sprinkle with the pine nuts, and serve.</p>
