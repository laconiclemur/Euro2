<h1 class="chapter_title" id="ch01"><span class="red"><span class="bold">SPRING</span></span></h1>
</div>
</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div4"><span class="dropcaps2line">M</span>y father is an impatient man. He loves eating out in fine French restaurants—it’s just the waiting part he can’t handle. I have memories of him excusing himself from the table, on one pretense or another, just after we had placed an elaborate order, one he knew would take the kitchen an eternity to cook. He would slip out for a quick bowl of noodles at a Chinese restaurant nearby, arriving back just in time for “dinner,” as if nothing had happened. This used to drive my mother crazy, especially because he never admitted where he’d been. I am his daughter and seem to have inherited this impatience; waiting is something I am very bad at, especially when it comes to … everything.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div5">I love summer, perhaps because I grew up in a tropical climate, and almost as soon as it has faded away, I can’t wait for it to come again. Autumn is exciting and beautiful; winter can be comforting and is, of course, crowned by the biggest feast of all, Christmas. But by spring, my patience is all but running out. I long for warmer days, light dresses, afternoon swims, and fresh fruits and vegetables. And I yearn for beautiful flowers. Adding to all this, my birthday is at the end of March, and I don’t think I need to tell you how bad I am at waiting for my party and presents. Nature must think this impatience is funny, because twice I have been due to give birth in spring and both of those babies made me wait longer than expected.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div6"><a id="page18"/>But waiting breeds anticipation and intense gratefulness. I greet every tulip and daffodil with a song in my heart. The season starts slowly, with a few buds, a handful of crocuses popping up from the soil, but it ends in a fullblown symphony of flowers, cherry blossoms, apple trees, and, the queen of them all, magnolias. In many ways, magnolias are spring to me. When I lived in Paris, I would go to the Palais Royal gardens almost every day in March to see if the magnolia trees had blossomed. If they had, it meant that summer was near; if not, my heart would sink a bit, but then I might cheer myself up by going to a nearby restaurant for lunch. In Paris, we were so spoiled with choices, seemingly endless options, each place better than the next.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div7">In Médoc, we have many magnolia trees but fewer restaurants, which is why we tend to have most meals at home. Seasonal cooking is one of life’s greatest joys; it may present a challenge, but the rewards are ample. Most of the year, nature fills my pantry with an abundance of ingredients, empowering me in the kitchen, making me feel invincible at the stove. But spring is a tricky period. From a culinary perspective, nature hasn’t started giving. Fruits are still little flowers and the strawberries of May seem an eternity away. The big hearty stews of winter that felt so comforting at Christmas are now clashing with my impatient heart, already fantasizing about swimsuits and parasols.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div8">So what is a cook to do? In early spring, I look to my old friends, the onions and the eggs, to carry me through until nature obliges. Confits and canelés tide me over. And finally, with a little bit of patience and luck, the glorious day arrives when someone has fresh asparagus at the market, a handful of fava beans. Then come the artichokes, and before I know it, I’m once more on that food carousel that will take me through summer and into the bounties of fall—until I find myself back in March, waiting for it all to begin again.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div37">My aunt is a wonderful cook and I spent a big part of my summers as a child watching her cook in her kitchen in the south of France. Like my grandmother, she’s always been a bit ahead of her time in terms of healthy eating, championing seasonal cooking long before it became fashionable. This soup is the recipe I most associate with her. It’s mainly made of vegetables, is delicious and healthy, and has a few little gourmet touches, including the unexpected garnishes hidden in the soup (bits of pancetta and croutons). I make this all the time in spring, and luckily for me I have an army of kids to shell the fava beans.</div>

<div class="note" id="div66"><span class="note_header">NOTE:</span> <span class="italic">In France, at the market you have a choice between regular fava beans and larger ones for soups</span> (fèves pour soupes). <span class="italic">They are extra-large and easy to peel without blanching.

<div class="headnote" id="div89">I am very fond of savory tarts and love to have them for little snacks or small meals (with a good glass of wine) or to serve them as starters ahead of meat or fish. I think my favorite such tart is this one, made with baby artichokes sautéed in butter with shallots. Baby artichokes are so lovely to cook with and arranging them in the tartlet shells feels like making beautiful edible bouquets.</div>
<div class="recipe_spacer" id="div90"><img alt="" src="images/Thor_9780804185608_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="yield" id="div91"><span class="purple">SERVES 6</span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div92">
<div class="IL_item" id="div93">8 ounces/230 g puff pastry, homemade (recipe follows) or store-bought</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div94">2 lemons, halved</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div95">12 baby artichokes</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div96">⅓ cup/80 ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div97">4 shallots, minced</div>
<div class="IL_item1" id="div98">A few sprigs of fresh thyme</div>
<div class="IL_item1" id="div99">Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div100">½ bunch fresh parsley, leaves removed and finely chopped</div>
</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div101"><span class="method_first_phrase"><span class="purple">ON A LIGHTLY FLOURED SURFACE,</span></span> roll out the dough ¼ inch/0.5 cm thick. Cut out 6 rounds large enough to line six tartlet molds, each about 3 inches/7.5 cm in diameter. (Alternatively, you can simply cut disks of the same size and skip the molds.) Put the rounds on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div102">Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div103">Fill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze the juice from the lemons into it. Rinse the artichokes. Working with one at a time and putting them in the lemon water as you go, trim the stems to ¼ inch/6 mm from the base. Peel back and remove the outer petals until the pale green leaves appear. Cut off the sharp tips. Trim off any remaining green from the base of the artichokes. Halve or quarter the artichokes, depending upon size, and return to the lemon water to prevent browning.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div104">Drain the artichokes and pat dry. In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the artichokes and shallots until slightly golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the sprigs of thyme and season with salt and pepper. Lower the heat, cover with a lid, and continue cooking until the artichokes are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes. Discard the thyme.</div>
<a id="page28"/>
<div class="method_step" id="div105">Meanwhile, line the molds with the pastry and prick the bases with a fork. Line with parchment paper and pie weights or dried beans and bake for 8 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and weights and bake until golden, another 5 minutes or so. (If you are not using molds, cover the disks with parchment paper and another baking sheet and bake for 8 minutes, then remove the baking sheet and bake for another 5 minutes.)</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div106">Scoop 1 tablespoon of shallots into each tartlet shell and arrange a few artichokes on top. Drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 5 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and crisp. Drizzle with a little bit more olive oil and sprinkle with the parsley before serving.</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div114">½ cup/120 ml room-temperature water</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div115">10 ounces/2½ sticks/300 g unsalted butter, at room temperature</div>
</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div116"><span class="method_first_phrase"><span class="purple">IN A LARGE BOWL,</span></span> mix the flour and salt. Cube 4 tablespoons/50 g of the butter and add to the bowl, along with the water. Mix gently with your fingertips until the dough comes together in a ball. Slice a cross in the top of the ball, about ½ inch/2 cm deep. (This will help when rolling the dough.) Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div117">Put the remaining 8 ounces/250 g butter on a piece of plastic wrap, cover with a second sheet, and use a rolling pin to flatten the butter into a 5- to 6-inch/14- to 15-cm square. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</div>
<a id="page29"/>
<div class="method_step" id="div118">On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough from the center out, following the lines of the cross, as if you were opening the ball like a flower, into a large square, 9 to 10 inches/25 to 30 cm on each side.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div119">Put the flattened butter in the center of the square of dough and bring the corners of the dough to the center to enclose the butter. Roll out, being careful not to squeeze out the butter, to an even rectangular shape about 8 by 12 inches/20 by 30 cm.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div120">With a short side facing you, fold the dough in thirds, as if you were folding a letter. Turn the folded dough so that the seam is to one side and a short side of the dough is once again facing you. Repeat the rolling and folding once. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div121">Repeat the rolling, folding, and chilling steps 4 more times. The idea is to fold and roll the dough six times (twice at the beginning and then once each subsequent time). When you are finished, your dough is ready! You can use it right away or wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month; defrost overnight in the refrigerator before rolling.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div146">I have a penchant for soufflés and while I usually prefer them sweet, for dessert, I sometimes make savory ones, often with cheese, for an elegant light lunch or a starter. While a nice quiche would serve a similar purpose, a soufflé is so much more fun. In spring, when artichokes start popping up at markets, I always start by having a few of them in the simplest manner, steamed, with vinaigrette. But then one day on a whim I had the idea to mix them into a soufflé, and it worked so well that it’s become a springtime favorite. Now we celebrate the arrival of artichokes, and the arrival of spring, with this soufflé.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div255">Roast chicken is very much a usual suspect at our dinner table. Throughout the years, my go-to version was somewhat Italian in style, perfumed with olive oil, lemon, and thyme. A few years ago, though, I started experimenting with more “French” ingredients, including crème fraîche and lots of garlic. The experiment has been nothing short of a success story and this recipe has dethroned the other version to become our most wanted chicken dish. In fact, it’s probably the recipe that dinner guests ask for most often. I once had a guest whose face lit up when he took his first bite and he said, “When I had the glass of Lillet I was pretty sure I was in France, but now that I’ve had this chicken, I know I couldn’t be anywhere else.” I guess that’s a compliment, right?</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div272">This is a simple and delicious dish I am in love with. But, as we all know, sometimes the simplest things are the hardest to master. The success of cooking this chicken to perfection rests on two things: the quality of the products and the alchemy of the Jura wine. It’s inspired by various chicken dishes that I’ve had, both in France and Hong Kong, where they like to cook chicken with fermented rice wine, which has a somewhat similar effect. The chicken breasts should have a thick layer of fatty skin and be seared so that the outside is crispy but the inside remains moist. Jura wine, which tastes like a mixture of sherry and white wine, adds a flavor unlike any other and is a real pleasure to cook with. (If you can’t find Jura wine, then dry sherry is a decent substitute.) Talking about divine pairings, when I cook with this golden wine, I always make sure to leave a bit for myself as a treat so I can enjoy it later with some walnuts and Comté cheese. I call it the chef’s privilege.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div293"><span class="italic">Confit de canard</span> has become something of a cliché: It’s standard on most bistro menus in France and in French restaurants around the world and you can even buy it canned in most supermarkets. But when it’s good, it exemplifies in one bite what French cooking is all about: beautiful ingredients cooked in a traditional, often simple way. I like to serve this national dish to guests in its purest form, accompanied by roast potatoes and mustard. It’s always a hit.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div294">As good as duck confit is, sometimes I like to take it one step further toward culinary nirvana and turn it into a Parmentier, or shepherd’s pie. That, of course, is another classic, but I find good versions of it hard to come by in restaurants. It’s usually decent enough but rarely breathtaking—and believe me, this dish can be breathtaking.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div295">This Parmentier is only as good as the <span class="italic">confit de canard</span> you start with (whether you make it yourself or not), and the most important thing is to keep it moist and use a decent wine for the cooking.

<div class="headnote" id="div337">Easter may be my favorite holiday. It’s all about enjoying good food, reflecting, and spending time with family, without any of the gift-giving stress of Christmas. Lamb for Easter is a must—along with chocolate and daffodils. While garlic goes well with almost any type of meat, I think it is never more at home than when married with lamb. I love simple pan-seared lamb chops with caramelized garlic and rosemary or a shoulder of lamb with bread crumbs and garlic.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div338">But for me the most French way of serving lamb is to accompany it with this creamy garlic-infused sauce. Just imagine the treat of scooping up the sauce and meat juices with a piece of good bread at the end of the meal. After this creamy sauce, I love to serve a rich chocolate cake and finish my glass of red wine with the first bites. Then I have coffee with my second serving of cake.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div360"><a id="page57"/>For a long time, sweetbreads were on the list of things that I simply didn’t like. I’d had them from time to time and mostly been unimpressed. But they are my husband’s favorite food, and when we lived in Paris, he always had them on his birthday. After we moved to Médoc, we found restaurants with sweetbreads harder to come by, so I started to make them at home as a once-a-year treat. Sweetbreads sound like such a complicated thing to make, but aside from the overnight soaking, they are actually quick and easy to cook. I like to sauté them with aniseed and serve them with a wine and shallot sauce. I don’t know if it’s the aniseed or just the fact that I’ve now cooked them many times, but I must say I have started to like sweetbreads a lot, especially served with a tasty celery root mash or, even better, glazed turnips, as here.</div>

<div class="headnote_indent" id="div407">This Basque cake is at once rustic and traditional but also light, silky, and wonderfully tasty.

Add the sugar and whisk for 30 seconds. Gradually add the flour, whisking away for 2 minutes to prevent any lumps. You can take the saucepan on and off the heat a few times if you are afraid of scorching the mixture. Reduce the heat to low and add the egg and egg yolks one at a time, still whisking away. Then whisk until the mixture has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the rum, and mix well.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div428">Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to prevent it from forming a skin and set aside to cool completely. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div429">Meanwhile, make the dough. In a large bowl, mix the sugar and butter with a wooden spoon until smooth. Gradually add the eggs and egg yolks, mixing until the dough is smooth. Add the flour, salt, and baking powder <a id="page64"/>and mix well; the dough will be soft. Divide the dough in half, shape into 2 balls, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div432">Line the cake pan with the larger round of dough, leaving a ¾-inch/2-cm overhang. Pour the cream filling into the pan and cover with the smaller round. Stir together the egg yolk and salt to make an egg wash, brush the overhang of the dough with the egg wash, and press the edges together to seal, folding the overhang up and over. Brush the top with egg wash and use a fork to score lines on the top of the cake (<a class="hlink" href="#sb3">see photo</a>). Make 3 to 4 tiny incisions in the top with the tip of a sharp knife to release steam.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div433">Bake until the cake is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 40 minutes before serving.</div>

<div class="textbox_nonindent" id="div436">I love eggs—so ordinary, yet so well crafted and special. If eggs were man-made, they’d win first prize in every design competition. They are versatile and always appropriate, ready to be cooked on their own in various ways or turned into something delicious, either sweet or savory. My kids love nothing better than <span class="italic">oeufs à la coque</span> (soft-boiled eggs), my husband goes mad for Béarnaise sauce, and I simply couldn’t live without meringues. There is a scene in <span class="italic">Forrest Gump</span> where his army buddy spends his time recounting all the possible ways of cooking shrimp. That’s how I feel about eggs; the possibilities are endless.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div440">What can I say … this is the cake that started it all. One early spring evening, inspired by all the new flowers in the garden, I decided to make a cake on a whim—a typical Icelandic creamy meringue cake, inspired by a recipe from my Icelandic mother-in-law. There was something in the air that night, something fresh and exciting. I wanted this cake to be a celebration of spring, of the garden, something out of a fairy tale. When my garden cake was ready, I posted a picture of it online. Little did I know it would be pinned, tumblrd, linked to on Facebook, and tweeted; it was all over the Internet—and so my blog, <span class="italic">Manger,</span> was born. It was a gift from spring, and I am forever grateful.</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div451">In a large very clean bowl (make sure that there are no traces of grease in it, or the whites will not whip to their fullest), beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until they form soft peaks. Still whipping, add the sugar little by little, so it is well dissolved, then whip until the meringue is stiff and glossy.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div452">Using a narrow spatula, form 2 meringues, each 8 inches/20 cm across and 2 inches/5 cm high, on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until the meringues are crisp on top, about 55 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues in the oven, with the door propped open, for 25 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div453">Whip the cream until it is light, fluffy, and holds soft peaks. Add the vanilla extract.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div454"><a id="page67"/>Spread half of the whipped cream over one of the meringues. Scatter as many berries as you like over the cream and sandwich the other meringue on top, flat side up. Spread the remaining whipped cream on top of the second meringue. Now you can enjoy decorating your cake with berries, leaves, and flowers—all things bright and beautiful. The cake is best eaten immediately.</div>
