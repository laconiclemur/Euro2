<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">When the Jews were banished from Spain in 1492, they were given</span> the possibility of converting to Christianity and remaining in the country as converts, or Conversos, as they and their descendants were called. Sitting on a bench in a little square lined with orange trees in the Barrio Santa Cruz, the old Jewish quarter of Seville, I imagined my ancestors going about their lives in the labyrinth of narrow streets that wind their way around whitewashed houses with wrought-iron balconies. I had just bought pastries at the Convento de Santa Inés on Calle Doña María Coronel. The nun who sold them to me said that the convent had been founded by Doña María Coronel, a Sevillian noblewoman who poured boiling oil over her face to disfigure it, to avoid the persistent amorous advances of Pedro I the Cruel, who had had her husband executed. Her remains lie in a sepulchre in the convent. I was intrigued, because I knew a Jewish family called Coronel in Egypt, so I looked up Doña María and, yes, she was from a well-known Converso family. My friend Cuqui Gonzales de Caldas, who lives in Seville, says that the city has more churches and monasteries than any other in Spain because it had a large number of wealthy Jewish converts, and they and their descendants funded many of them to win acceptance and prestige.</p>
<p class="para">There was a Jewish presence on the peninsula even before the Roman emperor Titus brought thousands of Jews back as slaves when he destroyed Jerusalem. After the Muslim occupation, large numbers of Jews migrated to Al-Andalus from different parts of the Islamic Empire. They spoke Arabic, dressed like Arabs, and cooked Arab foods, with a special Jewish touch. They prospered economically and culturally. It was here that they rediscovered and reinvented Hebrew as a literary language and here that the most beautiful Hebrew poetry was written. When the fanatic Almohads tried to convert them to Islam in the twelfth century, the Jews fled north to the Christian kingdoms, which is how some of the Moorish dishes spread to all parts of the peninsula.</p>
<p class="para">The Jews settled in many cities, where they lived in quarters known as <span class="italic">aljamas</span> or <span class="italic">juderías</span>. There were artisans and physicians, scientists and scholars, merchants, moneylenders, and royal tax collectors. A few were bankers and courtiers who financed the wars against the Moors. (Conversos were later to finance Columbus’s voyage.) Many rose to high ranks. But hostility against their perceived privileged status and relationship with the king resulted in riots and massacres and the forcible baptism of thousands of Jews in 1391.</p>

<p class="para">The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, established in 1478 to ensure that Christians remained true to orthodox beliefs and practices, was used to pursue Conversos who kept up their Jewish faith in secret (it was abolished officially in 1834). In 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella gave those who had not converted the choice to convert or to leave, in some towns, the entire Jewish community left; in others, the entire community converted. There were large numbers of Conversos in Castile, Aragon, Andalusia, and Valencia. Within a century, the majority had melted into the Christian population, but until the early nineteenth century, they continued to be suspected of being secret Jews, or Marranos. If denounced, they were interrogated and then could be burned at the stake in an auto-da-fé (a ritual ceremony in a public square, of public penance of heretics and apostates), or they could be imprisoned and their property confiscated, and their families would be stigmatized for generations. Inquisitors came on Fridays to see if Conversos had put white tablecloths and candles on their tables to celebrate the Jewish Sabbath. The dreaded Torquemada, the notorious Grand Inquisitor, himself a Converso, would stand on a hill above a city on Saturdays to identify the houses where there was no smoke coming out of the chimneys (Jewish laws prohibit any work, including cooking and lighting a fire, on the Sabbath). Records of the Inquisition show that certain foods were used as evidence of practicing Judaism in secret when women were brought to trial. Because of the dietary laws, cooking was central to the Jewish identity. So as not to use pork fat, as Christians did for cooking, or clarified butter, which the Muslims used (the dietary laws forbid mixing meat with dairy products), Jews used olive oil exclusively for cooking. The smell of frying with olive oil became so strongly associated with them that even old Christians of non-Jewish descent avoided it for fear of being mistaken for secret Jews.</p>
<p class="para">The traditional Sabbath dish <span class="italic">adafina,</span> a stew that was left to cook in a pot overnight in the ashes of a fire from Friday to Saturday (so that there was no need to light a fire on Saturday), was regularly cited as a sign of Judaizing. In it, meat, usually lamb and chicken, cut into large pieces, as well as ground meat rolled into large oval balls, was cooked with chickpeas, onions, and vegetables such as cabbage, spinach or chard, or eggplants. Sausages made of sheep’s intestines stuffed with ground meat were also added to the pot, as were hard-boiled eggs in their shells, which were called <span class="italic">huevos haminados</span>. To prove their true conversion to the Catholic faith, Conversos added ham, pork sausages, and <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (blood sausage) to their stews. But the memory of <span class="italic">adafina</span> lives on in Spain’s <span class="italic">cocidos</span> (see page 498), especially those of Madrid, Asturias, and Valencia, which contain chickpeas. In Asturias, there is a saying, <span class="italic">“Cocido de garbanzos guiso de Marranos”</span> (“Cocido with chickpeas is a stew of Marranos”; Marrano, meaning “pig,” was used as a disparaging term for Conversos as well as for secret Jews). The <span class="italic">pelotas,</span> big balls of ground meat or chicken with bread, almonds, and pine nuts, sometimes wrapped in cabbage leaves, that go into the <span class="italic">cocidos</span> of Valencia, Murcia, and Catalonia today are similar to those in the Sabbath pots of North African Jews.</p>
<p class="para">Conversos ate pork ostentatiously. In Majorca today, families of Converso origin are known as Xuetes (<span class="italic">xua</span> means “bacon”) because in the past, they cooked and ate large quantities of bacon out of doors for everyone to see. Antonio Campins, author of <span class="italic">En un Fogón de La Mancha: La Ingeniosa Cocina de Don Quijote y Sancho</span> (In a Fireside Kitchen in La Mancha: The Ingenious Cooking of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza), sent me a story and a poem written in the fifteenth century by the Converso troubadour Antón de Montoro, known as El Ropero. One day when the troubadour went to the butcher, he found only pork, and that inspired him to write the following verses addressed to Córdoba’s <span class="italic">corregidor</span> (mayor):</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="paracenter">One of the stalwarts of My Lord</p>
<p class="paracenter">the King, a mighty bulwark, gave</p>
<p class="paracenter">to the butchers reason and cause</p>
<p class="paracenter">for my false oaths and perjury.</p>
<p class="paracenter"> </p>
<p class="paracenter">To my sorrow I did not find</p>
<p class="paracenter">one thing to kill my hunger, and</p>
<p class="paracenter">they forced me to break holy vows</p>
<p class="paracenter">made by my sainted ancestors.</p>

<p class="para"><span class="italic">Almodrote de berenjena,</span> mashed eggplant baked with cheese and eggs, traditionally made on Friday to be eaten cold on Saturday, was a dish that, like <span class="italic">adafina,</span> compromised Jews and is mentioned in the papers of the Court of the Inquisition. Other Sabbath dishes were eggplant fritters; <span class="italic">fritadas,</span> baked omelets with vegetables; and <span class="italic">empanadas</span> and <span class="italic">empanadillas,</span> savory pies filled with ground meat. <span class="italic">Boronía</span> was a dish of fried eggplant, zucchini, and other vegetables. Sponge cake, almond pastries, marzipan, and <span class="italic">membrillo</span> (quince paste) were Sabbath sweets. Flourless cakes with almonds, eggs, and sugar, flavored with orange, were made for Passover, when Jews could not use flour. All these foods are still made in Spain and by Sephardi Jews all over the world.</p>
<p class="para">Jews and Conversos were known for their overuse of ground meat to make <span class="italic">albóndigas</span> (meatballs) and stuffings for vegetables and pies. Eggplants, quinces, fennel, onions, and garlic were strongly associated with Jews and mentioned in plays and poems, usually by Conversos themselves, that secretly satirized and outed Conversos. Spices such as cinnamon, saffron, cumin, caraway, and coriander were also associated with their cooking. Jews were said to smell of onion and garlic and their homes to smell of frying onion and garlic. This duo became the basis of the ubiquitous Spanish <span class="italic">sofrito,</span> to which tomatoes from the New World were later added.</p>
<p class="para">Laws of <span class="italic">limpieza de sangre</span> (blood purity) instituted under the Inquisition, which were in existence as late as 1865, excluded people with Jewish or Muslim ancestry from ennoblement, from certain professions, and from high office in institutions such as the Church and state or military orders. But some wealthy and influential Converso families (many of the Jews who decided to convert and stay were the wealthy ones who had a lot to lose) were able to hide their ancestry by using forged papers and paying witnesses. Some, fluent in many languages, became diplomats and ambassadors. Their international connections with relatives and other Jews of Spanish origin enabled them to make easy transfers of money and to trade around the Mediterranean and across the Atlantic. Some amassed immense fortunes and managed to buy land and titles, to enter into the Church and state hierarchies, and to marry into the impoverished aristocracy. The nobility, the clergy, and the kings came to depend on these Conversos for finance. They paid for the voyages of discovery and the military requirements of the empire. In the sixteenth century, two books appeared that provided evidence that a good part of the Spanish nobility, especially in Castile, had Jewish ancestry. This explains why Cervantes could have Sancho Panza argue that since he was a peasant who could brandish his “purity of blood,” unlike the wealthy merchants, intellectuals, and nobles who had Converso blood ties, he had the right to be made a duke.</p>
<p class="para">Foods that were once associated only with Jews are common today in many parts of Spain. Some of the pastries that nuns make in convents, such as the almond cakes of Santiago de Compostela, are of Jewish origin. In the early days of the Inquisition, having priests and nuns in the family was a way that Converso families protected themselves from persecution, and many nuns were of Jewish descent (Saint Teresa of Ávila was one). That may be how Jewish pastries were taken up by the convents. Another pastry of Jewish origin is the famous coiled-snake-shaped <span class="italic">ensaimada</span> of Majorca made with lard (<span class="italic">saim</span>). A Jewish equivalent is made with butter or butter substitute. The roast baby lamb eaten in Castile and León with only a simple green salad was originally the ritual Passover lamb eaten with bitter herbs and lettuce dipped in salted water, representing the bitter tears of the Jews who were slaves in Egypt.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p045.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">Spain’s Jewish legacies are now celebrated after centuries of silence and denial. Something of a recovery of a collective historic memory is going on through conferences and music festivals. “Sephardi” dishes appear on restaurant menus. The government-sponsored Caminos de Sefarad (Sephardi Routes) link fifteen medieval cities with Jewish quarters and sites on a tourist itinerary. In Ribadavia, in Galicia, where the old Jewish community owned vineyards and produced wine and where today’s Ribeiro wine is produced, they reenact a medieval Jewish wedding during the Fiesta de la Historía. It often happens that people I meet confide that they believe they are of Converso origin because of their names or family history, because their families lit candles in a secret room on Friday nights, or they hung their <span class="italic">jamón</span> outside (as once their ancestors would have done to prove that they had abandoned the Jewish faith), or cleaned the house on Saturday (showing ostentatiously that they were contravening Jewish laws). And they are probably right, as widely publicized recent studies on the DNA of the Spanish population have established that at least twenty percent has Jewish ancestry.</p>
