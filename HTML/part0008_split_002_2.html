  <p class="chap-para">Although the title suggests otherwise, this is a Neapolitan classic and, like ragù, is a Sunday lunch favourite in the Campania region. The recipe has age-old roots and there are various stories about its origins. One says it was prepared in <em class="calibre4">osterie</em> (inns) at the port of Naples by cooks from Genova for Genovese sailors. Large pieces of meat were slow-cooked with onions in order to create a flavoursome pasta sauce and a main course to feed the hungry sailors. Nowadays everyone has their own version. Beef is commonly used, but I prefer the milder taste of veal, which marries well with the onions; after long, gentle cooking these become sweet, with a meltingly soft texture that is perfect for a pasta sauce.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">800g/1lb 12oz veal joint</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">2.5kg/5lb 8oz large onions, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large carrot, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz salami, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 sprig of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">350g/12oz pennette pasta</p>

  <p class="ing2">30g/1oz pecorino (romano) cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="para">Rub the veal all over with salt and pepper, make some incisions in the meat and poke in the garlic slices.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Add the veal and brown well all over. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the onions, celery, carrot, salami and herbs, season with salt and pepper and sweat for about 30 minutes on a low heat.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the meat back in the pan, add the wine and allow to evaporate. Reduce the heat to very low, cover with a lid and cook for 3 hours, until the meat is very tender. Check from time to time to make sure it isn’t sticking to the pan, turning the meat and stirring the onions.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. Using a potato masher, mash the onions slightly and taste for seasoning.</p>

  <p class="para1">Cook the pennette in lightly salted boiling water until al dente, drain and toss with the onions. Serve with grated pecorino cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Slice the veal and serve as a main course with a green salad.</p>
