  <p class="chap-para">This typical peasant dish from Puglia, the heel of Italy, is said to have Spanish influences. It was often made with ‘poor’, but nourishing, local ingredients, to easily and cheaply feed a large family at the end of a long working day in the fields. It is unclear whether the word <em class="calibre4">tiella</em> derives from the dish it was cooked in or the cooking method. No matter; it has over time become the name of this dish, of which there are many variations, made with vegetables, meat or fish, depending on availability. However, the two main ingredients, rice and potatoes, are always present. This version using mussels comes from Bari, the capital city of the Puglia region. The uncooked rice is scattered over the layers of ingredients and the end result is an interesting type of baked risotto with a lovely subtle seafood flavour.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz fresh mussels, scrubbed, any open or broken shells discarded</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 handfuls of parsley, finely chopped, plus extra to serve</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz cherry tomatoes, halved</p>

  <p class="ing1">10g/¼oz pecorino (romano) cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="ing2">150g/5½oz/¾ cup arborio rice</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas mark 3.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the mussels in a pan, cover with a lid and cook on a high heat for a couple of minutes until the shells open. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly, discarding any mussels whose shells remain closed. Combine the parsley and garlic and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Line an ovenproof dish with the sliced onion, followed by half of the parsley mixture, sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cover with half of the potatoes, the mussels, tomatoes, 2 tablespoons olive oil and the remaining parsley mixture. Sprinkle with the pecorino, then scatter in the raw rice, the remaining potatoes and the remaining olive oil. Pour in 400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups water, ensuring you cover all the ingredients – you may need less or more water.</p>

  <p class="para1">Cover with foil and bake for 1¼ hours, until the potatoes are very tender when pierced with a skewer. Serve hot, sprinkled with parsley.</p>
