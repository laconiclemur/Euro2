				<p class="recipe-ing-head"><span>Ingredients</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>1 pound russet potatoes</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>2 cups extra-virgin olive oil</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>Salt to taste</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>Dipping sauce of your choice</span></p>
				<ol class="recipe">
					<li><p class="recipestep">Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch chunks. If you won’t be frying them right away, save them in water so they don’t turn brown. Be sure to drain and blot them dry before frying so they won’t splatter.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Heat the olive oil in a deep, heavy-bottom pot or a deep fryer to 275°F. Check with a candy thermometer for correct temperature.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Carefully lower the potato chunks (blotted dry) into the olive oil with a slotted spoon and poach them for about 10 minutes. This is to precook them, so they shouldn’t turn golden in color yet. Drain the poached potatoes on paper towels and set aside.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Raise the temperature of the olive oil to 350°F. Carefully lower the poached potatoes into the olive oil again and fry them until they are crisp and golden brown. Drain the potatoes and sprinkle them with salt.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Serve hot with your chosen sauce drizzled over the top and more on the side for dipping.</p></li>

				<p class="recipesidebarhead">Alternate Potato Prep</p>
				<p class="recipesidebar">Poaching the potatoes ahead of time in water and then frying them to a crisp when it is serving time is a good way to plan ahead. Simply cook the potato chunks in boiling water until tender, but not falling apart, about 8 minutes. Drain them and reserve them until ready to serve. At service time heat 2 cups of olive oil to 350°F and then crisp the potatoes in the oil for about 6 minutes. Drain, salt, and serve.</p></div>
