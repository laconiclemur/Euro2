<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0001947">The puddings in the previous chapter are for everyday eating, to end any meal. But when it comes to special occasions, there’s something wonderful about giving up your time to create a showstopping dessert or cake that is that both beautiful and delicious. No present can really compare to that moment when you walk into the room with something a little bit special, be it frosted, coated, towering, piled with decorations or sparkling with glitter. It’s the kind of gift that instantly says, ‘I love you.’ So this is a collection of some of my favourite sweet bakes, desserts and treats that will instantly show your guests and loved ones that you went out of your way to make an effort.</p>
