</h1>
<p class="pf">The fat and happy deer grazed on oats in the forty-acre field planted to the west of our farmhouse. When Mummy would discreetly tell Isä that we were out of meat, his response was that he would “tend to that tonight.”</p>
<p>Isä would strap on his headlight that night and go out on our acreage and shoot a deer. We preferred the young deer instead of the old bucks, which were tough and had a strong wild flavor.</p>
<p>With one crack of the gun the deer was felled, dragged to the shed, hung, and stripped of its innards. The liver was a huge treat. We sliced it thin, fried it in butter, and enjoyed it for breakfast the next day.</p>
<p>Isä’s take on this? “I feed ’em, I eat ’em.” In fact, we wasted nothing. Even the hide was taken to a place where it was tanned and usually made into the buckskin mitts we wore in the winter.</p>
<p>We had a heavy butcher knife with a rounded blade in the kitchen when I was growing up. Isä kept it sharp on his sharpening stone, which consisted of a circular whetstone about the size of a bicycle wheel, on an axle-like frame. He would sit on a wooden plank and turn the stone, which would go through water that was held in half of a rubber tire and was mounted beneath the wheel. He made the wheel turn by pedaling, and water would splash to the sides as the knife gained its razor-sharp edge. He sharpened not just the butcher knives that way but also the triangular cutting blades of the hay mower and anything else that required a sharp edge.</p>
<p>With that sharpened knife, he cut the raw venison into roasts or chunks. The roasts were wrapped and brined or canned. Before we had electricity and a deep-freezer, we brined the larger pieces of meat. Mummy also packed smaller chunks of meat into wide-mouth quart-sized canning jars and added a teaspoon or so of salt. Because they had not yet purchased a big pressure cooker for canning, she put the jars in the oven of the woodstove and then fired it up until the oven was hot enough to cook and can the meat. The canned venison was deliciously soft and tender and became the basis for all kinds of our favorite dishes, from soups to sandwiches to casseroles. Sometimes we just ate it right out of the jar.</p>
<p>One time, after one of the butcherings and when we were all out doing barn chores, we heard a huge explosion in the house. The venison-filled jars in the wood-fired oven had exploded and there was meat hanging everywhere in the kitchen along with glass shards. When one jar had exploded, so did the rest of them, causing a chain reaction. Laughing and crying at once, Mummy cleaned up the mess. Shortly after that they bought a big pressure cooker.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">The Best Venison Liver and Onions</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This was a delicacy we had the morning after a young deer was butchered. The liver was cut into very thin slices and we enjoyed it for breakfast.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">About 2 pounds sliced young venison liver</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup butter, divided</p>
<p class="rpil">2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into rings</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</p>
<p class="rpill">Salt and pepper to taste</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Gently rinse liver slices under cold water, and place in a medium bowl. Pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions. (If the venison is from an older animal, you’ll need to soak it in milk for a couple of hours to reduce the bitter taste.)</p>
<p class="rp">Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Separate onion rings, and sauté them in butter until soft. Remove onions and melt remaining butter in the skillet. Season the flour with salt and pepper, and put it in a shallow dish or on a plate. Drain milk from liver, and coat slices in the flour mixture.</p>
<p class="rpl">When the butter has melted, turn the heat up to medium-high, and place the coated liver slices in the pan. Cook until nice and brown on the bottom. Turn, and cook on the other side until browned. Add onions, and reduce heat to medium. Cook a bit longer to taste. Our family prefers the liver to just barely retain a pinkness on the inside when you cut to check. Enjoy!</p>
