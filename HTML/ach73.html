<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ditale con fagioli</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My father recalls that this is one of the first dinners he had with my mother at her parents’ house. “When I got home I told my parents that the Tropianos made this dish quite differently than we did, but that it was very tasty,” says Stan. “My father asked how it was prepared. When I told him it was served in a light tomato liquid, he responded immediately, ‘That’s just how my mother prepared it in Italy.’ ”</p>
<p class="indentb">This is a quick pasta-with-beans recipe, especially since the sauce may be prepared up to one day in advance. Add the beans and celery and warm the sauce while the pasta is cooking. I like to use ditale, but any tubular pasta may be substituted. This dish has a souplike consistency and should be served immediately so the pasta doesn’t soak up all the sauce.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 fresh basil leaf</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tender 5-inch-long celery stalk with leaves, cut into 1-inch pieces (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 19-ounce can cannelloni beans, drained and rinsed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound ditale</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnish (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Season with salt, stir in the basil, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the tomatoes sweeten, about 20 minutes. Stir the celery (if using) and beans into <a id="page_141"/>the sauce. Return to a simmer, cover, and cook until the beans are heated through and have blended with the tomato sauce, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, following the package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water before draining the cooked pasta.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Add the drained pasta to the bean sauce, and stir in enough of the reserved cooking water as necessary to make a soupy consistency. Simmer until the ingredients are combined, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately, garnishing with pepper and, if you like, Parmesan cheese.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Light white or light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> I often use dried beans to make this dish and I like to prepare the beans using the following quick-soak method. Place the dried beans in a saucepan and fill the pan with cold water to a level 2 inches above the beans. (If you like, a few tender celery leaves may be added to the beans.) Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Allow the beans to boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the beans stand, covered, for 1 hour. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid before draining the beans and proceeding with step 3 of the recipe.</p>
