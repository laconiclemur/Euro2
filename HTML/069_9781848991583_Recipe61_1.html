<p class="normal"><b>Jerusalem artichokes are an indulgent root vegetable that can be roasted, pureed or served, as here, in a velouté. When cooked this way, with a delicious chive cream, they become beautifully velvety and nutty and make a memorable cream soup for a special occasion.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot, finely diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 pound 5 ounces Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">4½ to 5 cups Chicken or Vegetable Stock (see pages <a href="010_9781848991583_Recipe4.html">16–17</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">14 ounces white asparagus, peeled and woody ends discarded</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon finely snipped chives</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 drops truffle oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 baguette, sliced, to serve</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the shallot and artichokes and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to high, add 4½ cups of stock and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and simmer 10 to 12 minutes until the artichokes are just soft.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, cut off the asparagus tips and leave to one side. Roughly chop the stalks, add to the soup and cook 4 minutes, or until they are just tender. Whip half the cream, using an electric mixer, until soft peaks form.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Transfer the soup to a blender, season with salt and pepper and blend until smooth. You might have to do this in batches, depending on the size of your blender. Add the whipped cream and blend once more, then pass the soup through a fine strainer, using a ladle to help you, into the cleaned pan. Leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Whip the remaining cream until soft peaks form, then fold in the chives and half the truffle oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. (You can use a hand-held blender to add the chive cream to the soup at this stage, or keep it separate and serve on top of the soup as below.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the reserved asparagus tips and cook 2 to 3 minutes until they are just tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Drain and season with the remaining truffle oil and with salt and pepper to taste. Put into four soup bowls.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Gently reheat the soup, adding the remaining stock if it is too thick, until bubbles just start to form on the top. Do not let it boil. Ladle the soup over the asparagus and top with a spoonful of the truffle oil and chive cream. Serve with slices of baguette.</p>
