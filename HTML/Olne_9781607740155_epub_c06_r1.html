  <h3 class="section1" id="c06-s24"><em><a id="page160"></a><span class="color">Grilled Pepper Salad</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Poivrons Doux Grillés en Salade</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The pleasant, clean taste of raw peppers contains no hint of the subtle flavor brought out through grilling. Prepared in a vinaigrette, they not only keep, but improve. Red, yellow and green have distinctly different flavors and a mixture of the three is attractive. Choose them large, firm, smooth, heavy and of regular shape (those tortuously formed cannot be evenly grilled). They are best grilled over hot coals, but may perfectly well be prepared beneath a broiler. If a bed of coals has been prepared for another purpose, one may profitably put peppers to grill afterward and leave them on a plate overnight before preparing them.</p>

  <p class="indent">The flesh should be semi-cooked. A heat that is too intense will char the skins before the flesh becomes soft; one that is too gentle will dehydrate the flesh before the skins are loosened. Turn them regularly so that all surfaces, including the stem end, are equally grilled. Some surfaces will be charred, others not. Once grilled, they should be transferred immediately to a plate to avoid any loss of liquid.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove them, one at a time, to another plate, pull out the stem end and the interior seed cluster to which it is attached, cut the pepper in two lengthwise, carefully remove any remaining seeds, and slip off the skins—peeling is no problem unless they are irregularly shaped or improperly grilled. The light, syrupy natural juice is a precious addition to the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare a vinaigrette in a garlic-rubbed bowl; for those who prefer a more “aggressive” presence, a clove of garlic may be reduced to purée with the dry ingredients of the vinaigrette before adding the vinegar and the natural juices. Count about 1 part of concentrated <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh12">Aromatic Vinegar</a> to 5 of olive oil. The sauce should be somewhat more salted than for most salads. Add the pepper halves, sliced lengthwise into wide strips. If they are stirred vigorously into the sauce, a semi-emulsion is produced which is, no doubt, less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page161"></a>An alternate method is to keep the peppers whole, merely slit down one side, sprinkled with vinaigrette, and folded over fresh branches of thyme and savory. These are often garnished with finely sliced scallions or anchovy fillets. Whole anchovies preserved in salt are best—they must be soaked in cold water to desalt them, the fillets lifted from the bones, soaked again and sponged dry in paper towels. If only canned anchovies are available, they, too, should be soaked first.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE LAMB STEW WITH ARTICHOKE HEARTS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The shoulder and the lower tip of the leg are the two best braising or stewing sections of the lamb. Both are rich in flavor, lean and gelatinous. Lamb and mutton fats are not only indigestible but strong in flavor. It is their taste which, during the cooking process, penetrates the otherwise delicately flavored flesh and renders these meats repellent to many palates. Although the fat should be removed before cooking, lamb of good quality is naturally covered with a healthy layer of white fat, and the flesh should be a clear, rose-tan color.</p>

  <p class="indent">The kind of oil used for browning in a preparation of this sort is not terribly important, for although without it onions, meat, sugar and flour could not be properly colored (all essential to the deep color and rich flavor of the sauce), it will ultimately be skimmed and discarded.</p>

  <p class="indent">Only a heavy copper <em>sauteuse</em> is perfect; the next-best method is to execute the first steps in a heavy iron skillet and transfer everything to an earthenware or enameled ironware casserole for the longer braising process. The pot should be precisely the right size to hold the pieces of meat placed side by side, but barely touching; if the pan is too large, its surfaces not contacted by the meat will burn while the meat browns (the flame being necessarily quite high for the meat to brown properly); if it is so small that the pieces of meat have to be packed in, they will boil in their juices rather than brown. Moreover, the eventual quality of the sauce depends on the solid elements’ being closely arranged in a pan of the right size so that they may be completely submerged in a minimum of liquid.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c06-s25"><em><a id="page162"></a><span class="color">Lamb Stew with Artichoke Hearts</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Ragoût d’Epaule d’Agneau aux Coeurs d’Artichauts</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a shoulder of yearling lamb</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4–12 artichokes, depending on size (plus lemon, salt, thyme, butter for their preparation)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium-size mild onions (12–14 ounces), coarsely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons olive or other vegetable oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 scant teaspoon <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 large, firm, well-ripened tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped (or a 1-pound can)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Ask your butcher to bone the shoulder. Cut it into 8 pieces of approximately equal size, respecting as nearly as possible the natural muscular structure, and remove all surface fat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare the Artichokes as described on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>, keeping them quite firm. After having removed the chokes, sponge them dry and leave them whole, or cut them into halves or quarters, depending on their size. Stew them gently in butter for from 20 minutes to ½ hour, tossing from time to time or delicately turning them. They should still remain slightly firm. Put them aside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the onions in the oil over a low to medium flame, stirring them regularly, until lightly browned. Watch them closely, for they burn easily. Remove them, leaving as much oil as possible in the pan. The slightest fragment of onion that remains in the pan at this point will <a id="page163"></a>inevitably burn while the meat is coloring and leave a bitter taste in the sauce. Salt the pieces of meat on all sides and put them to cook in the same fat, turning the flame up somewhat. When they are browned on all sides, lower the flame again, sprinkle with the sugar and turn the pieces around in the pan from time to time over a period of a couple of minutes until the sugar has had time to caramelize. Hold a lid over the pan, pour off the excess fat, return to the heat, and sprinkle with the flour. Turn the pieces over again and, when the flour has lightly browned, return the onions to the pan, sprinkle with the mixed herbs and add the garlic and the bay leaf. Lift all the elements and turn them around with a wooden spoon until well mixed together, and pour in the white wine. Turn the flame up, stir and scrape the bottom and sides of the <em>sauteuse</em> well to be certain that all adherent frying matter is loosened and dissolved, reduce somewhat, and add the tomatoes plus just enough boiling water to barely submerge the meat. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, at a bare simmer, either over a tiny flame or in a slow oven, for 1½ hours. Skim off the surface fat 2 or 3 times during this period.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lift out the pieces of meat, discard the bay leaf, and leave the sauce to rest for a few minutes. Skim off all traces of fat that rise to the surface and pass the sauce and onions through a fine sieve into another saucepan. Return the meat to the <em>sauteuse</em>, add the artichoke hearts, sprinkle with freshly ground pepper, and leave, covered, in a warm place.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring the sauce to a boil and leave it on the side of a small flame, skinning it regularly (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page90">this page</a>) for about ½ hour. It should, at this point, be of a perfect consistency. If it seems a bit liquid, turn the flame up and reduce rapidly, stirring all the while. Taste for salt, pour it over the meat and its garnish, and leave to simmer, ever so gently, covered, for another ½ hour. Serve directly from the cooking pot, accompanied by a <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh3">pilaf</a>. For a less “homey” presentation, the rice may be packed into a ring mold, unmolded onto a large, round, heated serving platter, the center filled with stew and sprinkled with chopped parsley. Second helpings, however, with this pretty presentation, are inevitably cold.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c06-s26"><em><a id="page164"></a><span class="color">Pears in Red Wine</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Poires au Vin Rouge</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 or 5 slightly underripe eating pears</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 orange</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>cinnamon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bottle good red wine</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut the pears in two lengthwise, core and peel them and arrange the halves in the bottom of an earthenware or enameled ironware terrine—if they are to be cooked in the oven, Pyrex or porcelain will do as well. Wash the orange to remove any hint of insecticide or preservative, and shave a long spiral from the peel, keeping clear of the white, pithy material. Add it to the pears, sprinkle very lightly with cinnamon, add the sugar and the wine, bring to a boil, and leave, covered, to simmer for about 2 hours (with certain hard varieties of cooking pears, one may allow as much as 6 to 8 hours’ cooking time), or until they are coated in a thin syrup. Serve them chilled, accompanied by <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh7"><em>Tuiles</em></a> or other simple cookies.</p>
