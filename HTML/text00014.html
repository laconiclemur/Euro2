 Glossary of Ingredients</h2>
<p class="para">
<strong>Ajika</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">A spicy paste made of chillies, garlic, herbs and spices that is used to flavour food. <em>Ajika</em>
 can vary in colour between red and green, depending on what type of chilli is used as its base. <em>Ajika</em>

<p class="para">
<strong>Bazha</strong>

<p class="para1">A spiced walnut paste that forms the basis of many Georgian dishes.

<p class="para">
<strong>Blue Fenugreek</strong>
