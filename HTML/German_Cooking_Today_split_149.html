Put the potato sticks in the hot oil in small amounts, using a skimming ladle and fry for about 2 minutes until half-cooked. Important: do not put too many potato sticks in the oil at once because they should not touch each other in the hot oil and in addition the oil would cool down too quickly.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre21">3.</span><span class="calibre6"> As soon as the potato sticks turn yellow at the ends, remove them from the oil with the skimming ladle.

If small bubbles rise up along the handle the oil is hot enough. Lower the heat to a medium setting while frying the chips. If the oil is not hot enough the potato chips will become saturated with oil, but if the oil is too hot, the potatoes will burn without being cooked through.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> If chips are made in a deep-fat fryer, a larger amount of oil will be needed (follow the manufacturer’s instructions).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre21">Variation:</span><span class="calibre6"> Potato crisps. Choose 500 g/18 oz potatoes with firm flesh, wash, peel, rinse and cut into thin slices with a sharp knife or vegetable slicer and pat dry. Pre-cook the potato slices in small quantities in the hot oil, remove them from the oil, spread them on a wire tray and leave to drain. Return the crisps to the hot oil and fry again until pale brown. Sprinkle with salt and paprika and serve as a snack.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_149"></div>
