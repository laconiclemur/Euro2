<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The tradition in Spain for salmon comes from the northwest, in Galicia, Cantabria, and, principally, Asturias, where they migrate from the sea up rivers like the Sella and Narcea. The first fish caught each season is called <em>el campanu</em>, as the church bell (<em>campana</em>) is rung to announce the news. The fish is sold by auction in the village square, usually to a restaurant for a newsworthy sum of money. A recent campanu, weighing 13½&gt; pounds/6.2 kg, sold to an Asturian cider house in Madrid for an even €10,000 ($13,000). In the flush days of 2007, the campanu went to a restaurant in the Asturian port city of Gijón for €18,000.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a wide, shallow bowl, blend the onion, olive oil, and parsley. Season the salmon with salt and pepper and lay them in the onion mixture, turning over to coat. Cover, refrigerate, and marinate for about 1 hour, turning from time to time.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Preheat a grill pan, griddle pan, or large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Remove the salmon from the marinade and place on the grill pan. Grill, about 5 minutes on each side, turning carefully with a wide spatula just once. Test for doneness near the bone with the tip of a knife; the meat should be just opaque and still very moist. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes more if necessary.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Serve with Galician potatoes on the side along with a bowl of mayonnaise to dollop as desired.</p>
