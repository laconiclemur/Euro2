</h1>
<p class="pf">There was a time in the 1940s when we were able to get free fabric by using colorfully printed feed sacks, which we would purchase at the Co-op in Floodwood. Isä had a good eye for selecting the nicest prints and was wise enough to buy more than one sack in the same print. It usually took two to three sacks to sew a simple dress. The feed sacks were used instead of many barrels for the storage and transport of flour and animal feed, which we purchased regularly for the cows. Animal feed sacks were larger than the hundred-pound flour sacks, so they were much easier to work with.</p>
<p>When I was in 4-H, I had to keep a record of everything I did for the projects I had signed up for. In my 4-H clothing record I described the dresses, blouses, and shirts that I sewed for myself and for my brothers and sisters out of feed sacks. Also, I enjoyed making Christmas gifts of clothing for the family. In my record I describe a baby dress I made for a shower out of a printed feed sack.</p>
<p>My report as I wrote it: “I like my clothing project because I just love to sew. My ambition to sew has really been valuable to the whole family. Whenever anyone needs a blouse, shirt, skirt or dress, I just sew it. Since there are so many in the family there is always sewing to do.</p>
<p>“Every time I finish a garment I make a report on it on a sheet of paper. By the end of the year I was really surprised to find how they had added up and how much I saved by sewing.</p>
<p>“This past year I have learned a lot about working with corduroy and this year the sister dresses are made from it.”</p>
<p>Up until this point I had been sewing on a treadle sewing machine and each year made identical “sister dresses” for my four sisters and myself. For Christmas in 1949, Isä bought Mummy a new electric Singer sewing machine. The sewing machine came with a booklet that had a series of sewing lessons, which I gladly took.</p>
<p>Again, from my 4-H clothing record at the time: “I planned to make a lot of dresses for myself, but the majority of the sewing I ended up doing was for others in the family. I don’t mind though, as it would be selfish of me to sew mostly for myself. The money I saved by sewing will almost pay for the cost of the sewing machine. When making a garment I seldom used a pattern because I liked to create my own designs. The Duluth <i>Herald</i>
 and <i>News-Tribune</i>
 had a lot of cute patterns for sale, and I clipped them from the paper and pinned them in a string on the wall of my bedroom for inspiration.”</p>
<p>I used the pictures of the patterns as ideas for making my own. The patterns were, we thought, too expensive when it is so easy to make them myself.</p>
<p>The sister dresses I made were different every year. One year <i>Seventeen</i>
 magazine came to Floodwood to do a story on teenagers at our school, and they published a photo of my four sisters and me next to a haystack on the farm. The dresses were identical—pale-green voile, with a square inset—my own design, as I didn’t have the money nor could I find the patterns in all five sizes.</p>
<p>This photograph was published in <i>Seventeen</i>
 magazine in an article on teenagers in small towns. I made the clothes that my siblings and I are wearing.</p>

<p>Later, when I took home economics at the university, my grades in sewing were not good. We always said that the clothing construction professor would take off points for a “wiggle in a stitch.” Sewing garments had been, in my experience, something done out of necessity—not in search of perfection.</p>
<p>Even though I had done a lot of sewing for the family and myself, I did not get good grades on the garments that I entered into the St. Louis County Fair. My penchant for speed and efficiency showed. I didn’t press seams properly or finish hems in a beautiful way. That cost me points on the professional scale.</p>
