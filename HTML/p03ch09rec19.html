<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">When pheasants have been hunted wild, they are usually no longer young, and while their flavor is richer, they can be quite tough and so need slow cooking. Our own pheasants that are available in autumn, or at other times frozen, are farmed. They are young and relatively tender (hen pheasants are the most tender, with more fat) and are best roasted at high heat for not too long. Asturias is apple country, where they also make an apple spirit that is like Calvados.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 young pheasants (about 1½ pounds each)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">5 Golden Delicious apples</p>
<p class="qun">4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter</p>
<p class="qun">12 slices pancetta or bacon</p>
<p class="qun1">½ cup Calvados</p>
<p class="recsum">Pull off any feathers on the pheasants or burn them off over a gas flame, then rinse the birds. Rub them with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Put them breast side up in a large casserole or baking dish with a lid.</p>
<p class="summary">Peel and core the apples. Cut one apple in half. Push a small piece of butter and an apple half in the cavity of each bird. Wrap each bird in 6 slices of pancetta or bacon.</p>
<p class="summary">Cut the remaining apples into 8 slices each. Heat the remaining butter with the remaining oil in a large skillet. Put the apple slices in—in batches if necessary—and cook briefly over medium heat, turning them once, to brown them lightly on both sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Pour in the Calvados and let it bubble for a moment. Arrange the apples around the pheasants, with their sauce, and cook, half covered, in a preheated 425°F oven for 30 minutes, or until the legs pull away easily from the body and juices run clear. Cut each pheasant in two down the breastbone and serve accompanied by the apples, with the sauce poured over.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Use sweet hard cider instead of Calvados.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Instead of apples, use 1 pound soft pitted prunes, soaked in 1 cup Cognac or other brandy for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Use 1 pound white, red, or black seedless grapes instead of apples with 1 cup brandy.</p>
