  <h3 class="h3a">Aubergine bread rolls</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">These lovely rolls remind me of my early baking days when I would make bread rolls with whatever leftover vegetables I had around. The dough is rolled into a rectangular shape, topped with grilled aubergines (eggplants) and scamorza cheese, rolled up and cut into spiral rolls. It takes a little time to prepare but is really worth the effort. If you prefer, you can replace the aubergines with courgettes (zucchini) and the scamorza with mozzarella.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes about 15 rolls</p>

  <p class="ing1">12g/¼oz fresh yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp lukewarm milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz/scant 2½ cups ‘00’ flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz/3 tbsp butter, melted</p>

  <p class="ing">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the filling</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz aubergines (eggplants)</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to grease</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz scamorza cheese, thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing2">a few basil leaves, torn</p>

  <p class="para">Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the milk and leave for about 10 minutes. Put the flour and salt in a large bowl, add the yeast mixture, melted butter and egg and knead on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes, until you have a smooth dough. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Preheat a grill (broiler) or griddle pan. Thinly slice the aubergine lengthways and grill on both sides. Combine the olive oil, salt and pepper and brush over the grilled aubergine. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Lightly grease a large baking sheet and line with baking parchment.</p>

  <p class="para">Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the dough into a roughly rectangular shape. Top with the scamorza, aubergine and torn basil leaves. Carefully roll up lengthways, taking care that the filling does not escape, and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut into slices about 4cm/1½ inches thick, place on the prepared baking sheet, cover and leave to rest for 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para1">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Bake the rolls for 15 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool before serving.</p>
