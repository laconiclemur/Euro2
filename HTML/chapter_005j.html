<h2 class="h2b">GRATIN DE FRUITS ROUGES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Red Fruit Gratin</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>The most wonderful berry gratin I’ve ever made was using</em> mara des bois, <em>which are a cross between wild and cultivated strawberries. They have all the flavour of the wild at the same time as being fat and juicy. They never seem to have a long run in the markets, but when they are about you can find your way to them by following your nose. You can use any mixture of berries for this gratin. If they are not perfectly ripe, add some sugar with the Grand Marnier and macerate them for a while just to sweeten them and get them bleeding a little. Very ripe peaches, finely sliced, are also wonderful in combination with raspberries</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
300g (10½ oz) strawberries, hulled<br/>
300g (10½ oz) raspberries<br/>
Dash of Grand Marnier</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">SABAYON</span><br/>
4 egg yolks<br/>
125g (4½ oz) caster sugar<br/>
Juice of 1 lemon<br/>
1 gelatine leaf (optional), soaked in cold water and squeezed dry<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) whipping cream</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Put the egg yolks for the <em>sabayon</em> with the sugar and lemon juice in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. If you’ve got an electric whisk, use it to start the <em>sabayon</em> as, although you probably get more volume with a balloon whisk, this is hard work and takes a while. Whisk the egg yolks until they double in volume and have thickened enough for you to make a figure 8 clearly with your whisk on the top of the mixture. Add the gelatine (if using) and keep whisking, away from the heat, until it has dissolved. Continue whisking until the mixture is completely cold.</p>
<p class="normala">Whip the cream and fold it gently into the <em>sabayon</em>. Refrigerate the mixture until you need it. This can be done a day in advance.</p>
<p class="normala">When you are ready to serve, toss the berries with the Grand Marnier. Leave to macerate for a few minutes. Put them either in four heatproof plates or one large dish (this is the most practical) and top them with the <em>sabayon</em>. Heat your grill to its highest setting and glaze the gratin for about 1 minute until golden but not too brown on top.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON ADDING GELATINE</span></p>
<p class="normala">The addition of gelatine here is a bit of an old chef’s trick, as it stops the mixture from separating.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON GRATINS</span></p>
<p class="normala">Your grill needs to be as hot as can be to glaze the top as quickly as possible and just warm the <em>sabayon</em> through without it separating. As not all domestic grills get quite hot enough (I’m always being told this), the easiest thing to do is use a blow-torch.</p>
