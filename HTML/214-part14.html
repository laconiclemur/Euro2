<p class="running_first">Of Europe’s three and a half million hectares of vineyards—95 percent of those dedicated to wine production—28 percent are in Spain. That is more than in France (25 percent) or Italy (23 percent). A bottle of wine on the table is a fundamental part of a Spanish meal. While vintages and celebrated winemakers might be appreciated, many in the country buy their table wine from the local cooperative. Co-ops, of course, bottle their vino, but also usually sell it by the liter from huge casks. For this, you take your own container to fill under the tap.</p>
<p class="running_first">Wines are usually enjoyed on their own, though sometimes they get a festive makeover in the form of sangria. I have a mixed relationship with this often sugary drink, but recently have begun preparing, and enjoying, naturally sweetened versions with both red wine <a href="219-chapter159.html#page_311">(see page 311)</a> and white wine <a href="220-chapter160.html#page_313">(see page 313)</a>. It is possible to make sangria using Cava, local champagne-style bubbly, though I don’t recommend it. A headache is almost guaranteed.</p>
<p class="running_first">A simpler <em>tinto de verano</em> (summer red wine) is red wine cut with some <em>gaseosa</em>, a plain, sweet carbonated soda (usually La Casera brand) served over ice cubes with a slice of lemon. This is a favorite drink of summer café terraces, beachside <em>chiringuitos</em> (seasonal restaurants, commonly not much more than a shack), and backyards among friends. It is also an excellent way to use the tail end of a bottle that has been open for a couple of days. (Especially one of those rougher-edged bottles from the co-op.) Homemade liqueurs and liquors remain popular. In Galicia, <em>licor de café</em> <a href="223-chapter162.html#page_316">(see page 316)</a>, <em>licor de guinda</em> (a small, sour cherry-like fruit), and <em>licor de hierbas aromáticas</em> (aromatic herbs) are all popular. These are prepared using as a base <em>aguardiente</em>, a strong and clear spirit made from the residue of grape-pressings like Italian grappa or French marc. In Navarra and the Basque Country, the most famous home liqueur and fine digestive is called <em>pacharán</em>, made by infusing sloe berries in anisette.</p>
<p class="running_first">Perhaps the most common <em>digestivo</em>, though, is a shot of brandy or rum added to coffee as an after-lunch tonic. Or a morning one. (I am still shocked at the popularity of this. Pull off at any rural roadside café in the morning to see just how common it is.)</p>
<p class="running_first">While at times it may seem otherwise, not all Spanish drinks are alcoholic or spiked with alcohol. There are lush milky drinks like <em>leche merengada</em> <a href="216-chapter157.html#page_308">(see page 308)</a>, or refreshing, slushy granitas made from lemon <a href="217-chapter158.html#page_309">(see page 309)</a> or coffee to quench a summer’s thirst.</p>
<p class="running_first">And, of course, the well-known and beloved hot drinking chocolate <a href="215-chapter156.html#page_306">(see page 306)</a>. Is there a more soothing way to begin a cold day than with a cup of that? Or, like many, end it, in the wee hours of the morning after a late night out?</p>
