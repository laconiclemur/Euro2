<h4><span class="red">aceitunas de mesa</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">A dish of olives sitting on the long bar or a marble café table is a recurrent offering in Spain. Bold green Sevillanas or small, drab-green Arbequinas, purplish black almond-shaped ones, green ones stuffed with anchovies . . . table olives are one of the foodstuffs most associated with Spain, and rightly so. They form not just a favorite nibble, but an important part of the country’s culinary heritage. Olives are grown both for olive oil <a href="44-boxnote07.html#page_63">(see page 63)</a> and for use on the table. Spain is the world’s largest producer of both.</p>
<p class="running_first">Olives are hard, bitter, and inedible when picked from the tree. The process for preparing Spanish <em>aceitunas de mesa</em> usually takes two to three months and has three phases: <em>recolección</em> (harvesting and collecting), <em>conservación</em> (conserving), and <em>aderezo</em> (curing). Recolección takes place in late autumn and into the new year. Ranging from bright green to greenish yellow to violet to reddish black, the color of an olive shows its stage of ripeness. After being washed and soaked in an alkaline solution to rid them of some of the bitterness, the olives are washed again and then put to soak in a salt water brine to soften. The olives are then drained and rinsed. Still bland, they need to be cured with seasonings—aromatic herbs such as thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, sage, and oregano; spices like fennel, cumin, and cloves; as well as aromatic additions like lemon and orange peel and crushed garlic cloves. Flavoring changes from region to region. Campo Real olives, for instance, picked early in October and possessing a brilliant emerald green color, traditionally have thyme, fennel, oregano, and garlic in the aderezo.</p>
<p class="running_first">Home curing was once done quite frequently. Like many in the countryside, my wife’s grandmother cured her own olives, just as she put up batches of peaches and quince paste. It is still possible to buy freshly picked olives in certain markets during winter for home use, and of course many farmhouses, if the climate is right, have at least a handful of their own trees.</p>
<p class="running_first">There is no disputing how tasty olives are. But with things that are so good, you need to use prudence when eating them, as the old Spanish refrain reminds us: <em>“Aceituna, una es oro, dos plata, y la tercera, mata”</em> (Olives: One is gold; two, silver; and the third kills).</p>
<p class="running_first">But like many people, I don’t follow that one. Rather, I heed another refrain that goes like this: <em>“Aceituna, una; y si es buena, una docena”</em> (One olive; and if it is good, then a dozen).</p>
