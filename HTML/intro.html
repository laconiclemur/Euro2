<h2 class="h2"><a id="intro"/><a id="page_1"/>introduction <span class="ash">]</span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">O</span>n November 20, 2009, Ferran Adrià pulled me aside and asked to see my notebook. We were standing in the kitchen of elBulli, each of us in our normal positions: he at the end of the pass, where he could oversee testing of the new dishes that his second in command, Oriol Castro, was developing; I closer to the center where I had a clear view of the long middle table where the bulk of the restaurant’s apprentices spent their day doing prep work. I was a bit surprised by the request: I had been in the kitchen for weeks each month since elBulli had opened for its 2009 season in June, and until now Ferran had never expressed any interest in what I was writing. But it was his restaurant, so I did as I was told. He started flipping through the pages, but it soon became clear he wasn’t reading any of my scribbled observations; he was looking for a blank space. When he came to the first one, he pulled his pen from behind his ear, and wrote, in letters large enough to fill the page: November 20, 2009. “Remember that date,” he said, handing back the notebook. “It’s the day we decided. A few months from now, you’ll understand what I mean.”</p>
<p class="indent">When, in January 2010, Ferran announced that he would be closing elBulli for two years while he transformed it into a think tank for gastronomic creativity, the news shook the culinary world. The most famous chef in the world, a holder of three Michelin stars, a five-time <a id="page_2"/>winner of the title Best Restaurant in the World, the person single-handedly responsible for transforming the meaning of cuisine and broadening its possibilities, was announcing that elBulli would no longer be a restaurant. The speculation started immediately. Was he having financial problems or health issues? Was it true that his former partner was thinking of suing him? Was he simply—gasp—tired of cooking? In the midst of the firestorm, I ran into a friend who has never cared very much about food or restaurants. “I don’t get it,” he said, referring to the media explosion surrounding Adrià’s announcement. “He’s just a cook. It’s just <span class="txit">food</span>.”</p>
<p class="indent">We live in an age in which food, and those who prepare it professionally, are the focus of unprecedented attention. As a society we are newly obsessed not with the securing of food (which would be natural enough and which remains a pressing issue in much of the world) but with the consumption and celebration of it. We track down the best artisanal cheeses, make lists of restaurants where we must eat before we die, and blog about the short ribs we cooked for dinner. We eagerly follow the business ventures and love lives of favorite chefs. We watch television stations devoted to round-the-clock food programming, and read websites that fawn over every seasonal ingredient to appear at the farmers’ market or that send reporters to stake out zoning meetings so that they’re the first with news of a new restaurant. Food has become a major source of entertainment, in other words, but it is hardly just that. As increasingly large segments of the population seek to reduce the power of the corn lobby in Washington, to reform school lunches, and to encourage those around them to “vote with their forks,” it has also become a political issue. Yet those who find this obsession perplexing, or silly, or possibly indicative of the imminent demise of civilization, can always dismiss it with a single phrase: But it’s just <span class="txit">food</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">I wrote this book because I wanted to find out why it’s not <span class="txit">just</span> food. Certainly the things we eat and how we eat them have always been about more than just the substances consumed. Throughout history, food has been a source of nurture (and not only nourishment). It has shaped culture and informed local and regional and national identities. <a id="page_3"/>But in recent years the list of things that food is called upon to do—its meanings, in other words—has dramatically expanded. These days, food and the cooking of it can be a form of self-expression or a remnant of sexist enslavement, a glamorous means of obtaining wealth and attention or a time-consuming chore, a sign of individual status or a source of collective identity, a vector for politics, an intellectual exercise, a subject for scientific inquiry, an expression of love. Food is all this, remarkably, while still doing what most of us want it to do, which is to taste good.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people have played a role in this expansion of food’s meanings, but few have been more influential than Ferran Adrià. Hyperbole may be the preferred rhetorical device of today’s hothouse food culture, but it is no exaggeration to say that Ferran is the most significant chef of our time. Since he began, in the mid-1990s, to experiment with food’s possibilities, he has transformed elBulli into the locus of a culinary revolution. Whatever one may think of “molecular gastronomy” (a term that Ferran reviles), it represents the most dramatic change to restaurant cooking since Escoffier. The techniques and ingredients Adrià has developed in his restaurant and equally famous workshop just off Barcelona’s Boqueria market—the foams, the sands, the liquids turned into tremulous globules via the magic of spherification—redefine what eating (or at least eating out) means. Chefs around the world have adopted not only his dazzling, delirious inventions but his ethos: to bring science and cooking into closer relationship; to use food not only to please and satiate but to amaze and provoke; above all, to constantly reinvent. “What we’ve done,” Ferran likes to say, “is create a new vocabulary, a new language, for cooking.”</p>
<p class="indent">That new vocabulary has produced some startling metaphors: “dragon” cocktails that make the drinker breathe smoke, “caviar” made from tiny spheres of olive oil. But it is his grammar—that is, the way he puts plates together—that is most astonishing. Hot turns into cold, sweet into savory, solid into liquid or air. Adrià’s cooking plays with the diner’s expectations, undermines established categories of taste and texture, and constantly, miraculously, continues to surprise. In the <a id="page_4"/>end, it is this intense creativity that distinguishes him. His mantra is “Don’t copy,” which means that not only does he not copy other chefs, he does not copy his own ideas. Each year, he and his team roll out new techniques developed in their test kitchen and create a new menu from scratch, incorporating new ingredients discovered in the previous months’ travels (in 2009, Japan still played a major role, though a few ingredients from the Amazon also worked their way in). It’s as if Adrià has internalized Ezra Pound’s famous dictum to artists: Make it new!</p>
<p class="indent">The acclaim Adrià has received for his work is similarly unprecedented. <span class="txit">Restaurant Magazine</span> has elected elBulli the best in the world five times. Fellow Michelin-starred colleague Juan Mari Arzak unabashedly refers to Adrià as “the most creative chef in history.” Polls put Adrià as one of the most easily identified figures in Spain—ahead of the prime minister (Rafael Nadal and Pau Gasol, however, still have him firmly beat). He has been on the cover of <span class="txit">The New York Times Magazine, Time</span> magazine, <span class="txit">Le Monde,</span> and hundreds more; on the elBulli website you can search for articles about him in twenty different languages. And each year, every single reservation for the thirty-course extravaganza that constitutes dinner at elBulli disappears in a single day (yes, 2011 is fully booked, too). Somewhere between 500,000 and two million people apply; for the 8,000 or so who get in—from renowned chefs to anonymous gourmands—elBulli’s small, unassuming dining room is the object of culinary pilgrimage.</p>
<p class="indent">In part, then, this is a book about elBulli. By now, there are enough chefs’ memoirs and kitchen exposés and seasons of <span class="txit">Top Chef</span> and <span class="txit">MasterChef</span> and <span class="txit">Iron Chef</span> available that anyone with an interest in what goes on behind the swinging door can easily find out. The long hours, the scars and burns, the knife skills, the verbal abuse, the perfectionism, the flavor profiling—even the most casual foodie is now fluent in the phrases and contours of kitchen life. Still, there is something different about elBulli. As Adrià himself repeatedly says, it is not a “normal” restaurant. From its ability to continuously reinvent itself to its astounding dishes to the system he and his chefs have devised for running the kitchen, elBulli maintains a mystique unmatched by any other restaurant. Admirers, <a id="page_5"/>and even some detractors, frequently refer to Adrià as a magician or a sorcerer, someone who performs alchemy with even the humblest of ingredients. If Ferran is indeed a modern-day incarnation of the Wizard of Oz, this book is, in part, an attempt to answer the question: What’s behind that curtain?</p>

<p class="caption">Ferran Adrià oversees the first step of the artichoke rose’s preparation. (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent">At elBulli, there is no hoax, no quaking charlatan pretending to be powerful. Ferran Adrià really is working wonders with food, the likes of which have never before been seen. The only trick—if that’s the right word—is that he is not doing it alone. Behind the curtain, dozens of others cooks stand with him: in recent years, there have been about forty-five people at a time working in elBulli’s kitchen, and since most of <a id="page_6"/>them stay only one season, the total over the course of the two decades since he began experimenting with food reaches high into the hundreds. Some of them are permanent staffers, but most are young cooks who give up six months of their lives to travel far from home and work long hours for no pay. These stagiaires—the apprentices to Adrià’s sorcerer—are following the most time-honored method of becoming a chef: volunteering to do hard, tedious labor in the kitchen of an established chef in order to acquire the skills, and perhaps a little of the philosophy, he has mastered.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet if elBulli is not a normal restaurant, neither are the stagiaires it attracts. For one, they are much more qualified: in most restaurants, stagiaires have little or no professional experience beyond what they may have picked up in their culinary schools’ practice kitchens. But at elBulli, the apprentices are hardly newcomers; most have already worked in some of the best restaurants in the world, often for pay. And they will go on, once they leave elBulli, to work in many more. In fact, many of the world’s greatest chefs—René Redzepi, Andoni Luis Aduriz, Massimo Bottura, Grant Achatz—have spent time in Adrià’s kitchen, and all, without exception, were changed by their time there. This is the other great distinguishing factor of a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli: it has launched the most glorious careers.</p>
<p class="indent">Training at elBulli, then, may be transformational for a young cook; it may help her get a prime position later and may, indeed, open up a world of professional opportunities that would otherwise be closed to her. But there is no guarantee. However long its list of dazzling alumni, elBulli has far more former stagiaires who are still toiling as line cooks in no-name restaurants or who have dropped out of the industry altogether. Cooking is a notoriously brutal profession, and even a stint at the best restaurant in the world cannot change its inherent difficulties.</p>
<p class="indent">So why do so many want to do it? Why are applications at the Culinary Institute of America up 50 percent in the past six years? Why do 30,000 aspiring British chefs apply to be on <span class="txit">MasterChef</span>? And why is a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli even harder to secure, as Ferran likes to say, than a reservation? The exalted position of food within a certain segment of Western society <a id="page_7"/>helps explain why so many of us now shop at farmers’ markets, tweet the details of our latest meal, take the occasional butchering class, and plan our vacations around tapas bars in Barcelona. But cooking is not like going to medical school: there is no guarantee that you’re going to make a decent salary down the line. And as any well-regarded chef who has occasionally been treated as “the help” can tell you, the status that comes from cooking the right food is far less stable than that derived from eating it. Cooking is work—and ill-paid work at that.</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of researching this book, I learned that if you ask aspiring chefs why they chose the profession, they will invariably tell you that they love cooking. But this seems to me a tautological response: <span class="txit">You cook because you love cooking? That’s it?</span> I wanted to know <span class="txit">why</span> they love cooking, what past longing it satisfies, what future they imagine it promises. I wanted to know, in other words, what it <span class="txit">means</span>. If we are to understand why food plays the pronounced role it does today, it seems to me that we have to be able to answer this single, critical question: Why cook?</p>
<p class="indent">“Look, I know. This isn’t solving climate change or curing cancer. We’re just feeding people,” pastry chef Mateu Casañas says. He and I are sitting on the bench outside elBulli’s kitchen on the last day of service for the 2009 season. Like the other chefs de cuisine, Mateu has spent his entire adult life working at elBulli, so I have a special interest in understanding why he does what he does. He nods thoughtfully as he pulls off an apron still immaculate after six hours of service, before repeating words I have heard before: “Here at least we know we have been a part of history.” He means, I think, the history of cuisine; already the dishes he and his colleagues prepare have become part of the canon of professional cooking, pored over and replicated by other chefs, before finally serving as inspiration for their own dishes. But he could just as easily have meant history in general. Given the importance we impart to how and what we eat, there is little doubt that someday, some doctoral student in cultural history will study elBulli’s menu for clues about our time and place. And what she will learn is that here at least, in this restaurant on the Catalan coast, at the end of the twentieth century and <a id="page_8"/>beginning of the twenty-first, food could do and be almost anything. It is that range of possibility that makes the stagiaires of elBulli, in the words of Claude Lévi-Strauss, so “good to think” when it comes to this strange modern phenomenon. Drawn by elBulli’s reputation, the come from around the world—a truly global class that testifies to the newfound power of haute cuisine. Their motivations, as well as the things they discover, differ from apprentice to apprentice. But all of them are attracted by the radical opening that elBulli represents, by the promise that there they can find their own meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">One day in 2011, when elBulli has served its last meal as a restaurant, those young men and women will still be cooking. They will scatter back around the globe and go on to work in other people’s restaurants or take the helm of their own places. Down the road, they may labor in temples of fine dining, grill steaks at some neighborhood bistro, invent whole new venues and styles, or maybe even find themselves in a world that no longer cares quite so intensely about the food they produce. But they will continue to take the things they learned at elBulli—perhaps the techniques and ingredients, but certainly the philosophy, the freedom, and, above all, the ability to explain why it’s <span class="txit">not just food</span>—and make them their own. They will continue, in other words, to shape the future of this fascinating, complex thing we call cuisine.</p>
