</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="bi">I rented a room at El Monasterio de Santa María del Socorro, the convent of</span> a Conceptionist Franciscan order of nuns on the Calle de Bustos Tavera, in the old quarter of Seville. From the outside, it looks like an ordinary house on a narrow street. Inside, the decor is Mudéjar—blue and white tiles line the walls and there is an interior patio. A picture of the Virgin Mary looked down on my bed. I thought of the room I’d shared with my Slovene Italian nanny, Maria, in Egypt. She had been a novice Catholic nun but was convinced by her family that it would be better for her to find work in Egypt, as many Slovene women did at the time, and to send money home. A crucifix, images of the Virgin, and icons of saints hung on our walls, and there was a branch from the “Virgin’s Tree” in Matariya, under which Joseph and Mary are believed to have rested.</p>
<p class="summary">I had hoped to see the nuns at Santa Maria del Socorro making pastries, not realizing that it would not be possible, because they are cloistered. I only saw Sister Inmaculada Romero, who is in charge of the rented rooms, and an older, very cheerful nun who passed the pastries through a hatch on a wooden <span class="italic">torno</span> (lazy Susan). The monastery was founded in 1522 by Doña Juana Ayala for women of the nobility who wished to live a contemplative life. Today the nuns spend their time in prayer and silent contemplation and make pastries to support themselves and maintain the convent. Seville has more monasteries and churches than any city in Spain and is famous for its convent pastries. Santa María del Socorro has the widest range—a list of sixty is pinned near the hatch where the orders are given and the pastries appear. Sister Inmaculada says their secret ingredient is <span class="italic">alegría</span>—joy. They have published their own cookbook (see page 575).</p>
<p class="summary">The only time the closed world of Seville’s cloistered nuns interacts with the outside world is when the nuns come out to sell Christmas specialties in the great patio of the baroque Palacio Arzobispal on the eighth of December, the feast of the Immaculate Conception, <span class="italic">la Purisima, la Inmaculada.</span> In the old days, nuns came to Seville from all over Spain. Now they are most likely to be from Latin America, Africa, and India. The new nuns learn to make the old traditional pastries whose secrets have been handed down for centuries.</p>
<p class="summary">Some of the convents have their own specialties. At the Monasterio de Santa Paula, an Indian nun sold me jasmine and orange blossom jams, tomato marmalade, chestnut cream, chiles in syrup, and quince paste. San Leandro is famous for its <span class="italic">yemas</span>—egg yolks cooked in sugar syrup. I adore them, but they are so rich I could only eat one. The nun who served me remained unseen behind the door but answered my questions. She said that by ancient tradition, convents had always made pastries to thank their noble protectors and sponsors. After the civil war, they started selling them to support themselves. A nun in a convent in Toledo once told me that convent pastries were Moorish because long ago, when mosques and synagogues were first converted into churches and monasteries, aristocratic nuns came to the convents with their Morisco maids of Muslim descent.</p>
<p class="summary">Around the corner from El Socorro, the Convento de Santa Inés also sells pastries. It contains the remains of its founder, Doña María Coronel, a Sevillian noblewoman who disfigured herself by throwing boiling oil on her face to escape the persistent amorous advances of Pedro I the Cruel (see page 27).</p>
<p class="summary">Here are some of the traditional pastries that figure on the menus of convents: <span class="italic">mazapanes, yemas, piñonates, mantecados, mostachones, empanadillas, pestiños, roscos, rosquillas, bizcochos, cocos, hojaldres, milhojas, bollo maimón, glorias, turrones, marquesitas,</span> and <span class="italic">torrijas.</span> And here are some with colorful names: <span class="italic">huesos de santos</span> (saints’ bones), <span class="italic">orejas de fraile</span> (friar’s ears), <span class="italic">tetas de novicias</span> (novice nuns’ breasts), <span class="italic">suspiros de monja</span> (nun’s sighs), <span class="italic">borrachuelos</span> (drunkards), <span class="italic">tocinos de cielo</span> (heavenly bacon), and <span class="italic">polvorones</span> (<span class="italic">dust cakes</span>). Some convents, inspired by the creativity of modern innovative chefs (they can see them on the Internet), have added pastries of their own invention to the traditional ones.</p>
