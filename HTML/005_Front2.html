  <p class="noindent">This book, an armchair travelogue of France with recipes emblematic of each district, will give the reader a rare opportunity of discovering <span class="italic">la France profonde</span>, off the beaten track.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Endowed with landscapes as rich as they are diverse, fertile farmlands and orchards throughout, France’s singular patrimony is its incredibly varied gastronomy—an art refined over centuries.</p>

  <p class="noindent">History points out that a great many of the dishes considered today part of our gastronomic glory trace their roots to a time when rural France suffered extreme poverty. The only way for the countrymen to survive was to avail themselves of all the simple elements growing nearby. Some plants they gathered from nature’s bounty, and some they grew themselves. Every possible part was used, either to feed the family, to fertilize the fields, or to feed the livestock. And the animals—besides producing milk or eggs or offspring—were in turn used for food from head to hoof. Driven by necessity, the rural householder learned how best to utilize each part of the beef or lamb, pig or chicken, including delicacies made of the innards and the extremities.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The recipes in this book for the most part date from long ago, emanating from the rural <span class="italic">terroir</span>, the small villages of <span class="italic">la France profonde</span>, from a time when farmers’ choices to feed themselves were limited to the produce of their own land—and when native creativity and innate ingenuity arose to transform the most humble ingredients into delectable fare.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Most of the deputies in the French Parliament who contributed to this collection were handed down a recipe by a grandmother or mother, secrets of family lore. Their sharing of their closely guarded treasures enables today’s reader to enjoy traditional cooking and to survey the origins of French gastronomy.</p>

  <p class="noindent">From these timeworn memoranda, scribbled in patois or local dialect and for the most part fragmentary or imprecise, recipes evolved into what is today our classic French cuisine.</p>

  <p class="noindent">For the reader’s convenience, and to avoid repetition, I include below a few basic components that are used over and over throughout the book.—<span class="italic">Tr</span>.</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="red">AIOLI</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">2 garlic cloves, germ removed</p>

  <p class="noindent">1 large egg yolk</p>

  <p class="noindent">1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</p>

  <p class="noindent">1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>

  <p class="noindent">1 1/2 cups olive oil</p>

  <p class="noindent">pepper and salt</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Put ingredients in the blender except for the oil. Turn blender on, and slowly trickle oil until mixture becomes firm. If you feel it is too thick, add a few drops water. If too thin, add 1 slice bread (crust removed), and mix in blender for a few seconds.</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="red">BOUQUET GARNI</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">To flavor a stock or other cooking liquid, a bunch of aromatic herbs is tied with string and immersed in the liquid. Usually the bouquet consists of a few sprigs of parsley, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, and chives, though the composition may vary. The bundle is removed before using the stock.</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="red">CRÈME FRAICHE</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">In a bowl, mix 1 cup heavy cream and 2 tablespoons sour cream. Cover and let sit overnight or a bit longer. Stir the crème fraiche and refrigerate.</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="red">PÂTE BRISÉE</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">2 ½ cups unbleached flour</p>

  <p class="noindent">2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces</p>

  <p class="noindent">1 teaspoon salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">1 teaspoon sugar</p>

  <p class="noindent">½ cup ice water</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Pulse all ingredients in the food processor until it comes together. Remove from processor, and form a ball of dough with your hands. Wrap and refrigerate at least one hour.</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="red">STOCK</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Stock can be made with the bones of beef, veal, chicken, or fish. Immerse the bones in a kettle of water with carrots, leeks, onion, celery, bouquet garni, peppercorns, and salt, and simmer for at least an hour, or longer for a stronger stock. Strain, discarding the solids, and refrigerate. A vegetable stock may be made without bones. For a dark stock, or <span class="italic">fond brun</span>, the bones and vegetables are roasted before simmering. Fish stock, <span class="italic">fumet de poisson</span>, is made with white wine.</p>
