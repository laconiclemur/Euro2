<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The name <em>cabañil</em> refers to the mules that traveled with flocks of sheep moving between summer and winter pastures, or to market. It is a recipe found, in numerous variations, across the mountainous region of southern Murcia that borders Andalucía, where lamb and goat form the centerpiece of the local cuisine, and offer it something of a culinary identity. This humble mountain dish adds a zesty, tangy sweetness to the savory flavors of the lamb.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large mortar, mash the garlic with a few generous pinches of salt. Stir in the vinegar and ¾ cup/180 ml water. Or quickly pulse the ingredients in a food processor.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the potatoes and onion, cover the skillet, and cook until the potatoes are nearly tender, about 20 minutes, turning from time to time. Pour over a generous half of the garlic sauce, add ½&gt; teaspoon of the sugar, and cook uncovered until the potatoes are tender and the liquid reduced, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat. Season the lamb with salt and cook in single-layer batches until browned, about 1½&gt; minutes on each side. Return all of the lamb to the pan, sprinkle over the remaining ½&gt; teaspoon sugar, and pour over the remaining garlic sauce. Reduce the heat to low and cook, turning from time to time, until done but still medium-rare, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Place the potatoes on a large serving platter and arrange the lamb chops on top. Drizzle any remaining sauce from the pan over the dish. Serve immediately.</p>
