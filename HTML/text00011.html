<h2 class="h2a">-SALMON WITH GARLIC AND CORIANDER SAUCE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Salmon has deliciously soft flesh that is packed with healthy fats. Here a pungent sauce of pounded coriander (cilantro), dill and fiery raw garlic are paired with the fish to cut through the richness. This is a wonderfully simple way to make a flavour-packed sauce, which you could pair with any kind of fish or simple grilled (broiled) meat.</strong>

<strong>The traditional Georgian flavours of ground coriander, fenugreek and marigold are combined with sour cream to create a mellow but flavoursome coating for delicate baked trout.

<h2 class="h2a">-FISH KEBABS-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>These kebabs are a great way of using up any fish that you have in the fridge, and they make a lovely addition to the table at any summer meal or barbecue. The marinade can be made ahead and the fish left in the fridge overnight to allow the flavours to develop, but, whether prepared in the oven or on the barbecue, the cooking time is minimal.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus at least 2 hours’ marinating time</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 10 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz mixed fish and shellfish (salmon, tuna, king prawns [jumbo shrimp])</p>
<p class="side">2 onions, halved and finely sliced</p>
<p class="side">1½ tbsp mayonnaise</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp <em>Mshrali Ajika</em>
 (Dry Red Chilli Paste, see <a href="text00005.html#page_29">here</a>

<p class="side">plain boiled rice, to serve</p>
<p class="side1">
<em>wooden or metal skewers</em>
</p>
<p class="para1">Place the fish, shellfish and onions in a large bowl and mix to combine. In another bowl, mix the <em>Ajika</em>
 and mayonnaise to combine, then pour over the fish and onion mixture, using your hands to ensure everything is well coated. Transfer to the fridge, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight to let the flavours develop.</p>
<p class="para1">Half an hour before you want to cook the kebabs, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6 and line a large baking sheet with foil. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water or oil to prevent them from burning in the oven.</p>
<p class="para1">Thread the fish onto the skewers, ensuring that you have a good mix of fish on each skewer. Lay the skewers on the prepared baking sheet and top with the onions. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the preheated oven to cook for 10 minutes, until the fish is cooked through and the onions are just soft, but still retaining some bite.</p>
<p class="para">Serve the skewers warm with plain boiled rice as a side.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">-CRISPY FISH IN SPICED MAYONNAISE AND WALNUT SAUCE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>These are essentially a Georgian take on fish fingers. Delicate white fish is fried in breadcrumbs and served with a deliciously spicy walnut and mayonnaise sauce. As well as making a wonderful dish for the dinner table, these could be adapted to make flavoursome canapés.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 20 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 8 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz white fish fillets (cod, haddock or pollock all work well)</p>
<p class="side">4 eggs, beaten, in a bowl</p>
<p class="side">200 g/7 oz panko breadcrumbs, in a bowl</p>
<p class="side">100 ml/3½ fl oz vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side1">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">100 g/3½ oz/¾ cup chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="side">3 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground coriander</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground blue fenugreek</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground marigold</p>
<p class="side">¼ tsp red chilli powder, or to taste</p>
<p class="side1">200 g/7 oz mayonnaise</p>
<p class="para1">Place the walnuts in a food processor and process to a very fine paste. The paste should be sticky and smooth, but not at all grainy (this can take up to 5 minutes).</p>
<p class="para1">Crush the garlic with the back of a knife and then put in a mortar with a pinch of the sea salt. Grind with a pestle to a smooth paste and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the walnut and garlic pastes in a bowl with the ground coriander, fenugreek, marigold and chilli powder. Add 100 ml/3½ fl oz of water and use your hands to bring the mixture together to form a smooth sauce. Transfer the sauce to a blender along with the mayonnaise and blend until smooth. Season to taste and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the bowl of beaten eggs and the bowl of breadcrumbs on a work surface. Then, working with one piece of fish at a time, dip the fish fillets into the egg and then roll in the breadcrumbs. Transfer to a plate while you finish the rest of the fish. Once you have breaded all of the fish, repeat the process so that all of the fillets have a double coating of breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Once hot, add the fish to the pan and cook one side until golden and crispy, around 4 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and cook on the reverse side for another 4 minutes.</p>
<p class="para">Serve the fish hot with the mayonnaise sauce drizzled over.</p>

<em>The smell of crispy fish in spiced mayonnaise and walnut sauce</em>
</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Throughout her life my mother was never fond of fish. If anyone was cooking fish at home, she had to leave the house for the day because she could not bear the smell. By contrast, my father, grandmother and I all loved fish and any time that my mother left the house, we took the oppotunity to cook some. On one Saturday each month my mother would visit her mother for the day, and the moment she left would signify the start of great activity in the kitchen. My grandmother would dip fish in breadcrumbs, fry it until deliciously crispy and serve it with a creamy mayonnaise and walnut sauce. My father, grandmother and I would all huddle together in the kitchen, eating it guiltily and revelling in our shared secret, always with one eye on the clock to watch for when my mother would return. As soon as we had finished eating, we would throw open all the doors and windows of the house in an attempt to banish the smell and keep my mother from discovering our secret. Sometimes it even worked.</strong>
