We do provide detailed information on curing and smoking as those steps play such an important role in making sausages, but we assume that a reader is familiar with the basic sausage making process. More space is dedicated to a special group of sausages such as head cheeses, liver and blood sausages as these products require slightly different production methods and there is little written information on the subject of their making.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Making sausages is like making hamburger: meat is ground, salt, pepper and the required spices are added, and then it is cooked until it is safe for consumption. If this prepared meat were stuffed into casings it would become a sausage. While various recipes usually get the spotlight the technical know-how behind preparing sausages is far more important.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre_2">The basic sausage making process:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Meat selection.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Curing.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Grinding/emulsifying.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">4.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Mixing.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">5.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Stuffing.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">6.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Conditioning.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">7.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Smoking/if needed.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">8.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Cooking/if needed. </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">9.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Cooling.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">10.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Storing.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Meat Selection</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">All cuts of good meat make good sausages. The trick is to know when and how to use them. Trim out all gristle, sinew, (discard glands and blood clots), excess fat, silver screen and any connective tissue and save them. Those visually unappealing trimmings are very important. They are used for regular sausages, but are an absolute must for making emulsified products like hot dogs or bologna. Once they are ground 2 times through a fine plate or emulsified in a food processor they become a paste that will bind larger particles of meat together.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">If you use only lean cuts of meat, your sausage will definitely be healthier but its texture will be poor and you will miss out on the taste. Fat carries flavor and provides a pleasant mouth feel. Our palate likes this mouth feel and that is why we love fatty foods such as ice cream, chocolate, butter, mayonnaise, cream and so on. To make a low fat sausage we have to cheat our senses by introducing more water and chemical agents like phosphate (binds water), hydrocolloids (gums that bind water) and commercially prepared fat replacers, for example micro cellulose. This book deals with traditionally made high quality sausages that are made without those additives.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Most sausages are made of either pure pork, or a combination with other meats, mainly with beef (about 20%). Sausage made entirely from beef will be drier with a harder texture. People living in off beaten track areas, for example Alaska might use wild game meats like moose, bear, elk, reindeer, or rabbit. However, it is still recommended to mix these lean meats with pork to achieve better texture and flavor. When it comes to selecting pork meat for sausages, the majority of books and recipes mention the same word: “use a pork butt.” Sure, it has the right lean meat to fat ratio of 70/30 and the sausage will be fine. What about someone with a big family who buys the whole hog - there are only two pork butts but what to do with the rest of the meat? He should have nothing left, some meat like ribs, chops and loins will be eaten right away and the rest can be processed to make all kinds of meat products such as smoked hams, butts, Canadian Bacon, smoked bacon, back fat, blood sausage, liverwurst, head cheese and dozens of different sausages.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">There is a unique meat classification system in the USA:</span></p><p class="calibre_32"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Acceptable grade - the only fresh pork sold in supermarkets.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Utility grade - used in processed products and not available in supermarkets for purchase</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Pork is divided into five prime areas:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Shoulder butt (Boston butt).</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Shoulder picnic.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Loin.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">4.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Ham.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">5.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Side (belly, ribs).</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_33" src="../images/00119.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 2.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Pork prime cuts.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Those main cuts are further broken down to additional parts. They all have unique names and numbers and they are listed in a trade catalog. These five primary cuts are the meat that a home sausage maker will be able to purchase in a supermarket. There are many meat products and known sausages that require meats from other parts of the hog’s body. Special sausages such head cheeses and as liver and blood sausages use offal meat such as head meat, jowls, brains, kidneys, hearts, back fat, lungs, tripes, etc. To make head cheese you need head, shank (hocks), jowls and skins. These parts are rich in collagen and will form a gelatin which will hold meat ingredients together. Blood is needed for blood sausages. Meat processors dealing with slaughter houses have access to those meats and they do use them to manufacture different sausages. A person living on a farm will be able to obtain a hog without much difficulty, a person living in a large city will need to visit Vietnamese, Thai or other ethnic stores. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Meat Classes</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Once the pig is gutted and the hairs are removed, it is split into two halves and processed into individual cuts. Imagine a butcher cutting hog into pieces until nothing is left on the table. Before he can carve out a ham from the leg he has to separate it from the body, then cut off the lower leg, remove the bones, tendons, gristle, sinews, skin, pieces of fat, silver screen and other connective tissue. To get a clean piece of meat like a ham, butt or pork loin a lot of work has to be performed first that leaves scraps of meat which can not be sold in one piece. Keep in mind that the meat plant was established to bring profits to its owners, and every little piece of meat, fat, and even blood is money.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00059.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 2.2</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> A half of pig can weigh 100 pounds so this is a lot of meat.

It will come naturally, remember it will not matter much if you mix some of pork class I with II. Make sure you get enough class III. Looking at meat class III that contains a lot of sinews one can develop the feeling that it is a poor kind of a meat scrap. After all who wants to chew meat with sinews. The truth is that </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">this is a very important meat class as it contains a lot of collagen</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> which is necessary for creating gelatin and binding meat particles together. It also binds water very well making products juicier.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Knowing meat classes will also help you immensely when shopping for better deals at large supermarkets. You will see what quality meat you will be buying, regardless of what’s on the label. When trimming pork chops, loins or hams for roasting, save the skin and those meat trimmings and store them in a freezer. You can use them to make sausages at a later date. Or when making sausages from pork butt, save the skin and fat for later use in a head cheese or liver sausage. When carving ham or butt you will get </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">all</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> meat classes, of course in different proportions. Picnic which is mainly class III, will also provide class II or even a piece of meat class I. It is a good substitute for pork head meat.</span></p><table border="1" class="calibre4" valign="top"><tr class="calibre5" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre6" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><img class="calibre_38" src="../images/00088.jpeg"/><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre6" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2">Pork Class I</span></span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre6" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2">Market Equivalent</span></span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre5" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre6" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">No bone, lean, no connective tissue.

The more myoglobin the darker the meat, it is that simple. Going from top to bottom, meats that contain the most myoglobin are: beef, lamb, veal, pork, dark poultry and light poultry. The amount of myoglobin present in meat also increases with the age of the animal. Different parts of the same animal, take the turkey for example, will have different colors as well. Parts that are active (legs) need more oxygen to function and they carry more myoglobin making this particular meat darker. A breast works very little and its meat contains less myoglobin making it lighter. This color is pretty much fixed and there is not much we can do about it unless we mix different meats together. Cured meats develop a particular pink-reddish color due to the reaction that takes place between meat myoglobin and nitrate/nitrite. If an insufficient amount of nitrate/nitrite is added to the meat the cured color will suffer. This may be less noticeable in sausages where the meat is ground and stuffed but if we slice a larger cut like a ham, the poorly developed color will be easily noticeable. Some sections may be gray, some may be pink and the meat will not look appetizing. There is a fixed maximum amount of nitrite that the meat can absorb and that depends on the amount of myoglobin. If too much is added the myoglobin will reject the excess of it and the consumer will have to eat it.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Curing Fats </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">We already know that nitrite will color meat pink. What about pure fat like back fat? It makes no sense to add nitrite to back fat as there is no myoglobin present and there is nothing there for nitrite to do. We will end up eating the chemical. Salting is all we need. If you study the recipes you will see that the more fat in the meat the less potassium nitrate was added. Very fatty meats or back fat are salted only, as the salt alone will cure the fat.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Blood Salting</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Blood is a very perishable product and has to be refrigerated. It was preserved by adding 5 kg of salt to 100 kg of blood and mixed well together. Such preserved blood was stored up to 48 hours at 39-42° F (4-6° C). Today an anticoagulation agent is immediately added to freshly collected blood and the blood is either stored at 37° F (3° C) for up to 48 hours or frozen.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Curing With Nitrates/nitrites </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Meat cured only with salt, will have a better flavor but will also develop an objectionable dark color.

Studies had shown that when nitrites combine with by products of protein (amines-in the stomach), that leads to the formation of nitrosamines which are carcinogenic (cancer causing) in laboratory animals. Those findings started a lot of unnecessary panic in the 1970’s about harmful effects of nitrates in meat on our health. Millions of dollars were spent, a lot of research was done, many researchers had spent long sleepless nights seeking fame and glory but no evidence was found that when nitrates are used within established limits they can pose any danger to our health. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">A review of all scientific literature on nitrite by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that nitrite does not directly harm us in any way. All this talk about the danger of nitrite in our meats pales in comparison with the amounts of nitrates that are found in vegetables we consume every day. The nitrates get to them from the fertilizers which are used in agriculture. Don’t blame sausages for the nitrates you consume, blame the farmer. It is more dangerous to one’s health to eat vegetables on a regular basis than a sausage.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">As our most popular cures are in a pink color it would be very hard to mistake them for common salt. Even if Cure #1, was misplaced in such an unusual way the amount of salt needed to consume as a single dose will even be larger as there are only 156 ppm of sodium nitrite in it. That corresponds to eating 18.26 lbs of meat at one sitting. The only way to consume a fatal dose will be to mistake pure nitrite (it is white) for salt but the general public has no access to it. Note that:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">1g of nitrite is generally accepted as the life threatening dose.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">1 PPM (part per million) equals 1 mg/kg.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">By the time meats are consumed, they contain less then 50 parts per million of nitrite.

Cure #1 is not interchangeable with Cure #2 and vice versa, however, no harm will come to you if they were inadvertently mixed.

Today, people don’t cure meat at all assuming that if the sausage is pink it has been cured. Well, if you mix sodium nitrite with ground meat the sausage will develop a pink color after cooking. Curing is not just coloring meat, curing changes the texture of the meat and develops </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">curing flavor</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> what contributes to quality of the product. Meat cured for 2 days in a refrigerator will produce a better quality sausage than meat which was ground, mixed with sodium nitrite (Cure #1) and immediately smoked. All of us are very busy nowadays and we may not want to cure meat in a refrigerator, but we still want a good product. We know that </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">curing needs time,</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> so let’s find some extra time for the meat to cure, but let’s do it inside the casing.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">It is a known fact that a smoked sausage will be of higher quality when the meat is seasoned over night which is basically a shorter, simplified version of a curing process that should have been performed earlier. If you want to cure a sausage that way, grind the meat, mix and stuff it, then it can be stored for a day before it goes in the smoker. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Leaving sausages for 12 hours at 2-6° C (35-42° F) or for 2-3 hours at room temperature below 30° C (86° F) will provide this extra time to cure meat. This curing process will continue during smoking and will end when the sausage is cooked.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Bear in mind that this “simplified” curing method can not be used when curing whole pieces like hams, butts, loins or even chunks of meat that should be visible in some sausages. Due to the insufficient curing time they will have an uneven pink and reddish area or even some gray in it that would be easily noticeable when slicing those meats. In those cases a traditional method of curing must be performed.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Commercial processors can cure meat faster and at lower temperatures by using ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, or their derivatives, sodium ascorbate and/or sodium erythorbate. These additives speed up the chemical conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide which in turn will react with meat myoglobin to create a pink color. They also deplete levels of meat oxygen which prevents fading of the cured meat color in the presence of light and oxygen.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Curing Meats for Headcheeses, Liver and Blood Sausages</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">This group of sausages employs an assortment of meats that will be difficult to sell. Many people would restrain from buying a sausage knowing that organ meats or blood are inside and they would refuse to accept the fact that this kind of sausage has a very high nutritional value. In the meantime they prepare sandwiches for work with bologna, hot dogs and other emulsified products which have a very similar meat composition.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Curing jowls, tongues or blood is not something that you can find in a typical sausage making book. We are presenting the actual data and curing tables from the official government manual that was prepared for Polish meat plants in 1959, however, this information holds true today as well. Those products were made and sold in Poland for 50 years and were absolutely wonderful. Most of them are still available although they are made differently today. The curing step contributed the most to the high quality of those products. There were three curing procedures:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1. Dry mixture for ground meats (sausages).</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Dry mixture was prepared by mixing 5 kg of potassium nitrate with 100 kg of salt.

Fresh sausages that will be cooked or grilled at high temperatures don’t need to be treated with nitrite though nitrite may be added to develop the pink color. In the USA and most European countries it is 150 ppm (parts per million) which corresponds to 150 mg of sodium nitrite per 1 kg of meat. 75 ppm is considered to be the minimum for curing meat for sausages (adding cure mix directly to meat-dry curing method). Our calculations are based on 120 ppm (using Cure #1 or Peklosol) which is below the max limit. When the recipe calls for 1 flat teaspoon (6 g) of cure 1 and you administer a little less or a little more, it will not really matter much.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Curing Temperatures</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The curing temperature should be between 36° and 40° F (4-10° C) which falls within range of a common refrigerator. Lower than 36° F temperature may slow down the curing process or even halt it. In the past we used potassium nitrate exclusively because its derivative, sodium nitrite was not discovered yet. Potassium nitrate was the best and only curing chemical we knew of and it worked wonderfully at 4-8°C (40-46°F) which was fine as refrigeration was not very common yet. If temperatures dropped below 4°C (40°F) the bacteria that was needed to force nitrate into releasing nitrite would become lethargic and the curing would stop.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">It was a slow working agent and the meat for sausages had to be cured for 72-96 hours. Sodium nitrite does not depend on bacteria, it works immediately and faster and the curing times are shorter, 48-72 hours at refrigerator temperature 2-4° C (35-40° F). At higher temperatures it will work even faster, however, spoilage bactria will also grow faster which will shorten the shelf life of the product. Nevertheless a stuffed sausage may be conditioned (hanged) for 1-2 hours at room temperature. That means we could perform the curing process out of the refrigerator saving some time and space. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Except fresh and a few special sausages (head cheeses, liver and blood sausages) </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">all Polish sausages require meat to be cured</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> and we would like to simplify this procedure for a busy person of today.

As a rule, lean meat is ground coarsely, while fatty cuts are ground very finely. Sausage is lean-looking and the fat is hidden inside. It is much easier to grind cold meat taken directly out of the refrigerator. The fat is usually ground through a plate with very small holes and if it is not partially frozen a smeared paste will be produced. The locking ring on the grinder head should be tight and the knife must be sharp, otherwise the meat will smear. To avoid smearing, grinding should be performed at low temperatures 34-38° F (1-3º C). Ideally, meat should always be chilled between 32-35° F (0-2º C) for a clean cut. Since refrigerator temperatures are roughly 38-40° F (3-4º C), we should place the meat in a freezer for about 30 min just before grinding.There are numerous electrical grinders, or processors with grinding head attachments that all work fine. Keep in mind that the meat will have to be stuffed into casings, so the grinder will need to accept tubes of different sizes. The best solution is to use a stand alone sausage stuffer.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_15" src="../images/00026.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 2.38</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Grinder is an efficient device, however, it “grinds” meat, it does not produce a clean cut.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00069.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 2.39</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Bowl cutter pictured below produces a very clean cut.

It will be much easier to use 3/8” plate for everything. There are many reasons for it:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> You could do just that if you had only high grade meats, let’s say pork class I (ham) and pork class II (butt). With such fine meats you would not get any pieces of bone, gristle and sinews that would stick between your teeth. On the other hand we are left with meat scraps of lower classes that we would not be able to eat if they were not finely ground.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> We want to retain meat juices and water inside the meat and those poor meat grades with a lot of gristle and sinews are loaded with collagen that helps do just that. The better grind we can obtain the stronger binding power meat develops and this is where a bowl cutter starts to shine. A grinder, manual or electrical, cuts meat and pushes meat through plate holes, cutting meat but also mechanically breaking it at the same time. A bowl cutter cuts cleanly without doing mechanical damage to a piece of meat’s structure. It develops a lot of heat so ice or cold water are added to cool down the meat and rotating knives. That allows it to emulsify meat into a consistency of fine paste that is able to trap all this ice and water with fat and hold it inside. All scraps of meat with fat, gristle and sinews have become a paste now, the product will be juicier and the manufacturer will make more money. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The third reason is that many people do not like to see fat inside of the sausage. By grinding fat through a fine plate the fat will bind with meat and will not be noticeable. There is not any rigid, fixed rule in regard to grinder plates and the selection depends greatly on the type of sausage that we decide to make.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">For hundreds of years we chopped meat with knives and stuffed it with fingers through a horn. And the sausages were great. Queen Victoria of England had her own very strict rules about making her sausages: </span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">The meat had to be chopped, not ground to prevent natural juices from leaking out</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">The casings had to be filled by hand, the mixture pressed down through a funnel with the thumbs</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Some sausages like “Krakowska Krajana Sausage” are still made from lean meat cut with knives and then stuffed into a large diameter casing.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Mixing</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">If the meat was previously cured, then the salt, nitrite, and sugar was already added. Now we have to add the remaining ingredients and spices. They can be added during emulsifying in a food processor or they may be mixed with cold water and then poured over the minced meat. The water helps to evenly distribute the ingredients and it also helps soften it during stuffing. We can easily add 1 cup of cold water to 5 lbs of meat because it is going to evaporate during smoking anyway. Water should not be added to products that will be cold smoked, fermented or air dried. The lean meat should be mixed with spices first and to prevent smearing the fat should be added at the last moment. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">You have to apply some pressure</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> when mixing and </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">kneading</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> is a good term for it. When the meat feels sticky it is an indication that it was properly mixed. Mixing meat by hand also raises its temperature so it should be done quickly. It takes roughly about 5 minutes to thoroughly mix 10 lbs of meat. The time is important because fat specks start to melt at 95-104° F (35-40° C). We want to prevent this smearing to keep the sausage texture looking great. Taste the sausage before you stuff it, since you still have time to implement any changes.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Stuffing</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">There is not much we can do to alter the taste of the sausage after it is stuffed. It is strongly recommended to taste the meat when mixing it with spices. People make mistakes when reading recipes, they get confused with ounces and grams and they use different size spoons to measure ingredients. Just make a very tiny quarter size hamburger, throw it on a frying pan and in two minutes you can taste your sausage. After the meat is ground and mixed it has to be stuffed into a casing preferably as soon as possible. Allowing the meat to sit overnight in a container causes it to set up and absorb all this moisture that we have added during mixing and stuffing. The mixture will harden and we’ll be struggling filling casings blaming the whole world for it. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Pack the meat tightly inside the grinder, horn, or piston stuffer to prevent air from entering into the casing. The air creates unnecessary resistance during stuffing and creates little air pockets which may fill with water and produce spoilage. Besides, when water evaporates the finished product may have little holes visible after slicing. The majority of piston stuffers come equipped with an air valve that allows accumulating air to escape outside. After the sausage is stuffed, any air pockets are simply pricked with a needle. There is no need to worry about tiny holes that will be gone as fast as they were made. The exception to the above hard stuffing rule is when a long rope sausage is made as it will be divided to equal links by twisting them. That would be impossible to achieve if the casing was stuffed hard. Liver and blood sausages are stuffed loosely as they often contain filler material such as buckwheat and barley groats, rice, rusk bread crumbs, semolina flour or soaked rolls. Those materials can expand during the cooking process. The casing should have a little water inside as it acts as a lubricant for the entering meat. By the same token pouring water over the stuffing tube is recommended to increase lubrication. Some people grease the tube lightly. When placing a casing on a stuffing tube, it should go on loosely otherwise it might break.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The natural casings are ideal casings for a home sausage maker though they require some practice. After the first sausage session they become easy to work with and are always ready to be used at a moment’s notice. After stuffing, any remaining casings should be packed with canning salt and stored at refrigerator temperature (38° - 40° F) where they will last almost indefinitely.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Conditioning</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">At the first look this step seems to be insignificant but in reality it is very important. It is a kind of drying-setting up-seasoning combination step that influences the color of the sausage, both inside and outside. Conditioning provides extra curing time and allows the surface of the casing to become dry as it should be if we want to obtain a nicely colored smoked sausage.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The sausages can be placed in the area with some moving air and the moderate use of a fan will definitely be of help. Air-fan drying should not be used for an extended period of time as it may harden the surface of the smaller meat pieces/sausages. Conditioning is a short, hardly noticeable process and when making a lot of sausages, before the last casings are stuffed, the first ones are ready for smoking. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Stuffed sausages that are subject to smoking may follow a drying procedure inside the smoker which lasts about 1 hr (no smoke applied) at 40-60° C (104-140° F) until </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">the casings feel dry or at least tacky to the touch.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Leave draft controls or the top of your smoker fully open. If a natural wood is used for fuel, enough wood must be burned to produce hot embers that would be releasing heat without creating smoke to dry out the casings. This is a welcome scenario as preheating a smoker to eliminate humidity inside is a must step for any kind of a smoker.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Smoking </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">There are two distinctive methods of smoking:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Cold smoking, usually at 71° F (22° C) or less. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Hot smoking. This method covers a large range of temperatures and at lower range is often called </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">warm smoking</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> and as the temperature raises it becomes </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">hot smoking.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">The dividing line is when meat or fish proteins start to cook.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Throw an egg on a cold frying pan and start raising the heat. At a certain point the white of the egg which actually looks like a clear jelly starts changing color and becomes cooked egg whites. The technical term is </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">coagulation of protein,</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> this is when the product starts to cook. In meat this usually happens at around 29° C (85° F), there is a rapid loss of moisture and the texture of the meat becomes hard. The fish starts to cook at 85° F (29° C) and if you want to make cold smoked salmon that can be sliced paper thin you cannot exceed 85° F (29° C). In simple terms </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">cold smoking should be performed below 29° C (85° F).</span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Cold Smoking</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">You will find that different sources provide different temperatures for cold smoking. All Polish, German, Russian or Lithuanian technology books agree that cold smoke should be applied around 72° F (22° C). Occasionally a book calls for 77° F (25° C). Old German books specify temperature of cold smoke as 64° F (18° C) or lower. Any recipe that calls for cold smoke </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">higher</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> than 85° F (29° C) makes little sense, as at this temperature proteins coagulate and the texture of the meat changes. The meat gets cooked. The surface area will harden preventing moisture removal and the product may rot inside. This hardened ring will also slow down smoke penetration. In the past sausages were smoked for different reasons. Our ancestors did not care much about the flavor of the meat or the sausage. What they needed was a method that would preserve food for later use. They tried different ways to preserve meat and this eventually lead to methods like salt curing, drying, smoking and fermenting. It was discovered that salted meats could be air dried and would keep for a long time.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_20" src="../images/00025.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 2.40 and 2.41</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Using the weather to his advantage, Waldemar Kozik has no problems with cold smoking in Catskill Mountains of NY.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Two different methods of drying developed in Europe. In Northern European countries, winters were cold and the only way meat could be dried at low temperatures was placing them close to the fire. Originally that took place in caves where fire was the center of all social activities, then separate enclosures (smokehouses) were built for drying and storing meats. As the temperature had to be higher than freezing temperatures outside, the fire was slowly burning on the ground providing suitable temperatures for drying. It is common knowledge that fire produces smoke so the meats and sausages were dried and smoked at the same time. They were just flavored with cold smoke which not only further preserved the product but gave it a wonderful aroma. In addition it prevented molds from growing on the surface. Those advantages of applying smoke were not ignored by our ancestors and smoking became an art in itself. The meat, however, was preserved by drying and the benefits of smoke flavor was just an added bonus.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The majority of hobbyists think of cold smoking as some mysterious preservation technique that will produce a unique and superb quality product. What makes matters worse is that they start to experiment with different smoke temperatures and establish their own rules which then spread around and are repeated by newcomers into the field of smoking meats. Let’s put some facts straight:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">cold smoking is not a preservation method, it will not preserve meat unless the meat will be dried. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">the higher amount of salt is added to meat to inhibit the growth of spoilage bacteria.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">cold smoking is an additional safety hurdle that helps to achieve microbiological safety of meat.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Cold smoking is an old technique that was practiced not because it produced great flavor, but because it helped to preserve meats. Cold smoking was nothing else, but a drying method. Its purpose was </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">to eliminate moisture so that bacteria would not grow.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> This technique developed in North Eastern European countries where the climate was harsh and winters severe. When meats were cold smoked for 2-3 weeks, yes, the meat became preserved due to the loss of moisture, but it was drying that made the meat safe. If the same meat was dried at 54° F (12° C) without any smoke present, it would be preserved all the same.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Cold smoking is drying meat with smoke.</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">The pigs were traditionally slaughtered for Christmas and the meat had to last until the summer. Noble cuts were cooked or salted, but trimmings were made into sausages that were dried which was not easy with freezing temperatures outside. The only way to heat up storage facilities was to burn wood and that produced smoke. Too much heat was not needed as it consumed too much wood and it would cook the product instead of preserving. They were two choices: </span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">hang meats 5 feet above a small smoldering fire OR </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">burn wood in a firebox that was located outside. The firebox was connected with the smokehouse by an underground channel that would supply heat and smoke at the same time.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_56" src="../images/00079.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Fig. 2.2</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> An old Polish smokehouse.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">A large smokehouse was also a storage facility where smoked meats hung in a different area where they continued to receive some smoke, although on a much smaller scale. This prevented any mold from growing on the surfaces of hams or sausages, as molds need oxygen to grow.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_57" src="../images/00013.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Fig. 2.3</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> An old smokehouse.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">It had been established that meats dried best when the temperatures were somewhere between 50–60° F (10-15° C) and although the temperature of the smoke leaving the firebox was higher, it would be just right by the time it made contact with meat. Whole logs of wood were burnt. The fire was allowed to die out as people went to sleep. The meats hung until the morning and the fire would be re-started again. So, when you see an old recipe saying that ham or sausage was smoked for 2 weeks, well, it really was not, as it probably received smoke for about 1/3 of the time. Those meats were not cooked, they were dried and could be considered fermented products. There is little difference about Italian salami, Hungarian salami or Polish Cold Smoked Sausage. Italian salami is dried without smoke and Hungarian salami or Polish sausage were dried with cold smoke.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Italians and Spaniards were blessed with a climate that provided cool prevailing winds at right temperatures. There was no need to burn wood to warm up the drying chambers. As a result products did not carry a smoky flavor. For this reason people in the Mediterranean basin are not particularly fond of smoked products, and people in Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania love them, but don’t generally like uncooked air dried products. The majority of all processed meat products in Northern Europe are of smoked variety.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The purpose of cold smoking was to dry meats. The product was drying out and the smoke happened to be there. Preservation was on people’s mind rather than creating cold smoked flavor. Very few products are cold smoked today, notably cold smoked salmon known as “lox.” The texture of cold smoked products is firmer and they can be sliced paper thin. The taste is a different story, you must acquire a liking for cold smoked products. In the past people already knew what we know today, that hot smoked products taste better. Cold smoking was our answer to the lack of refrigeration in the past. Do you think we would have bothered to smoke meats for weeks if refrigeration had been present? No, we would hot smoke them for a few hours and then they would go into the refrigerator.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Cold smoking</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> – 52-71°F (12-22°C), from 1 - 14 days, applying </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">thin</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> smoke with occasional breaks in between. Cold smoking is not a continuous process, it is stopped a few times to allow fresh air into the smoker. Cold smoking slows down the spoilage of fats, which increases the shelf life of meat. The product is drier and saltier with a more pronounced smoky flavor. The color varies from yellow to dark brown on the surface and dark red inside. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Cold smoked products are not submitted to the cooking process.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Cold smoking assures us of total smoke penetration inside of the meat. The loss of moisture is uniform in all areas and the total weight loss falls within 5-20% depending largely on the smoking time. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">It is obvious that you cannot produce cold smoke if the outside temperature is 90° F (32° C), unless you can cool it down, which is what some industrial smokers do. With careful planning you can even cold smoke in tropical areas like Florida, however, you are limited to the winter months only and the smoking must be done at night when temperatures drop to 40 - 60° F (4-16° C) or even lower.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The question arises to how to continue cold smoking when temperature increases to 80° F (27° C) at day time? Well, do not smoke, move meat to the area of 50° F (10° C) or refrigerate. Then when the temperature drops in the evening, start smoking again.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Warm smoking</span></span><span class="calibre_2">  - 73-104° F (23-40° C), continuous smoking from 4-48 hours depending on the diameter of the meat, humidity 80%, and </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">medium</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> smoke. The weight loss varies between 2-10%, with the difference being largely dependent on time spent smoking. The surface of the product becomes quite dry but the inside remains raw. Because of the warm smoke, the product receives more smoke in its outside layers. This dry second skin helps increase shelf life, as well as prevent the loss of its natural juices. The color ranges from yellow to brown and has a little shine due to some fat moving outwards. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Hot Smoking</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> - Continuous smoking at 105-140° F (41-60° C), 0.5-2 hours, 5-12% weight loss, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">heavy</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> smoke. This is not recommended for large pieces of meat. Although it is the fastest method, there is not enough time for adequate smoke penetration. This results in a higher moisture content thus reducing the product’s shelf life. This type of smoking can be divided into three separate phases:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Drying out the surface of the meat for 10-40 min at 112-130° F (45-55° C), some very light smoke is acceptable, although not necessary. Besides drying out the surface of the meat, the temperature speeds up nitrite curing. Keep in mind that draft controls must be fully opened to eliminate any moisture residing inside of the smoker. Initially smoking at temperatures higher than 130-140° F (54 -60° C) will prematurely dry out the casings on the surface of the meat and will create a barrier to smoke penetration.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> This is the proper smoking stage at 112-140° F (45-60° C) for 30-90 min, using medium to heavy smoke. The color becomes a light yellow to dark brown with a shade of red. In this state, the natural casings become strong and fit snugly on the sausages. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> About 10-20 min baking on the sausage surface at 140-176° F (60-80° C). Temperatures as high as 194° F (90° C) are permitted for a short period of time. Proteins are denatured in the outside layers of the product, but the inside remains raw with temperatures reaching only 104° F (40° C).</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">If a smoker is used to cook the meat, for example Kabanosy or Hunter’s Sausage </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(Myśliwska)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> the temperature in the last stages of hot smoking is increased to 167-194° F (75-90° C) until the inside of the meat reaches 152° F (67° C). The majority of smoked sausages are cooked in water at 176° F (80° C). This type of cooking (poaching) is more economical to baking (less weight loss). Hot smoked casings fit very snugly, become shiny, and develop a few wrinkles. This is a welcomed scenario; lots of smoked products are subsequently poached. Acting like a barrier, the drier and stronger casings prevent the loss of juices. Because of a relatively short smoking time, hot smoked products should be kept in a refrigerator and consumed relatively quickly. Hot smoking is the fastest and most common method of smoking.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Wet Smoking</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> - hot smoking that employs a water dish placed inside of the smoker to increase humidity levels.  Dampening wood chips into water one hour before smoking will produce a similar effect. One reason small smokers need a water dish is that their fuel (charcoal briquettes, heating element) does not contain moisture. On the other hand wood logs always contain some moisture, even when perfectly dried. During the first stage of combustion wood dries out and any remaining moisture evaporates with the smoke into the chamber. Once the wood has burned out, the remaining charcoal has no water left and in dry climates the product may be too dry. Ready made charcoal briquettes or an electric heating wire have no internal moisture, so we have to supply the water in a pan.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Another reason for the water pan is that most little factory made smokers are enclosed units that don’t receive a steady supply of air. Fresh air contains moisture which cools sausage casings or the surface of the meat. When smoking with an open fire, lots of fresh air enters the smoker and keeps the meat from drying out. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">As the water boils at the constant temperature of 212° F (100</span></span><span class="calibre_2">° </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">C), placing a water filled pan inside of a small smoker will also help to control and maintain temperature at that level. Bear in mind that this temperature is too high for smoking quality meats and sausages.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Wood for Smoking</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">All hard woods are suitable: oak, alder, beech, hickory, nut, fruit and citrus trees. Stay away from evergreen trees such as pine, spruce, fir and others. These are soft trees that are rich in resin. They impart a turpentine like flavor to meat and they produce a lot of soot which will induce a dark color to smoked meats.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Smoking Temperature</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">There is no steadfast rule that dictates exact temperature ranges for hot smoking. A few degrees one way or the other should not create any problems as long as the hot smoking upper temperature limit is not crossed. Smoking temperature is one of the most important factors in deciding quality. When smoking, the inside temperature of the smoker cannot exceed 170° F (78° C) for any extended time. At this temperature, fat starts to melt quickly affecting the texture of the sausage. Once it melts the sausage will be greasy outside with a mass of bread crumbs inside, it will lose its shine and will have an inferior taste. If your sausage:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Is greasy on the outside.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Drips grease onto the ground.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Is too shriveled and wrinkled.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">Has lost its shine and looks opaque.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="5"><span class="calibre_2">Is crumbly inside with little empty pockets.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">it means that the internal temperature of the sausage was too high during smoking or cooking. Determining temperature is as easy as inserting a stem thermometer through the wall or the door of the smoker. To sum it all up:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Meat smoked with dry wood has a more pronounced smoky flavor.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Dry wood may be soaked in water and used for hot smoking.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Dry wood must be selected when cold smoking.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Humidity</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Ideally the meat should be cold smoked at 80% relative humidity. If the humidity were increased, the intense smoke penetration would bring extra moisture inside. Extra moisture in the meat causes bacterial growth, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid. Extremely low humidity, such as in Arizona and New Mexico will cause excessive drying of the sausage casing or the surface of the ham. This will prevent internal moisture from escaping the meat. Humidity control plays an important role when making products that cure very slowly in open air. Not having enough humidity will produce meat that is still moist and raw on the inside and dry outside. Once the meat is cut there will be two different noticeable shades. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Choosing the time of the day is an effective method of humidity control. The humidity is always higher at night when the temperatures are lower. As the temperature drops down the air loses its ability to hold moisture and more moisture is present. In warm climates night is the best time for cold smoking.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Using </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">dry wood</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> is of utmost importance when cold smoking. By following these rules we achieve 75-85% humidity, creating the best conditions for moisture removal. This in turn prevents the growth of bacteria. Once the moisture content drops low enough the salt present in meat will further inhibit the development of bacteria and the products can hang in the air for months losing more moisture.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Cooking Sausages</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Sausages, hams and other pieces of meat are considered a raw product unless heated to an internal temperature of 154-160° F (68-72° C). It is of no importance whether it is done by boiling, steaming, grilling, or baking. A sausage smoked for 6 hours at 100° F (38° C) will have a great smoky taste, flavor and color, but it will still be a raw sausage like a fresh sausage that was only ground, mixed with spices, and stuffed into casings. Both of them must be cooked to safe temperatures before consumption. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Methods of Cooking</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">You could smoke your meat in the most primitive conditions outdoors, then bring it home, cook in water and it will be a great product. We can use the following cooking methods:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Baking in a smoker.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Baking in the oven.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Cooking in water.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">All we have to do is remember that fat melts down at low temperatures and although it solidifies again, its looks are already gone. Fry a piece of solid fat on a frying pan and see what happens when it solidifies, it doesn’t look the same. We can’t avoid it altogether (unless we make cold smoked and air dried products), but there is no reason to intensify the problem by creating unnecessarily high temperatures.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Cooking in a Smoker</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">It makes a lot of sense to cook meat in the smoker as it is already there. Besides, it will have a slightly better taste than sausage cooked in water and it will shine more. On a downside, it will lose more weight than other methods. It is also the </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">slowest</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> and the most difficult method that largely depends on the technical possibilities of the smoker. A slow but regularly increasing temperature inside the smoker will produce the best effects. Two thermometers are needed – one to monitor the temperature of a smoker and the other to monitor the inside temperature of the meat or sausage in its thickest part. It helps to have a thermometer with an alarm sounder in it, this way we get an audible warning when meat has achieved its pre-set temperature. Cooking meats in a smoker is a slow process. While it takes 2 –3 hours to smoke a sausage, it may take an additional 5 hours to bake it. It will largely depend on the inside temperature of the meat when smoking was stopped. If it was 100° F (38° C) we have a long way to go, if it was 150° F (66° C) we are almost there. A lot will depend on outside conditions and how well the smoker is insulated. Of course we take for granted that our smoker is fully capable of providing heat on demand. The other easier method will be to increase the temperature of the smoker to about 176° F (80° C) and wait until the meat’s inside temperature reaches 154-160° F (68-72° C).</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Cooking in Water</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">This is a common, acceptable and professional method of cooking meats and sausages. It is also easier and faster to apply than cooking in the smoker and the meat weight loss is also smaller. Water is brought to the temperature of 158-194° F (70-90° C) and the meats or sausages are immersed in it. For instance, home made hams are poached at 176° F (80° C) and this temperature is maintained until the meat internal temperature reaches 154-160° F (68-72° C). </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Note:</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> according to United Stated Department of Agriculture meats that were not cured and smoked should be cooked to the following temperatures:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Fish should reach 145° F (63° C). </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">All cuts of pork to 160° F (72° C). </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Ground beef, veal and lamb to 160° F (72° C). </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">All poultry should reach a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° F (74° C). </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="5"><span class="calibre_2">Leftovers to 165° F (74° C). </span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Baking in Oven</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Baking in an oven is also an option as long as the temperature can be kept at 200° F (93° C) or less.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Smokehouse</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The simplest smokehouse will be the one that is dedicated to smoking only. The outside temperature will determine whether such a smoker can be used for cold smoking. Any smoking done over an open fire or inside of any simple box or barrel will fall into this category. The design of a smoker remains relatively easy unless we want to use it for baking sausages. In cold climates such an outside smoker will use plenty of fuel unless it is well insulted.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">But why cook a sausage in a smoker? The majority of processed meats are cooked in water or in steam. The design of the smoker becomes very simple if cooking is accomplished in a different appliance.
