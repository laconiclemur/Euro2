<h2 class="h2b" id="page182">FOUGASSE</h2>
<p class="normalla0"><em>This is Provence’s bread, and you can find it in and around most towns or markets in the area</em>. Fougasse <em>is basically the same as Italian</em> focaccia, <em>a plain bread dough enriched with olive oil. The shape, although often in a very abstract way, is meant to resemble a head of wheat. There are many versions: flat and square, thick or thin, flavoured with olives, rosemary, dried tomatoes or anchovies, anything that really bursts with taste. The stuffed version is a great pleasure to make; I am just never sure where to put it in the context of a meal – with drinks, as a starter or a bread on the side. In truth you are probably best tearing off greedy chunks under a tree with a bottle of rosé and nothing to do all afternoon</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 3 MEDIUM-SIZED FOUGASSES</span><br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) strong white flour, plus extra for dusting<br/>
16g (½ oz) fresh yeast<br/>
300ml (10fl oz) lukewarm water<br/>
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br/>
12g (¼ oz) salt</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOUGASSE FARCI</span><br/>
6 preserved artichoke hearts<br/>
9 dried tomatoes<br/>
9 anchovy fillets<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
9 garlic cloves, peeled and blanched once<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) Parmesan, freshly grated<br/>
½ tbsp sea salt flakes or <em>fleur de sel</em></p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 240°C/475°F/Gas 9.</p>
<p class="normala">Sift the flour into a bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water being very careful that it is not too hot, as this will kill the yeast.</p>
<p class="normala">Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the water, yeast and oil. Mix well until you form a dough. Turn it out on to your bench, add the salt and knead for a further 6 or so minutes until it is very smooth. (The salt is added at this stage so that there is absolutely no danger of it killing the yeast.) At this stage place the dough back into the bowl and cover it with a damp tea towel. Leave it in a warm, but not hot, place for an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
<p class="normala">Once this is done knead the dough again to knock out any air bubbles. Separate the dough into three pieces, then with a rolling pin, roll each out to oval shapes about 15cm (6in) long and 8cm (3¼ in) wide, dusting with flour as and when necessary. Slice three deep lines down each on the diagonal or, if feeling very daring, make eight lines to resemble a leaf. Gently place the loaves on to a tray then cover with a cloth and allow to prove for about 30 minutes until they have almost doubled in size. Before baking you can either brush a little olive oil over the top and sprinkle with salt flakes or give a very light dusting of flour through a sieve. Bake in a very hot preheated oven for 15 minutes or until the fougasse sounds hollow when tapped. Transfer it immediately to a rack to cool.</p>
