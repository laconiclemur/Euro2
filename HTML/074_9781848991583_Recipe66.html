<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_105"/><b>Sous-vide Lettuce</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Sheep’s Milk Cheese</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>With this dish, I’m trying to encourage you to cook more salad vegetables, because this is a much-neglected style of cooking. My home-style “vacuumpacked” Little Gem lettuces are topped with a slightly crumbly sheep’s milk cheese, crunchy croutons and a drizzle of olive oil, and are just delicious. Enjoy this recipe as a vegetaian dish with sourdough bread or serve it as an accompaniment to roast pork. If you have a small vacuum-pack machine, follow the instructions in the method, using vacuum bags instead of plastic wrap. Alternatively, you can use small freezer bags with a seal, making sure the air is squeezed out before you close them. You can also cook the lettuce packages in a microwave for just 40 seconds on full power.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes, plus making the croutons</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 20 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 baby Little Gem lettuces or hearts of lettuce, outer leaves removed and quartered lengthwise</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 ounces sheep’s milk cheese, such as Ossau Iraty, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon small Croutons (see <a href="011_9781848991583_Recipe5.html#pageid_18">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put four 8-inch square sheets of plastic wrap on the countertop. Top each sheet with a quartered Little Gem, putting the pieces in a pile in the middle. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the oil over each pile, then season with a little salt and pepper. Tightly wrap the Little Gem in the plastic wrap to make 4 small packages, pressing out any air.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer, with a steamer insert on top. Put the lettuce packages in the steamer, cover and gently steam 12 to 14 minutes until the lettuce quarters are just tender.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Remove the packages from the steamer and unwrap over a small saucepan to catch any juices. Pat the lettuce quarters dry with paper towels, then put them in a broiler pan, arranging the contents of each package closely together so you have four separate portions. Scatter the cheese over the lettuce, then season with more salt and pepper and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Meanwhile, heat the broiler to high. Put the pan of reserved cooking juices over medium-high heat and cook until it reduces by half, then whisk in the remaining oil. Drizzle the sauce over the Little Gems, then put them under the broiler 2 to 3 minutes until the cheese is golden brown and a little puffed up. Sprinkle with the croutons and serve hot.</p>

<h6 class="h6k"><a id="pageid_106"/><b>SOUS-VIDE COOKING</b></h6>
<p class="normal">I am sure everyone is familiar with using <i>sous-vide</i>—a vacuum—as a way of storing food, as we see vacuum-packed food all over the place, from spices and coffee to cured meats and rice. It is a great way of packing food for transport. But, although it has been around for a while now and is used a lot in professional kitchens, you might not be so familiar with cooking <i>sous-vide</i>.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>At The Vineyard</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">In The Vineyard kitchen, we sometimes use this method, and we have a professional vacuum-pack machine that seals the food ready to go in a special water bath. It’s usually a great way of cooking, although I have to confess it has gone wrong once or twice and given us all a good laugh—although laughter is not quite the reaction if it happens in the middle of a busy service! If a bag is not sealed properly—or the plastic wrap isn’t tied securely if you are trying it at home—and no one notices in time, it can cause a mini disaster, and you can find yourself with an empty bag or a chicken breast swimming in water. So just watch those knots and tie them tightly!</p>
<p class="normal1a" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Why would you prepare food this way?</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">So, what are the advantages of cooking in this way? Well, to start with, you can prepare dishes one or two days ahead and keep them refrigerated, or portioned up and frozen ready to cook when you need them. Imagine how useful that would be when you have a party coming up and you can spread the preparations so you have less to do on the day.</p>
<p class="normal">Then there’s the fact that, when prepared this way, the food develops some beautiful flavors as it cooks in its own juices, with all the flavors locked in. As nothing is lost, there’s an intensity of flavor in the finished dish.</p>
<p class="normal">Then we come to temperature, which is critical in <i>sousvide</i> cooking. When you cook <i>sous-vide</i>, you can cook at a low temperature, about 158°F. This is important because meat, in particular, can be adversely affected when cooked at very high temperatures, as the collagen fibers within the meat can become tough. This is less important with fish, but it can still happen. So, to keep the meat tender, it is recommended you cook at less than 158°F. That makes this style of cooking perfect for the cheaper cuts of meat and also for variety meat. Many people don’t like to cook variety meat in case they overcook and ruin it, but with <i>sous-vide</i> cooking that’s not a problem, because the cooking method is so gentle. You’ll be sure to get perfectly tender results every time.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Sous-vide cooking at home</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">So, how can you try <i>sous-vide</i> cooking at home without a professional vacuum-packing machine? I will show you how to cook a chicken breast, and you can use the same procedure for other foods. Just glance through the recipe options in the book that I’ve listed on <a href="057_9781848991583_Recipe50.html#pageid_79">page 107</a> and you’ll see how versatile the technique is.</p>
<p class="normal">Firstly, make sure you use plastic wrap and not wax or parchment paper. Plastic wrap is perfect for cooking, because as it withstands the necessary temperatures,.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Put four layers of plastic wrap on a countertop. Put a boneless chicken breast half in the middle of the plastic wrap, then roll it up tightly, pressing out the air to each side as you roll. Make a knot in one end, then press the air out the other side before you knot that end. This gives you a partial <i>sous-vide.</i></p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Of course, you cannot keep the product as though it had been properly vacuum-packed because you have not created a full vacuum. Therefore, you need to treat the packages as you would any nonvacuumed product and store it properly in the refrigerator or freezer for the recommended time only. If you follow your common sense, you’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent"><a id="pageid_107"/>•  For most <i>sous-vide</i> dishes, there are two alternative cooking methods, boiling and steaming. To boil, place the package in a saucepan large enough to hold it comfortably, then just cover it with water. Put the pan over medium heat and bring the water up to 158°F. Keep it at that temperature for the time indicated in the recipe, which will depend on the size of the portion. A 6-ounce chicken breast will take about 20 minutes; if it is stuffed, it will take 5 to 10 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Alternatively, you can steam the package. Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer, with a steamer insert on top. Put the chicken package in the steamer, cover and cook 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  When the food is ready, just cut off one end of the plastic wrap, push the meat through and pat it dry on paper towels or a clean dish towel.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Then, to regain the crisp skin, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and pan-fry the chicken, skin-side down, for a minute or so until crisp and brown. Finally, serve it with a delicious sauce, or <i>jus.</i></p>
<p class="normal">Just as a reminder, if you only want to prepare the package in advance, make sure you keep it refrigerated and for a maximum of 2 days. Do not cook it in advance.</p>
<p class="normal">Some meats have a stronger texture, and I usually wrap them in plastic wrap in the same way, but then cook them as a confit, in other words in hot fat. This method is suitable for chicken leg meat, or the dark meat from poultry or game birds.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that you understand the technique, I hope you’ll try some of my recipes<i>,</i> such as Sous-Vide Lettuce with Sheep’s Milk Cheese (see <a href="074_9781848991583_Recipe66.html#pageid_105">page 105</a>), Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Cabbage and Chestnuts (see <a href="075_9781848991583_Recipe67.html#pageid_111">page 111</a>), Pork Tenderloin with Mushrooms, Figs and Chestnuts (see <a href="080_9781848991583_Recipe72.html#pageid_118">page 118</a>), Salmon in Cabbage Leaves with Lemon Butter Sauce (see <a href="084_9781848991583_Recipe76.html#pageid_126">page 126</a>), Steamed Cabbage with Pork and Hazelnut Stuffing (see <a href="114_9781848991583_Recipe105.html#pageid_177">page 177</a>) and Pancetta-wrapped Monkfish with Carrot and Mandarin Puree (see <a href="120_9781848991583_Recipe111.html#pageid_186">page 186</a>).</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Enjoy a quail salad—or, perhaps, a poussin</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">Quail is the quickest and easiest option if you want to try cooking sous-vide, and this recipe also works well with poussins, which are available from some supermarkets. This is one example of when it is best to cook the legs as a confit, because the texture of the meat is different.</p>
<p class="normal">Simply wrap two quail legs and two quail breasts separately in plastic wrap, as described in the general instructions on <a href="074_9781848991583_Recipe66.html#pageid_106">page 106</a>. Cook the legs very gently in goose or duck fat 40 minutes, or until the meat is super-tender and falls off the bone. When the legs are almost cooked, steam the breasts very gently about 4 minutes until they are tender and cooked through. You can test if the meat the meat is cooked by piercing the plastic wrap with a sharp knife, and the juices will run clear when it is cooked.</p>
<p class="normal">Once unwrapped, heat a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the breasts, skin-side down, and brown 2 minutes, then turn them over and cook 2 minutes longer. Deglaze the pan with a splash of white wine vinegar and a little salt and pepper, stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom.</p>
<p class="normal">I make a delicious salad to serve with the quail by tossing together a handful arugula leaves, a handful pea shoots and a few Belgian endive leaves. Then I sprinkle some shredded tarragon leaves and a quartered boiled new potato over. That’s just enough per person. Cut the quail legs and the breasts in half, then put them on top of a pile of fresh salad. As an extra bonus, you can finish the dish with a quail egg per portion, boiled for just 2½ minutes so the yolk is perfectly runny.</p>
