<p class="pf">Northern Minnesota is known for its lakes and rivers. Ask anyone about them, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area might be the first name that comes to mind. We never visited the BWCA. It was too far away and summertime was not a time for vacations. There was too much work to do. It wasn’t possible for my parents to say, “We want to take a couple of weeks off for a canoe trip.” What that meant is that we didn’t take vacations, per se. Only when there was a big storm, lightning, thunder, and downpours did we have to (or as us kids would say, “got to”) stay indoors and play games. Those were “vacation” days.</p>
<p>The St. Louis River ran by our farm. We were situated on a bend in the river that had a stretch of rapids where the water wasn’t too deep and it was very cold. To get to the river we had to run down a path through the woods. This was a special treat in the heat of summer. What we called swimming was to find a rock on the bed of the river we could each call our own. If we could stay on that rock without being swept away, we were swimming. The rapids stretched for several hundred feet and the water was about three or four feet deep. A treacherous place, now that I think of it.</p>
<p>When we had a big summer storm, we looked forward to swimming—or what we called swimming—in the warmer water of the creek that fed the river.</p>
<p>It was always fun when we’d have a rainstorm and the water collected in the widened bends and turns of the “creek” that ran to the river from the woods next to our house and through the pasture behind the barn. The water was no more than two feet deep at its deepest point. The water would be muddy but it was warm. A day or so later, when it finally drained down to a trickle, it wasn’t fun to “swim” in anymore.</p>
<p>On one warm summer day after a storm when the creek was swollen, Marion, Leonard, my two little sisters Betty Mae and Lillian, and I were swimming. Marion was showing off, singing her own mantra “sister knows how to swim so sister doesn’t have to worry” as she dog-paddled across the widest point of the creek. It was a warm, muggy day, and in the sun-warmed water she stubbed her foot on a big rock and fell—<i>blub, blub</i>
—into the water. At that point we got together and pulled her back to the muddy shore. Marion never lived down the bragging about her ability to swim.</p>
<p>From the time we were little kids, we associated the idea of swimming with just being in water outdoors—water heated by the sun. So, in my very early years—that was when only Leonard and I were ambulatory kids—swimming meant soaking in a round galvanized tub in sun-warmed water. We could splash all we wanted and we each had our own tub. That was swimming!</p>
