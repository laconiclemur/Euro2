<h2 class="h2b">MILLEFEUILLE AUX FRAISES A LA CREME DE CITRON</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Strawberries and Lemon Curd with Filo Pastry</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Lemons and berries are real symbols of Provence. The big, gnarled, untreated lemons have a tarty fresh look and flavour that perks you up enormously. As for the strawberries, in season, particularly when warm from the sun, they have a corruptingly decadent fragrance. I’ve combined the two here with a little crispy filo to make a dessert that has everything; sweet, sour and crisp. Not only that, you can prepare it all at least 12 hours in advance and just assemble at the last minute</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 sheets of filo pastry<br/>
50g (2oz) unsalted butter, melted<br/>
Icing sugar for dusting</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00a">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">LEMON CURD</span><br/>
1 large egg<br/>
1 large egg yolk<br/>
Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon, about 50ml (2fl oz) juice<br/>
50g (2oz) icing sugar<br/>
50g (2oz) butter</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">THE STRAWBERRIES</span><br/>
450g (1lb) strawberries, stems removed<br/>
100g (3½ oz) icing sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normal1">Double up the sheets of filo pastry so that you have two rectangles of two layers. Brush them well with the melted butter. Cut eight 12 × 6cm (4½ × 2½in) rectangles from the two large rectangles and put them flat on a baking tray. Dredge them with plenty of icing sugar and bake for 6–8 minutes until golden and caramelised on top. Store in a dry place.</p>
<p class="normala">To make the lemon curd mix the eggs and sugar in a thick-bottomed, stainless-steel saucepan. Add the lemon zest, juice and butter and whisk over a medium heat until it thickens to the texture of a thick custard. Transfer the curd to a bowl, put a piece of clingfilm directly on the surface to stop a skin forming and leave it to cool. This can easily be made two days in advance.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut 150g (5oz) of the strawberries into small pieces and put them into a saucepan with the icing sugar and 2 tbs water. Cook this over a low heat for a couple of minutes until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat and simmer for 5 minutes until thick. Leave it to cool for a while, then halve or quarter the remaining strawberries and toss them through it.</p>
<p class="normalaa">Build each <em>millefeuille</em>, first starting with a little lemon curd followed by a filo rectangle, more lemon curd, the strawberries then another filo rectangle. Repeat this once more then make the other three.</p>
