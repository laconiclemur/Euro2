<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_89"/><b>Snail, Fennel</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Almond Casserole</b> <span class="smfont">in</span> <b>Red Wine Sauce</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>You might recall the classic dish of snails with garlic butter, which, when made the correct way, is delicious. Well, this recipe is different, but no less flavorsome. It’s a bit like a boeuf bourguignonne, but with snails, toasted almonds and fennel. You will have to buy some cooked snails, and just make sure you rinse them properly before use. This is delicious served with Rutabaga Boulangère (see <a href="018_9781848991583_Recipe12.html">page 20</a>) or sautéed potatoes with pancetta.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 35 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 pound 2 ounces canned snails, shells discarded</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons dry sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons Burgundy red wine</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups Beef Stock (see <a href="008_9781848991583_Recipe2.html">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 fennel bulbs, outer leaves discarded and fronds reserved, finely sliced using a mandolin, if possible</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 handful slivered almonds, toasted</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">crusty bread, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Rinse the snails in warm water, then tip them onto paper towels, pat them dry and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Melt the butter and half the oil in a nonstick skillet over low heat. Add the shallot and fry slowly 2 minutes, or until it is soft. Pour in the sherry vinegar, turn the heat up to high and deglaze the pan by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom, then cook until the liquid almost evaporates. Add the red wine and cook 3 to 4 minutes longer until it reduces by half. Then add the stock and simmer 10 to 15 minutes until it reduces by two-thirds and the sauce becomes glossy and almost syrupy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan, leave the sauce to one side and keep warm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400°F and bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the sliced fennel and blanch 2 to 3 minutes until slightly soft. Drain and refresh in ice water, then drain again and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Heat the remaining oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the fennel and fry 2 to 3 minutes, stirring, until it is just golden brown. Add the snails and the reserved fennel fronds and fry 2 to 3 minutes longer until everything is just heated through—you don’t want to overcook the snails. Add the toasted slivered almonds and toss to combine. Finally, season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Divide the snails into four small ovenproof dishes or wide ramekins. Spoon the red wine sauce over the top of the snails until they are just coated. Put the dishes in a baking sheet and cook in the oven 4 to 5 minutes until heated through and just bubbling. Serve hot with plenty of crusty bread.</p>
