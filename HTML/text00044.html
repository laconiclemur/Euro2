<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">A Year in Finland</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">A few years after the Pillsbury Bake-Off, in 1960–61, we spent a year in Finland because Dick had applied for and received a student Fulbright. The difference between a student Fulbright and a family grant was that the grant he received was just enough for one person (i.e., the student) to live on. Needless to say, our funds while we were in Finland that year were meager.</p>
<p>Others in the group had enough money to rent rather luxurious apartments in prestigious sections of Helsinki. We rented a one-bedroom apartment on the third floor of a building for retired nurses in a northern suburb called Käpylä. At the time, our daughter Cathy was almost three and our son, Greg, was a year old. Yet I felt privileged to be in the same country that my grandparents had left behind.</p>
<p>The Arctic Circle runs through Finland. When we first arrived in Helsinki, the days seemed the normal length, about the same as what we’d left in Minnesota. But as autumn faded into winter, they quickly became shorter and shorter, and soon it was dark by three in the afternoon. Being a person affected by solar deficiency, I didn’t know what was coming over me. I had never experienced the kind of “sadness” that began to color my days.</p>
<p>To add to the stress, Dick spent every day, all day, at the Geological Survey and the university, leaving me to care for our two children, carrying them both up and down three flights of stairs (the building had no elevator). This was good exercise, but it became a challenge when I had to bring home milk and other groceries. To add to that, the nearest bus stop was six blocks away, so it was a major effort to go to downtown Helsinki. I was very limited in what I was able to do.</p>
<p>Finally, one day out of exasperation, I called the United States Information Service—the organization that had been involved in our orientation—and explained my dilemma. I said that I could speak Finnish and that I could present cooking demonstrations on American foods. I told them I’d be willing to travel, but would need my expenses covered. They jumped on the idea and scheduled me to visit women’s organizations in villages throughout the country. I was to stay in the homes of my sponsors, and my travel expenses would be fully covered.</p>
<p>Wow! The only limitation was that I could travel only on weekends, when Dick’s schedule made it possible for him to stay home with Cathy and Greg.</p>
<p>The foods of America were exotic to Finns at the time. I had received boxes of cake mixes through my connections with Pillsbury. They were a revolutionary idea for Finnish cooks. I made popcorn and impressed them with the “before and after” volume. I cooked hamburgers and made apple pie.</p>
<p>The women I visited belonged to an organization called the Marttaliitto, or the Martha League, which was similar to women’s organizations that in Minnesota were organized by the county agent. They all came into the schoolroom and placed their chairs in a circle. Each woman pulled out knitting or crocheting as she attentively listened to what I had to say. Always willing to share, the women scribbled their recipes on scraps of paper, the backs of envelopes, whatever paper they had on hand. Throughout my visits, I kept asking about Finnish food traditions, about their customs during holidays, and what certain Finnish words meant. These were words my grandmother used, but I wasn’t thinking enough when she was alive to ask what they meant. Words such as <i>rieska</i>
 and <i>laatikko.</i>
 People were ever so willing to give me their recipes; I made notes everywhere I went and collected wonderful information and recipes, all of which eventually provided fodder for my first book, <i>The Finnish Cookbook</i>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Lanttulaatikko (Rutabaga Casserole)</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Cooked and mashed rutabaga, often mixed with mashed potatoes, can be made with either turnips or rutabagas. This dish is not only traditional, but a <i>must</i>
 for the holiday buffet. Home-cured ham is the usual meat for the holidays.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">2 medium rutabagas, peeled and diced, about 6 cups or 3 cups rutabagas and 3 cups diced peeled potatoes</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup dry bread crumbs</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="rpill">3 tablespoons butter</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 2½-quart casserole and set aside.</p>
<p class="rp">Cook the rutabagas or rutabagas and potatoes together in salted water to cover until soft.</p>
<p class="rp">Drain and mash. Soak the bread crumbs in the cream and stir in the nutmeg, salt, and beaten eggs.</p>
<p class="rp">Blend mixture with the mashed rutabagas and potatoes. Turn into the casserole. Dot the top with butter. Bake for 1 hour or until the top is lightly browned.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Swedish Prince’s (Princess) Cake</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Greg had his first birthday on the Swedish ship the M.S. <i>Kungsholm</i>
 on our trip to Finland, and his second on the Norwegian ship <i>Stavangerfjord</i>
 when we returned to the United States. We packed everything we thought we would need for a year into two steamer trunks, four suitcases, and overnight bags—we hadn’t yet learned to travel light. We boarded the <i>Kungsholm</i>
 on the way to Göteborg, Sweden, where we caught a train to Stockholm, and from there a ferry to Helsinki. The journey took lots of strength and energy! In Göteborg, we bought a double stroller to make walking with two little kids easier.</p>
<p class="rp">Greg’s first birthday was August 14, while we were in the mid-Atlantic. The pastry chef baked him a “Prince’s Cake”—a Swedish classic for such celebrations. If Greg had been female, it would have been called a “Princess Cake.” They are exactly the same cake, except for girls the marzipan coating would be tinted pink. The cake is a triple-layered creation with fillings of raspberry jam, pastry cream, and whipped cream, blanketed by a layer of marzipan. It’s not a cake you start making at 4:00 <span class="sm">P.M.</span>
 with plans to serve it by 7:00! I suggest that you make it in stages: first make the pastry cream, because it has to cool; then bake the cake. After it cools, slice it horizontally in three layers. You need to top it with a rounded mound of whipped cream to be authentic, so slip the cake into the freezer for a couple of hours so that it is easier to form the marzipan over the top. Don’t let the daunting list of ingredients overwhelm you—each part of the cake is quite simple to prepare. In the end you have a beautiful cake!</p>
<p class="rph1">Pastry cream</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">2 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">4 egg yolks (save whites for cake)</p>
<p class="rpil">⅓ cup cornstarch</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup softened butter</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Cake</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">2 cups sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">2 eggs plus 4 egg whites (at room temperature)</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup milk</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup (1 stick) butter</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Simple syrup</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">¼ cup water</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon rum if desired</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Filling and marzipan layer</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">2 cups heavy cream, whipped stiff, slightly sweetened if desired</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup seedless raspberry jam</p>
<p class="rpil">3 (7-ounce) packages marzipan</p>
<p class="rpil">Green and red food coloring</p>
<p class="rpill">Powdered sugar for dusting</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">For the pastry cream, heat the milk with half of the sugar to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk the yolks, remaining sugar, and cornstarch. When the milk-and-sugar mixture is hot, whisk a little of it at a time into the yolk mixture. Cook until thickened, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. The cream becomes very thick. Beat in the vanilla and butter. Cool completely.</p>
<p class="rp">For the cake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a 10-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper. Coat with nonstick spray.</p>
<p class="rp">Beat the sugar, eggs, and egg whites together until very light and thick; this takes 5 to 10 minutes at high speed, a task that is most easily done in an electric stand mixer. Stir the flour and baking powder together. Heat the milk, butter, and vanilla extract until the butter is melted and milk is steaming. Blend the flour mixture into the eggs and slowly add the hot milk and butter, whisking constantly until batter is smooth and thick. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes until the cake bounces back when lightly touched in the center and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and dry. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a rack. Remove cake from the pan.</p>
<p class="rp">For the simple syrup, cook the water and sugar until sugar is melted. Cool and add rum, if desired. Refrigerate any remaining syrup.</p>
<p class="rp">Using a long knife, cut the cake horizontally into three even layers. Place the bottom layer, cut side up, on a sheet of waxed paper. Brush with 2 tablespoons simple syrup and spread with about ½ cup of the whipped cream and with the raspberry jam, spreading to the edges of the layer.</p>
<p class="rp">Place what was the top of the cake, cut side up, on top of the whipped cream. Brush with 2 tablespoons simple syrup and spread to the edges with a very thin layer of whipped cream and then with all the cooled pastry cream. Top with the remaining layer of cake, brush with simple syrup, and pile the remaining whipped cream on top of the cake. (At this point you can refrigerate or freeze the cake to top with the marzipan blanket later.)</p>
<p class="rp">For the marzipan layer, soften the marzipan and reserve a golf ball–sized portion and set aside. Cut remaining mixture into pieces and knead about half with your hands until pliable, working in green food coloring. (This is most easily done in the food processor with the steel blade in place.) Roll out between sheets of plastic wrap to make a 16-inch circle. Dust with powdered sugar if desired. Transfer marzipan onto the cake by rolling it up on the rolling pin and then unrolling it over the cake. Smooth out with your hands, covering the cake completely; trim off excess marzipan. Color the uncolored golf ball–sized portion with red food coloring, roll it out into a strip, trim the edges, and roll up to resemble a rose. Place on the cake. You can refrigerate the cake up to 3 days before serving.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 12 servings</p>
