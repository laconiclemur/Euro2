 BLOODY MARY CASHEWS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0000781">
<em>I don’t actually drink alcohol, so it may come as a surprise to see one of my recipes labelled ‘Bloody Mary’. But the fact I don’t drink doesn’t take away my curiosity for the flavours used in cocktails and what makes them taste the way they do, and I enjoy nothing better than inventing new food-drink hybrids! Bloody Mary is a combination of sweet and savoury with a hint of chilli. I have had a virgin version of the classic and liked it a lot, so here I have tried to recreate the flavour in my party cashews.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180° fan/gas 5. Have a large baking tray ready.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000789">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Mix the paprika, lime zest and celery salt in a small bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000790">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Put the egg whites into a large bowl and whisk for a few minutes by hand, until the mixture is light and frothy.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000791">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Add the nuts to the bowl of egg-white and mix through, making sure the nuts are covered with the egg white mixture. This acts as a glue for the spices to stick to.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000792">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Spread the cashews on the baking tray. Sprinkle over all the spice mixture, then, using a clean spoon, mix the nuts around so they are completely coated.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000793">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Bake in the oven for 10–12 minutes, making sure to give them a stir halfway through. Keep a close eye on them so they don’t catch. You will know they are ready when the spices on the nuts are dry to the touch.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000794">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Take the cashews out of the oven and leave to cool on the tray. Once completely cool, put them into a large bowl or smaller bowls to serve.</p>
