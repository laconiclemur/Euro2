<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">CHILLED TOMATO AND PEPPER SOUP</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">In summer you will find a bottle of gazpacho chilling in the fridge of pretty much every Spanish kitchen. I love mixing it up a bit – strawberries, raspberries, beetroot, cherries and watermelon are all things that have found their way into my gazpacho at one time or another. Try it, you will see what I mean!</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 6</p>

<p class="recipe-list">SALT</p>
<p class="recipe-list">ICE CUBES, CROUTONS AND OLIVE OIL, TO GARNISH</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Place all the prepared vegetables in a food processor or blender, reserving a little of the red and green pepper, cucumber and onion for the garnish. Add the cumin, sherry vinegar, bread, olive oil and about 200 ml of water. Add a pinch of salt and blend until smooth.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary. If you don’t like bits in your gazpacho you can pass through a sieve at this stage. Serve with a few ice cubes and garnish with the reserved pepper and cucumber, croutons and a few drops of olive oil.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Gazpacho tastes so much better when prepared in advance – the night before if possible. If you do want to sieve it, I recommend you wait until just before serving as the flavour will be much more intense if it has been left overnight with all the bits in.</p>

<p class="chap-opener">This tuna and potato stew is one of my favourites. It comes from the Basque country in northern Spain, from where, they say, the best food in the world comes. Traditionally this would be made with Spanish dried peppers called <span class="bold-italic">pimientos choriceros</span>, but they can be hard to find outside Spain, so my version uses hot pimentón and saffron – the result is as good, if not better, my friends say.</p>

<p class="recipe-head1" id="note9">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Spanish tuna fishing is a tradition that goes back hundreds of years, when fishermen from the Basque country and Cantabria would sail out into the Bay of Biscay and use fishing rods to catch bonito tuna one by one. Bonito is a world apart from regular tuna – it has a rich flavour and soft texture. It is usually preserved in oil and can be found in jars in good supermarkets and specialist food shops.</p>
