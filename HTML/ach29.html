<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_56"/><a id="ach29"/>summer vegetable soup</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">minestra estiva</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This soup makes for a refreshing lunchtime meal on a hot summer day. Accompanied by bread, cheese, and olives, it may be served hot or cold and will keep in the refrigerator for three or four days. I like to drizzle a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil over each portion just before serving to enhance the flavor.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>

<p class="noindenta">Place a large flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and the onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 7 minutes. Stir in the potato, parsley, and basil and cook, stirring occasionally, to season the vegetables with the herbs, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato and 3 cups of the stock or water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer to warm through, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, peas, and asparagus along with the remaining 3 cups stock or water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with the lid slightly askew and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer to heat through and soften the <a id="page_57"/>vegetables, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow to cool and serve at room temperature, or keep in the refrigerator for up to four days.</p>
