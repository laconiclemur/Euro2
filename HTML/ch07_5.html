<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">‘THE’ PAELLA</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This famous Spanish dish is our equivalent of the Sunday roast, a dish that brings friends and family together. If the weather allows we cook it on an open fire – you are rewarded with an amazing smoky aroma. This paella recipe is the fruit both of my own investigations and those of top Valencian chefs and grandmothers. Follow this recipe and I guarantee you will soon be tasting the best paella. <span class="bold-italic">Buen provecho</span>!</p>

<p class="recipe-list">500 G SPANISH RICE, SUCH AS CALASPARRA OR BOMBA</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 SPRIG OF ROSEMARY</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Wrap the saffron in foil and toast it for 30 seconds on each side in a paella pan over a medium heat. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Increase the heat to the maximum and season around the edges of the pan with the table salt. Wait until the pan is really hot and then drizzle with the olive oil. It should start smoking immediately; at this point throw in the pieces of chicken and rabbit (the meat needs to absorb the salt at this early stage). Fry the meat until nicely browned on all sides (this will add to the flavour of the paella).</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Add the runner beans and broad beans and stir together for 1 minute before adding the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add the grated tomatoes (discarding the skin), pimentón and toasted saffron. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring all the time, until you can see that the tomatoes have lost most of the juice and changed colour.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg167"/><span class="no">4</span> Add the water or chicken stock and leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the bits of caramelized chicken and vegetable on the bottom of the pan to dissolve so you get a rich stock. If you use chicken stock instead of water you will only need to simmer for 5 minutes. Check the seasoning but bear in mind that the rice will absorb a lot of saltiness, so it’s okay if it tastes quite salty at this stage.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Cut the artichokes into quarters and add to the pan – if you add them any earlier the entire paella will turn dark in colour. Add the rice, spreading it evenly over the paella pan and stir just once. Cook on the highest heat for about 10–12 minutes before reducing the heat right down and cooking for a further 5–7 minutes. Once you have added the rice and given it a good stir you shouldn’t touch the pan with a spoon again. You need to keep the film that develops on the top of the stock from breaking, otherwise the steam will escape and the rice won’t cook evenly.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">6</span> When the water is at a lower level than the rice itself, add the rosemary sprig. If the layer of rice on the top starts to look a bit crispy, cover the paella pan with a layer of newspaper for the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will help to steam the grains on top while the bottom gets crispy. In Spain this crispy bottom layer, the ‘socarrat’, is the most valuable part of the paella. Once the paella is finished it should look like a completely flat layer of rice. Leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">TIP</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">If you have some rice left in the paella pan, remove it to a plate otherwise it will take on a metallic taste.</p>
<p class="recipe-para">If you want to make a good paella, you need to follow a few basic rules:</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Use Spanish ingredients – they are just too good not to be used in this case. If you can, use saffron from La Mancha (it’s the best in the world), Spanish olive oil and calasparra or bomba rice.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Get yourself a good paella pan – it should be wide and flat so that the rice cooks in a thin layer. Never use deep pans.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Never stir the rice. Ever! You will make the rice release starch and it will become too stodgy. At the end of the cooking time the rice should be light, soft and not sticky.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Let it rest for 5 minutes at the end of the cooking time. The rice should not be soupy so give it a chance to absorb any trapped steam.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Follow the recipe!</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Start by making the stock. Peel the prawns and remove the heads. Remove the lobster claws and keep intact. Crack open the bodies to remove the tail meat and chop roughly. Set the peeled prawns, lobster tail meat and claws aside. Heat the oil in a large, wide pot and add the lobster and prawn shells and heads and brown for 5 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, leek, garlic cloves, bay leaf and peppercorns. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes until golden. Add the chopped tomato and cook for 1 minute before adding the brandy and white wine. Boil for a couple of minutes so that the alcohol evaporates. Use a large spoon to squeeze the heads of the shellfish (to release all the juices) and then add 4 litres of hot water. Bring to the boil, skim the froth from the top and let it simmer for around 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Heat the olive oil in a large, wide pan and add the salt and chopped squid. The squid will release liquid that needs to evaporate before it can start frying and sticking to the bottom of the pan (this is what gives the dish its flavour). Take care as the hot squid can explode in the pan. When the squid starts to ‘pop’ add the chopped peppers and stir for 5 minutes. Then add the garlic and fry for 3 minutes. Follow with the pimentón, toasted saffron, crushed ñora (if using) and tomatoes and cook for 2–3 minutes until the tomatoes have reduced down a bit.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg169"/><span class="no">3</span> Strain the fish stock, add 3 litres to the pan and boil for 5 minutes before adding the rice. Cook over a high heat for 14 minutes, giving it a gentle stir every 5 minutes to make sure it’s not burning on the bottom of the pan. Add the lobster claws, peeled prawns and chopped lobster tails to the pan and give it another gentle stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning. After a further 3 minutes, everything should be cooked to perfection.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> The end dish should look yellowish from the saffron and pimentón, but slightly soupy and with lots of shellfish bits floating around. Serve in a soup plate and enjoy.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1" id="note10">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Toasting saffron releases its glorious fragrance. Simply wrap the saffron in foil and use tongs to hold the parcel over an open flame on the hob for just 2 seconds on each side, flipping each side 5 times (10 seconds in total).</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> First, make the stock. Heat the olive oil in a large pot and fry the prawn heads and shells over a high heat for a few minutes. Add the chopped leek and head of garlic and continue to cook for a few minutes until everything has a good golden colour. Add the brandy and quickly flambé by setting light to the pan with a lighter or some long matches. Add the white wine and cook until it has reduced by half, then add 2.5 litres of water and bring back to the boil. Boil for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and use a hand blender to purée until smooth. Pass through a sieve and keep hot until needed.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Place a large, heavy-based pot or dish (a deep paella pan is ideal) over the highest heat. When it is searing hot, add the olive oil, salt and squid – the squid will release a lot of liquid which needs to evaporate. Once that happens it will start frying and sticking to the bottom of the pan. This part of the process is very important as it will be pure concentrated flavour, but be careful as the squid tends to explode! Keep scraping the bottom of the pan to remove any squid that is sticking so that it doesn’t burn.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Once the squid is golden add the peppers and onions and cook for 5 minutes until they are golden brown. Add the garlic and after a couple of minutes add the sweet pimentón and saffron – keep stirring all the time as these two ingredients are very delicate and could burn in a matter of seconds. After 15 seconds add the squid ink and tomato and cook until the liquid has reduced by half.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Add the rice and stir through for a couple of minutes before adding the hot fish stock. Cook, stirring at all times, until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. This should take about 15–18 minutes but check the rice packet instructions. Keep stirring to stop the rice sticking and burning on the bottom and so that the rice develops a really nice consistency. Four minutes before the end of the cooking time, add the peeled prawns. Serve as soon as the rice is cooked – this dish waits for no man!</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">TIP</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">I love to serve this rice with a dollop of alioli (see <a href="ch02.html#pg44">here</a>).</p>
<p class="recipe-head1" id="note11">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Calasparra and bomba are varieties of short-grain rice that are perfect for this dish but they are not cheap. The reason Spanish rice is the most expensive is because it is the best. Well, I would say that, I know, but the reason it is the best is because it absorbs more water than any other type of rice in the world without losing its texture. The more stock the rice absorbs, the more flavour the dish will have. Paella isn’t our most famous dish for nothing!</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">PAELLA WITH PASTA</h2>
<p class="chap-opener1">Fideuà is essentially paella made with pasta instead of rice. Like paella it should be cooked in a big paella pan so if you’re cooking for large numbers it’s almost impossible to cook paella in an average kitchen because of the size of the pan. The best way to cook paella is outside on an open fire. However, I promise you that this recipe works just fine in a normal frying pan, but only if you cook it for no more than three people, even better if you are just cooking for two. Although I’m a professional chef, I’m also a dedicated home cook so I know all the tricks and shortcuts.</p>

Squid can be very temperamental as it releases a lot of water when you start cooking it so it tends to explode in the pan. It’s fair to say this bit is a tiny bit dangerous. I recommend you hold a pan lid over the pan, so that the steam can still escape, and stand back. Give it a quick stir, half cover with the lid and leave to cook for a couple more minutes. Don’t scrape the bottom of the pan, as that sticky layer on the bottom is essential for making a rich stock.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">RICE WITH SAUSAGE AND RABBIT</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This rice dish from Catalonia was one of the first dishes I learned on the traditional Spanish cookery course I did at the age of 16 and it is still a favourite. Ideally use a large ovenproof terracotta or clay pot.</p>

<p class="recipe-list">1 TABLESPOON SALT</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof casserole dish or pan (ideally a terracotta dish). Add the garlic cloves and almonds and fry for a couple of minutes until golden. Remove from the pan and blend with the saffron, thyme and tomatoes, using a pestle and mortar or stick blender, until you have a smooth purée. Set aside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Season the rabbit pieces all over with salt and add to the pan with the white sausage. Fry over a high heat until dark golden, then add the onion and cook, stirring for 5 minutes. Cut any large mushrooms into pieces and add to the pan and sauté for a further 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> By now the meat and onion should be fairly brown. Add the blended paste and cook, stirring, for 3–4 minutes; then add 1.5 litres of water.

<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list85"><a id="pg179"/>LENTEJAS ESTOFADAS</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">LENTIL STEW</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This recipe for braised lentils is real comfort food. It has a bit of everything – a warming liquid, flavoursome meats and healthy vegetables. Pulses are big in Spain and there are several varieties but to me, pardina lentils, with their distinct nutty flavour, are the best. If you can’t get hold of them, use puy lentils.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Heat the olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat and add the garlic cloves. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook for about 7 minutes or until the onion is light golden. Then add the chorizo, panceta curada, bay leaf, thyme, salt, pepper, cumin seeds and clove. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, and then add the pimentón. Stir quickly so that it doesn’t burn.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Pour in the red wine and cook until the liquid has all but evaporated. Now add 1 litre of cold water, the stock cube and the lentils (always add lentils to cold, not boiling, water or they will not cook properly).</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Bring to the boil and leave to simmer for about 40 minutes or until the lentils are tender (there is nothing worse than undercooked lentils). Season with salt and pepper and enjoy.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">In Spain we would add a ham bone – or even a morcilla de Burgos – to the lentils to intensify the flavour.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list86"><a id="pg180"/>FABADA ASTURIANA</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">ASTURIAN BEAN STEW</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This cured meat and white bean stew must be one of Spain’s most famous dishes and yet it is one of the most simple. The key to this recipe is the ingredients, which need to be from Asturias (otherwise it just won’t be the same). Fabes are fat, white beans which cook beautifully without disintegrating – if you can’t get hold of them you could use large lima beans or butter beans – but don’t say that I said so…</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 5 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 3 HOURS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">500 G FABES BEANS, OR LARGE BUTTER BEANS, SOAKED OVERNIGHT IN COLD WATER</p>

<p class="recipe-list">1 GARLIC CLOVE, CRUSHED WITH SKIN ON</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Drain the beans and meat and place in a large, heavy-based pan or casserole dish along with all the remaining ingredients. Cover with cold water, approximately 3 litres, and place over a high heat.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> As the liquid starts to come to the boil, scum will start to form on the surface; skim it away using a spoon or sieve. Skim any fat from the surface as well.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> When the water starts to boil, add a long drizzle of cold water to the pan – this is to stop the skin of the beans from splitting. Repeat this technique twice more and then leave to simmer for about 3 hours, skimming the surface from time to time to remove any impurities.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> After 3 hours you should have a thick, flavoursome bean stew. If the liquid does not look thick, remove the onion and blend with a little of the cooking liquid before returning to the pan. If you need to add more liquid to the pan during cooking, add boiling water, not cold.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> To serve, chop the meats into pieces, give it a good stir and serve the stew in big bowls.</p>
