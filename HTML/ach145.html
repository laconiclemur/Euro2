<p class="author1"><span class="txit">spezzato di pollo “scappinello”</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Serve a soup, such as minestrone, or a traditional <span class="txit">antipasti</span> platter of cheeses, olives, and salami as a first course before this hearty dish. Transfer the roasted meats and vegetables to a large serving platter, place in the center of the table along with a loaf of country bread, and allow everyone to serve himself. The chicken, sausages, onions, and peppers may be prepared several hours in advance. Toss with the potatoes and herbs just before baking.</p>
