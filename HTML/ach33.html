<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_64"/><a id="ach33"/>grace’s chicken soup with mozzarella</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">zuppa di pollo con mozzarella alla grazia</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe is named for my Aunt Grace, my mother’s sister, who created this variation based on my grandmother’s original chicken soup recipe. This tasty soup is a meal in itself when served with a slice of crusty bread. For this recipe, you can use homemade broth (see <a class="nounder" href="ach27.html#page_52">Chicken Soup with Tiny Chicken Meatballs</a>) or you can substitute a store-bought broth. These days there are several excellent varieties available—I always select the organic brands sold at my local supermarket. The chicken meatballs called for in this recipe are optional—the soup is very tasty prepared either way.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 small heads escarole, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">7 cups chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 whole chicken breast, bone in, skin removed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">20 small <a class="nounder" href="ach27.html#page_52">chicken meatballs</a></span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup grated mozzarella cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Blanch the escarole until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring 3 cups of the chicken broth to a gentle boil in a large saucepan. Add the chicken breast, cover, and poach until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Skim off and discard any foam that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Add the meatballs to the chicken broth and poach until cooked through, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Strain the chicken broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a large saucepan or mixing bowl, add the remaining 4 cups broth, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Shred the chicken meat into bite-size pieces and set aside, discarding the bone.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_65"/><span class="red">6.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Pour <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the chicken broth into a small casserole or soufflé dish. Layer one quarter of the escarole over the broth. Add one quarter of the meatballs, one quarter of the shredded chicken, 1 cup of the broth, one quarter of the mozzarella, and 1 tablespoon of the pecorino Romano cheese. Top with another quarter of the escarole and continue to layer the ingredients, ending with mozzarella and pecorino Romano cheese. Pour the beaten egg over the top. Bake until the cheese has melted and the broth is heated through, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
