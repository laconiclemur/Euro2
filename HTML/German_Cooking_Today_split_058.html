Poultry is cooked when the juices that run out are colourless and the legs separate easily from the body. A meat thermometer can be used to check the temperature at the centre of the chicken. When measuring the temperature in this way, be careful not to position the thermometer too close to a bone because this would falsify the result. </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Chicken</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">

</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> All of the more common kinds of poultry are also sold as pieces, fresh, chilled or deepfrozen. You can buy pieces separately, such as a halfbreast, breast fillet (escalope, only from chicken and turkey), leg (including the thigh and lower leg), thigh, lower leg and wing. The breast and leg have the most meat but they are also the most expensive. The breast meat of chicken and turkey can also be served as thin strips or slices or used as a basis for oriental dishes.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparation</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Fresh poultry should be put in the refrigerator as soon as possible after purchase. When buying frozen poultry to be stored in the freezer at home, make sure that it thaws as little as possible on the way home. Putting the poultry in a cool bag while transporting it is recommended. When you get home the poultry should be put in the freezer immediately.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Freezing</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> When deep-freezing fresh poultry yourself, there are a few rules to be observed:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • The poultry must be packed with great care and the freezer bag must not be damaged so that freezer burn does not occur.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Freeze the poultry in such a way that it freezes to the centre as quickly as possible. This is because if the freezing process is too slow, large ice crystal will develop which will damage the cellular structure of the meat; the meat will then lose much of its juice during thawing and become tough as a result.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Defrosting</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">Deep-frozen poultry should be defrosted slowly (preferably in a refrigerator but otherwise at room temperature) so as not to damage the cell structure which would toughen the meat.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Completely remove the packaging and throw it away.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Place the poultry in a metal sieve inside a container, or in a large bowl on top of an inverted soup plate so that the liquid produced while the poultry is defrosting can flow away (the poultry must not be in contact with that liquid).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • During the defrosting process the container should be covered with a lid, plate, aluminium foil or clingfilm.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Throw away the water resulting from the defrosting and make sure that no other food comes into contact with that liquid (because of the risk of salmonella).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Finally, wash your hands, the work surfaces and the dishes used.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Jointing</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This refers to the cutting up of poultry into pieces, which is done so that the various pieces which require different cooking times can be cooked properly. A leg, for instance, needs to cook longer than breast meat.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> For example, a chicken:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Place the prepared chicken on its back and cut off the legs and wings with a sharp knife.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut the breast meat along the breastbone as far down as the bone, cutting the breastbone with poultry shears.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut the back along the backbone (use poultry shears), cut out the backbone and halve the breast.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut the legs at the joint using a knife or poultry shears.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Dressing</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">When poultry is to be cooked whole, all the protruding parts, such as the legs and the wings, must be tied close to the body with kitchen string to prevent them from drying out.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Method:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Place the prepared poultry on its back, bend the tips of the wings towards the back and slide under the body. If the tips of the wings have been cut off, tie the wings together under the body with string.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Tie the legs together with string, cross-wise or all around.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Stuffing</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Large birds such as turkeys and geese are particularly suited for stuffing. The stuffing is then served as an accompaniment to the meat, which is also more aromatic as a result.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Method:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Place the prepared fowl on its back.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Put the stuffing in the abdominal cavity.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Sew up the opening with string or secure with wooden cocktail sticks and tie crossways with string.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Carving</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">Carving is the process of cutting up the cooked fowl into individual servings.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Method:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut off the legs. With a sharp carving knife, make a cut into the meat as far as the joint, twist the joint slightly and cut through the tendons.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut off the wings with a sharp knife, then cut at the joints.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Loosen the breast meat on both sides of the bone using a knife and slice into portions.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Arrange the meat on a previously warmed dish.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_58"></div>
