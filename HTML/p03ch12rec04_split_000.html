<p class="summary1">Nostalgia in Spain has a smell: it is the smell of chorizo hanging in attics and kitchens. The taste and aroma of a piece of chorizo or <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (blood sausage) evoke powerful ancestral and family memories of the day of the <span class="italic">matanza</span>, when the pig was killed and the entire family—father, mother, uncles, aunts, grandmothers, and grandfathers—had a part to play in the preparation of the hams and sausages for drying. They cut the pig’s throat, drained the blood into a bucket, and salted the hams; they chopped the fat and the rest of the meat and mixed in seasonings for sausages. They washed and scrubbed the intestines, cut them, stuffed them, and tied them. It was hard work, but there was bonding and laughing, and a lavish feast at the end, when the offal was eaten. The cured hams were a luxury that could be used as payment for the doctor or midwife, but the sausages were for the family. For some, these sausages were the only source of meat. Today the ritual of the family <span class="italic">matanza</span> is in decline, partly because of new hygiene laws that require a veterinarian to test the health of a pig before it can be eaten.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p506.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="summary">Every region has its own ways of making sausages that have been passed down in families for centuries; Catalonia alone has seventeen special varieties and more subvarieties. Now most sausages are mass-produced in factories, with curing plants where thousands of them hang from rafters like stalactites in musty caves. But there are still family-run artisan concerns that use traditional methods and do not compromise on quality, and some butchers still make their own sausages.</p>
<p class="summary">Ana Isabel Lozano, a young woman who lives in Madrid, wrote to me that her family continues to make chorizo and other sausages even though they no longer live in the country or keep a pig. They buy a whole pig from the butcher and have it cut up. They give away half the meat to friends, and the rest they eat throughout the year, some of it from the freezer. They prepare chorizo and other sausages the way her grandmother did and make enough so that they can have sausage to put into all kinds of dishes throughout the year. They make it <span class="italic">a ojo</span>, by eye, or according to taste. They grind the meat in a food processor with fat and flavorings until it acquires a homogenous reddish color. They fry a little and taste it to see if there is enough salt and <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (paprika) to preserve it, then stuff it into pig’s intestines that they buy from specialty shops. At teatime, they cut semi-cured sausages into slices, cook them in the microwave, and eat them on bread.</p>
<p class="summary">Our chances of finding artisanal Spanish sausages are very small at the moment, but hopefully that will improve. In the meantime, there are acceptable mass-produced ones.</p>
<p class="summary">Here are the main types of sausages:</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Chorizo</span> is a dry-cured sausage made simply with chopped pork and pork fat, seasoned with salt, garlic, and <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, which gives it a reddish color and distinctive flavor. There are hundreds of regional varieties—long or mini links, thin or thick, or in the shape of a horseshoe; with more or less fat, and more or less garlic; coarse or fine; with sweet <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> or hot <span class="italic">pimentón picante</span>; smoked or unsmoked; and with additional herbs or other seasonings. <span class="italic">Chorizo blanco</span> is made without <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. Hard, fully cured chorizos are ready to eat, sliced for an appetizer or incorporated into a dish. Soft, semi-cured chorizos must be cooked. They can be grilled or fried, whole or sliced. They can also be cooked in wine or hard cider (see page 152). Try this—it is very good.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Lomo embuchado</span> is pork loin that is trimmed of fat, salted and washed, and marinated in a paste of <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, garlic, oregano, and olive oil (sometimes with wine). Then it is encased in a large sausage skin and air-dried. When it is made from ibérico de bellota pork, it is exquisite.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Longaniza</span> is a thin sausage, from Navarre and Aragon, which is made from ground and marinated pork. It is fried or grilled.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Salchicha</span> (<span class="italic">botifarra</span> in Catalan) is fresh pork sausage seasoned only with salt and pepper. Catalonia’s <span class="italic">botifarra dolça</span>, an unusual sweet pork sausage cured with sugar instead of salt and flavored with cinnamon and grated lemon zest, is eaten as dessert with fried or toasted sweet bread.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Salchichón</span> is like salami; there are many versions across Spain. The Catalan town Vic, north of Barcelona, once the venue of an important pig market, is the charcuterie capital of Spain; one of its specialties is <span class="italic">salchichón</span>. There is no <span class="italic">pimentón</span> in their sausage, only salt and pepper; one variety contains wine. A thin one called fuet is famous.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Morcilla</span> is blood sausage, made with pig’s blood and usually also bread. In Burgos, León, and Valladolid, <span class="italic">morcilla</span> includes rice and onions. In Asturias, it is smoked and peppery. In Catalonia, <span class="italic">morcilla</span> is called <span class="italic">botifarra negra</span>; when it is made with rice and spices, it is called <span class="italic">botifarra negra d’arròs</span>. The Majorcan <span class="italic">botifarron</span>, which contains meat and is spiced with cinnamon, fennel seeds, and black pepper, is precooked. In Tolosa, in the Basque Country, the morcilla includes minced leeks. In León, there is a smoked blood sausage with bread crumbs and onions. Other versions include pine nuts and flavorings such as nutmeg, oregano, or <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. A sweet <span class="italic">morcilla dulce</span> of La Rioja is flavored with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, aniseed, and black pepper. A <span class="italic">morcilla</span> from Ronda in Málaga is flavored with cloves, oregano, cumin, coriander, and pepper.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• <span class="italic">Sobrasada</span>, a specialty of Majorca, is a sweetish, peppery, spreadable red paste in a sausage casing: a mix of pork, creamy pork fat, salt, and <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. There are some inferior commercial varieties, but the good ones are something to discover. The best is the <span class="italic">sobrasada de Mallorca de cerdo negro</span>, made from the native black pigs (not Ibérico) with large floppy ears that roam free and are fattened in their last three months on figs, legumes, and barley.</p>
