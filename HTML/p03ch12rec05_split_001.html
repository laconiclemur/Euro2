<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">On our way to Maracaibo, the best restaurant in Segovia, Ana Lorente, of the wine magazine</span> Opus Wine <span class="italic">(see page 582), took Alicia and me to visit the Palacio Real de la Granja de San Ildefonso, in the nearby hills, where the most famous beans of Spain, the</span> judiones de la granja<span class="italic">, are from. The palace is like a little Versailles. It was built by Philip V, grandson of Louis XIV of France, and it was the summer residence of the Bourbon kings in the eighteenth century. They came there with their court, cavalry, servants, and cooks. Today, in the tourist shops around the palace, they sell the large oval cream-colored beans, which have a delicious nutty flavor and a buttery texture. The name</span> de la granja <span class="italic">(from the farm) comes from the farm that was run by the monks from whom the king bought the site. The monks planted the beans, and the gardeners at the palace continued to grow them to feed the horses. I got this recipe from Maracaibo. The pig’s ear and foot give the dish a rich gelatinous quality. It is worth making for a lot of people.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 12</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pig’s ear</p>
<p class="qun">1 pig’s foot (cut in half)</p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds <span class="italic">judiones de la granja</span> or other large white beans, soaked (see Soaking Beans, page 487)</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound pancetta or slab bacon, in one piece</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound semi-cured chorizos</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound <span class="italic">morcillas</span> (Spanish blood sausage)</p>
<p class="qun1">Extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="recsum">Singe any remaining hairs, and scrub the pig’s ear and foot under cold running water; then boil them in water for 20 minutes. Drain.</p>
<p class="summary">Drain the beans, put them in a large pot, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, removing any scum, then put in the pig’s ear and foot, pancetta or bacon, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Simmer, covered, over low heat, until tender, adding cold water from time to time to keep the beans covered. Once the beans have begun to soften, add some salt.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Judiones de la granja</span> need 2½ to 3 hours to become very tender. (Other beans would need less time, so if you use other beans, boil the pig’s ear and foot in the water for 1 to 1½ hours before adding them with some of their cooking water to the beans at the start of cooking.) Cook the chorizos in a pan of boiling water for 30 minutes. Boil the <span class="italic">morcillas</span> in another pan for 10 minutes—no longer, or they may burst. Drain the sausages and cut them into thick slices.</p>
<p class="summary">Add them to the beans to heat through. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil.</p>
