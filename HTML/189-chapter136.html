<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This rich, legendary Spanish dish hails from Extremadura and Andalucía (especially around Córdoba). It’s bony and requires hours of braising, but the fatty meat becomes incredibly tender and the sauce velvety and almost decadently rich.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     The sauce can be passed through a food mill before serving, but after so many hours of braising, it is not really mandatory. Serve the oxtails with Puréed Potatoes with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil <a href="83-chapter58.html#page_117"><span class="red">(page 117)</span></a>.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 POUNDS/1.8 KG OXTAILS</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR FOR DREDGING</li>
<li>2 LEEKS, WHITE AND TENDER GREEN PARTS ONLY, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>1 ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>1 CARROT, CHOPPED</li>
<li>3 GARLIC CLOVES, CHOPPED</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML BRANDY, COGNAC, OR OLOROSO SHERRY</li>
<li>2 CUPS/480 ML RED WINE</li>
<li>2 PINCHES FINELY CHOPPED FRESH THYME</li>
<li>1 BAY LEAF</li>
<li>PINCH FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEG</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Ask your butcher to cut the oxtails into 1½&gt;- to 2-inch/4- or 5-cm sections, separated at the joints so that the bones don’t splinter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the oxtails with salt and pepper and lightly dredge in the flour, shaking off the excess. Working in single-layer batches that don’t crowd the pan, brown the oxtails, turning as needed, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer to a platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Add the leeks, onion, carrot, and garlic to the cazuela and cook until the leeks and onion are tender, about 10 minutes. Pour in the brandy and, as the alcohol burns off, return the oxtails to the pan. Pour in the wine and 3 cups/720 ml water. Add the thyme, bay leaf, and nutmeg. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and simmer uncovered until the meat is very tender and comes away from the bone in whole pieces without breaking, 3 to 4 hours. Add more water as needed to keep the sauce moist and loose.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Remove the pieces of oxtail and pass the sauce through a food mill, if desired. Return the sauce to the pan along with the oxtails, and loosen with a touch of water if necessary. Reheat the sauce and oxtails until very hot. Serve immediately.</p>
