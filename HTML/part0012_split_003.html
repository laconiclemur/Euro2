  <h3 class="h3a">Venetian pot roast</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This classic Venetian pot-roast, traditionally made with horsemeat, is slow-cooking at its best; the meat is left to marinate overnight in vinegar and spices before being slow-cooked with a little white wine, Marsala and the spices from the marinade. The end result is very tender beef with the aromatic flavour of the spices. Carve fairly thick slices, otherwise the beef will fall apart. Serve with runny polenta (cornmeal) for a hearty Venetian meal.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1.5kg/3lb 5oz topside of beef</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp Marsala wine</p>

  <p class="ing">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup <a href="part0007_split_005.html#pg21" class="calibre1">beef stock</a> or <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a></p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups red wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, left whole</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the marinade ingredients, pour over the beef, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge to marinate overnight.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat from the marinade, pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside. Strain the marinade, reserving the vegetables and herbs. Cut a piece of greaseproof (waxed) paper slightly larger than the diameter of your cooking pot and lightly grease.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a flameproof pot, add the onion and the vegetables from the marinade and sweat on a medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Add the beef and brown well all over; season with salt and pepper. Add the wine, Marsala and stock, reduce the heat, then cover with the greaseproof paper and the lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2½ hours.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove the meat and set aside on a board. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve into a small pan and, using a small whisk, beat the sauce so it is well amalgamated. Carve the meat into thick slices, pour over the sauce and serve with runny polenta.</p>
