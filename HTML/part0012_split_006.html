  <p class="chap-para">This classic Piemontese dish, made with the region’s famous Barolo wine, is fit for a king. It can, of course, be made with other, less expensive, full-bodied red wines, but for a special occasion I like to use Barolo. The meat is first marinated overnight with vegetables, herbs and wine before being slow-cooked with the same ingredients, giving the meat its richness. Delicious served with polenta (cornmeal), as is traditional in Piedmont, and also good with mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz shoulder/blade or topside of beef</p>

  <p class="ing1">4tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz/2 tbsp butter</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 celery stalks, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 bottle of Barolo wine</p>

  <p class="para">Gently dry the beef with kitchen paper, then put it in a bowl together with all the marinade ingredients. Cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge for 12 hours or overnight.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat from the marinade and pat dry with kitchen paper. Strain the marinade, reserving the liquid, vegetables and herbs.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the oil and butter in a large flameproof pot, add the beef and brown well all over. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, add the vegetables and herbs from the marinade and sweat on a medium heat for about 3 minutes. Return the meat to the pan, add some salt and pepper and cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes. Increase the heat, add the wine from the marinade and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, partially cover with a lid and cook gently for 2½ hours, until the meat is tender, turning the meat over from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat and set aside. Increase the heat and cook the sauce for about 5 minutes, until it has reduced slightly. Slice the meat and serve with the vegetables and sauce, with polenta or mashed potatoes.</p>

    <p class="box-para">Marinate the beef. Drain and brown as above. Lift the beef out of the pan and put into a medium slow cooker pot. Sweat the vegetables and herbs from the marinade, then add the marinade, salt and pepper, bring to the boil then pour over the beef. Cover with a lid and cook on High for 4 hours, turning the beef once, then reduce the heat to Low and cook for 1 hour. Pour the sauce into a saucepan and boil for 15–20 minutes to reduce and thicken.
