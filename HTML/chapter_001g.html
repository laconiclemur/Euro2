<h2 class="h2b">TARTE FINE AUX TOMATES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Tomato Tart</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>I came across a tart like this one evening in a packed little restaurant in St Tropez. They made it with goats’ cheese topped with dried tomatoes, but after a few tries I found it nicer to use fresh tomatoes so their juices flow out and then get sucked back up by the pastry. Don’t worry if after half an hour the tart looks an absolute mess: it’ll all dry out. The tomatoes will concentrate to an intensely flavoured, almost dry, crimson. You can eat the tart hot or cold and it’s worth making for the aroma alone. I often serve this tart as part of a buffet, or sometimes I make individual ones and serve them with a sharply dressed salad and a Parmesan mayonnaise – simply add 150g (5½oz) freshly grated Parmesan to the aïoli recipe <a href="chapter_003k.html#page92">here</a></em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6</span><br/>
350g (12oz) puff pastry<br/>
1.5kg (3lb 5oz) tomatoes, all around the same size<br/>
150g (5½oz) mascarpone cheese<br/>
50g (1¾oz) Parmesan, finely grated<br/>
1 biggish bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
3tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.</p>
<p class="normala">Roll the puff pastry to a circle slightly larger than 30cm (12in) in diameter. (If you don’t have a ring this size, use a plate.) Put the pastry circle on a tray and let it rest in the fridge for 20 minutes or so while you prepare the tomatoes. Remove the cores from the tomatoes and slice them about 5mm thick. Keep all the slices together and put the ends in a separate pile.</p>
<p class="normala">Mix the mascarpone cheese with the Parmesan and basil and season well. Spread the mascarpone across the centre of the pastry circle, leaving about 10cm (4in) at the edges. Layer the sliced tomatoes around the outside of the cheese, making a full circle. Continue towards the centre in ever-decreasing circles, overlapping the earlier circle each time. Tuck the tomato ends under each layer to prevent them caving in, then continue toward the centre. Put the last slice right in the middle and drizzle with the olive oil.</p>
<p class="normala">Bake the tart in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn the oven down to 150°C/300°F/Gas 2 and bake for a further 45 minutes. When cooked there should be almost no liquid left in the tomatoes, and the pastry base will be crisp.</p>
