<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The most famous way to prepare trout in Spain comes from Navarra, a fertile region in northern Spain bordering the Basque Country, La Rioja, and Aragón. The saltiness of the jamón offers a perfect counter to the delicate flavors of the fish. Like many cooks, I use the least expensive cured jamón called jamón serrano (as opposed to the much more expensive jamón ibérico) for this dish. Look for wide, moist, and fatty slices.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 CLEANED WHOLE TROUT, WITH HEADS AND TAILS, ABOUT 8 OUNCES/225 G EACH</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>8 GENEROUS SLICES DRY-CURED JAM<span class="serif">Ó</span>N <a href="11-turning.html#page_16">(SEE INGREDIENT NOTE, PAGE 16)</a></li>
<li>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR FOR DREDGING</li>
<li>1 LEMON, HALVED</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS CHOPPED FRESH FLAT-LEAF PARSLEY</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Rinse the trout and pat dry with paper towels. Lightly season with salt.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over high heat and add the jamón. Cook, turning as needed, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the jamón to paper towels and dab off the excess oil.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Lightly dredge the trout in flour and add to the skillet. Cook until the trout are golden and just cooked through, turning very carefully just once, about 4 minutes on each side. Test for doneness along the backbone with the tip of a knife; the meat should be just opaque and still very moist. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes more if needed. Transfer to a serving dish.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Tuck a slice of jamón into the cavity of each fish. Finely chop the remaining four slices of jamón into shards.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Squeeze the lemon over the fish and dust with the chopped jamón and the parsley. Serve immediately.</p>
