<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red"><em>Escalivada</em> derives its name from the Catalan words that mean “to cook on hot embers”—the traditional method of preparing this dish. These days, the vegetables are frequently roasted in the oven, the method given here. But for smokier, more rustic flavors, place the vegetables directly on hot charcoal or over a gas flame, turning frequently with tongs, until blackened. Place them in a paper sack or wrap in newspaper to cool and soften. Once cool enough to handle, peel and then follow the steps below.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Serve with wide slices of bread rubbed with tomato <a href="48-chapter27.html#page_68"><span class="red">(see page 68)</span></a>, either alone or accompanied by anchovy fillets, cold cuts, or tinned bonito del norte tuna.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Escalivada keeps well for a few days in the refrigerator. The flavors will deepen as the garlic has time to embed its flavor into the vegetables.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> CUP/75 ML EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, PLUS MORE FOR BRUSHING VEGETABLES</li>
<li>4 RED BELL PEPPERS, WASHED AND DRIED</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM GLOBE EGGPLANT, WASHED AND DRIED</li>
<li>2 UNPEELED MEDIUM ONIONS</li>
<li>6 GARLIC CLOVES, PEELED AND SLICED IN HALF LENGTHWISE INTO FLAT PIECES SALT</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 450°F/230°C/gas mark 8.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Lightly brush with oil the bell peppers, eggplant, and onions and then wrap them individually in aluminum foil. Place the vegetables on a baking sheet and bake until very tender and the skin of the peppers is falling away and the eggplant is charred in places and shriveled, about 1¼ hours. Remove from the oven and let cool in the foil for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Carefully open the foil (watch out for the steam escaping; it can burn) and let the vegetables cool further. Once cool enough to handle, begin working over a bowl to catch and save the juices. Peel away the skin of the peppers, seed, and tear them into long, lengthwise strips ½&gt; to 1 inch/1.25 to 2.5 cm wide. Peel the eggplant, seed, and tear it into long strips the same size as the peppers. Remove the burnt outer skins of the onions, and cut them into slices.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a large shallow serving dish, arrange the vegetables by type, with the brilliant red bell peppers in the middle. Dribble in 3 tablespoons of the reserved juice, tuck the garlic within the layers of vegetables, and season with a pinch of salt. Pour over the remaining oil and jiggle the dish to settle and distribute the oil. Let sit for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavor of the garlic.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> To store for up to 4 days, make sure the vegetables are covered with oil. Cover with a dish and refrigerate. Remove from the refrigerator with enough time before serving for it to return to room temperature.</p>
