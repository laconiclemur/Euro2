<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Pepa is a glamorous blond, blue-eyed live wire. I first met her at an interna</span>tional symposium on Mediterranean food in Barcelona in 2004; she was director and coordinator. Scholars from various Mediterranean countries came together to discuss the histories, peoples, religions, products, cooking techniques, and shared food heritage of the area, and chefs were invited to demonstrate their dishes using Mediterranean products. Pepa put together chefs from warring countries (they fell into each other’s arms) and initiated the project Taste for Peace. She later got the chefs to help compile a database of all the dishes they had in common for her Fundació Viure el Mediterrani, which aimed to establish the gastronomic heritage of the Mediterranean and to create a Mediterranean Product brand.</p>
<p class="summary">She is also the director of the Fundació Institut Català de la Cuina (page 105). When I stayed with her in Barcelona, I met her colleagues, passionate Catalan gastronomes, over lunch. She sent me a huge book, their archive of recipes collected from chefs, farmers, and housewives, most of them in mountain and fishing villages. I keep phoning her for advice and details. How long can I boil the blood sausage before it explodes? What is <span class="italic">vi ranci</span>? (It is fortified—not rancid—wine.)</p>
<p class="summary">Pepa’s office is in a flat above her own and she manages to cook lunch every day for everyone. She has four children, two daughters and two sons. Her elder son, Juan, is unusual in that although he comes from a very Catholic family he became convinced that he was of Jewish origin and wanted to convert to Judaism. When rabbis in Spain would not convert him, he went to Israel to study at a yeshiva. His family thought it was a kibbutz. He became Jewish and Israeli and fought in Lebanon. He now lives in Barcelona with his Catalan wife and sons and has joined the Jewish community, which is made up mainly of people from North Africa and Latin America.</p>
