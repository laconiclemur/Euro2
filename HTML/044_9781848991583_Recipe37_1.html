<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_57"/><b>Pan-fried Skate Wings</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Chili–Lime Butter</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Skate wings are classically served with a Beurre Noisette (see <a href="023_9781848991583_Recipe17.html">page 22</a>) and capers, but I think they go just as well with this chili- and lime-flavored butter. It’s the same basic idea, but the chili brings a touch of heat and sunshine to the dish, which skate has the depth of flavor to take. Add a splash of fresh lime juice and a little garlic and you have a memorable meal.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 skate wings, about 5 ounces each, cleaned and prepared</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">a little all-purpose flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxta">boiled new potatoes, to serve</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CHILI–LIME BUTTER</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 red chili, seeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">finely grated zest of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">juice of ½ lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 2 flat-leaf parsley sprigs, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the chili–lime butter, put the butter, chili, garlic, lime zest, lime juice and parsley in a nonmetallic bowl and season with salt and pepper. Mix together with a wooden spoon, then put 4 heaped teaspoons to one side. (The rest of the chili–lime butter can be frozen for future use. Wrap half the remaining butter in plastic wrap, roll it into a log shape and twist the ends. Repeat with the remaining butter. Wrap each log in a piece of aluminum foil and put in the freezer to firm up. You can then cut pieces off at your convenience for use on grilled, barbecued or pan-fried meats or fish.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Briefly rinse the skate wings in ice-cold water, then pat dry with a clean dish towel. (Do not use paper, because it will stick.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat one or two nonstick skillets, large enough to hold the skate wings, over medium heat. Add the unflavored butter and the oil and heat until the butter just melts. Lightly dust the skate wings with flour, shaking off any excess. Add the skate wings and fry 5 minutes, turning them over once, or until they are just golden brown. As you turn the skate wings, add the reserved chili–lime butter to the pan and spoon it over the fish. (Alternatively, cook the skate wings 1 or 2 at a time and keep them warm in the oven at 300°F while you cook the remaining skate wings.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Remove the skate wings from the pan and put on serving plates. Stir the parsley into the pan, then spoon the flavored butter over the top of the skate wings. Serve with boiled new potatoes.</p>
