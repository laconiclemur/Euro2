<p class="yield">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The southern coast of Andalucía is the land of excellent <em>fritura</em>, small fish (and sometimes vegetables) perfectly deep-fried in a light flouring (rather than a thick batter). Also called <em>pescadito frito</em> (literally “little fried fish”), the most famous version comes from Cádiz and can include a large selection of different seafood.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     The key to getting the fish golden brown on the outside while juicy and tender on the inside, with a light, crispy texture, is using abundant and hot oil. Do not crowd the pan, because it cools the temperature of the oil. If the oil is not hot enough, the fish will get soggy and perhaps break apart. (If it is too hot, though, the fish will burn on the outside before the center can cook.) Fry the fish by types and in small batches. Fry one complete batch at a time, rather than adding more as space allows in the pan. Between batches be sure that the oil returns to an adequate temperature.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3½&gt; POUNDS/1.6 KG FRESH FISH, SUCH AS SMALL HAKE, SOLE, ANCHOVIES, AND RED MULLET, AND WHOLE FRESH SHRIMP</li>
<li>MILD OLIVE OIL OR SUNFLOWER OIL FOR FRYING</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR FOR DREDGING</li>
<li>1 LEMON, CUT INTO WEDGES</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Do not rinse the small fish and shrimp; instead wipe them with a damp towel. Clean the larger fish and, if needed, cut them in half or into thick steaks; leave the smaller fish whole. Scale the red mullet. Refrigerate until ready to fry.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 200°F/95°C.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a deep skillet, heat about 2 inches/5 cm of olive oil to 375°F/190°C. (The oil is the right temperature when a large cube of fresh bread dropped into it browns in about 60 seconds.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Season the fish with salt and then dredge in flour, covering each part. Shake off any excess flour in a sieve.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Working in small batches that don’t crowd the pan or bring the temperature of the oil below 350°F/180°C, gently lower a batch of fish or shrimp into the oil with tongs and fry until golden and slightly crunchy on the outside, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Remove with a slotted spoon or tongs, and place on paper towels to briefly drain. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place in the oven to keep warm until all of the fish have been fried.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Fry the remaining fish, being sure that the oil has returned to 350°F/180°C before adding the next batch.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">8.</span> Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.</p>
