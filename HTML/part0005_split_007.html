			<p class="rec-intro">The combination of chicken and langoustines may seem odd, but I think this is truly delicious and it was a great favourite on the menu at Le Gavroche for many years. The dish is made extra special by using a wonderful Bresse chicken if you can find one. </p>

			<p class="body">Joint the chicken into breasts, legs and thighs and season with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil with the butter in a sauté pan until foaming, then add the chicken. Cook for 15 minutes, turning twice, until golden and cooked through.</p>
			<p class="body">Cook the langoustines in salted, boiling water for 2 minutes or less, depending on their size. Drain and cool, then remove the heads and shell the tails, reserving the shells.</p>
			<p class="body">Remove the chicken from the pan and keep it warm. Tip out half the cooking fat, add the onion to the pan and cook until lightly browned. Add the langoustine heads and shells and crush them with a wooden spoon, keeping the pan over a low heat. Deglaze the pan with the Madeira, then add the stock and tomatoes and cook until the pan is nearly dry. Add the cream, bring to the boil and reduce to a light sauce consistency. Pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan. </p>
			<p class="body">Reheat the chicken and langoustine tails in the sauce, taking care not to let it boil or the langoustines will toughen. Serve immediately with fresh pasta if you like. Garnish with a sliced, cooked truffle for an extra treat. </p>
