    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page39"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">On the southern shore of <a id="ind396a"/>Lake Mývatn</span></span> in north-central Iceland stands a dilapidated-looking wooden house with a pile of what looks like blocks of dirt on one side. It’s not a routine stop on the tourist trail at this popular holiday destination, but it is the sweet spot for those who let their palates dictate their itineraries. It is here that <a id="ind282a"/>Gylfi Yngvason, his wife, <a id="ind39a"/>Audur Jónsdóttir, and their four children smoke arctic char in the same manner as their ancestors did centuries ago.</p>
<p class="nonindent1">A plume of thick, gray smoke puffs up through the chimney and fills the air with a dusky earthiness whose flavor profile cannot quite be broken down at first. The fuel for this single-family operation is shaggy brown blocks of compressed hay and sheep manure, packed down over the months by the sheep themselves. They infuse the char that Gylfi neatly arranges on long wooden poles with an essence that means more than simply flavor to Icelanders.</p>
<p class="extract">It conjures nostalgia for an experience that is quickly succumbing to the crush of globalization and the desire for instant gratification. There was a time when almost nothing tasted better to most Icelanders than a slice of sweet rye slathered with local butter and topped with a glistening slice of <a id="ind34a"/><a id="ind242a"/>smoked arctic char. Today, most of the smoked char in Iceland is processed in large, soulless buildings, where workers brush the <a id="ind583a"/>fish with smoke oil to mask the absence of tradition.</p>
<p class="extract">But Gylfi persists in his time-honored work. Each morning, the quiet man with salt-and-pepper hair and a slow, discerning smile dons his bright orange fishing waders to protect his clothing from the blood and guts that are part of his work and heads to the smokehouse at the bottom of the hill from his residence, a tidy, inviting home that is now also a guesthouse. He sets out sated with rye bread his wife bakes in the nearby geothermal ovens, her homemade butter, and hot tea made from Icelandic herbs she forages. He breaks down the char in the same way he has for decades, then hangs them from wooden poles, which he carefully installs inside the smokehouse. He heaves a few of the heavy smoking blocks into a pile beneath the fish and stokes a flame that emerges meekly at first but is soon billowing with brazen energy, only to settle down into a persistent orange glow.</p>
<p class="extract">The fish smoke for three days and three nights while the family tends to the countless tasks necessary to maintaining the business, including caring for a small herd of sheep, a flock of chickens, and the guesthouse—and most important, a legacy that is as fundamental to who Icelanders are as the dormant volcanoes that dot the shore of Lake Mývatn.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c02-s10"><a id="page40"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Arctic Char Smoker Gylfi Yngvason</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you smoke your fish?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I cut them lengthwise and wash them well, but I leave in the bones and a small hole at the top for hanging later. Depending on how big they are, I put them in salt for two to twenty hours. I rinse them, hang them from sticks, and put them in the smokehouse for three days and three nights. It’s cold smoke, using blocks of compressed sheep manure and hay. It’s a very old Icelandic tradition. The weather has to be exactly right, because the blocks must not burn, just glow. They can’t be too hot.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Why did you decide to become a fish smoker?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I come from a long line of fish smokers and took over this business from my father. When I did, our smokehouse was falling down, and I thought it would be an improvement to build a new one, so I neglected the original one. My uncle was the first smoker to sell to stores in this region. Before that, we would just sell to people who were passing by. He told me not to switch houses. He said it would change the flavor of the fish. But I just laughed at him and went ahead with my plan, thinking new is always better. I smoked fish in the new smokehouse for five years, and it never tasted the same. I have no idea why that was the case. I finally gave up and returned to the first house. Yes, it is falling down, and yes, it doesn’t look pretty, but it’s a very good house. Its walls are thick and the temperature inside is always the same. It’s perfect for my fish and results in the best flavor.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you smoke fish year-round?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes. This is my only job.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you smoke fish other than arctic char?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I buy and smoke rainbow trout sometimes, because we are not allowed to fish for them ourselves. I also smoke for fishermen in the area. We smoke twelve to fifteen tons of fresh fish each year. Three kilograms [6½ pounds] of fresh fish yields about one kilogram [2¼ pounds] of smoked fish.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Whom do you sell your fish to?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I sell a lot of my fish to chefs. I also sell it to stores throughout Iceland. In the summertime, I sell a lot more fish because of all the people on holiday passing by. Our fish isn’t <a id="page41"/>exported, but it is available at the international airport, and we know that many people from around the world are buying it to take home with them. So in this way, it is finding its way out of Iceland.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you use any other parts of the fish besides what you are selling?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Some of the fish we smoke contain bones, and after we are finished with the smoking, we remove the bones, save them until winter, and then feed them to our sheep all winter long. We cold smoke our lamb for fourteen days in the same smokehouse, usually before Christmas. If you look for it, you can taste the smoked char in their meat.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How was smoked arctic char traditionally used in recipes?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Traditionally, it was served with just sweet rye bread and local butter. You can’t find a better combination.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you find that smoking fish in the traditional way is a dying tradition?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, fish has been smoked this way for centuries, but things are now changing. Only a handful of us traditional smokers are left in Iceland, maybe fewer than ten in the entire country, and the <a id="ind397a"/>Mývatn way of using sheep dung, hay, and porous stone in the foundation of the wooden smokehouse is very specific to this region. The stone is sourced locally from the lava fields of the area and enables the smoke and outside air to slowly flow in and out. The sheep need to compress the hay and dung themselves by walking on it for at least a few months. It’s impossible to do this in the new smokehouses because grates are required. We don’t add anything to our fish except salt, smoke, and time.</p>
<p class="Answer">The modern way is to put the fish in smoke for several hours and then add smoked oil to them. The fish lose a lot of flavor in this process. Modern operations also smoke fillets, whereas we keep the bones in our fish because they impart flavor. The process is more time-consuming, but it’s worth it. My goal is to get the best possible taste from my smoked fish. We do everything with our hands. No machines. Fishermen could take their fish to these contemporary places, but the taste will be completely different, and so many continue to come here to have them smoked in the traditional way.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Is the younger generation of Icelanders interested in this technique?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, not really. Maybe when they get older they will appreciate it. I just hope that by then it’s not too late.</p>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">WHAT IS <a id="ind194a"/><a id="ind582a"/>DIRT SMOKING?</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">In Iceland, when you hear a food described as having been dirt <a id="ind243a"/>smoked, it usually means that the source of the smoke was a dried block of compressed hay and sheep manure. Gunnar chooses not to sugarcoat the process and calls it what it is: shit smoking. The technique infuses whatever it is smoking, usually arctic char or lamb, with an earthiness that is impossible to achieve using the more modern smoking techniques employed nowadays almost everywhere in Iceland. For an Icelander and anyone else able to overcome their misgivings about eating manure-smoked foods, the reward is flavor packed with a region’s <em>terroir</em>. Its flowers, grasses, grains, and weeds are all there for those brave enough to accept the tradition.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Arctic char smoker <a id="ind283a"/>Gylfi Yngvason explains a process he has employed to smoke his <a id="ind584a"/>fish for decades: “The sheep compress together a mixture of hay and manure by walking over it in the barn for at least two months. We then shovel it out to dry it. It’s best to move it outdoors in the early spring after the long Icelandic winter that has kept the sheep inside doing their work. The drying process is as important as the first step. It cannot be too dry or too wet or it won’t smoke the fish properly. It’s very hard work to remove the blocks from the barn. They’re heavy and it’s a tiring process, but I cannot imagine smoking my fish using anything else.”</p>

<div class="headnote1">Gunnar is always searching for ways to use parts of vegetables that other cooks typically relegate to the trash bin. The use of kale stalks as one of the primary elements in this recipe is the perfect illustration of that. When blanched for a few seconds, they are transformed into ideal dipping vessels for the creamy buttermilk sprinkled with smoky arctic char. Of course, other vegetables, such as blanched asparagus or raw celery, can be substituted for the kale, but the stalks are a great conversation piece and are an especially clever way to use an element that rarely finds its way to the table.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent0">The buttermilk also symbolizes the use of an element that might otherwise be discarded. The buttermilk is drained and only the solids are used here, but Gunnar reserves the whey and uses it in other recipes.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">This recipe is a unique and addictive bar snack. If you’re having difficulty sourcing the arctic char, salmon proves a good substitute. Either fish, once it is dehydrated and flaked, also pairs well with cream cheese for bagels or can be stirred into mayonnaise.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the buttermilk, line a colander with a coffee filter and place the colander over a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into the colander and let drain in the refrigerator for 12 hours. Reserve the solids for plating and reserve the whey for another use such as <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-s61">marinating pork or beef tenderloin</a>.</div>
<div class="method">To make the arctic char, preheat the oven to the lowest setting. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the fish fillet on the prepared pan. Dehydrate in the oven for about 6 hours, until completely dry.</div>
<div class="method">Line the bottom of a tiered steamer with the onion peels and place over high heat. Ignite the onion peels with a kitchen torch, put the steamer rack in place, and when the peels are smoking, put the dehydrated fish on the rack, cover the steamer, and leave undisturbed for about 10 minutes, until the smoldering subsides. If a more intense smokiness <a id="page45"/>is desired, repeat the process once or twice.

<div class="method">Remove the fish from the steamer, let cool completely, and break apart into flakes. The flakes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To make the kale, prepare an ice bath. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil over high heat, add the kale stalks, and blanch for a few seconds. Using a wire skimmer, transfer the stalks to the ice bath, immersing them. Let stand until chilled. Drain the stalks and pat dry with paper towels.</div>
<div class="method">Season the stalks with salt and then toss them with just enough oil to make them glisten.</div>

<div class="headnote">Arctic char roe is as vibrant in color as the flesh of the fish it comes from, and when added to the caramelized puree in this recipe, it adds a briny pop of flavor. Salmon roe is a good substitute for the sometimes difficult to source arctic char roe, and either one is a welcome flash of vibrant color in a dish that is otherwise awash in ivory. Celery root or rutabaga proves a good substitute for the parsnips, and no matter what root vegetable is used, be sure to add a generous amount of vinegar to counter the natural sweetness of the puree. You might want to double, or even triple, the volumes called for in the <a id="ind454a"/><a id="ind550a"/>pickled shallot powder, as it is also terrific sprinkled over hamburgers, vegetables, fish, or nearly anything else.</div>

<div class="method">To make the shallot powder, prepare an ice bath. Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat, add the shallot petals, and blanch for a few seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the petals to the ice bath, immersing them. Let stand until chilled. Drain, pat dry with paper towels, and transfer to a small heatproof glass jar.</div>
<div class="method">Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the shallots, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat a dehydrator to the highest setting or preheat an oven to its lowest setting. If using an oven, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drain the shallots, pat dry with paper towels, and arrange on a dehydrator tray or on the prepared baking sheet. Dehydrate the shallots, flipping them over at the halfway point, for about 12 hours, until they are deep golden brown. Let cool to room temperature, then grind to a coarse powder in a spice grinder (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-note8">see notes</a>). The powder will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page49"/>To make the pickled parsnip, thinly slice the parsnip lengthwise on a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>). Bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat, add the parsnip slices, and blanch for a few seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the slices to a small heatproof glass jar. Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the parsnip slices, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.</div>
<div class="method">To make the parsnip puree, melt the butter in a <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass2">pressure cooker</a> over medium heat and stir in the parsnips, baking soda, and salt, mixing well. Lock the lid in place and cook at medium-high pressure for 15 minutes, until the parsnips are caramelized to a dark golden brown and tender. Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes, then remove the lid.</div>
<div class="method">While the parsnips are still hot, transfer them to a blender and process until a smooth, thick puree forms. Season with salt and vinegar. The puree should be smooth and easily pourable. If it is too thick, thin with a little water (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-note8">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To make the parsnips, combine the parsnips, butter, and water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until all of the water evaporates and the parsnips begin to caramelize in the butter. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon some puree onto plate, top with a parsnip, and arrange some pickled parsnips alongside. Garnish with the shallot powder, roe, parsley, dill, watercress, and rye bread crumbs.</div>
<div class="note" id="c02-note8">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Be sure to dehydrate the shallots completely before grinding or they will become gummy.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Season the puree with the vinegar before adding any water to thin it.

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">USING A <a id="ind478a"/>PRESSURE COOKER</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Pressure cooking has gained an unfortunate (and generally unwarranted) reputation as a dangerous cooking method in the home kitchen because of explosion horror stories. But any mishap is easily avoided with a little kitchen wisdom.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Every pressure cooker is different, so the first thing to do is to familiarize yourself with your cooker by reading the owner’s manual from cover to cover. Some basic rules apply when using any pressure cooker, however. For example, never use less liquid than is called for in a recipe, though more liquid is generally okay. Cut the food into uniform pieces so that it will cook evenly, and if the first step is to caramelize the food, always scrape up the browned bits on the pot bottom to prevent scorching before adding liquid and moving on to the next step. Be sure to secure the lid in the locked position before you begin adding pressure to the cooker, and once the pressure is reached, moniter the time and the pressure level closely throughout the cooking process. Once the pressure is released according to the instructions in the recipe—either a quick release or by letting the pressure subside naturally—vigorously shake the cooker to lower the temperature inside before opening.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Here are a few additional tips: Fresh herbs work better in a pressure cooker than dried herbs because dried herbs are more intensely flavored and can overpower the other ingredients. When cooking legumes or grains, do not fill the pot more than half full, as they expand dramatically during cooking and can plug the vent pipe or other mechanism of the cooker. If you find that too much liquid remains after you have removed the lid, continue to cook in the open cooker until the liquid is reduced to your satisfaction.</p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR (PLUS 12 HOURS TO REFRIGERATE THE CHEESE)</div>
<div class="headnote1">Gunnar is an ardent meat and fish smoker, but he also enjoys smoking more unexpected items, such as cheese. He infuses it ever so lightly with smokiness by using a smoke gun to pipe wood smoke into it. It’s a simple technique that works well with virtually anything you want to permeate with smoke, such as vegetables, sauces, or even ice creams, since the smoke carries very little heat. You can also play around with the smoking material used. For example, dried tree leaves of nearly any species or hay are good choices.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Don’t be intimidated by the idea of making cheese at home. It’s not as daunting as it sounds, and once you are comfortable with the technique, it’s fun to mention to your guests that you made the cheese yourself. Plus, the process results in whey, which is also used here. The smoked cheese caramelizes nicely during the smoking process, which also makes it a fun and unexpected topping for ice cream. Like many Nordic chefs, Gunnar frequently cures his own fish, which, when paired with the fresh salad and the light texture of the cheese, makes for a lovely dish on a warm summer’s day.</div>

<div class="method">To make the smoked cheese, put the milk and vinegar in a small saucepan, stir to mix, and place over low heat. Heat to 189°F (87°C) and maintain the mixture at this temperature for about 5 minutes. The milk will separate completely into clumps of white curds and watery whey. Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Pour the contents of the pan into the sieve and refrigerate for 12 hours.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page53"/>Reserve the solids in the sieve and transfer the whey to a small, heavy saucepan. Place the pan over low heat and leave undisturbed for about 30 minutes, until the liquid begins to caramelize. Remove from the heat, pour into a heatproof bowl, and let cool to room temperature. As the liquid cools, it will stiffen to the texture of chocolate. Break it apart and reserve to use as a garnish.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the solids from the sieve to a hotel pan or deep baking pan and seal tightly with plastic wrap. Fill a smoke gun with wood chips and ignite the gun with a match. Make a small hole in the plastic wrap covering the pan, insert the nozzle of the gun through the hole, and smoke the cheese for 10 minutes. Alternatively, smoke the cheese in a wood chip–<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-eass16">fueled homemade</a> or store-bought kitchen smoker. Season the cheese with salt and drizzle with oil and vinegar to taste, then crumble to the consistency of dry ricotta.</div>
<div class="method">To make the artic char, remove any skin and fat from the fish. Combine the sugar, <a id="ind526a"/>rock salt, and greens in a bowl. Evenly distribute half of the sugar mixture in a shallow metal container just large enough to accommodate the char. Place the fish on top and cover it with the remaining curing mixture. Let stand at room temperature for 22 minutes. Remove the fish from the curing mixture and discard the mixture.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat an immersion circulator to 127°F (53°C). Cut the char into 4 equal pieces, place the pieces and the oil in a vacuum bag, and seal on the medium setting. Cook in the circulator for 10 minutes. Remove the bag from the circulator, remove the fish from the bag, and keep warm. Alternatively, preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut the char into 4 equal portions, rub (or spray) the bottom of each portion with rapeseed oil, and arrange on the prepared pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until medium-rare.</div>
<div class="method">To make the potatoes, boil the potates in salted water to cover for 18 to 20 minutes, until just tender. Drain the potatoes, let cool just until they can be handled, and cut into disks ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. Melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat, add the potatoes, and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, until golden brown on both sides. Season with sea salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the mixed salad, toss together the lettuce and herbs with just enough oil to make them glisten. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the artic char, potatoes, and salad on a plate and garnish with the roe, the smoked cheese, the caramelized whey, and the oil.</div>
<div class="note" id="c02-note9">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. If your fish comes complete with skin, after you remove it, save it, cut it into bite-size pieces, and fry it up for a crunchy topping for the salad.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Rock salt is the workhorse of salts, ideal for curing fish, making salt crusts, and other culinary uses. It also has nonculinary uses, so look for food-grade rock salt to avoid rock salt that has been treated with chemicals.</span></p>

<p class="sub_yield">MAKES ABOUT 1 POUND (450 G) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 4 HOURS</p>
<p class="sub_headnote"><span class="dk_blue">Long ago, salt was an <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-s78">expensive commodity in Iceland</a>, which meant it was out of the reach of most people. The absence of easy access to salt as a preservative resulted in sour butter, a flavor favored by the palates of the time. So appealing was sour butter to the early settlers that it was used as a payment method for everything from rent to goods and services. It was also considered a nutritional powerhouse, and when stored properly, it would keep for years. There are accounts of twenty-year-old butter being sought out for its intense sour zing.</span></p>
<p class="sub_headnote2"><span class="dk_blue">Although this recipe does not call for a twenty-year-long aging process, Icelandic butter is still highly prized by locals and visitors alike. Tourists often declare that Icelandic butter is the best butter they have ever tasted, and Icelanders are pretty sure that such testimonials are not just because visitors are invariably awestruck by the country’s beauty. Icelandic dairy products are some of the richest, most nutritious in the world, and because the cows typically graze freely, eating pesticide-free hay and grasses, they produce velvety milk flush with flavor. It’s no wonder that Iceland consumes more dairy per capita than almost any other country in the world. Since butter is all about the cream, it’s important that you seek out organic cream with a high butterfat content for this recipe.</span></p>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item_center"><strong>8½ cups (2 L) heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_center"><strong>Sea salt (optional)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Pour the cream into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment and mix on medium-high speed for about 10 minutes, until the butter solids separate from the liquid. To prevent splattering, cover the bowl with a kitchen towel. When you notice splashing in the bowl, it is time to turn off the mixer. Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and place it over a bowl. Pour the contents of the mixer into the sieve and drain well. Reserve the liquid for another use (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-note10">see note</a>).</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the butter solids to a bowl and knead with your hands for about 10 minutes to squeeze out any remaining liquid and to form a dense, shiny mass. If you want salted butter, add some salt as you knead. Form the butter into a ball or a block, put it in an airtight container, and refrigerate until chilled, about 4 hours. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to several months.</div>

<p class="note_text1"><span class="dk_blue">The liquid, or buttermilk, adds a lively tang to pastry dough that calls for milk. It is also an excellent tenderizer and marinade for proteins, such as lamb and pork.</span></p>

<div class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 30 BITE-SIZE ROCKS <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR</div>
<div class="headnote">Since the first day he opened Dill, Gunnar has been serving what he calls “sweet goodies.” He often serves them before dinner as a way to build anticipation for the good things to come, and his Licorice Lava has been in the repertoire from the beginning. Perhaps no other sweet better represents the area of <a id="ind398a"/>Lake Mývatn where <a id="ind284a"/>Gylfi Yngvason smokes his arctic char. The otherworldly region is mapped by lava fields that stretch to the horizon of a world that feels more like the surface of the moon than somewhere on earth. Although the flinty texture of the Licorice Lava mirrors the porous lava stones that inspired it, don’t be fooled by the airiness of this sweet. Its intense flavor will leave you wanting more.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1¼ cups (250 g) granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (120 ml) water</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ teaspoons egg whites</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (30 g) confectioners’ sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>3 g licorice powder (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-note11">see note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>8 drops powdered black food coloring (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-note11">see note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Nonstick cooking spray</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Combine the granulated sugar and water in a tall, heavy pot, place the pot over medium heat, and heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar has dissolved, clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, stop stirring, and heat the mixture to 284°F (140°C).</div>
<div class="method">Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg whites, confectioners’ sugar, licorice powder, and food coloring until blended.</div>
<div class="method">Line a heatproof bowl with aluminum foil, spray the oil with cooking spray, and wipe off the excess spray with a paper towel.</div>
<div class="method">When the sugar mixture reaches 284°F (140°C), rapidly whisk in the egg white mixture until fully incorporated. Whisk at lightning speed to prevent the mixture from becoming a solid mass, letting the contents concurrently foam and rise to the top of the pot. As soon as it has reached its rising limit, which should take about 1 minute (including whisking time), immediately pour the mixture into the prepared bowl.</div>
<div class="method">Let cool to room temperature, then break into bite-size rocks.</div>
<div class="method">The rocks will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="note" id="c02-note11">

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">Both licorice powder and black food coloring are available at specialty baking stores or online. The only word of warning when using the food coloring is to wear gloves, as it will stain your hands.</span></p>
