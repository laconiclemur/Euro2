<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">I</span></span><span class="italic">n Emilia-Romagna the antipasto is usually savored as a single dish presented at the table before the first course. It can be as simple as a few slices of prosciutto or as elaborate as a mousse of chicken and duck livers. The richer the dish, the smaller the portion. There is a fine balance here; rarely are antipasti overdone. These first tastes are meant to remind us just how hungry we are for what is to come and to keep us that way</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Occasionally confusing to non-Italians is the fact that the antipasto is not a first course. In Italy first courses are pastas, risotti, soups and important vegetable dishes. The antipasto is the optional introduction to a menu, sometimes offered before the first course</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">I have included menu suggestions with each antipasto recipe, but enjoy these dishes as your mood dictates. Emilia-Romagna’s most important culinary tradition is taking pleasure on your own terms</span>.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Antipasto di Salumi</span></span></p>
<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">N<span class="italic">o matter where you dine, from Ferrara to Piacenza, in homes, remote <span class="underline">trattorie</span> in the country or in city restaurants, a platter of cured meats is the most frequently served antipasto. On it you will always find oval slices of locally made salami, thin rounds of coppa and even thinner pieces of prosciutto. Occasionally pancetta or mortadella appear, depending on where you happen to be. These platters testify to the skill of Emilia-Romagna’s artisans. Endless variations in artisans’ styles assert themselves: one adds some red wine to his salami, another cinnamon or garlic or cloves</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Sometimes baskets of fritters and small dishes of marinated vegetables are added for a more substantial first course or a whole meal. Most of the time, the platter stands alone, with everyone taking just enough to work up an appetite. Cured meats are usually eaten at the table with a knife and fork. Breads like Ferrara’s <span class="underline">Cop</span>p<span class="underline">ia,</span> Romagna’s <span class="underline">Piadina</span> or Modena Mountain Bread are offered. Butter is often set out, but few use it</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Parma ham and cooked prosciutto (much like boiled ham) are the only Italian pork products imported into the United States at this time. But you can assemble your own platter by finding the best source in your area for domestically made cured meats. Count on ½ to 1 ounce of meat per person</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Emilia-Romagna’s most classical and elegant antipasto is three or four sheer slices of Prosciutto di Parma served only with a bread like Ferrara’s Coppia. In this country, use a crusty baguette. No fruit or other embellishments are needed. For a more informal platter, set out short links of cacciatore salami (hunter’s-style salami), thinly sliced, with Modena Mountain Bread and Marinated Baby Onions. Cubes of mortadella on long bamboo skewers are traditional before a meal of Bolognese dishes. Good coppa, sliced thin, is the classic starter for a Piacenza menu. Mix coppa, salami and a robust, slightly salty prosciutto to go with a Modena meal</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When it is difficult to find meats cured in the style of Emilia-Romagna, I serve several types of salami inspired by other northern regions—Genoa-style, Tuscan and Venetian, for instance. Paper-thin slices of pancetta and coppa are another favorite combination. If I come across a superb salami, I serve it by itself. The key is to present the best meats you can buy. Better one excellent example than three lesser ones</span>.</p>

<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">I <span class="italic">first tasted the combination of sweet/tart marinated onions, cured meats and puffed bread fritters at the medieval castle restaurant Al Castello, in the Modenese hill town of Castelvetro. Since then I have often eaten this classic country antipasto in much of Emilia. For lighter appetites, the trio makes a fine meal by itself. Modenese trenchermen, however, regard it as an overture to several courses, including soup, pasta and meats</span>.</p>

They are a perfect contrast for cured meats, as well as for roasted or grilled beef, lamb, duck and pork.

Onions can be peeled a day before cooking; keep them covered and refrigerated. The marinated onions will hold for 3 weeks in the refrigerator</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Peeling the Onions:</span> Bring the 4 quarts of water to a boil in a 5- to 6-quart pot. Cut a cross into the root end of each onion. Drop them into the water, boil 1 minute, and drain in a colander. Stop the cooking by rinsing under cold water. Trim away <a id="page17"/>the very top of each onion, and the skin will slip off easily.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Marinade:</span> Combine the sugar and ½ cup water in a 5- to 6-quart nonaluminum pot. Have a cup of cold water and a brush on hand. Boil the mixture over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved and the syrup is clear; then boil over high heat 2 minutes, or until pale caramel colored. As the syrup bubbles, brush down the sides of the pot with the brush dipped in cold water. Take care not to let it go beyond pale caramel. Standing back, pour in the red wine (the syrup will erupt and seethe). Once the mixture has calmed down, stir in the olive oil, wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Boil the marinade, uncovered, 2 minutes over high heat. If you are not cooking the onions right away, remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Onions:</span> Add the onions to the marinade and bring the liquid to a slow bubble. Cover the pot and cook the onions over medium to medium-low heat, unattended, 10 to 15 minutes. The onions should be tender but a little resistant when pierced with a knife. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the balsamic vinegar. Cool to room temperature. Taste for a pleasing balance of sweet to tart, adding a little more vinegar or sugar if needed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Marinating the Onions:</span> Pour the onions and their liquid into a glass storage container. Refrigerate, covered, at least 3 days and no more than 3 weeks.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Lift the onions from their liquid. (Refrigerate any onions you are not using in their liquid.) Let them come to room temperature. Stand the onions upright on a platter and spear them with the long skewers. Serve with thinly sliced prosciutto, salami, and coppa and a napkin-lined basket filled with hot, freshly made bread fritters. In true Modena style, the meats are eaten with forks and knives, accompanied by torn-off pieces of fritter and bites of onion.</p>
<div class="bibliography">
<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span>   Wine:</span> In Modena a local crisp, dry Lambrusco is always taken with cured meats. The wine’s fresh fizz lightens the impact of rich salami, coppa, and prosciutto. Imported Lambruscos seem too sweet, so try a chilled white Trebbiano di Romagna or di Lazio instead, or a red “La Monella” Braida di Giacomo Bologna or Barbera di Rocchetta Tanaro from Piemonte.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> This three-dish antipasto is excellent on its own for lunch or supper, serving six. As a first course it is best before a light main dish, such as Herbed Seafood Grill, Giovanna’s Wine-Basted Rabbit, or Grilled Winter Endives.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Paola Bini and Villa Gaidello</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In the countryside of Castelfranco, near Modena, is Villa Gaidello, a guest farm where you can eat food prepared by local farm women and stay in one of three simple apartments. Villa Gaidello is also where local traditions of family cooking and handcraft are revitalized by the villa’s owner, Paola Bini. For me, Paola touches at the heart of Emilia-Romagna’s culinary identity in her work with the land and the local peasant women. Paola speaks of sowing what naturally grows best in a way that gives nourishment back to the soil. Her beliefs have made Villa Gaidello an organic farm. They have also brought a new life to the women who had been the property’s tenant farmers for years.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">After inheriting the family farm, Paola needed a way of keeping it alive. Taking in guests and serving meals prepared by the farm women seemed the answer. Then she discovered the women found more status in earning money as sales help in Castelfranco’s equivilant of the five-and-ten than in continuing the old crafts learned from childhood—handmade pastas, preserving fruits and vegetables, baking bread, curing meats, and cooking traditional dishes. Letting those skills slip away meant not only possibly losing the farm, but also losing crafts accumulated over centuries. By hiring the women at generous salaries and encouraging them to cook as they always had, Paola helped revive their pride in local food traditions. At the same time, visitors could experience the closest thing to real home cooking short of being invited to a family Sunday dinner.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Paola stresses that Villa Gaidello is neither a restaurant nor a hotel. The Villa continues an old Italian tradition, <span class="italic">soggiorno in campagna</span>, or the holiday in the country. Years ago, families often vacationed on farms, going back, if even for a few weeks, to their rural roots. Every Sunday you can share the tradition in miniature at Villa Gaidello. Families come from as far away as Milan to feast, stroll through the fields and refresh themselves after weeks of city living. In the converted hay barn, you sit down to eat before a stack of thick white pottery plates. The top plate is filled with the course being served and then removed to make way for the next dish. There will be at least five courses, but never a printed menu. Paola explains a local saying, “Here we eat as in the convent, meaning we use what comes along.” What comes along is good home food, and a sense that local traditions are not stopped in time and preserved under glass, but continuing to evolve and flourish.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Saracen Invention?</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Italy comes quite rightly by her antipasto salads, even though many consider them a hallmark of France’s nouvelle cuisine. Composed salads of all kinds were very much a part of the elaborate first courses (the forerunner of the antipasto) at Italian Renaissance banquets, when Italy defined much of the dining fashion for all of Europe. Scholars speculate that the first-course salad originated in Italy during the 1400s. I have wondered if the Saracens (Moslems from the Middle East) introduced the concept long before the Renaissance. During their occupation of Sicily in the 9th and 10th centuries, their influence spread far beyond the southernmost portion of Italy. Perhaps then they were serving salads at the opening of meals just as is typical today in North Africa and the Middle East. Perhaps the idea was adopted by Italy’s nobles, just as they eagerly took spices, hard wheat, pastry, and confectionery from the Saracens.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Toasting the Crostini:</span> Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut the baguette into ½-inch-thick diagonal slices. If you are using Modena Mountain Bread, slice the loaf about ¼ to ½ inch thick, and divide each slice into thirds. Rub the slices with the split garlic cloves and brush lightly with olive oil. Arrange on a baking sheet, and bake about 8 minutes, or until they are starting to crisp but not brown. Remove and set aside.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing the Crostini:</span> Shortly before serving, preheat the broiler. Top each piece of bread with a thin slice of pancetta, and arrange them on the baking sheet. Run it under the broiler, keeping the slices about 3 inches from the flame. Broil until the pancetta begins to seethe and soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve hot.</p>

Heat the butter in a heavy 12-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the pears in one layer, and sprinkle lightly with the sugar. Cook over high heat, about 3 minutes, to brown lightly on both sides, turning gently with two wooden spatulas so the pieces don’t break.</p>

Drape two prosciutto slices over each pear serving so it looks like two or three waves undulating up from the plate. (The ham could also be woven under and over the pears.) Garnish each serving with a sprig of mint.</p>
