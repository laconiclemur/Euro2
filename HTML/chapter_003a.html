<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan white bean and salt cod salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">Our executive chef, Josep Carbonell, cooked for us for over five years in London before moving back to Barcelona, from where he now travels back and forth, overseeing the menus in the tapas bars and restaurants. When his daughter, Judit, was born I went to visit him and his family, and knowing how much I love the Catalan <em>mongetes del ganxet</em>, as a little gift they gave me a special bag filled with these shiny white hooked beans which have quite thin, delicate skins, so need less soaking and cooking time than other varieties, and quickly become creamy, delicate and beautiful.</p>
<p class="indented">Inside the bag, written on a tiny piece of paper, was a recipe for <em>empedrat</em>, the simple, nourishing salad of <em>mongetes</em> and salt cod that is famous in Catalunya, and this is the version that we now have on the menu at Casa Brindisa.</p>
<p class="indented">If you can’t find <em>mongetes</em>, you could substitute other small white beans, such as <em>arrocina</em> or <em>planchada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p381d">here</a>).</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g white beans, such as <strong><em>mongetes</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g salt cod <strong><em>migas</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p330c">here</a>), de-salted (if you can find them), or de-salted fillet, broken into pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 ripe tomatoes, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot or sweet mild onion</p>
<p class="ingredients">10–12 mixed black and green olives, stones removed</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, preferably Chardonnay</p>
<p class="ingredients">80ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon chives</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small clove of garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="method">Soak the beans for 12 hours at least, then drain. Put into a pan of cold water, bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer for 45 minutes, and cook until just tender. Drain and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Put the eggs into cold water and bring to a simmer gently so that the shells don’t crack, then cook gently for 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water, then peel, remove the yolks and discard them (or keep for another recipe). Chop the whites and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Mix together all the dressing ingredients and stir to emulsify.</p>
<p class="method">Combine the cooled beans with the rest of the salad ingredients and the reserved chopped egg whites, and toss carefully with the dressing.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘ a big family’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The tuna family (<em>los túnidos</em>) is a big one and there are many different species. In the UK we are most used to the relatively cheap, brownish and quite strong-tasting skipjack, which comes from tropical seas and is mainly canned to meet world demand. However, in terms of Spanish fish, you have three main choices: yellowfin, which in Spain is known as <em>atún claro,</em> the supreme but very threatened bluefin, which thanks to its rich red flesh is rather confusingly known as <em>atún rojo</em>; and the prized <em>bonito del norte.</em></p>
<p class="recipe-head">Atún claro</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Yellowfin tuna</p>
<p class="flush_left1">This can reach around 20–50kg in weight and has pink meat with a pronounced, but not strong flavour. It is mostly canned for the speciality markets not only of Spain, but of Japan, Italy and other Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="indented">It is usually fished in tropical, rather than local waters, and is frozen at sea. On average only about 20 per cent will be eaten fresh (from frozen), and about 80 per cent will go on to be preserved: either in tins, or salted and dried to make <em>mojama</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_121">here</a>). The content of fat is what determines how a piece of the fish is used: the fatty pieces, notably the <em>ventresca</em> (belly), are the most coveted for eating fresh, smoking or canning; the least fatty will be used for <em>mojama</em>, though occasionally the <em>ventresca</em> is salted over a very long period of time (a couple of months), then pressed and hung, and can be exceptional.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose canned tuna</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Price is the main clue. Pole-and line-caught tuna will suffer less in the fishing and so the meat will be less damaged in terms of bruising, and the best and most expensive fish is cut and packed by hand, so that the processors can more easily keep a visual check on quality.</p>
<p class="method">The larger the tin the more intact the tuna – 2kg tins, for example, will have large cuts, whereas in cheaper, smaller tins (about 120g) you find a mix of pieces of ends of loins, large flakes or chunks.</p>
<p class="method">Usually tuna is packed in a conventional vegetable oil or a light olive oil, which is better than extra virgin olive oil, as the delicate flavour of the fish should be able to shine rather than compete with a more distinctive oil.</p>
<p class="method">Most canned tuna can also be found in brine and spring water – lighter, healthier preparations containing no fat which are excellent for special diets; however, you will not experience the luxurious texture of fish stored in oil.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_203"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg203.jpg"/></div>
<p class="recipe-head"><a id="pg_204"/>Atún rojo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Bluefin tuna</p>
<p class="flush_left">Fished in the Atlantic and most famously in the Mediterranean in the month of May, bluefin tuna is renowned for its high fat content, which gives luxuriously marbled, oily-textured, deep red meat with a very, very silky texture and almost ethereal flavour. This is the tuna that is loved by chefs and especially the Japanese, who will pay high prices for it for sushi and sashimi. Though it is usually eaten fresh or raw, it is also found preserved in jars of olive oil.</p>
<p class="indented">Spanish bluefin tuna is fished in Spain either in the Bay of Biscay or in the Mediterranean sea, but its stocks have decreased dramatically (largely because of the Japanese appetite for it) and fishing limitations have been established, so most canneries no longer conserve it in tins, opting instead for yellowfin or <em>bonito del norte</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">The oldest, most controversial, and some would say barbaric form of fishing for bluefin tuna is the <em>almadraba</em>, which still takes place each year around Barbate on the south coast, though on a much smaller scale than in the past.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p204a">La almadraba</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The <em>almadraba</em>, which translates from Andalusian Arabic as ‘the place where one beats something’, is the famous, bloody capturing-ground for the great bluefin tuna in a tradition that goes back at least 3,000 years and was devised by the Phoenicians, who valued tuna so highly that they featured the fish on their coins. However, it was truly perfected by the Arabs.</p>
<p class="indented">Every year between May and June, usually on the first full moon of the month, the shoals of fish migrating from the cold Atlantic to the warmer Mediterranean to spawn pass close to the coastline at Barbate near the Straits of Gibraltar. Here the local boats are waiting to drive them through a series of nets that are placed along the route of the fish until they become trapped in a central pool or <em>copo</em> near the water’s edge, where they are speared by the waiting fishermen.</p>
<p class="indented">The fish on this stage of their journey are known as <em>atún de derecho</em> and are at their prime and rich in fat, which gives the flesh a very visible marbling. Tellingly, this is known as <em>tocino,</em> which is also the name used for pork back fat, and the Spanish often call this tuna <em>el cerdo del mar</em>, the pig of the sea, not only because of its size but also because of the desirability of this fat, and also the fact that both have traditionally offered nose-to-tail eating for families.</p>
<p class="indented">Those who support the <em>almadraba</em> argue that for centuries it has been a sustainable form of fishing since only a certain number of fish are captured, and in their view this is preferable to the massive-scale plundering of bluefin tuna using vast, sophisticated trawlers often guided by spotter planes that is endangering the stocks, and in turn has caused the demise of all but a handful of the <em>almadrabas.</em></p>
<p class="indented">Once slaughtered, those <em>almadraba</em> fish destined for the local market are taken to the auctions and then cut up in a process known as <em>el ronqueo</em>, or ‘hoarseness’, which represents the sound of the knife as it hits the spine of the tuna and cuts along the length of it. The very best fish fetch prices two or three times higher than the rest, and their flavour will be so clean-tasting it needs no condiments. A small quantity still goes to be preserved as <em>mojama</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_121">here</a>) in the traditional way; however, the Japanese are so enamoured of bluefin tuna that 90 per cent of the <em>almadraba</em> catch leaves Spain for Japan, sold even before the boats have returned to shore.</p>
<p class="indented">Some tuna which escape the May cull are caught around September, again using the <em>almadraba</em> method of trapping, when they pass by the coast on the reverse trip – these are known as <em>de vuelta</em> (returning) – but by now, having spent time in warmer waters, they are about 30 per cent leaner and their meat is drier, so they are not highly rated gastronomically.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p204b">Bonito del norte</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is in a class apart from any others in the tuna family: elegant, subtle, with a sublime, delicate <a id="pg_205"/>flavour and white flesh. Expensive, yes, but just a small tin excites and satisfies the palate in the same way as a few slivers of the most expensive acorn-fed Ibérico ham. That said, I frequently find that initially the taste is quite surprising and foreign to the UK palate, more used to feisty skipjack. In the early days at Brindisa I would hold blind tastings of different labels of tuna and <em>bonito del norte</em> with both Spanish and English colleagues, and the reactions were very different. The Spanish would immediately recognise and prefer the <em>bonito del norte</em>, while the English would veer towards more familiar skipjack or yellowfin. Once converted, however, I find that people love the <em>bonito del norte</em>, even if its high price makes it a treat, rather than a regular food.</p>
<p class="indented">It is important to call the fish by its full name, <em>bonito</em> <em>del norte</em>, as there can be confusion with the Portuguese <em>bonito</em>, which is similar to a mackerel and is more often cured as a <em>salaz</em>ó<em>n</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_118">here</a>). Although its name means ‘of the north’, this just refers to the species, not the geographical origin, even though the best are actually landed in the north of Spain.</p>
<p class="indented">It is a very distinctive-looking fish, with silvery blue scales, huge round eyes and a large mouth with tiny teeth; it is much slimmer and smaller than yellowfin and bluefin tuna (typically weighing 6–8kg) and has whiter flesh, with a beautifully smooth, delicate flavour. The silky <em>ventresca</em> (belly), in particular, is in a league with the finest cured hams, caviars or <em>foies</em>, and although the fish is often eaten fresh, even when canned it is considered a real luxury.</p>
<p class="indented">The fishing season is June to September, and while <em>bonito</em> <em>del norte</em> can be fished in other seas such as the Pacific or the Indian Ocean, to which the fish often migrate, the very best are caught around the Bay of Biscay, where the fish come in search of food (sardines, anchovies and mackerel) having wintered in the Mar de los Sargazos (the Sargasso Sea), passing by the Azores on their journey, before returning south again to spawn. By now, although they are small to medium size, they are rich in the prized fat that makes them such an exquisite, tender delicacy. The fat settles particularly in the <em>ventresca</em>, the belly, giving the cuts from this part of the fish its special silkiness. Because they are caught locally they can be landed fresh, whereas those from further afield and in other parts of the world may be older and bigger, have a drier, less sought-after meat and will be frozen at sea.</p>
<p class="indented">In the old days around the Bay of Biscay the fish were caught in hazardous conditions using a method called trolling, which involved small rowing boats towing hooked lines behind them. The towing of lines is still done sometimes, but mostly about 20 fishermen fish from bigger boats, with fixed poles and lines, using live bait (anchovies) – a system introduced by the French Basques in the 1950s. Since each fish is caught individually, the fishermen can select the best and at the same time avoid catching other species, such as dolphins, or damaging the sea bed, as can happen with big trawlers using nets.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose <strong><em>bonito del norte</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">Often the name of the harbour where the fish was landed appears on the labelling: so you might see ports such as Getaria, Burrela, Arila, Lequeitio or Ondarroa listed. This shows that the fish comes from the prime waters of the Bay of Biscay.</p>
<p class="method">At the packing house the fish is divided into different cuts: <em>ventresca</em> (the velvety belly), whole loin, chunks of loin, and small pieces, known as <em>migas</em> (crumbs). The most prized <em>ventresca de bonito del norte</em> will consist of long <em>láminas</em> (fillets) of fish which should melt on your tongue and be beyond comparison with any other tuna – a luxury that will be reflected in the price.</p>
<p class="method">The best producers will also offer whole tuna loins in tall jars rather than tins, which allow you to see the quality: look for perfect, pale, undamaged flesh with no blood spots.</p>
<p class="method"><em>Migas</em> in oil are ‘crumbs’ of <em>bonito del norte</em> which are a fantastic, cheaper alternative for something like <em>empanada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_401">here</a>).</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec73"><a id="pg_206"/>Ensalada de bonito del norte con piquillos, huevos y garbanzos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">White tuna salad with <em>piquillo</em> peppers, eggs and chickpeas</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a very simple, summery, colourful salad that we serve at Casa Brindisa, which is designed to showcase the delicate flavour of <em>bonito del norte</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p204b">here</a>), though you could substitute yellowfin tuna.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon capers in brine or salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 large tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g tinned <strong><em>bonito del norte</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p204b">here</a>) in olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g jarred <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>), cut into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g good jarred chickpeas, drained</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons parsley, chopped</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">30ml good red wine vinegar, such as Cabernet Sauvignon</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="method">Soak the capers in water for 10 minutes, to remove the excess salt, changing the water twice, then drain them.</p>
<p class="method">Either grate the tomatoes or, if you prefer a smoother, more elegant texture, de-skin and de-seed them. The way to do this is to cut a cross in the top of each tomato and put them into a bowl. Pour boiling water over them, leave for about 10 seconds if they are very ripe, or up to a minute if not so ripe – just enough to loosen the skin, but no more, or the tomatoes will begin to cook – then cut them in half, scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon and chop the flesh.</p>
<p class="method">Put the eggs into cold water and bring to a simmer gently so that the shells don’t crack, then cook gently for 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water, then peel and slice.</p>
<p class="method">Drain the <em>bonito del norte</em> of its fishy oil, put it into a bowl and mix in the capers, together with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.</p>
<p class="method">Gently heat the rest of the olive oil and add the whole garlic clove to flavour it – once the clove starts to colour, take it out, put in the shallot, allow to soften, then put in the <em>piquillo</em> peppers and chickpeas and warm them through.</p>
<p class="method">Layer up the salad in a serving dish, beginning with the shallots, peppers and chickpeas, then the <em>bonito del norte</em> and capers and finally the tomato. Combine the dressing ingredients and drizzle over the top, but don’t toss through, as you don’t want to disturb the layering of the ingredients. Arrange the sliced hard-boiled eggs on the side or on top of the salad. Finish with the parsley.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec74"><a id="pg_207"/>Ensaladilla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Russian salad or white tuna and potato salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">In Britain Russian salad often has a bad name, thanks to the tinned versions that were popular in the sixties, but in Spain people love it, and when it is made carefully with fresh ingredients and good, preferably homemade, mayonnaise, it can be lovely, a bit like coleslaw really, in that it makes a good dish to have on the table with other small plates or to take on a picnic. My good friend Ambro, the cheesemaker in Burgos (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>), says it is a salad that makes him happy, and he packs it into a lunchbox to take with him when out on the family farm, or into a much bigger box to take to their <em>merendero</em> (converted mountain cave) for weekend get-togethers.</p>
<p class="indented">The salad was first created by French chef Lucien Olivier at the Hermitage restaurant in Moscow in 1860, combining freshly cooked vegetables and pickled vegetables in the Russian tradition, adding cooked meat and eggs, and mixing everything in mayonnaise, the fashionable dressing of the time.</p>
<p class="indented">The salad arrived in Spain during the twentieth century and its popularity may have grown partly out of a Spanish affinity with the Russians, who supported the Republican effort during the civil war, so much so that Franco’s government insisted that it be re-named ‘national potato salad’.</p>
<p class="indented">At its most basic the salad is made with chopped cooked potatoes, carrots, peas and possibly green beans, bound in mayonnaise, but there are endless embellishments that are often added, from cauliflower, cucumber and <em>piquillo</em> peppers to sliced apple, capers and olives, chopped hard-boiled eggs, even prawns, langoustines or tuna in oil or <em>escabeche</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">This particular recipe is a fishy variation from Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) that is a staple on her restaurant menu in Madrid, and while, of course, you can add other ingredients if you like, I feel the merit of Ana’s salad is that she keeps it simple, and her customers love it for that.</p>
<p class="indented">If you can’t find <em>bonito del norte en</em> <em>escabeche</em>, substitute tinned tuna in oil (drained very well, so that it is not too oily) with a little lemon juice squeezed over it.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">25–30 Marcona almonds (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p90a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 carrots, skin on, washed</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 small potatoes, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g Ortiz <strong><em>bonito del norte en escabeche</em></strong>, or tuna in oil, well drained and mixed with a little lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml good mayonnaise – preferably homemade</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan, add the almonds and fry gently, turning until golden, then lift out and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">Put the eggs into cold water and bring to a simmer gently so that the shells don’t crack, then cook gently for 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water, then peel.</p>
<p class="method">Cook the carrots and potatoes together in boiling salted water with their skins on until just tender. Be sure not to overcook them, as they need to retain their texture. Drain and cool, then rub off the skins. (If you are in a hurry you can cook the eggs, carrots and potatoes all together.)</p>
<p class="method">Chop the eggs, carrots and potatoes as finely as you can, so that they almost appear to be grated. This way you will stop the salad becoming too heavy once the mayonnaise is added. Add the fish and mix all the ingredients evenly. Mix well with the mayonnaise, and garnish with the almonds.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec75"><a id="pg_208"/>Barny’s butter bean, piquillo pepper, artichoke and olive salad</p>
<p class="flush_left1">This is another recipe from chef Barny Haughton. Being one of ten siblings and the father of five children, he embraces that wonderful, generous ethic that I also grew up with – and that is very Spanish – of welcoming everyone to come and eat. He made this salad with one of his favourite varieties of dried bean, the <em>judión</em>, as part of a many-course meal for myself and about twenty friends at his family home.</p>
<p class="indented">If you buy good olives marinated in oil, vinegar and herbs, you can use this marinade for the dressing, otherwise you will need a little extra virgin olive oil and sherry vinegar.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g <strong><em>judión</em></strong> beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#rec144">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, quartered</p>

<p class="ingredients">250g chargrilled artichokes in oil, drained and cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g black olives, such as Aragón, either plain, or marinated in oil, vinegar and herbs</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little extra virgin olive oil, if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little sherry vinegar, if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 spring onions, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">a bunch of fresh coriander, finely chopped</p>
<p class="method">Soak the beans for 24 hours in plenty of water (as they will expand).</p>
<p class="method">Drain the beans, put into a large pan of fresh water and add the onion, celery, carrot and leek, along with the <em>farcellet</em> and the peppercorns. Simmer gently for about 2 hours, until the beans are tender.</p>
<p class="method">While the beans are cooking, slice the aubergine, brush with a little olive oil and char-grill (preferably), or grill, until golden. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Once the beans are tender, take off the heat, put the pan under the cold tap and run water into it until the beans are cool, then drain them to avoid their skins cracking. Take out the vegetables and herbs and discard them. Season the beans with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p class="method">Put the beans into a serving bowl. Add the peppers, aubergine, artichokes and olives, with their own dressing and/or a little extra virgin olive oil and sherry vinegar, and mix well. Sprinkle the spring onions and coriander over the dish.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Lentil salad with <em>piquillo</em> peppers and anchovies</p>
<p class="flush_left">Good jarred or tinned lentils are fine for this and mean that you can make the salad quickly and easily. Sometimes, however, I find the tinned ones can be a little soft for salads, when you are tossing them with other ingredients, so when I have time I usually pre-prepare my own. If you want to do this, use 300g of Castilian green or dark Pardina lentils, or their equivalent. You don’t need to soak them, just wash them well, put them into a pan together with a whole carrot, a small onion, a bay leaf and some peppercorns, cover with cold water, bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes until tender. Drain and discard the vegetables, herbs and peppercorns.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec78"><a id="pg_211"/>Salmorejo de conejo al extremeño</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Roasted rabbit and red pepper salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a deconstructed version of the cold soup on <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_149">here</a> which makes for a wonderful, fresh, succulent and colourful salad, perfect for summer, and shouldn’t be confused with the similarly named <em>conejo al salmorejo</em>, which is a typical rabbit stew in the Canary Islands in which the meat is marinated in garlic, herbs and <em>pimentón</em> (paprika).</p>
<p class="indented">Ask your butcher to cut the rabbit into six, giving four legs and two loins, and keeping the lard from around the kidneys. Dotted on to the rabbit pieces, this will melt in the oven, keeping the meat succulent and moist and helping it to brown nicely.</p>
<p class="indented">The salad can be served warm or chilled – either way it is good with some country bread and a glass of dark, aromatic red wine from El Bierzo in the province of León.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 farmed rabbit (around 1.6kg), cut into 6 pieces, plus the lard from around the kidneys</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 red peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium tomato</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 spring onions</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Put the rabbit pieces in a roasting pan and season with salt, pepper and the oregano. Break up the lard and dot some on each piece of rabbit, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.</p>
<p class="method">Put the peppers into an ovenproof dish and smear with another tablespoon of olive oil. Wrap the head of garlic in foil.</p>
<p class="method">Put the roasting pan containing the rabbit, the dish of peppers and the foil-wrapped garlic into the preheated oven and leave all three for 20 minutes, until the rabbit is golden, the skins of the peppers have darkened and are beginning to char and the garlic is soft.</p>
<p class="method">Halfway through the baking time, put the tomato into a separate dish and put into the oven for 10 minutes. Add the spring onions to the dish of peppers for the last 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Take everything out of the oven, cover the red peppers with a tea towel and let them sweat to make peeling them an easier task.</p>
<p class="method">When cool enough to handle, strip the rabbit meat from the bones and put into a serving bowl. Peel the peppers, cut them into strips and add them to the rabbit. Peel the tomato and chop it finely, strip off the outer layers of the spring onions and slice diagonally, then add these two ingredients to the bowl. Peel 2 of the cloves of garlic and mash them with a fork, then add this pulp to the bowl, along with the rest of the whole roasted cloves.</p>
<p class="method">Combine the rest of the olive oil and the sherry vinegar and toss through the salad. Taste, season with salt if necessary, and serve.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘surely the best gift of Heaven’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Olive groves seem to bring out the philosopher and the romantic in their owners, perhaps because the olive tree is so elemental, its history so vast and its pace of life so slow that only poetry or fine prose can express the emotion of becoming its guardian. One inspirational olive grower, Joan Miralles of Finca Treurer in Mallorca (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p217a">here</a>), likes to quote Thomas Jefferson on the subject: ‘The olive tree is surely the best gift of Heaven.’ And olive oil, says Joan, ‘is an investment in health, a pleasure for the senses, a feast for the palate and balm for the soul’.</p>
<p class="indented">Often the most stunning olive oils, the ones that stand out against the crowd, are produced by people with a story to tell, and I think ultimately I make a connection with an oil when I know and relate to the people who make it, why they do it, where, and under what circumstances. Sometimes these are families making oil on a small, artisan scale in the most challenging circumstances; sometimes they are wine-makers, who can bring their skills of cultivation and blending (coupage) to a different fruit. Or they might be engineers or businessmen looking for a new way of life, who can combine old-fashioned methods and utter respect for the land with cutting-edge technology. For example, they might grow their olives in groves filled with wild flowers and grasses, irrigated only by rain water, then harvest them by hand, vibrating the trees and catching the fruit in an inverted umbrella to avoid bruising, before cold-pressing them in innovative, state-of-the-art mills.</p>
<p class="indented">Some of my favourite oils have the most lyrical of names that relate to their history; for example, in the Sierra de los Pedroches in Córdoba, Jesús Fernández de Castro and his wife, Tránsito Habas Sánchez, make an oil called ‘Olivar de la Luna’ – olive groves of the moon – which is a tribute to all the people who worked in extreme conditions in the previous three centuries to establish and nurture the olive groves in the tough, dry terrain of the remote and beautiful mountains. On nights of a full moon they would carry on working and the locals say that the leaves of the olive trees reflect the moonlight as a sign of appreciation.</p>
<p class="indented">Olive oil is quintessential to the Spanish table, vital for marinating, cooking and drizzling on to toasted bread, cured meats, cheeses, roasted vegetables, grilled fish, salads and soups. It is the essential ingredient of the classic garlic mayonnaise <em>alioli</em>, and is becoming more and more popular in sweet dishes, especially added to red fruits such as raspberries, strawberries and cherries, or used in ice cream, chocolate desserts and yogurts.</p>
<p class="indented">The average Spanish household gets through around 9.66 litres per capita of olive oil in a year, and Spain is the leading olive oil producer in the <a id="pg_214"/>world in terms of quantity (producing more than double that of Italy). However, if you compare the perception and appreciation of the oils from each country, both at home and abroad, there is a big gulf. In Spain olive oil is considered an all-purpose fat, and only around 30 per cent of the oil consumed is extra virgin. By contrast, in Italy 70 per cent is extra virgin, since it is revered as a delicate complement to exceptional dishes. On average Italians are prepared to pay two to three euros more per litre than the Spanish.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_213"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg213.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">Until relatively recently most Spanish oil came from gigantic mills run on the principle of economy of scale, whereas in Italy there may be many more producers, but the majority are small estates whose image is of integrity and individuality.</p>
<p class="indented">In the UK, if there is a choice of Spanish or Italian oils on a supermarket shelf, the chances are most people will choose an Italian one. Although I like to think that at Brindisa we have helped to turn around this perception, there is still a long way to go, and it is a subject I have often discussed with Roberto Gracia of La Maja, the family mill where we produce our own-label pure varietal oils and blends.</p>
<p class="indented">Roberto believes Spanish oils are every bit as good as their Italian counterparts, but, while Italian producers have valued and marketed their oils supremely well, the Spanish have lagged behind. ‘Even 30 years ago, if you went to a food trade fair the Italian brands already had a certain level of design, image and care taken with their product,’ he says. ‘They spent money on presentation, which cost them, but they valued their product because they were proud of the quality, so they put the little Italian flag on it. The Spanish went with plastic bottles, cheaply priced and badly presented, with ugly labels.’</p>
<p class="indented">Roberto went on to explain that many Spanish producers simply sold their oil to Italy in bulk to be bottled and marketed there, as they could make the same money as they would selling to the home public, but without the additional work of bottling the oil.</p>
<p class="indented">Over the last 15 years, however, a band of smaller Spanish producers have begun to take a leaf out of the Italian book, making high-quality characterful estate oils in smaller quantities, and taking care and time with the design of bottles and labels. As Roberto observes, however, it takes time to change the instinctive attitude of consumers who say, ‘If I am going to pay your price, I would rather have an Italian oil.’</p>
<p class="indented">Frustrating as this can be, Spanish olive oil has come a huge way since I bought my first bottles from Núñez de Prado in 1990, the year that the estate achieved organic certification: a first in Spain. I had stopped off in Madrid on my way to Burgos to meet cheese-maker Ambrosio Molinos, and inevitably I went food shopping in the city, where I spotted these beautiful bottles with their informative labels. I bought some of the oil, tasted it, immediately called the telephone number on the bottles and spoke to Paco, the eldest of the Núñez de Prado brothers and head of the operation. We agreed that I should make my way south to Baena. Coincidentally, I was also interested in the cheeses made in a tiny dairy in the village of Zuheros nearby, so I managed to visit both producers, and only months later, I and my earliest Brindisa colleague, Emma Ranson, were selling both the oils and cheeses in London.</p>
<p class="indented">We knew that initially we would have to convince people to try the oil, since only a decade earlier the industry had been in real crisis after a consignment of <em>colza</em> oil, made from brassica seeds and meant to be used as an industrial oil, had found its way into street markets and was being sold as olive oil. It coincided with the sale of tomatoes that were over-fertilised with chemicals, and in households where these two contaminated ingredients came together, many people suffered toxic syndrome, and around 600 died. At that time Spanish tomatoes were a great source of income abroad, so it suited the authorities to divert blame from the tomato crops on to the oil alone.</p>
<p class="indented"> It was against this backdrop of tainted reputation that Emma and I began selling our first bottles of Núñez de Prado. ‘Are you sure this won’t harm anyone?’ was the inevitable <a id="pg_215"/>question, but the fear faded once people got to know and trust this stunning oil, which we sell to this day. And over the years I have discovered many, many more exceptional Spanish oils, made by dedicated people who are championing local olives and sustainable or organic methods. I only wish I could bring all of them to Brindisa.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose and store olive oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Various indicators help to show the quality of an oil: for example, it might have a PDO (Protected Denomination of Origin) label, the bottles might be numbered as part of a limited production or notes on the bottle will state that methods satisfy environmental criteria. The best oils will usually be estate bottled, since this shows that the producers are involved in every step of the process, in which they will take great pride.</p>
<p class="method">Ultimately, though, it is all about the organoleptic qualities of an oil, and the only way to find your favourite is through tasting. The correct way to taste an oil is to use a blue glass with no stem, which allows you to warm it in your cupped hands, and not be prejudiced by its colour before smelling or tasting. Breathe in the aromas deeply, then taste a small mouthful by pressing the oil to the top of your mouth with your tongue and then swilling it around gently and swallowing slowly. The sensations of aroma and flavour that you experience might be anything from apples to tropical fruit to freshly mown grass: the important thing is to find a character you like, but also that suits the way you want to use it.</p>
<p class="method">When possible, look for new season oil and use it within its first year. Although you can keep oils longer, they don’t improve with age like wines, and their potency and impact reduces over time.</p>
<p class="method">Good oils are normally in dark bottles, to keep out the light in order to preserve the properties of the oil. If in doubt, keep your oil in a cupboard.</p>
<p class="method">These are notes on some of my favourites:</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p215a">Núñez de Prado, Flor de Aceite and extra virgin olive oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The pioneering Núñez de Prado brothers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_218">here</a>) produce their wonderful oils in Córdoba in Andalucía. The three main varietals of olives grown on the estate are the floral Picual, Hojiblanca (for sweetness) and Picudo (robust and more bitter), which, when combined, give the oils their distinctive character.</p>
<p class="indented">The limited production <em>Flor de Aceite</em>, ‘the flower of the oil’, is pure, raw and unfiltered. Instead of being pressed, the olive paste is allowed to seep naturally through a mesh, so it retains all of its intense character. The precious oil from each olive variety is kept separately and then the <em>coupage</em> is made of all three, to give the right combination of spicy fruit flavours and peppery aftertaste. Finally, the oil is bottled by hand, unfiltered (so it has some sediment) in numbered bottles, each with a red wax seal. The remaining paste is sandwiched between round mats (sadly, the original and beautiful mats made from <em>esparto</em> grass have had to be replaced by regulation EU plastic ones that are easier to wash). Then it is pressed to make the extra virgin olive oil, with the temperature not exceeding 20°C, so none of its character is lost.</p>
<p class="indented">Both oils have similar qualities of intense aromas of Cox’s apples, melons, passion fruit, papaya and a touch of lemon, and rich complex flavours of tropical fruit and herbs, and a good bitterness and pepperiness, which linger in the aftertaste of almonds and lemons. However, in the Flor de Aceite, these are more exaggerated.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Olivar de la Luna, Pozoblanco, Córdoba, organic single-estate extra virgin olive oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">An unfiltered green oil with golden hues made according to biodynamic techniques by Jesús Fernández de Castro and his wife, Tránsito Habas Sánchez, using native Nevadillo Blanco olives, supplemented by Lechín, Picudo or Manzanilla. The olives are stone-pressed immediately after harvest at room temperature, and the oil has an exceptionally pure flavour, rich in polyphenols, <a id="pg_216"/>antioxidants and vitamin E, with aromas of orange, spicy lemon and mango. It has a fruity taste with spicy nuances of apples, almonds and freshly cut grass, and is long, soft and sweet in the mouth, with a slightly bitter fruit flavour on the finish.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p216a">Marqués de Valdueza, Extremadura, estate-bottled extra virgin olive oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Alonso, the Marqués de Valdueza, and his son Fadrique planted their olive groves with four varieties: the local Morisca, cultivated by the Romans who once inhabited Extremadura, the Hojiblanca, a variety grown in the neighbouring region of Andalucía, and the more widely grown Arbequina and Picual. These are harvested separately, pressed in the modern mill on the farm, and blended to give an elegant oil with a great balance between the aromas of mango and deeper tones of tomato leaves. It has a lovely creamy texture with sweet almond and cobnut flavours, and a walnut-skin bitterness on the finish with some gentle pepper.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Aubocassa, Manacor, Mallorca, single estate extra virgin olive oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Owned by wine-makers Bodegas Roda of Rioja, the estate reflects the philosophy of a wine chateau applied to an olive grove, in that the oil is respected and treated as a fresh fruit juice that requires minimal processing to preserve its qualities. The oil has PDO status and is made solely from Arbequina olives, grown on a small family estate with an ancient Moorish farmhouse dating back to the twelfth century. The oil has citrus notes on the nose, with sharp apple, tomato, salad leaves, herbs and fennel, and flavours of almonds, dry hay and fresh vegetables, with a silky finish.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Casta Diva extra virgin olive oil, Parcent, Alicante</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Produced by the Gutiérrez de la Vega wine-making family (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>). The olives – Picual, Grosal, some Blanqueta and a little Arbequina – are collected from sheltered groves in the area of La Marina Alta, pressed at a low temperature in a small stone mill in what was their original wine bodega, and the oil is bottled without filtering.</p>
<p class="indented">The early harvest oil is golden yellow in colour with green tones, rich on the nose with floral notes, eucalyptus, mint, basil and rosemary. Its taste is soft, with some sweetness on the palate and a peppery finish. The late harvest oil is pressed from double the quantity of olives, which produce a fresh-tasting, deep green oil with aromas of fennel and mint, and a flavour that is grassy and fruity, with subtle spicy and bitter notes and an intense finish.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">La Maja, estate-bottled extra virgin olive oil, Mendavia, Navarra PDO</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Brindisa and La Maja have a strong collaboration in that not only do we buy their premium estate oils, but our own-label pure varietal oils and blends are produced at their mill. Historically, the Gracia family were successful grape growers in Rioja; however, in 1977 the current generation, brothers Roberto (who studied chemistry and has a master’s degree specialising in oils and fats), Mateo (in charge of the land), José Luís (an architect) and Carlos (an engineer), decided to give up the vineyards and pioneer the cultivation of olive trees in this fertile plain which is the highest olive-growing region in Spain. Here they developed a highly innovative and technically progressive olive oil operation dedicated to making a high-quality oil at an affordable price.</p>
<p class="indented">Their own estate-bottled extra virgin olive oil, produced from Arbequina olives, with 30 per cent of local Arróniz and 10 per cent of juicy, medium-sized Empeltre olives, is yellowish-green, with a clean, intense aroma, reminiscent of fresh green fruit, with banana-skin tones, tomato plant, grass, artichoke and apple, and a touch of kiwi, green <a id="pg_217"/>coffee bean, almonds and caramel. These notes are reaffirmed in the flavour, which has a medium bitterness and a slight late ‘bite’</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p217a">Treurer, Mallorca, Spain, extra virgin estate-bottled olive oil, PDO</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Mallorca produces excellent oils, and when I first tasted this one from the tiny estate of Finca Treurer, I was bowled over by its floral nose.</p>
<p class="indented">Joan Miralles is a Mallorcan businessman who changed lifestyle from the tourism industry to olive oil when he bought the estate back in March 2000 and began planting Arbequina trees for this single varietal oil. Treurer means treasure in Mallorquín, which perfectly describes the result: liquid gold, noted for its sublime fragrance and medium-fruity flavour, reminiscent of green almonds, hazelnuts, tomato plant, artichoke, fennel and banana, with a touch of bitterness and moderate piquancy.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Ninou, Oleum Flumen, Lleida, Catalunya, extra virgin olive oil estate-bottled</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The name Ninou comes from the Latin <em>annum novum</em> (new year) and reflects the idea of facing the different challenges that each harvest brings. The small production of numbered bottles is made by Martí Terés i Ríos, who supplements the olives from his own groves by working with a tight selection of local growers. The olives are predominantly Arbequina, with a small percentage of local Vera and Salze Fulla, all of which are harvested manually in the traditional manner. The oil is a deep straw yellow, with fruity aromas of ripe green olives which give way to notes of green grass, tomato, avocado, banana, green almond, artichoke, fennel and green walnuts. The flavour is intense, but with an elegant balance on the palate, a long finish and a sweet and nutty aftertaste.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Vea, Lleida, Catalunya, early harvest</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The fourth generation of the Vea family to be producing oil is Gerard, who along with his father, Avelino, runs their mill in the little village of Sarroca de Lleida, which is surrounded by 200-year-old olive trees, all of the local Arbequina variety, some of which are harvested in late October or early November to produce this oil. Although the Arbequina is a quite high-yielding variety, when picked this early the harvest is small, but the quality is very high and the oil is particularly aromatic and flavourful.</p>
<p class="indented">Aromas of smoky olives mingle with light dried herbs and some deeper earthier tones, and attractive nutty flavours combine with the freshness of green apple skins, balanced by a long finish of gentle pepper.</p>

<h2 class="box-head" id="box10"><a id="pg_218"/>The Oils of Núñez de Prado</h2>
<p class="flush_left">‘The earliest and purest memory I have is the smell of freshly prepared olives on entering the mill with my father,’ says Francisco Núñez de Prado (known as Paco), whose family’s oils are made in Baena, in the province of Córdoba in Andalucía. ‘It was a smell full of fragrance, innocence and purity and it is engraved forever in my memory. My dream is that the paradise of the olive grove, the greatest magical forest planted in the history of mankind, becomes a kind of cultural and geographical heritage, because it is a source of wealth and health and helps to prevent desertification. My dream is that it becomes almost eternal, that this landscape will not change and that it will always be a source of human nutrition.’</p>
<p class="indented">Núñez de Prado was the first olive oil to receive organic certification in Spain in 1990. Although the estate has produced olive oil since 1795, it wasn’t until 1986 that the three brothers – Paco, Andrés and Felipe, the seventh generation of the family – made the bold move to pioneer high-quality organic oil.</p>
<p class="indented">It was the late Andrés, an agricultural engineer, who recognised that the increased use of pesticides in Spanish agriculture left a residue in the olives, and so he drove the conversion to organic farming, bringing together traditional techniques and innovative technology in order to nurture the land and crops that he and his brothers had inherited. Now the estate is recognised all over the world for the family’s dedication to purity and perfection, and they have achieved PDO (Protected Denomination of Origin) status, but in 1990 this was the first time that the family had exported their oils, and I felt we shared the same pioneering spirit, and a similar ethic of mutual respect for the chain that links land, farmers, suppliers and customers.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em>almazara</em> (oil mill) is on the edge of Baena town, and a painting of Santa Lucía, patron saint of the mill, greets you as you pass under the arched entrance into a vast courtyard, surrounded by whitewashed buildings where the oil is produced and stored. Nowadays visitors come every year to see the groves, taste the oils and enjoy a traditional miller’s breakfast of olive oil, oranges and honey, or lunch of a variety of dishes, all laced with estate oil.</p>
<p class="indented">The qualities of a good oil are mostly defined by the land in which the olives grow. All the way through the process, producers have to make decisions according to the philosophy they have <a id="pg_219"/>chosen for their crop and their business, and it is out in the groves that the Prado brothers really come alive. At heart they are farmers, from a long line of farmers, and the land is what they know and love. Instead of ploughing the groves, which can cause soil erosion, they allow wild grasses and flowers to grow and only cut these back manually once a year, near the base of the trees. The cuttings are then left as a mulch to capture rain and retain moisture.</p>
<p class="indented">The belief is that every small detail contributes to great oil, so the trees are trimmed by a skilled pruner, one of a long line of pruners who have worked only for the estate. A good pruner looks to protect the tree bark from the sun, to keep the height moderate, so that the sap can reach across the width as well as the height of the branches, and to balance the trees’ shape, size and density to allow the olives to fall easily through the branches at harvest time. The trimmed branches are left where they fall, as, like the cut grasses, they help to retain the humidity of the soil.</p>
<p class="indented">The olives are picked by hand with a ‘milking motion’, to avoid bruising, then washed in the groves to remove leaves and twigs, which go into natural compost to feed the trees. Then, since speed is of the essence, in order to retain the highest properties of the olives, they are mashed within three hours of picking, using the traditional granite cones first introduced by the Romans. From here the resulting paste goes to make the mill’s finest <em>Flor de Aceite</em> and cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p215a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Everything that the olives have to give is maximised. After the oils have been produced the paste is sold off and sent away so that plain olive oil can be extracted from it. A further treatment produces characterless pomace oil, and finally the leftover pulp and olive stones are compressed into slow-burning stones which are used for fuel. On patios and in restaurants you can see these being used in the ingenious <em>mesas de camilla</em> – round tables which have a shelf at foot level, with a round hole cut in the centre, in which, during the winter, a wok-like pan of the coals gives out a smokeless heat. The tables are draped in heavy cloths, and you sit with your feet tucked underneath, resting on the shelf and keeping snug and toasty.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="recb4"><a id="pg_221"/>SOPAS CALIENTES</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Hot soups</p>
<p class="flush_left">There is a Valencian name I love, <em>sopa cubierta</em> (‘pantry’ soup), which to me sums up the way that simple soups, often served before or alongside other small plates, are very much a part of day-to-day eating in Spain. Few, except for some fish soups which border on stews, are very elaborate.</p>
<p class="indented">At one time bars and cafés would always have a bowl of stock on the counter, often made with a ham bone, so that people could take a cup or bowlful to warm them up on an icy day, and many soups are little more than that: good stock, perhaps with some <em>fideo</em> (fine noodles), cooked beans or chickpeas added; quite basic, though very healthy, such as <em>sopa de farigola</em>, Catalan thyme soup. Essentially, it is crunchy bread soaked and then whisked in hot water, and infused with branches of thyme, garlic cloves and a pinch of salt. Sometimes an egg is added or whisked into the soup before pouring into bowls. Sounds easy, but like so many supposedly simple things it is deceptive: thyme that isn’t properly aromatic or bread that is too soft, for example, can easily spoil it.</p>
<p class="indented">Castilian garlic soup is a similar quintessential and inexpensive bowl of sustenance that is entirely dependent on good stock to carry the flavour, and is usually served over a poached egg, which you break up and mix in as you eat. However, you will find more sophisticated contemporary versions, for example garnished with slices of fried <em>chorizo</em> or <em>panceta</em>, and a handful of parsley for colour. In its traditional form it is a soup I have often eaten with our friends Ambro and Asun and their family in Pedrosa de Duero (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>), and if any was left over, by the next morning the bread would have absorbed all the stock, making it thick enough to slice, so Ambro would have it this way for breakfast with a glass of wine!</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec79"><a id="pg_222"/>Potaje de berros</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Gomeran watercress, bean and potato soup</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The interior of the island of Gomera, the second smallest of the Canaries, is very damp, so watercress grows in abundance, which comes as a real surprise when all you see at first is beach.</p>
<p class="indented">On Gomera this dish is considered a <em>potaje</em> (stew), but although the watercress is bolstered with potatoes and beans, and the <em>panceta</em> and chicken stock give a meatiness to the base flavours, it is still quite light, so I think of it as a soup. If you use vegetable stock and omit the <em>panceta</em> it makes a good dish for non-meat-eaters, too.</p>
<p class="indented">I first came across it some years ago on a family holiday. On a tropical morning we hiked for about three hours through the shade of the damp green forest of the Parque de Garajonay, with its moss-velvet trees, until we came to a valley filled with mist and found a little lodge where we were served the <em>potaje</em> in wooden bowls, like lengths of little hollowed-out tree trunks.</p>
<p class="indented">It is easiest to use good, jarred beans, drained, or tinned ones, well rinsed. However, if you want to cook your own dried beans, leave 100g to soak in water overnight, then rinse them, put them in a pan with copious amounts of cold water, bring them to a simmer and cook for 1–2 hours – you can add a piece of pork belly, an onion and a bouquet garni for flavour if you like. When the beans are tender, drain off the excess water.</p>
<p class="indented">Make sure you remove any green shoots from the garlic to avoid bitterness.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, cut into lardons</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g potatoes, peeled and diced (about 1cm)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre cold <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (dark chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g watercress, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g cooked beans, preferably <strong><em>alubias</em></strong> (white beans)</p>
<p class="method">Put the lardons into a dry pan and fry until they release their fat and become crispy, then lift out and keep to one side. Add the olive oil to the same pan, stirring it into the hot fat released by the <em>panceta</em>, and when hot add the garlic, letting it sweat briefly.</p>
<p class="method">Before the garlic turns golden, add the potatoes with a pinch of salt to help them sweat along with the garlic. The potatoes don’t need to brown either, so keep stirring them around the pan for 4 minutes, just to allow them to become coated in oil and garlic.</p>
<p class="method">Pour in the chicken stock and, keeping the pan on a medium heat, simmer until the potatoes are cooked through. Add the watercress and cook on a low heat for a further 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon around half of the soup into a bowl and purée with a hand blender, then return this to the pan, add the cooked beans and heat through over a medium heat for a couple more minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary, bearing in mind that the stock will have its own saltiness, and if you are using jarred beans they will have been kept in brine, so the soup may not need more salt.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the soup into bowls, garnish with the reserved lardons and serve hot.</p>

<p class="flush_left"><em>La castañada</em> is the chestnut festival that is celebrated in the first week of November in many villages of Spain. The nuts are often roasted and served with grilled <em>chorizo</em> washed down with cider, young wine or Moscatel, as well as being used to make soup, since the chestnut and pumpkin season coincide.</p>
<p class="indented">Make sure you select pumpkin or squash with brightly coloured flesh, so that when blended with the chestnuts the soup keeps as much vibrancy as possible.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">20g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g pumpkin or butternut squash, chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small onion, chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 stick of celery, chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 600–750ml hot <strong><em>caldo vegetal</em></strong> or <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (vegetable or dark chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g peeled and cooked chestnuts, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons double cream (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil and butter over a high flame in a large pan, and when the butter has melted and begun to sizzle add the vegetables. Stir until they begin to turn a light golden colour, then turn down the heat to low, add a pinch of salt and allow to sweat uncovered for 10 minutes, checking regularly to make sure the vegetables are still <em>al dente</em> – don’t let them overcook.</p>
<p class="method">Pour in 400ml of the hot stock together with 400ml of water, and add most of the chopped chestnuts, reserving a few for the garnish.</p>
<p class="method">Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer for 5 minutes to heat the chestnuts through and finish cooking the vegetables. Taste and season if necessary, then blend, using a hand blender.</p>
<p class="method">The chestnuts will act as a thickener and turn the soup a brown colour. Add another 200ml of hot stock, bring back up a simmer, and add the double cream, if using – this will lighten both the colour and texture of the soup and bring out the creamy flavours of pumpkin and chestnut.</p>
<p class="method">If the soup feels a bit too dense (some chestnuts absorb the liquid more than others), add more hot stock and serve immediately, garnished with the reserved chopped chestnuts and the parsley.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec81"><a id="pg_225"/>Menestra de verduras</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Spring vegetable bowl</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Menestra de verduras</em> is often served in little bowls in fashionable Madrid bars, but probably the best I have ever had was made for me by Raúl Domingo, when I stayed with him and his family in the city. Raúl is a history lecturer, his wife, Carmen, a photographer, lecturer and archivist, and their student daughter Livia is a jazz and classical violinist. The shelves of their home groan with incredible books and the walls are covered with extraordinary paintings, and when it comes to food, Raúl is in charge of the kitchen and his cooking is excellent. While I was writing up recipe notes he brought me a Madrid tapa of fine crisps and <em>escabeche</em> mussels (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_111">here</a>) and then a little bowlful of this light, delicious, nutritious <em>menestra</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">The key is in the initial brief and individual blanching of the green vegetables, apart from the courgette, which is fried. It may seem a lot of fuss, but it really is worth it, so that you keep all the flavour, texture, bite and particularly the bright colour of each vegetable. You can use frozen peas – but full-sized ones, not petits pois,</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 small eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 small-medium artichokes</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g fresh or frozen garden peas</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g Brussels sprouts</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 green asparagus spears</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g fresh broad beans</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 spring onions, white parts only, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 carrots, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 courgette, cut lengthways, central seed part scooped out, cut into slices</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 aubergine, chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g <strong><em>tacos</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_175">here</a>) of Serrano ham</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ tablespoon plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 mint leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 red <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers from a jar, cut into thin slices</p>
<p class="method">Put the eggs into a pan of cold water and bring to a simmer gently so that the shells don’t crack, then cook gently for 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water, then peel and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Trim and quarter the artichokes (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_350">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Have ready a bowl of iced water. Blanch the green vegetables one at a time. Boil the peas in 2 litres of salted water for about a minute, then lift out with a sieve and put into the iced water. Cook the Brussels sprouts in the same water for about 3 minutes, until just tender, then lift out with the sieve again and add to the bowl of iced water.</p>
<p class="method">Repeat the process with the asparagus, cooking the spears for about 2 minutes, the artichokes, for 3 minutes, and finally add the broad beans, for about 2 minutes. Keep back 1 litre of the cooking liquid and discard the rest.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a deep sauté or frying pan and add the onions, garlic, carrots, courgette and aubergine. Season and cook gently until soft but not coloured. Add the ham and cook briefly, then sprinkle in the flour and move everything gently around the pan, so that the flour brings the vegetables together, but take care not to burn it. Add a little of the reserved vegetable cooking water and cook briefly to thicken the liquid a little.</p>
<p class="method">Drain all the green vegetables from the bowl of ice through a colander and add to the pan, stir well, then add the parsley and the rest of the reserved vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer gently, uncovered, for about 10 minutes, until all the vegetables are just tender and the stock is slightly thickened and aromatic.</p>
<p class="method">Taste and correct the seasoning if necessary, and add the mint leaves just before serving. Serve in a big shallow dish, topped with the <em>piquillo</em> peppers and slices of the reserved hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec82"><a id="pg_226"/>Porrusalda de la casa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Brindisa vegetable broth with salt cod and fennel</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a lovely, wholesome and light broth which in Spain is often made just with garlic, leeks, onions, squash and potatoes. However, when our head chef, Leo, decided to put it on the menu at Casa Brindisa, he added some fennel and salt cod and people love it. The quality of the stock is important, so it is worth making your own.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 leeks, sliced quite chunkily</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium onion or 1 shallot, sliced quite chunkily</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ of a butternut squash, peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bulb of fennel, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 large potatoes, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.25 litres hot <strong><em>caldo vegetal</em></strong> (vegetable stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g de-salted cod (optional) – ideally an inexpensive cut such as <strong><em>cola</em></strong> (tail), <strong><em>migas</em></strong> (crumbs) or <strong><em>tacos</em></strong> (chunks) (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_329">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil gently in a large pan, add the garlic and cook for a couple of minutes until softened but not coloured, then add the leeks and onion or shallot and cook for 3 minutes. Add the squash and fennel and continue to cook for another 3 minutes. Finally, add the potatoes and let everything cook gently for 10 minutes until lightly coloured.</p>
<p class="method">Add the hot stock, cover the pan and simmer over a medium heat for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, if adding de-salted cod, blanch it in a pan of boiling water for about 3 minutes, then drain under the cold tap – just until the fish is cool enough to handle. Put it on a chopping board, remove the skin, and flake carefully to find and remove any bones. Add the flakes to the soup 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Season to taste and serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Fish soup</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is an amazing, light soup made with prawns and squid and a delicate <em>fumet</em> (fish stock) whose flavours are beautifully balanced by the sweetness of the carrot and the acidity of the tomatoes. We owe the recipe to Sandra Salcedo, chef and daughter of José Salcedo, of Navarrico in Navarra, who prepare superb jarred vegetables and <em>piquillo</em> peppers, and with whom we have worked for almost 25 years.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ an onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g squid, cut into 2cm pieces (or squid rings)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small potato, chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, coarsely grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre <strong><em>fumet blanco</em></strong> (white fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>), at room temperature</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g peeled prawns, cut into 2cm pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a deep pan or casserole on a low to medium heat. Add the onion, stir and leave to sweat for 2 minutes. Mix in the tomato and a pinch of salt, coating the tomato in oil and onion and allowing the mixture to continue sweating for 4 more minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the squid and stir into the other ingredients, then fry over a medium heat until the squid and onion just start to brown.</p>
<p class="method">Add the potato and carrot, stirring and frying for 2 more minutes, then pour in 200ml of the stock, stir and turn up the heat, mixing the juices from the bottom of the pan into the stock. Pour the remaining stock into the pan and bring gently back to the boil. Turn down the heat, skim off any froth with a spoon, and simmer until the potato is cooked through.</p>
<p class="method">Take the pan from the heat and add the pieces of prawn. Leave the soup to rest for 5 minutes, which will allow the prawn pieces to cook through in the hot liquid while preserving their texture and flavour. Taste and season with a little more salt if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Serve immediately in soup bowls, sprinkled with parsley.</p>

<p class="recipe-headg" id="rec84">Gambas al ajillo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Large garlic and chilli prawns</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is one of the all-time favourite combinations in our tapas bars and restaurants. There is something irresistible about the smell of the chilli and garlic sizzling in the hot terracotta dishes. Buy the biggest and best prawns or langoustines you can afford.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">20 tiger prawns or langoustines, fresh, or if frozen, defrosted</p>
<p class="ingredients">extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 cloves of garlic, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 dried <strong><em>guindilla</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>), finely chopped, or 2 teaspoons crushed chilli</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Remove the heads and shells from the prawns, but leave the tails on. Heat 2.5cm of olive oil in a flat-bottomed heatproof terracotta dish or a frying pan and once very hot put in the garlic and chilli. Sauté briefly, then add the prawns. Cook on one side for 90 seconds, then turn over and cook for another 40 seconds – that is all you need, as the prawns will continue to cook after you take the terracotta dish/pan from the heat.</p>
<p class="method">Scatter with sea salt and chopped parsley and serve immediately, straight from the terracotta dish/pan.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec85"><a id="pg_230"/>Calamar frito al pimentón</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fried squid with paprika</p>
<p class="flush_left">In summer, rather than deep-fry the squid, you could barbecue it, without the floured coating, and serve it with this quick, fresh, slightly spicy sauce.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 1–2 people</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g cleaned squid</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g wholemeal flour, for coating</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml vegetable oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón de la Vera dulce</em></strong> (sweet smoked paprika)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 spring onions, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 fresh large red chilli, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of chopped parsley leaves</p>
<p class="method">To make the dressing, heat the oil in a pan, add the garlic and cook gently until it just begins to turn golden, then add the spring onions and cook for another 1–2 minutes. Lift out the garlic and onions with a slotted spoon and reserve, take the pan off the heat, let the oil cool down, then mix in the chilli and parsley, so that they coat in the cooling oil. Mix in the reserved garlic and onions and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Cut the squid into 1cm strips and have the flour ready in a shallow bowl.</p>
<p class="method">Pass the strips of squid through the flour. Heat the oil in a pan, making sure it comes no higher than a third of the way up. If you have a thermometer it should be 180°C, otherwise drop in a few breadcrumbs, and if they sizzle the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p class="method">Put in the squid and fry until golden and crispy, lift out, drain on kitchen paper, then season.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange on a plate, drizzle with the dressing, and finish with a sprinkling of <em>pimentón</em>.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Crisp little shrimp pancakes</p>
<p class="flush_left">I had these wonderful, elegant morsels served as a tapa when I was staying at the Posada Rural Ríoturbio, a country house hotel outside Comillas in Cantabria. Crisp, lacy and golden, they almost snap when you break them to find the fragments of shrimp inside (you can also use prawns). The secret to the crunch is the chickpea flour.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 15</p>
<p class="ingredients">55g chickpea flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>

<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons very finely chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">vegetable oil, for frying</p>
<p class="method">Put the flour and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl and slowly add about 130ml of water, mixing until you have a creamy, pancake-like batter. Season with salt and paprika, if using, then put into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Mix the shrimps with the onion, parsley and garlic, then add to the batter.</p>
<p class="method">Pour enough oil into a large frying pan to give a depth of around 7mm. When medium-hot, fry in batches, taking dessertspoonfuls of the batter and dropping them carefully into the oil, quickly spreading the batter out so that it flattens and becomes lace-like and crispy as it fries. Turn each <em>tortilleta</em> once, until light golden on each side. Lift out, drain on kitchen paper and eat straight away.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘colour and flavouring’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Along with Hungary, Spain produces and consumes the most paprika (<em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em>) in Europe. It is added to soups and stews; it provides the colour and flavouring for chorizo, and it is ubiquitous as a condiment, often sprinkled on eggs or salads for colour or used in dressings and dry marinades.</p>
<p class="indented">So it is sometimes easy to forget that the spice didn’t actually exist until the end of the seventeenth century, since peppers, from which <em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em> is made, only arrived in Spain with Christopher Columbus in the sixteenth century. They were first cultivated by monks at the Monastery of Yuste in Cáceres, Extremadura, and by the end of the seventeenth century it was realised that they could also be smoke-dried and that their skins, and sometimes seeds and veins, could be ground to make a spice. Once discovered, <em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em> began to be used as a seasoning and marinade for almost every dish in Spain, as well as for colouring and flavouring sausages and other meats. The main production centred around La Vera in Extremadura, and at first the peppers were ground in water-powered flour mills; however, once electricity arrived in La Vera, production grew and improved significantly.</p>
<p class="indented">The species of the Capsicum genus from which <em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em> is made is <em>Capsicum annuum</em>, which includes fruit spanning from the large mild Bola varietals through to the bittersweet <em>Capsicum longum</em> and the smaller hot Ocales, each of which produce <em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em> of different character and heat from <em>dulce</em> (sweet and mild) to <em>picante</em> (quite sharp and hot). You might also see <em>agridulce</em> (bittersweet and medium hot), and cooks in different regions will select the style best suited to the dish they are preparing. While <em>dulce</em> and <em>agridulce</em> tend to be the most popular around Spain, as they give a dish good balance without being too fierce, hotter varieties are favoured in the Canary Islands, Galicia and Extremadura.</p>
<p class="indented">The ripeness of the fruit, the soil and climate in which they are grown, and the production method all help determine the character and quality of the finished spice. A paprika producer will want his peppers to be well ripened in good fertile soil, then selected carefully before the process of drying, using smoke, sun or air, begins. Preferably this will be done slowly, since if the peppers are overheated or dried too quickly the paprika can be bitter and the colour very dark.</p>
<p class="indented">The two main styles are <em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em> <em>de La Vera</em> from Extremadura and <em>piment</em>ó<em>n</em> <em>de Murcia.</em></p>
<h4 class="c_head">Pimentón de La Vera</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Protected and watered by the Sierra de Gredos mountains, the privileged pepper fields of La Vera produce excellent fruit, which is harvested <a id="pg_234"/>at the end of the summer and usually smoke-dried on the farmers’ holdings. The gentle process harks back to the seventeenth century and takes about two weeks, during which time the water content of the peppers is reduced from about 80 per cent to 15 per cent before the fruit is ground in stone mills.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_233"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg233.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">Look out for the DOP label and the typical oblong tins which are beautifully lithographed.</p>
<p class="indented">Pimentón de La Vera paprikas have a deep smoky flavour and their colours can vary from coppery to dark red. They suit bolder dishes such as game, meat and potatoes and of course are used in the cures for <em>chorizo</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">There are three styles: <em>dulce</em> (mild) has a sweet flavour and is made primarily from Bola and Jaranda pepper varietals. <em>Agridulce</em>, or <em>ocal</em>, is a semi-sweet paprika with a touch of heat on the finish made from Jaranda and Jariza varietals. <em>Picante</em> is hot paprika made mainly from Jeromín, Jariza and Jaranda varietals.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Pimentón de Murcia</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This orangey-red paprika from the Mediterranean coast is ground predominantly from the Bola family of peppers: small, round, bright red, aromatic and sweet with a good fruity flavour. They are either dried for a few days under the sun or in warm air chambers for 8–10 hours. The sun-dried peppers will be redder and more aromatic. Once dried, the fruit is stone-ground to a fine powder which has a fresh, almost tomatoey flavour, well suited to the more delicate dishes of this coastline where rice, vegetables and fish predominate.</p>
<p class="indented">This paprika also comes in hot, mild and <em>agridulce</em>/bittersweet versions.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to buy, store and use <strong><em>pimentón</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Jars of the generic spice with no country of origin will be a mix of paprikas of different origin and may not offer the best quality.</p>
<p class="flush_left">The spice starts to deteriorate almost as soon as it has been ground, so buy it in small quantities and store it in an airtight container, so it is out of the light.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">The colour of the paprika will vary according to the style and some will be more or less ground. The aroma, however, should always overwhelm your senses. If it is dusty or flat it has been sitting on a shelf too long.</p>
<p class="flush_left">Be careful not to overheat the spice when adding to hot oil, especially, as it burns easily and can turn bitter.</p>

<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, preferably Cabernet Sauvignon</p>
<p class="method">Cut the squid tubes into strips about 4cm long and 0.5cm wide.</p>
<p class="method">Cut the beans into lengths of a similar size to the squid, then blanch in boiling salted water for a minute or two – they should still be crunchy. Drain under the cold tap to halt the cooking, then make a slit along each bean lengthways and open out like a book – this will help them to absorb the flavours when you add them to the squid, garlic and sliced pepper.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a pan, add the garlic and squid, and then the slices of pepper. Sauté briefly until they all colour a little. Then add the beans and toss all together until the beans are heated through. Add the vinegar and continue to heat through for 1 minute more.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Octopus Galician-style</p>
<p class="flush_left">Our executive chef, Josep, cooks whole octopus for this, using a technique that he calls <em>asustar el pulpo</em>: scaring the octopus. He fills a large pan to just over halfway with water, adds the carrots, shallots and peppercorns, then brings it to the boil and dunks in the octopus with the head upright, counts to ten and lifts it out, drains off the water, then repeats the process twice more. This helps to soften and curl the tentacles, and after the final dunking the octopus will have visibly shrunk. Finally, he removes the tentacles (the head can be kept for a seafood salad), returns them to the pan and cooks them as in the recipe below.</p>
<p class="indented">For ease, however, I have suggested you buy ready-prepared octopus.</p>

<p class="method">Bring a pan of water to the boil, add the carrots, shallots and peppercorns, put in the octopus, turn down to a simmer and leave to cook gently for 40–45 minutes, until tenderised (check by pricking the chunky parts of the tentacles). Lift out with a slotted spoon, and cut the tentacles into 1cm slices. Reserve the pan of cooking water, but discard the vegetables and peppercorns.</p>
<p class="method">Cook the potatoes in the same water for 20–25 minutes, or until just tender, then cut in half lengthways and arrange in a serving dish with the octopus slices on top.</p>
<p class="method">Sprinkle with the <em>pimentón</em> and drizzle with olive oil and a light scattering of sea salt, if you like (remember, though, that the octopus will be quite salty).</p>

<p class="flush_left"><em>Romesco</em> sauce is typically served on the side of barbecued or pan-fried squid, octopus or cuttlefish, but in this recipe, which uses baby squid (<em>chipirones</em>), the ingredients are all cooked together to create a warming, homely little stew which is thickened at the end with a <em>picada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>), in this case a paste of crushed fried bread, nuts and sautéd garlic. Traditionally, the stew would be made in a <em>barro</em>, or clay pot.</p>
<p class="indented">If <em>chipirones</em> aren’t available, you can use small squid (<em>calamares</em>), up to about 6cm. It’s best to get the fishmonger to remove the black ink sac for you, while keeping the little tentacles intact and in place.</p>

<p class="method">Soak the peppers in warm water for 30 minutes, then scrape out the flesh and set aside, keeping the skins too.</p>
<p class="method">Either grate the tomatoes, or, if you prefer, de-skin and de-seed them (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_206">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Heat a little oil in a deep pan or casserole, put in the whole pepper skins and garlic cloves and cook gently until coloured, then lift out, discard the pepper skins and keep the garlic to one side for the <em>picada.</em> Keep the pan ready to cook the squid.</p>
<p class="method">If you are using <em>calamares</em>, open them out and score them with a sharp knife diagonally in one direction and then the other to form a diamond pattern, making sure you don’t cut all the way through (<em>chipirones</em> don’t need scoring). Put the pan back on the heat, and when hot add the <em>chipirones</em> or <em>calamares</em> and fry quickly until coloured on all sides. Remove from the pan and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook for 10 minutes until softened, then add the reserved pepper flesh, the <em>chipirones</em> or <em>calamares</em> and the stock and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, until reduced by half.</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>picada</em>, break up the slice of fried bread and either pound with the nuts and reserved garlic, using a pestle and mortar, or pulse in a blender, then add the olive oil a little at a time until you have a rough paste. Add the picada to the stew to further thicken the sauce, and then at the final moment stir in the vinegar.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Anchovies with sprouting broccoli, fried egg, breadcrumbs and smoked anchovy dressing</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a recipe from our friends at the Dehesa tapas bar in London, who reckon that the metallic-tasting sprouting broccoli combined with the salty umami of the anchovies is a match made in heaven. They dry out the salted anchovies until they are brittle, so that their flavour is intensified, and when they are mixed with the <em>migas</em> (breadcrumbs), they give a crunch to the tapa. As well as salted anchovies, they use quite sweet and subtle beech-smoked anchovies, combined with sweet wine vinegar in the dressing.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4 with other tapas</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g sprouting broccoli, trimmed of any woody ends and cut into bite-size florets</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs</p>

<p class="forhead">For the smoked anchovy dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 smoked anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml Moscatel vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">lemon juice, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="method">For the <em>migas</em>, rinse and dry the salted anchovies, then split each one in two and carefully remove the backbone (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p126b">here</a>) so that you have 4 fillets. Chop these finely and mix with the breadcrumbs. Place on a tray and put in a cool dry place, such as the oven on its lowest temperature, for 3–4 hours to dry out until crisp.</p>
<p class="method">Take a medium pan and pour in enough olive oil to cover the surface. Add the dried-out anchovies and breadcrumbs, together with the garlic, and cook over a medium heat until the breadcrumbs are lightly browned. Season well and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the broccoli florets for 3–4 minutes, then refresh in cold water, drain and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">For the dressing, chop the smoked anchovies and mix with the shallot. Pour the vinegar over and add a squeeze of lemon juice. Pour on the extra virgin olive oil. Mix everything together well, season to taste, and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put the drained broccoli in a sauté pan with some oil and warm through over a medium heat. Transfer to a serving bowl. Season well, then spoon the smoked anchovy dressing over the top.</p>
<p class="method">Heat a small non-stick pan over a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil. Crack the eggs into the pan and lightly fry them, ensuring the yolks are still runny. Season and place on top of the broccoli and anchovy dressing. Spoon the anchovy crumbs over the top and serve, breaking up the eggs as you do so.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="recb6"><a id="pg_241"/>CROQUETAS Y BUÑUELOS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Croquettes and fritters</p>
<p class="flush_left">I know people in London who are <em>croqueta</em> obsessives and have been around every Spanish restaurant or bar, trying them out, comparing notes and looking for new variations on the typical chicken and/or ham recipe, which is traditionally a way of finishing up leftover pieces of meat from the Sunday <em>cocido</em> (stew). Done well, these little croquettes, made with thick, creamy béchamel paste, coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried, can be wonderful, and in Spain every good cook feels they are going to be judged on how well they can make them – though it is equally acceptable to buy them ready-made from a good food shop. Whenever you get a bunch of chefs together they will argue over the precise detail – inevitably, of course, each one will insist that their mother makes the ultimate <em>croqueta</em>. I always find that quite funny, as for me there is something deliciously sinful about <em>croquetas</em>, and my own mother would never have fed us such a thing: far too rich, heavy and fatty!</p>
<p class="indented">I have eaten every style of <em>croqueta</em>, from delicate, sophisticated ones in the sixteenth-century Echaurren Hotel in Ezcaray in Rioja, to miniature versions with roasted partridge and quail meat made by our friends at the Núñez de Prado oil mill in the Sierra Madre, and massive hearty ones at Café Melo’s, a Galician bar that keeps the hungry night-time crowd going in downtown Madrid.</p>
<p class="indented">The recipes that follow are a selection of favourites.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Some croquetas notes</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Using full-fat milk in the béchamel paste makes for a creamier <em>croqueta</em>. We call it paste rather than sauce, because this is something much heavier and more sturdy than the kind of béchamel sauce you might serve with a vegetable or fish dish – more like a dough or a base that you can shape.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after"><a id="pg_242"/>Always use warm milk when making the béchamel mixture, and equally, when you add the stock later, make sure this is warm, as cold liquid can create lumps as you stir.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">The fat used to make the béchamel paste may be butter, olive oil or even lard, according to personal taste, family or local tradition and the ingredients you are going to add. On the whole in Spain the emphasis is more on oil, which gives a bolder flavour than butter, but as the key feature of a great <em>croqueta</em> is the creaminess of the paste and the method is based on the French béchamel sauce, the use of butter is very in character. However, you can experiment with either in an equal ratio (for example, 120g of butter can be replaced by 120ml of oil).</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">You need patience and a strong arm, as you have to stir the paste pretty continuously for at least 20 minutes for the quantities given in the recipes that follow, and up to around 40 minutes if you are making a larger quantity. This is necessary in order to cook out the flour properly and reduce the milk down to the right consistency, at which point the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan. Many Anglicised recipes tend to shorten the cooking time for convenience, but don’t be tempted to cut corners. If the flour is not cooked through the paste will have an unpleasant aftertaste.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Let the béchamel rest for at least two hours before using. This allows the flavours to meld together and the mixture to bind, so that it will be easier to shape. In our bars and restaurants we leave it overnight in the fridge. You also need to cover the surface of the béchamel with clingfilm to stop it oxidising and forming a crust on the top, which would make it harder to work with.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">We use large Japanese <em>panko</em> breadcrumbs to coat the <em>croquetas</em>, as they give a really good colour and crunch when deep-fried. Alternatively, you can buy natural breadcrumbs from bakeries, which are also very good.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Although I wouldn’t normally recommend olive oil for deep-frying, it is a luxury that can make the <em>croquetas</em> very tasty – though its flavour is quite strong. If you prefer something less extravagant and more neutral, use sunflower oil.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Always keep an eye on the <em>croquetas</em> as they fry, as they only need to be cooked long enough for the outside to turn lightly golden and crisp and the inside molten – all the ingredients that you add to the béchamel are already cooked.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">The recipes that follow will all make around 1kg of béchamel, enough for 22–24 <em>croquetas</em>, either about 7cm long and 3cm in diameter, or shaped into balls. As they are quite rich and filling, two each is a reasonable serving – though it can be very easy to eat more, depending on whether you are serving them with other small plates or alone with drinks.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Because making <em>croquetas</em> is a time-consuming process, most people will make a large quantity at a time and freeze what they don’t need immediately. Either they will freeze the béchamel in one piece, then defrost it to make the <em>croquetas</em> in the usual way; or they will make the <em>croquetas</em> in their entirety, coated in breadcrumbs, before freezing, then defrost and fry them. I have tried both ways, and they are equally good.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec92"><a id="pg_243"/>Brindisa croquetas de jamón ibérico</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Ibérico ham croquettes</p>
<p class="flush_left">These have been loved since the first Brindisa tapas bar opened. They are very creamy and quite irresistible. We make the <em>croquetas</em> with Ibérico ham, but you could use Serrano instead.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 22–24</p>
<p class="ingredients">600ml full-fat milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">75ml chicken or ham stock</p>
<p class="ingredients">120g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a leek, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">120g <strong><em>taquitos</em></strong> (trimmings) of Ibérico ham or good Serrano ham, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">120g plain white flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">a small pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingredients">sunflower oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="forhead">For the coating</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g white flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredients">70g large breadcrumbs, preferably <strong><em>panko</em></strong> (Japanese crumbs)</p>
<p class="method">Warm the milk in a pan, but don’t let it boil. Warm the chicken/ham stock separately.</p>
<p class="method">Melt the butter in a tall, non-stick saucepan, add the leek and cook without colouring for 2 minutes, then add the ham and continue to cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the flour and stir very well over a low heat until it is a light brown colour. The longer you can cook the flour at this stage, the less you will have to cook the mixture once you have added the milk and stock, but be careful to keep the heat low, as the flour can burn very easily.</p>
<p class="method">Slowly add the warmed milk, stirring continously until it is all incorporated, then add the warmed stock – again do this slowly – and keep stirring until it is all mixed in. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and continue to cook gently for at least 15–20 minutes, stirring all the time, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan of its own accord. Alternatively, check by denting the mixture with your finger, and if it doesn’t stick, it is ready.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon this béchamel paste into a shallow dish or tray, place a sheet of clingfilm over the top, and as soon as it has cooled, put into the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="method">When you are ready to make your <em>croquetas</em>, have the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs ready in separate shallow bowls. Take the béchamel out of the fridge and divide into 22–24 equal pieces. Oil your hands lightly and roll each piece into a ball. If you like, elongate them until they are around 7cm long and 3cm in diameter.</p>
<p class="method">Coat each <em>croqueta</em> first in flour, then dip into the egg and put into a sieve to drain off the excess. Finally, coat well in breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil for deep-frying in a large pan, making sure it comes no higher than a third of the way up. If you have a thermometer it should be 180ºC (if you don’t have a thermometer, drop in a few breadcrumbs and if they sizzle gently the oil is hot enough).</p>
<p class="method">Fry the <em>croquetas,</em> in batches if necessary, for 3–4 minutes, turning until golden on all sides. Drain on kitchen paper and serve.</p>

She cuts her chicken very, very small, but when our head chef, Leo, makes his version he prefers to tear it into small pieces with his hands, as he thinks it gives more texture to the <em>croquetas</em>.

<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Chorizo</em> croquettes</p>
<p class="flush_left">I spotted <em>chorizo croquetas</em> on a menu in Santander, made with sausage from Liébana, which is strong and quite smoky. I was hesitant about ordering them, as I suspected they would be incredibly rich, but gave in to temptation, and yes, they were rich, but delicious, and excellent with a cold beer. So back home we set about coming up with a recipe. The method is slightly different to the previous <em>croqueta</em> recipes, because you need to compensate for the additional fat that comes from the <em>chorizo</em>. For this reason we make the béchamel paste with butter rather than olive oil, which might seem to be contributing to the richness, but just achieves the usual result, without the béchamel splitting due to the <em>chorizo</em> fat. For the same reason we add the cooked <em>chorizo</em> pieces to the béchamel once the paste has been mixed, rather than at the beginning of the process.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec96"><a id="pg_248"/>Buñuelos de bacalao</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Salt cod fritters</p>
<p class="flush_left">The batter here is known as <em>al monj</em>à<em>venes</em>, derived from the old Andalusian Arabic word <em>almuyabbanat</em> in the region around Valencia, and is similar to that of a profiterole. It is difficult to be exact about the quantity of eggs, as much depends on the absorbency of the flour, so it is best to do as suggested in the recipe and work in the eggs one at a time, until you have the right consistency.</p>
<p class="indented">For an interesting variation, add ½ a teaspoon of <em>pimentón dulce</em> (mild paprika) and 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley to the batter just before forming it into quenelles for frying.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em>buñuelos</em> are good served with a tomato salad and some fresh mayonnaise.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes enough for a big plateful (around 30 bite-sized puffs)</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g de-salted cod <strong><em>migas</em></strong> (pieces, or ‘crumbs’) (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p330c">here</a>), or salt cod fillet</p>
<p class="ingredients">250ml fish stock or water</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 6 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">vegetable oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="method">If you are using <em>migas</em>, just break them into pieces 1–2cm square. If using cod fillet, peel the skin from the flesh with a sharp knife, then feel for any bones with your fingers and remove them with tweezers or a knife before flaking it into pieces 1–2 cm long. Keep the pieces to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Bring the stock or water to the boil in a pan, then add the butter and let it melt. Take the pan off the heat and add all the flour at once, whisking continuously, then add the eggs one at a time, working them in vigorously with a wooden spoon. Don’t add the next egg until the previous one has been completely absorbed into the dough. Six eggs is usually about right, but you may need more or less. The dough is ready when it comes away from the sides of the pan easily.</p>
<p class="method">Gently stir in the flakes of cod so that you avoid breaking them up too much. It is much nicer to find some good mouthfuls of cod inside the <em>buñuelos</em>, rather than tiny bits.</p>
<p class="method">Pour some vegetable oil into a deep pan – it should not come more than a third of the way up – and heat to 180ºC (if you don’t have a thermometer, test by dropping in a little of the mixture – it should sizzle). Taking two lightly oiled teaspoons, make ‘quenelles’ by scooping some of the mixture on to one spoon, then scooping it on to the other and passing the mixture back and forth between the two spoons a few times until the mixture is smooth and egg-shaped. Finally, ease the quenelle gently into the hot oil with the help of the free spoon. Fry in batches, so that the mixture doesn’t lower the temperature of the oil.</p>
<p class="method">As the <em>buñuelos</em> fry, the batter will puff up. As soon as each batch is golden brown all over, lift them out carefully and drain on kitchen paper. Eat hot.</p>

<p class="method">Gently toss the balls of cheese in the flour, then coat in the beaten egg and, finally, roll them in the breadcrumbs, making sure you press the crumbs on firmly. Put into the fridge for at least an hour to firm up.</p>
<p class="method">Pour a 5cm layer of vegetable oil into a pan large enough to hold at least half the balls in one layer without overcrowding (make sure the oil comes no higher than a third of the way up the pan). Heat to 180ºC. If you don’t have a thermometer, put in a few breadcrumbs and if they sizzle the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p class="method">Lower the first batch of balls into the hot oil with a slotted spoon and cook for 2 minutes or so, turning them over gently as they fry, until they are a lovely golden colour all over. Lift out and drain on kitchen paper for a few minutes while you cook the next batch in the same way.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange all the balls on a platter, drizzle with the honey, then scatter with the mint or basil leaves and the almonds. Eat while hot.</p>

<p class="flush_left">When I tried to think of hot <em>chorizo</em> tapas that I have enjoyed, I could recall very few, since <em>chorizo</em> is usually served in a very straightforward way. The cooking sausages are either just chopped and sautéd with squares of potato until golden, or poached, as here, in wine or cider, to make one of the simplest and most tasty of tapas: especially warming for winter evenings. Poaching, however, does require a very good <em>chorizo</em>. Don’t pierce it, as you want it to retain its juices and fat and flavour; however, some of this will leach into the poaching liquid, flavouring it richly.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘almost a national emblem’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Across the world, the ruddy-coloured <em>chorizo</em> flavoured with <em>pimentón</em> (paprika) is probably the most popular and recognisable food export of Spain. It has almost become a national emblem, offering a fast route to a Spanish experience: a magic ingredient with an immediate ‘wow’ flavour, whether on its own or in any number of dishes.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain itself, however, people tend to be far more judicious in their use of <em>chorizo</em>, the argument being that not only is it quite rich and fatty, but if they are combining the sausage with other more subtle ingredients they don’t want these to be blasted by its powerful flavour. While in the UK pairing <em>chorizo</em> with fish or seafood, such as squid (or razor clams, as in Mark Hix’s recipe on <a href="chapter_003.html#rec36">here</a>) is popular, in Spain this is a contentious subject. I remember once, when I was in Madrid, someone mentioned having seen a dish of cod cheeks with <em>chorizo</em> being made on a cooking show on British TV. My Spanish colleagues were horrified. In their view fish was far too delicate and subtle to cope with pork and <em>pimentón</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Pilar Sapena, of the wine and vinegar estate in Alicante (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>), who typically uses very delicate flavours in her cooking, has this rule about <em>chorizo</em>: ‘in a sandwich great, with potatoes and legumes, great, but never in rice and never with seafood’. And Ana Barrera echoes this philosophy at her wonderful little restaurant in Madrid (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>), in that she only ever uses <em>chorizo</em> with beans or chickpeas, which she feels can cope with the fattiness and spiciness of the sausage.</p>
<p class="indented">In Alicante and Valencia, where the food is generally much lighter than in other regions, they use <em>chorizo</em> very little, and in the Basque country and Catalunya they don’t even have a traditional <em>chorizo</em> of their own.</p>
<p class="indented">Also, given its iconic status abroad, it is strange to realise that while the history of sausage-making in general goes back to Roman times, <em>chorizo</em> is a relatively recent development. Almost all <em>chorizo</em> is now made with pork (though in Asturias, venison <em>chorizo</em> is a speciality); however, its origins are not with the pig at all, but in the flavouring of lamb meat, goat and small game with aromatic herbs and spices such as cumin and coriander, which was favoured by the Moors who arrived in Europe in the eighth century and whose religion prohibited them from eating pork. These meats were often made into sausages, and the recipes for their spicing and marinades became absorbed into the local communities. It was only later, during the persecution of the Moors in the fifteenth century, that Christians began making a point of eating pork to demonstrate their faith, while keeping the inherited tradition of herbs and spices. <a id="pg_258"/>At this point, however, there were still no peppers in Spain, and therefore no paprika. It wasn’t until the sixteenth century that the monks at the monastery of Yuste, in Cáceres, Extremadura, first began cultivating peppers brought in from the New World and realised these could also be dried and ground to make a spice. As the cultivation of peppers spread, this <em>pimentón</em> began to be used in the flavouring of sausages throughout central Spain.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_257"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg257.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">Like almost all Spanish foods, <em>chorizo</em> isn’t made to a single recipe. It spans around fifty recognised styles which vary from region to region, often according to the kind of paprika used (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_232">here</a>), which can be <em>dulce</em> (mild) or more <em>picante</em> (spicy). Some regions add a little garlic or herbs to the basic <em>chorizo</em> mix of pork meat and <em>pimentón</em>, and in Extremadura cooked potatoes can sometimes be added.</p>
<p class="indented">The sausages are either fresh, in which case they must be cooked before eating, or they are cured and air-dried, ready to slice and eat like salami. They might be made on a very small, artisan and local scale, or produced industrially by brands who sell them all over Spain.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><strong><em>Chorizo fresco</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">Fresh, cooking <em>chorizos</em> are usually a similar shape to British sausages, though in some regions they are hooped, mini-sized, or long and thin – like the 60cm-long hooped <em>chistorra</em> typical of the Basque country.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain you might find a butcher who is making his own fresh <em>chorizo</em> on a daily basis – sometimes people buy these and strip off the skin, then use the seasoned pork as a stuffing or <em>picadillo</em> (mince). More usually, though, ‘fresh’ actually involves a few days of curing – typically up to a week. This brief curing concentrates the flavour but still allows the juices to come out of the sausage and flavour any other ingredients in a dish. It also firms up the meat a little, so that if you put the <em>chorizo</em> into a dish such as a casserole with beans that requires long, slow cooking, it won’t disintegrate. Some, like the famous <em>chorizo de León</em>, are also lightly smoked over oak.</p>
<p class="indented">Fresh <em>chorizos</em> are incredibly versatile. They can be sliced and grilled or fried for breakfast dishes, for example <em>huevos a la flamenca</em>, a combination known all over Spain in which the whole <em>chorizos</em> are coloured in a terracotta dish (as with a good meaty British pork sausage, if you are grilling, frying or barbecuing fresh <em>chorizos</em> whole, don’t prick them first, as you will leach out the fat, and with it a lot of the flavour). They are then lifted out, and some tomato <em>sofrito</em> is spooned into the dish, cooked peas are added and the <em>chorizo</em> put back on top. Some good eggs are broken over the top and then the dish is put into the oven at 180°C/gas 4 for about 12 minutes, until the <em>chorizo</em> is cooked through and the white of the egg is firm – how soft you have the yolks is up to individual taste. Then it is eaten with toasted country bread to mop up the eggy-tomatoey juices.</p>
<p class="indented"> Fresh <em>chorizo</em> can also be poached whole for tapas (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#rec102">here</a>), as well as added to rice dishes, stews and casseroles. Of course, you could use cured <em>chorizo</em> in these slow-cooked dishes, but a Spanish person wouldn’t, because they want the juiciness of the fresh sausage.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose fresh <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">Look for few ingredients and no additives. The fresh Alejandro <em>chorizos</em> that we sell, for example, list only three ingredients: pork, spices and salt. Those made without preservatives and colours will have a duller, more rusty-orange colour than the more pinky-orange, industrial ones. The joy of these natural sausages is that they have a full taste that is deeply peppery and mildly smoky, without being spicy-hot, whereas the industrial versions often have a slight taste of chemicals and an unattractive metallic after-flavour.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_259"/>Cured <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">Cured (ready to eat) <em>chorizo</em> is graded according to meat, fat and humidity content. At one time you might have seen many different grades, including <em>puro</em> (pure), <em>primera</em> (first), <em>segunda</em> (second) and <em>extra</em>. However, these days <em>extra</em> is considered the highest grade, and is the only one you are likely to see on a label; otherwise, there will usually be no grade stated. Sometimes you might also see <em>natural</em> on a label, which simply indicates no additives.</p>
<p class="indented">The best <em>extra chorizo</em> begins with the quality of the meat. The choice cut is the redder lean meat between the belly fat and the ribs, as well as that from the foreleg, which is much juicier than the hind leg, and good producers tend to cut the meat by hand. Cheaper <em>chorizos</em>, not labelled <em>extra</em>, tend to be more gristly, as they have been made from less fine cuts of meat.</p>
<p class="indented">You also need fat, so some <em>panceta</em> will be added. An <em>extra</em> <em>chorizo</em> will have a percentage of around 60 per cent lean meat to 30 per cent fat, with the rest made up of flavourings. In thicker <em>chorizos</em> the meat tends to be coarsely minced, whereas in thinner ones it is more likely to be finely chopped.</p>
<p class="indented">The sausages can be small, the shape of a normal sausage, long, or hooped. Once made, they are hung up to cure for 1–6 months, depending on the size, ingredients, the kind of casing used and the environment in which they are being cured.</p>
<p class="indented">Generally speaking, the longer they are cured, the firmer the sausage, and the more expensive they are likely to be. In the colder, wetter, northern areas of Spain, such as Galicia, Asturias and León, the <em>chorizos</em> tend to be smoked as they are curing, as this helps them to keep longer, and deepens the flavour. <em>Chorizo de León</em> is the most famous example of rich, smoked, cured <em>chorizo</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Sometimes, finding a brilliant food is really down to a stroke of luck, and the day I met our Riojan <em>chorizo</em> producers, the Rituerto brothers, Roberto and Alejandro, was one of those moments when the gods were smiling on me. Back in the early, heady days of Spain’s EU membership, in the lead up to the Olympics in Barcelona, the Spanish were investing heavily in launching themselves as a serious exporter of excellent food and wine. At Brindisa we were already a step ahead, but most of the world was not really plugged into what Spain had to offer, so a motley selection of foodie people and buyers, including myself and my colleague Emma Ranson, were invited aboard an extravagant promotional cruise ship sailing from Barcelona to Cádiz for Expo 1992. Various regional wine-makers, cheese-makers and other local Spanish producers had been selected to set up stands on board, and among them were Roberto and Alejandro, with their Riojan ‘Alejandro’ <em>chorizo</em>, made with very high-quality <em>pimentón</em>, a touch of garlic and no additives or preservatives.</p>
<p class="indented">Tasting that <em>chorizo</em> was the start of a long and great relationship. At first we insisted that the <em>chorizo</em> needed to be hotter to suit the British taste, but Roberto refused to adapt the recipe, as he said it would unbalance the flavours. In his view a good <em>chorizo</em> should be mild, so that the quality of the meat and other seasonings are not overpowered. Over the years he has been proved right, since his traditional <em>chorizo</em> is a best seller. Whenever possible the brothers come over from Spain to join us at events, and everyone loves them. Invariably they burst into song as they hand out slices of their cured <em>chorizo</em> and poach fresh ones in wine and cider for people to try.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_260"/>How to choose cured <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Look for the grading <em>extra</em> on labels. If you also see the word <em>natura</em>l this shows that no preservatives or colours have been added. Next, what is important is the casing used, as this affects the quality of the curing. The <em>chorizos</em> should have a quite thick skin, as this indicates they are made from animal casing, rather than man-made. These <em>chorizos</em> will usually have a better flavour, as the skins are permeable both ways, allowing the sausage to be cured more naturally and for longer, intensifying the flavour. They will also be irregular in shape.</p>
<p class="flush_left">By contrast, industrially made <em>chorizos</em> tend to be much bigger – sometimes 6–8cm in diameter, and more uniform-looking, inside man-made casings, and they are more likely to have been fast-cured in special drying rooms. They may contain preservatives, which can give a chemical-like petrolly aftertaste; or strong, dried garlic flavourings, often designed to enhance an otherwise unremarkable flavour. They are also likely to contain colourings, which makes them look pink, rather than the natural-looking rusty-coppery colour that comes from using only <em>pimentón</em>.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p260aa"><strong><em>Sobrasada mallorquina</em></strong></h4>
<p class="method">In the Balearic Islands and some Levantine coastal villages where the local air is too humid to produce firm <em>chorizos</em>, the Balearic islanders opt for this popular soft orange-red ‘spreading <em>chorizo</em>’, which is more like a pâté (locally it is spelt <em>sobrassada</em>). Instead of chunks of meat, it is made with very finely minced pork and belly fat and is truly delicious. It is mostly eaten as it is, taken straight from the skin and spread on bread, or it can be spooned on to toast, with some Manchego cheese and grilled (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec45">here</a>), used in <em>banyetas</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_66">here</a>) or to fill <em>empanadas</em> (little pasties). You could even use it to make a Spanish twist on little sausage rolls. Often it is used to make the sweet and savoury <em>coca tovada</em>: little pieces of <em>sobrasada</em> and fruit such as fresh apricot are pushed into focaccia-like dough which rises up around the <em>chorizo</em> and fruit as it bakes (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_65">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">These days industrially made <em>sobrasada</em> may contain pork from white pigs, but traditionally the meat comes from the herds of native black Mallorquín pigs with their distinctive dangly bits of skin at the base of their necks (<em>mamellas</em>), which are descendants of the Ibérico pig and have been indigenous to the Balearic Islands for around seven centuries. Unlike their mainland cousins which are fattened on acorns before slaughter, the Mallorquín black pigs have a year-round diet of beans, alfalfa grass, acorns, carobs and figs, and the sweetness of the figs, in particular, comes through in the meat.</p>
<p class="indented">Once the pork and fat mixture is seasoned and flavoured with <em>pimentón</em>, it is stuffed into natural skins to make bulbous sausages which are tied with string and hung up on poles to cure for 1–8 months or longer, depending on the casing, weight and shape.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p260a">How to choose <strong><em>sobrasada</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">For the authentic and very superior product, look for <em>sobrassada de Mallorca de cerdo negro</em> on the label.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Each size and shape of <em>sobrasada</em> has a different name. These include the largest, <em>bisbe</em>, which can weigh as much as 30kg. It is cured for up to a year, hanging from three strings – so it looks almost like a baby in a sling. More popular, however, are the wrinkly bulbous <em>rizada</em>, which cures in 6–12 weeks; the <em>poltru</em>, larger than the <em>rizada</em>, but similarly shaped and cured for 2–6 months; and the ball-shaped <em>bufeta</em> (also cured for 2–6 months). As an indicator of the flavour (not always reliable), the milder sausages are tied with white string, and the hotter, spicier ones with red string.</p>
<p class="flush_left">Often some of the best <em>sobrasada</em> is sold in delicatessens, where they will slice soft chunks from a large sausage for you.</p>

They included it in their <em>Moro Cookbook</em> (Ebury), and Sam tells me their customers love it. When they cook their beans (and also chickpeas) they add a little bicarbonate of soda, to help soften them.</p>

<p class="ingredients">½ a red onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">a drizzle of olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g mild or spicy cooking <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong>, cut into little pieces</p>

<p class="method">Soak the beans overnight in plenty of water with a pinch of bicarbonate of soda added.</p>
<p class="method">Drain and rinse the beans, then cover with 2 litres of cold water in a large pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer, skimming off any froth that comes to the surface. Cook gently for 1–2 hours, until the beans are tender. Pour off some of the cooking liquid until it is level with the beans, season and keep to one side – this stops the skins from wrinkling or splitting.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, make the dressing. Crush the garlic to a paste with a good pinch of salt, using a pestle and mortar, then add the vinegar and lemon juice, if using, and whisk in the olive oil. Season to taste.</p>
<p class="method">Drain the beans and put them into a shallow serving bowl with the tomatoes, red onion and parsley. Allow to cool until warm, then pour on the dressing and mix well. Leave to sit for at least 5 minutes to let the flavours mingle.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, set a frying pan over a medium to high heat. Pour a drizzle of olive oil into the pan and add the <em>chorizo</em>. It will only take about a minute to cook – it really just needs to sizzle quickly until it is crisp on both sides.

<p class="ingredients">125g <strong><em>cansalada</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_262">here</a>) or <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, rind removed, sliced into 1cm x 0.5cm batons</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g fresh (or frozen) shelled broad beans</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> with onion or <strong><em>botifarra negra</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p450a">here</a>), skin removed</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons anise liqueur, such as Anis del Mono Seco</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil, preferably in an earthenware, flameproof dish, then put in the <em>cansalada</em> or <em>panceta</em> and sauté until the fat becomes translucent. Add the onion and garlic and cook slowly until the onion is translucent but not coloured. Take care not to let the garlic burn. Bring some water to the boil in a pan and put in the beans, lower to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes (depending on their size), until tender.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, heat the rest of the oil in a frying pan, add the <em>morcilla</em> or <em>botifarra negra</em> and sauté for a couple of minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Add the anise – be careful, as it is likely to flame, and stir for another minute or so to burn off the alcohol.</p>
<p class="method">Transfer the <em>morcilla</em> or <em>botifarra negra</em> to the pan containing the beans and allow to simmer for another 8–10 minutes, until the beans are completely tender, then add the chopped mint. Stir through, simmer for another 2 minutes, and serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec105">Pochas con morcilla y acelgas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fried white beans with black pudding and Swiss chard</p>
<p class="flush_left">This recipe was created for the London Bridge tapas bar menu by our executive chef, Josep. Colourful, iron-rich and nourishing, I have enjoyed it on so many occasions.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g fresh white beans, such as <strong><em>pochas, alubias</em></strong> or <strong><em>mongetes</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p381a">here</a>), or 200g dried white beans</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, peeled, one left whole, the other chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil, plus a little extra for cooking the beans</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g Swiss chard leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> or <strong><em>botifarra negra</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p450a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">chopped parsley (optional), to finish</p>
<p class="method">If using dried beans, soak them overnight in plenty of water. Put the soaked or fresh beans into a pan with the whole carrot, bay leaf and whole clove of garlic. Cover with plenty of cold water. Add a drizzle of oil. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer until tender (around 20 minutes for fresh beans or 45–60 minutes for dried). Drain, reserving some cooking water, and discard the garlic, carrot and bay leaf.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a sauté pan or wok, add the chopped garlic and shallot and cook gently until golden, then add the cooked beans, together with the Swiss chard, and fry quickly, adding a tablespoon of the reserved cooking water. Let the liquid bubble up and reduce a little, then taste, and season with salt.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, heat the rest of the oil in a frying pan, add the <em>morcilla</em> or <em>botifarra negra</em> and sauté for a couple of minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Serve the beans topped with the <em>morcilla</em> or <em>botifarra negra</em>, and a sprinkling of parsley, if you like.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="recb8"><a id="pg_264"/>REVUELTOS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Scrambled eggs</p>
<p class="flush_left">In the hands of the Spanish cook scrambled eggs <em>(revueltos)</em> are really taken to another level, and only the best ingredients are added. These are not dishes for using up leftovers.</p>
<p class="indented">Whereas <em>tortilla</em> slices or squares tend to be served as a tapa, scrambled egg dishes are more often eaten as starters. They are more like broken omelettes, only lightly beaten and stirred slowly over a low heat, so the egg stays quite soft and moist, rather than the drier, grainy, quite quickly cooked eggs that used to be traditional in Britain. When my brother and sisters and I were young and my mum made scrambled egg, I remember there were always little crispy bits where the eggs had caught at the bottom of the pan – which we all wanted in our portion, but in the Spanish kitchen eggs like this would be considered a dry disaster.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Some <strong><em>revueltos</em></strong> notes</h4>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Start with the very best eggs you can afford. In Spain the <em>huevo de corral</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_164">here</a>) is the ideal. In the UK, choose a good farm egg, preferably with a deep orange-coloured yolk, which shows that the hen has been allowed to forage properly outside.</p>
<p class="method">Only beat the eggs very lightly with a fork: 2 seconds, that’s it.</p>
<p class="method">Good <em>revueltos</em> are cooked slowly, so that the eggs remain moist. So use a heavy-based pan, or preferably a non-stick wok, which allows you to move the eggs around to cooler areas, so that they don’t get too hot and cook too quickly.</p>
<p class="method">Always turn down the heat under your pan of oil before you add the lightly beaten eggs. Then quickly take the pan from the heat, stir and fold the eggs and put the pan back on the heat. Continue with this on-and-off-the-heat process, which will stop the eggs drying out and keep them creamy.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec106"><a id="pg_265"/>Revueltos con ajetes</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Scrambled egg with fresh garlic shoots</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a typical Good Friday dish in Spain, when the fresh garlic shoots, or scapes as they are known in the UK (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_140">here</a>), are in season. Our friends Ambro and Ásun pick their shoots straight from Ambro’s brother’s garden, and when we visited for Easter, Ambro cooked a huge <em>revueltos</em> made with around 20 eggs in a massive pan over a gas ring at their <em>bodega</em>/cave up in the hills.</p>
<p class="indented">This is what I call a ‘yellow scramble’, because the garlic shoots are light in colour and there are no added ingredients to darken the colour of the eggs.</p>
<p class="indented">If you can’t find fresh green garlic shoots, or scapes, you could substitute very small, mild-flavoured leeks.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">12 fresh garlic shoots (scapes) or 6 thin leeks</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 medium eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Chop the garlic shoots or the whites of the leeks, if using (discard the green parts), into 2cm lengths on the diagonal.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, beat the eggs very lightly with a fork for 2 seconds and season with salt.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a small wok or heavy-based pan, add the garlic shoots and sauté gently for 2 minutes, then lift out with a slotted spoon and add to the beaten eggs. Turn down the heat.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the egg and garlic shoot mixture into the pan, take it off the heat and stir gently, then put the pan back on the hob and for 1–2 minutes keep taking it on and off the heat as you stir and fold, to stop the eggs drying out and keep them creamy. Stir in the parsley at the last moment, off the heat.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec107">Revuelto de morcilla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Scrambled egg with black pudding</p>
<p class="flush_left">This dish may lack beauty, as the egg will blacken with the pudding, but it more than makes up for it in flavour. Ideally, use a soft <em>morcilla</em> made with onion – typically these have a very thin skin (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>).</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> with onion or black <strong><em>botifarra</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p450a">here</a>), skin removed</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of ground cinnamon (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 medium eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">4–5 mint leaves, chopped or torn</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a small wok or heavy-based pan, put in the pine nuts, moving them around to brown them slightly, then lift out and keep to one side. Put the <em>morcilla</em> or <em>botifarra</em> into the pan and sauté until heated through. Add the shallot and cinnamon, if using, and sauté for 2 more minutes. Turn down the heat.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, beat the eggs very lightly with a fork for 2 seconds and season with salt. Add to the pan, take it off the heat and stir gently, then put the pan back on the hob and for 1–2 minutes keep taking it on and off the heat as you stir and fold, so that the egg envelops all the ingredients (the sausage will blacken the eggs). Stir in the pine nuts and mint at the last moment, off the heat.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec108"><a id="pg_266"/>Revuelto de setas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Wild mushrooms in scrambled egg</p>

<p class="flush_left">Obviously this is far more interesting if you can use seasonal wild mushrooms rather than cultivated ones.</p>
<p class="indented">The eggs in this scramble will remain yellow and the colour will contrast really well with the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g mixed wild mushrooms, cleaned</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 large cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 medium eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a small wok or heavy-based pan. Add the mushrooms, shallot and garlic and sauté for 3 minutes. Turn down the heat.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, beat the eggs very lightly for 2 seconds and season with salt. Add to the pan, take it off the heat and stir gently, then put the pan back on the hob and for 1–2 minutes keep taking it on and off the heat as you stir and fold, so that the egg envelops all the ingredients. Stir in the parsley at the last moment, off the heat.</p>


<p class="recipe-head" id="rec109">Revuelto de espárragos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Asparagus in scrambled egg</p>
<p class="flush_left">This only works with fresh green asparagus, rather than jarred white asparagus, as it is not only the texture but the colour of the spears that really makes this an exceptional combination. It is such a favourite dish in Spain that in asparagus season everyone talks about it. I have frequently spent long journeys listening to Madrid taxi drivers regaling me with romantic stories of collecting wild asparagus from the hills when they go back to visit their mothers in their home villages, in order to make this <em>revuelto</em>.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 bunches of fresh green or wild asparagus spears (about 24 spears), ideally thin ones</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 medium eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="method">Chop the spears into 2cm lengths on the diagonal, leaving behind the woody stems. If the asparagus isn’t thin, boil the pieces in salted water for 5 minutes, then drain and reserve.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a small wok or heavy-based pan, and if you are using thin spears put them in and sauté for 2 minutes. Turn down the heat.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, beat the eggs very lightly for 2 seconds and season with salt, and if you are using thicker asparagus which you have cooked in water, add the pieces to the egg. Add the eggs to the pan, take it off the heat and stir gently, then put the pan back on the hob and for 1–2 minutes keep taking it on and off the heat as you stir.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec110"><a id="pg_267"/>Tortilla de bacalao</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Salt cod omelette</p>
<p class="flush_left">I have included this here, despite it being called a <em>tortilla,</em> as it is somewhere between scrambled egg and an omelette. Since it is relatively thin and doesn’t contain any potato to soak up the moisture from the eggs, the texture is quite soft and creamy, so it is impossible to turn, and is sometimes served folded in the French style.</p>
<p class="indented">It is a menu staple in the cider houses of the Basque country, where it will be followed by exceptional, super-thick rib-eye steaks, cooked over coals. To finish there will be Basque sheep cheeses with walnuts on the side and, naturally, cider to drink.</p>
<p class="indented">This is our head chef Leo Rivera’s version of the omelette. You don’t need to buy expensive salt cod loin, you only need the ‘<em>migas</em>’, or ‘crumbs’, which are the small pieces left after the loins have been cut out (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p330e">here</a> for more about salt cod).</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 2 hungry people</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g de-salted cod <strong><em>migas</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p330c">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 eggs</p>
<p class="forhead"><strong><em>To serve</em></strong> (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers, from a jar (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">If serving with <em>piquillo</em> peppers and garlic, prepare these first. Heat a film of oil in a 28cm frying pan, add the garlic slices and cook briefly but don’t allow to colour, add the <em>piquillo</em> peppers and heat through, then take off the heat and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Separate the <em>migas</em> into small pieces with your fingers, then heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onions and garlic and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured.</p>
<p class="method">Add the cod and cook for 3 more minutes, then add the parsley and cook for another minute. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="method">Beat the eggs in a bowl, then add the cod mixture.</p>
<p class="method">Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper, heat another tablespoon of oil and swirl it around so that the sides as well as the base are oiled, then pour out the excess.</p>
<p class="method">Pour in the egg mixture and cook in the style of a French omelette, drawing the sides of the egg mixture towards the middle as you cook it. When just set underneath but still soft like scrambled egg on top, either slide it out on to a plate, or fold it over first. If serving with red peppers and garlic, spoon these on top.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec111"><a id="pg_268"/>Remanat de camp</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Country scrambled egg</p>
<p class="flush_left">Llorenç Petrás has a famous stall in the Boqueria market in Barcelona, where his <em>fruits del bosc</em>, wild woodland produce, is a stunning sight. You have to go to the market early, though, if you want to see the scale of his treasure, as by the end of the day it will all have sold out. We often use his book, <em>La Millor Cuina dels Bolets</em>, at home since it is full of ideas for wild mushrooms – Catalunya in autumn is a mushroom-picker’s paradise – and this colourful combination of squash, peppers and mushrooms is incredibly tasty. It is really more of a mix of vegetables with eggs than a creamy scrambled egg dish.</p>
<p class="indented">Llorenç adds snails to his <em>remanat</em> (the Catalan name for scrambled egg), which he collects and cooks himself; however, I admit I shy away from snails. If you do want to add them, however, you can buy them in tins or jars.</p>
<p class="indented">When ceps aren’t available, Portobello mushrooms give an excellent flavour, though they give off a lot of moisture and darken the final dish. A combination of chestnut and chanterelles is very good too and keeps a more golden colour.</p>
<p class="indented">Try to use a sweet, thin-skinned green pepper.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 ripe tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g potatoes, peeled and chopped, about 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g pumpkin or squash, peeled and chopped, about 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 green pepper, roughly chopped, about 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 slice of country or sourdough bread (about 100g), crusts cut off, cut into small squares</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g ceps, cleaned and cut into slices of about 4cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g freshly cooked or jarred snails (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 eggs</p>
<p class="method">Either grate the tomatoes, or, if you prefer, de-skin and de-seed them (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_206">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a deep frying pan and add the potatoes, pumpkin or squash and the green pepper. Season with a pinch of salt and sweat over a medium heat for 10–15 minutes, until the potato is just tender and beginning to brown, then lift out and keep to one side. Wipe out the pan for later.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 more tablespoons of the oil in a small pan, put in the bread and fry until the cubes are nicely browned, to make croutons. Lift out and keep to one side. Heat a further 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan, put in the ceps and briefly cook through. Take off the heat and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Return the deep frying pan to the heat with the rest of the oil, then add the onion, garlic, tomato, the snails, if using, and a pinch of salt. Allow to sweat on a low heat for around 10 minutes, until the onion is transparent. Add the reserved potatoes, pumpkin or squash and peppers, together with the mushrooms, and heat everything through on a medium heat. Taste and season as necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs very lightly for 2 seconds and season with salt. Add to the pan, take it off the heat and stir gently, then put the pan back on the hob and for 1–2 minutes keep taking it on and off the heat as you stir, to stop the eggs drying out and keep them creamy. Sprinkle with the reserved croutons and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="recipe-head2" id="recb9"><a id="pg_270"/>TAPAS DE VERDURAS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Vegetable tapas</p>

<p class="flush_left">If you were to give a Spaniard a plate of boiled or steamed vegetables their attitude would probably be: ‘Why would you do that? They don’t taste of anything.’ In Spain so much more consideration and attention goes into the cooking of vegetables, and they really come into their own as small plates. For example, in Catalunya and all along the Mediterranean coast, greens such as spinach are especially popular cooked long and slow, or just lightly tossed through hot oil in a pan with sautéd shallots, pine nuts and raisins.</p>
<p class="indented">In Alicante, at La Taberna del Gourmet, María José San Román serves a wonderful platter of individually prepared vegetables, laid out like a colourful fan: baby artichokes lightly coated in chickpea flour and fried until crispy, baked whole tomatoes and chunky slices of roasted squash, grilled courgette, aubergine, asparagus and large slices of mushroom, all sprinkled with sea salt and olive oil. Such combinations are typical of this southern Levante region and also of Murcia, where vegetables are often cooked on hot stones.</p>
<p class="indented">Garden vegetables coated in tempura-style batter have also become very fashionable. On a visit to the Núñez de Prado brothers at their olive oil mill in Baena, at the foot of the Sierra Madre mountains (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_218">here</a>), they arranged an elaborate early lunch in the private restaurant which included irresistible mounds of peppers, courgettes and aubergines, cut into delicate matchstick pieces whose green and red colours peeped through their light batter. I went downstairs to the kitchen to watch the cook prepare the vegetables for frying – naturally using their wonderful oils – and I was fascinated by the simple and ingenious device she had next to the deep fryer – a version of which our executive chef, Josep, has since bought for the kitchen at our Shoreditch restaurant. Essentially, it is a metal box with a sliding sieve at the top. You fill the box with flour, put the batter-coated vegetables into the sieve, scatter them with some of the flour, then slide the sieve up and down to shake the excess flour back into the box, leaving the vegetables thinly coated. Of course a normal sieve will do the trick, but the tin is more fun!</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_271"/>While in many regions vegetables are eaten in abundance, you won’t necessarily encounter the same reverence towards them all over the country – in inland Spain in particular, the diet is often heavily weighted towards meat. Even though vegetarianism is growing, it is still very much in the minority, and a vegetarian is often taken to mean someone who likes vegetables a lot, rather than someone who doesn’t eat meat or fish. The thinking is that you might not want half an animal on your plate, but a little bit of ham is fine. So a vegetable such as red cabbage, Swiss chard, cauliflower, green beans or asparagus might be blanched until just tender, then sautéd in oil and garlic and finished off with a sprinkling of roasted nuts and chopped cured ham, or <em>panceta</em>, fried until crispy. Or, in a mix of traditional and new, you might find the likes of chard stalks sandwiched around Ibérico ham and cheese, covered in tempura batter and deep-fried.</p>
<p class="indented">While stuffed tomatoes and peppers might seem a little passé in the UK, they are still all the rage in Spain. In Navarra, the garden of Spain, Sandra Salcedo, one of the daughters of the family who supply us with many of our jarred vegetables, makes a lovely cosy dish of big, ripe, ruby-red tomatoes, filled with spinach and ham mash. And <em>piquillo</em> peppers make perfect receptacles for all kinds of combinations, from cheese to rice or <em>morcilla</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_276">here</a>).</p>


<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_272"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg272.jpg"/></div>
<p class="square-subhead">‘ flavour over heat’</p>
<p class="flush_left">A sun-ripened Mediterranean pepper is a world away from the hydroponically grown ones we tend to see in supermarkets in the UK, and Spanish varieties range from small to big, mild to spicy, though in general they are valued for their flavour over their heat. There is a huge appreciation and understanding of all of them, and the best ways to use them – some fresh, others dried, preserved in oil, or pickled in</p>
<p class="method">gentle vinegars.</p>
<p class="indented">We started buying dried peppers very early on in the days of Brindisa. I first saw <em>ristras</em> (strings) of them drying on the balconies of homes across Rioja and Murcia and they were irresistible – they seemed to me to be a way of bringing sunshine into the kitchen. So we began combining <em>guindilla</em> pepper strings with <em>farcellets</em>, the very pretty Catalan version of bouquet garnis (two bay leaves rolled around herbs such as thyme and savory), with Brindisa colleagues and friends all helping out with the stringing. From there we progressed to bringing in <em>ñora</em> and <em>choricero</em> peppers.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain these days most dried peppers are sold in boxes of about ten, with a clear window in the lid so that you can see the peppers inside, but we feel that the strings are more visually exciting, so I asked the growers if these could be made locally. Yes, I was told, but I was also warned that pepper-stringing is a dying art which may not remain viable in the future.</p>
<p class="indented">Many of the peppers we sell dried are grown by the García family, based in Quel in south-eastern Rioja, away from the main wine-growing areas, close to the southern tip of Navarra and the barren hills where you can follow the ancient dinosaur trails, which of course we have visited with the children. Their business was set up back in 1935, and as well as growing <em>guindillas</em> and <em>choriceros</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a> and <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_281">here</a>) in Rioja they also cultivate <em>ñora</em> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_280">here</a>) on another five hectares they own in Murcia, as these benefit from a drier climate in which to ripen.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Herbón (Padrón) peppers, PDO</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The bright green, pointy, triangular-shaped variety of pepper from the municipality of Padrón in Galicia has become Spain’s most recognised and loved pepper in the UK, since it is a staple of the tapas bar, flash-fried in olive oil and served hot, sprinkled with sea salt (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#rec112">here</a>). I like to think that its popularity gives renewed hope for the green pepper in general, since for so long in Britain we have known only the green bell pepper that is relatively flavourless.</p>
<p class="indented">It can, however, be grown in other areas of Spain such as Almería and Murcia, and in countries such as Morocco (allowing the peppers <a id="pg_274"/>to be still available when the Galician harvest is over or in short supply). Some are even grown in small volumes in Cornwall, so one way or another you can usually find them fresh in UK shops. Peppers grown outside Galicia, however, are usually larger, possibly lighter in colour and may be drier in texture and less flavoursome.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_273"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg273.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">Peppers from the town of Herbón, where, on the first Sunday in August, they celebrate the Fiesta del Pimiento, have PDO status. This guarantees the varietal and dictates that the peppers must be grown and picked to traditional methods in five villages of the municipality during the season (May to October). The area here benefits from generous rainfall and very fertile soil which produces peppers that are small – about 2cm in length – and are a bright, deep green, with juicy flesh. In the UK it can be almost impossible to find peppers bearing the mark of the Herbón PDO, but you can at least check that the peppers have been grown in Padrón.</p>
<p class="indented">Usually the peppers are mild, but you can play Russian roulette with the prospect of occasionally being hit with a more fiery one. Mostly they are harvested young, at only about 4–5cm in size, as at this stage only a minority will be spicy hot, whereas if they grow bigger there is much more chance of heat on the finish. As well as being a favourite tapa, the fried peppers are sometimes packed into tins of the small sardines (known as <em>xoubas</em>) in Galicia to add spice to them.</p>

<p class="flush_left">These are typically eaten as a snack in the same way as the Padrón, flash-fried whole in olive oil and sprinkled with salt (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#rec112">here</a>).</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_275"/><strong><em>Guindilla</em></strong> (eaten fresh locally, but mostly jarred or dried)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The best green <em>guindilla</em> peppers are grown in Ibarra, in the Basque country, where they are nicknamed <em>langostinos</em> (prawns) <em>de Ibarra</em> (or <em>ibarrako piparrak</em> in Basque), partly because of their long thin shape (they are 5–12cm long), and partly as a term of endearment, as both the peppers and prawns are among the best-loved foods of the Basques.</p>
<p class="indented">The peppers are famous for their mellow, fruity flavour – this is not an area that considers <em>picante</em> (hot) peppers desirable – and when they are in season, around July to October (earlier with greenhouse cultivation), freshly picked ones are pan-fried and sprinkled with salt, like the Galician Padrón in Basque homes and local bars. Ibarra is a gentle, verdant lowland, and the limited production of <em>guindillas</em> that grow there are of a strain that has been nurtured specially for the area. This microclimate is key: the small difference in temperature between day and night and the ample rainfall at 400 metres above sea level makes for sweet and juicy peppers that are collected by hand once they reach the length of a French green bean.</p>
<p class="indented">However, they are also very delicate, and once picked their life is short – which is why fresh ones don’t travel to the UK. Since they won’t keep, some are dried on long strings; however, the bigger tradition is to pickle and jar them in good wine vinegar.</p>
<p class="indented">In Rioja, a different, more strident variety of <em>guindilla</em> is grown and allowed to ripen to red on the plant, then dried and strung – we buy ours from the García family in Quel (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_272">here</a>). It is longer and fatter than the Ibarra <em>guindilla</em> and is used to add warmth and spice to dishes such as <em>gazpachos manchegos</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_456">here</a>).</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to use</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The jarred peppers are speared with olives, gherkins, and/or anchovies to have with drinks. They are also the essential complement to a plate of one of the Basque country’s most typical dishes of slow-cooked Tolosa beans and bacon. The vinegary flavour and fresh crunch of the peppers makes a fabulous contrast to the velvety creaminess of the dark beans.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_275a"/><strong><em>Piquillo</em></strong> (mainly charred in jars)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Roasted and conserved red <em>piquillo</em> peppers, the small version of the larger <em>pico</em> (‘tail’), were unheard of in 1990 when Brindisa began to bring them in from Lodosa in Navarra, a region which carries its own label of Denomination of Origin. Of course, most of our customers said, ‘But I can roast my own peppers’ – however, most of the red peppers in the shops at the time were being grown hydroponically in Holland, and had so little flavour compared to the <em>piquillos</em> grown in the fields of Navarra. Here the clean waters and good soil combine with the sunshine to create a pepper with a delicate, thin skin that is intense in flavour and red colour and gives off an amazing aroma as it roasts in kitchens, garages, or over fires in the garden all around Navarra, as families make the most of the season.</p>
<p class="indented">Occasionally at Brindisa we have brought over a few sacks of fresh red <em>piquillos</em> and grilled them on our barbecue to share with customers as a way of celebrating harvest time. And in the local Navarra markets you sometimes also see fresh green ones that have been picked early, but they tend to be less popular than the ripe red ones, as they are a little bitter in comparison – though they are excellent lightly fried on a <em>montadito</em> (toast) with some grilled pork loin. The majority of the harvest, however, is grown for charring and preserving in jars.</p>
<p class="indented">Ours are grown by Pepe Salcedo Soria. At harvest time, the bright red fruit peeps out from lines and lines of low plants stretching towards the horizon. Nimble pickers pack the peppers into huge wooden crates, then they are <a id="pg_276"/>washed and sorted. Traditionally, they would be tumbled on to a conveyor belt that took them through a funnel filled with burning beechwood, but the world moves on, and the process now uses gas flames – a shame, as I feel a little of the picturesque romance has been lost, even though the taste difference is minimal. The peppers are charred in a flash, losing around 60 per cent of their weight, so their flavour becomes even more concentrated. Then the belt carries them on to the warehouse, where they are gently and patiently hand-peeled by the women of the village – no use of an industrial water bath here that would strip the skins quickly but dilute their flavour in the process.</p>
<p class="indented">Once peeled, the women pack them one by one into jars and tins, placing the first ones flat against the outside of the jar or tin, then working inwards, and finally sealing them in nothing but their own juices. When you taste the peppers, their flavour is as intense as if they were still on the plant: sweet initially, then warm, slightly peppery and smoky on the finish.</p>
<p class="indented">At one time <em>piquillos</em> were cultivated and processed intensively in other regions of Spain, but outside Navarra production has largely transferred to countries like Peru, who can compete on price. Many Spanish companies are now packing Peruvian peppers – though not necessarily declaring the country of origin, in the way that we do at Brindisa. Their size is similar to the Spanish <em>piquillo</em>, the flesh fairly thin, and their flavour is as good as any other industrially produced pepper of this type; however, since they will usually be peeled using a water bath rather than by hand, they cannot compare with the exceptional quality of the traditional Lodosa <em>piquillo</em>, protected by its PDO.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1">How to use Quick and easy</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">In Spain <em>piquillos</em> are used a great deal for decorating plates; for example, a rice dish might come with five of them arranged to form a star on top. The beauty of the peppers is that they have already been roasted before being peeled and put into a jar or tin, so they are ready to stuff (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#g3">here</a>) or slice as you like, and they go well with so many ingredients, from tuna and capers (great as a sandwich filling) to soft cheese, to British pork sausages or steak. All of us at Brindisa hate to be without a jar in the cupboard and my colleagues are always swapping ideas on how to use them. This is a selection of our favourites:</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">To make a simple <em>tosta</em>, spread a layer of fresh curd or cream cheese on toast and top with the peppers. Or chop the peppers, then either pound them using a pestle and mortar or whiz them in a blender with garlic and enough extra virgin olive oil to form a paste. Spread on a slice of toasted bread, and top with Manchego cheese and some chopped chives.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">I particularly like chef Peter Gordon’s recipe for <em>piquillo</em> pepper harissa, for spreading on a slice of toasted bread topped with roasted vegetables, or spooning into a stew or soup. He toasts 2 teaspoons of cumin seeds, a teaspoon each of toasted fennel and coriander seeds, a stick of cinnamon and 2 star anise in a dry pan, grinds them, then blends to a paste with 300g of <em>piquillo</em> peppers, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 chopped chillies, a handful of fresh coriander, 2 tablespoons of dried mint, the juice and zest of 3 limes and around 150ml of olive oil.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Chop the peppers and scatter them over a <em>tortilla</em>, or use as a pizza topping, along with slices of aubergine and wild mushrooms.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after">Whiz some peppers with hummus in a blender and serve with grilled meats or burgers. Although the peppers don’t need heating, they are also good sautéd very briefly. I often use up <a id="pg_277"/>peppers from opened jars in this way, adding a little crushed garlic and sprinkling with a little PX vinegar, sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar, to serve alongside grilled meat or put into a grilled <em>chorizo</em> sandwich (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_67">here</a>). If you like, you can blend the peppers, garlic and vinegar to turn them into a smooth dipping sauce. Or add some capers and chopped herbs.</p>
<p class="flush_left">The peppers are also good cut into strips and pan-fried with cooked butter beans in a little olive oil, to serve alongside other small plates.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="g3">Stuffed <strong><em>piquillos</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">These are mainstays on tapas bar menus around Spain, featuring many fillings from the traditional to the experimental, easy or complex. Manu, one of our early chefs at the Food Rooms, likes to fill the peppers quite simply with a mixture of tuna, chopped hard-boiled egg and thinly sliced spring onions – great for a summer’s day.</p>
<p class="indented">When filling the peppers, you just need to handle them with care, as they are very thin and delicate. Carefully open each one out, then spoon in the filling of your choice.</p>
<p class="indented">In tapas bars, stuffed <em>piquillos</em> are often served perched on top of pieces of good bread or toast so you can eat them with your fingers while standing up – though it requires a bit of dexterity to eat neatly and hold a drink at the same time.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec113"><a id="pg_278"/>Pimiento de piquillo con meloso de setas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Piquillo</em> peppers stuffed with ‘creamy’ wild mushroom rice</p>

<p class="flush_left">If you want to make a more elaborate rice stuffing, a favourite at Brindisa is the squid black rice on <a href="chapter_004.html#rec135">here</a>.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">300ml chicken stock</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g risotto rice, such as Carnaroli, or Bomba (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_341">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g wild or chestnut mushrooms, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g spinach, washed</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g Manchego cheese, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers</p>
<p class="method">Bring the stock to the boil in a pan, add the rice, turn the heat down to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, then add the spinach and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Add the cheese for 2 more minutes. Season to taste.</p>
<p class="method">Very gently open out the peppers and, holding each one with the thumb and forefinger of one hand, use a teaspoon to stuff them – very carefully, taking care not to split the peppers. Transfer to a serving dish.</p>



<p class="recipe-head" id="rec114">Pimiento de piquillo con crema de queso y mojo verde</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Piquillo</em> pepper stuffed with goat’s curd, mixed herbs and mojo verde</p>

<p class="flush_left">These are really quick and colourful: great for summer parties and picnics. Josep, our executive chef, who came up with the combination, uses goat’s curd from La Bauma, but you could substitute cream cheese or cottage cheese.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g goat’s curd, cream cheese or cottage cheese</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon mixed herbs, such as thyme, rosemary, chives, parsley and lemon thyme, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 piquillo peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml <strong><em>mojo verde Brindisa</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Mix together the cheese and chopped herbs. Very gently open out the peppers and, holding each one with the thumb and forefinger of one hand, use a teaspoon to stuff them very carefully with the cheese mixture, taking care not to split the peppers. Top each one with a spoonful of <em>mojo verde</em>.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec115"><a id="pg_280"/>Pimiento de piquillo con morcilla de cebolla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Piquillo</em> peppers stuffed with <em>morcilla</em> with onion</p>
<p class="method">These have become a classic at our London Bridge tapas bar, where we present them in little terracotta dishes.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon raisins</p>
<p class="ingredients">170g <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> with onion (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>), skin removed, crumbled</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers</p>
<p class="forhead"><strong><em>To serve</em></strong> (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little hot tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_316">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the shallot and garlic and cook gently until soft but not coloured. Add the pine nuts and raisins, and let the pine nuts colour and the raisins expand a little. Add the <em>morcilla</em> and cook until it is heated through.</p>
<p class="method">Very gently open out the peppers and, holding each one with the thumb and forefinger of one hand, use a teaspoon to stuff them – very carefully, taking care not to split the peppers. Transfer to a serving dish, and if using, spoon some hot <em>sofrito</em> around.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1"><strong><em>Bierzo</em></strong> peppers (fresh or jarred)</p>
<p class="flush_left">The valley of El Bierzo in León has a privileged climate of many hours of sunshine, rainfall, great humidity and late frosts that enables the harvest of amazing vegetables and fruit right through to mid-November. These large, bell-shaped peppers are particularly succulent and fleshy, usually twice as long as they are wide, and orange-red, occasionally with streaks of green. Fresh Bierzo peppers are perfect for dishes such as <em>pollo al chilindrón</em>; however, one of our biggest surprises at Brindisa was discovering the juiciness and freshness of the peppers when roasted and jarred.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1">How to use</p>
<p class="flush_left">For a simple tapa, just warm the jarred peppers in a pan with a film of oil and a clove of garlic, as you might do with a <em>piquillo</em> pepper, and serve them with anchovies, or add them to a lentil salad.</p>
<p class="method">Another of our favourite things to do is combine the peppers with a fresh, 20-day goat’s cheese such as Tiétar Fresco, and eat them just as they are, or on toast.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><strong><em>Ñora</em></strong> (dried)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Our dried <em>ñora</em> peppers are grown by the García family in Murcia. The planting takes place in May, the fruit ripens and turns red over the warm summer and is harvested in the autumn, when only the fully ripened peppers will be picked, then dried on trays in large ventilated ovens. Drying is a slow process, taking about eight days, with the peppers being turned every 2 days, and the trays rotated, to ensure consistency in the drying. Then, once dried, one of the six elderly lady stringers will thread them on to <em>ristras</em> of 20 to 100 peppers.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_281"/>How to use</h4>
<p class="flush_left">You need to soak the dried peppers for half an hour to an hour to rehydrate them. Typically, the peppers are then roasted whole in oil, aromatising it ready to sauté onions and garlic to make a base for slow-cooked dishes. The pepper is then taken out, the flesh is scraped from the skin and then pounded to make a <em>picada/majada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>) for adding at the end of cooking. The peppers are not very fleshy, but what scrapings of flesh there are give an important, peppery sweetness to a dish.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1"><strong><em>Choricero</em></strong> (dried)</p>
<p class="flush_left">In Spain you can buy huge strings of around 100 dried red <em>choricero</em> peppers – we always have one, made by the García family’s network of stringers, hanging in the kitchen at home and many visitors think they are giant raisins or prunes, as they are so dark and wrinkled.</p>
<p class="indented">These large, mild, fleshy peppers grow in the Basque country as well as in La Rioja and once rehydrated in water have a deep, rich pepper flavour and subtle smokiness.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to use</h4>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Choriceros</em> are often used in place of <em>pimentón</em> (paprika), sometimes made into a pure <em>choricero</em> sauce or <em>gazpacho</em>, or typically added to lentil dishes, <em>rancho riojano</em> (Riojan stew) and, in the Basque country, salt cod <em>a la vizcayana</em>.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><strong><em>Pimientos de cristal</em></strong> (jarred)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Fully ripened crimson-red <em>cristal</em> peppers are some of the most delicate and sought-after peppers, with the thinnest skins of all – hence the name. They come from a small but very select harvest in the same region as the <em>piquillos</em> – Lodosa in Navarra – and are long and slender, wood-roasted and hand-peeled, then put into jars. So delicate are they that each kilo of fresh peppers will end up filling only a small 170g jar.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1">How to use</p>
<p class="flush_left">Sweet and smoky, the peppers are best eaten just as they come, with only a light dressing of olive oil and vinegar and a sprinkling of sea salt. Their sweetness combined with a salty ingredient such as bacon or anchovies is a match made in heaven. So try them straight from the jar with fried egg and bacon for a brunch dish, or on crusty bread with a fat, freshly-filleted cured anchovy.</p>

<h2 class="box-head" id="box11"><a id="pg_282"/>Life and Cooking with Mark and Arbell</h2>
<p class="flush_left">Perhaps the area of Catalunya that I have come to know best in recent years is Moianès, about an hour’s drive from Barcelona. This is where my brother, Mark, chose to settle with his second wife, Arbell, and family after years of living in the city of Barcelona, in order to pursue their dream of producing wine – a passion he always shared with my father. Their ancient stone farmhouse is in an area full of natural beauty overlooking the village of Santa Maria d’Oló, with the mountain of Montserrat to the south and the snow-capped Pyrenees to the north. It is a favourite with birdwatchers, since it is full of bee-eaters, woodpeckers and nightingales, and the house is called Can Coll Tor, which means House of the Wryneck, a sparrow-sized bird that lives on the ground and eats ants.</p>
<p class="indented">There are terraces of almond trees and groves of olives which Arbell cures herself, and they keep hens so they always have fresh eggs, but the main project is the wine: Vinos Colltor.</p>
<p class="indented">For the last ten years Mark and Arbell have been acquiring small tracts of land, planting, pruning, harvesting, dry-stonewalling and building a small <em>bodega</em>. Their land is within the Pla de Bages Denomination of Origin where neighbouring <em>bodegas</em> such as Abadal and Celler el Molí have blazed the trail, growing in prestige and encouraging recognition for the fine wines of this area.</p>
<p class="indented">The reds of the region tend to be very dark-coloured, full-bodied <em>crianza</em> wines (aged in oak) and the popular grapes are Merlot, which thrives in the area, the sturdy and reliable Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah, the wild card. Since this is a grape that likes a hot, dry climate, Mark and Arbell have high hopes for it. In addition, with a view to creating more distinctive wines over the coming years, they are planting white Picapoll and red Mando, indigenous varietals to blend with their established international ones.</p>
<p class="indented">Wine-making is a tough but exciting challenge, and while the first two vintages were barely drinkable, by 2011 the results were very good. In 2016 they not only produced around 10,000 bottles of their two red wines (in Catalan red wine is known as <em>vi negre</em>), but they achieved the mark of the Pla de Bages DO.</p>
<p class="indented"> Their white label is predominantly Merlot, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in American oak, and the black label is almost all Syrah, aged in French oak to create a very distinguished wine. I feel that we have created the perfect circle in that we are now able to <a id="pg_283"/>sell their wines in London and on the menu of our restaurant, La Bellvitja, in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="indented">When we visit Mark and Arbell in winter a favourite family event is to char <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> over a fire bolstered with vine trimmings, as this is also vine-pruning time.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> are the famous sweet, delicate Catalan onions that look like thin leeks or large spring onions and are the great February treat. The word <em>cal</em>ç<em>ot</em> means ‘shoed’ in Catalan, which refers to the fact that the onions are kept tender, white and juicy by piling the earth over and around them to create a shoe-shaped cover that keeps out the light as they try to push through the soil.</p>
<p class="indented">You buy the <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> in bundles of about 20 and traditionally, for a proper, traditional <em>cal</em>ç<em>otada</em> session, large groups of family and friends get together to cook them outside over a fire made inside a ring of stones with a grill on top. Mark and Arbell have converted a couple of shepherd shelters into <em>cal</em>ç<em>otada</em> venues, which can be used for an entire day in February–March to celebrate the season; however, we like to char them over the huge fireplace in the farmhouse kitchen.</p>
<p class="indented">As soon as the <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> come off the fire, we wrap them in newspaper like fish and chips, to let them steam a bit, then strip them of their charred casings and dip them into great bowls of <em>romesco</em> sauce. It’s a delicious, messy business that ends up with bits of ash-covered outer skins and dribbles of sauce everywhere, so we use more newspaper for a tablecloth, so that all the leftovers can just be bundled up and disposed of.</p>
<p class="center_head">CALÇOTS CON ROMESCO</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> are snapped up as soon as we begin to sell them and during their season you see them in restaurants all over London. At our own Shoreditch restaurant we serve an entire <em>cal</em>ç<em>otada</em> menu in February, which also features a selection of the grilled meats and vegetables that the Catalans love so much.</p>
<p class="indented">The traditional accompaniment is <em>romesco</em> sauce, and it is always worth making plenty of this, as it is also good spooned over any grilled vegetables, potatoes or meats such as <em>botifarra</em> and lamb chops, or mixed into certain rice dishes, to add texture and flavour. As usual in Spain, everyone has a slightly different and favourite version of <em>romesco</em>. See <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_304">here</a> for three quite different versions.</p>
<p class="indented">You can cook <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> on the barbecue in the traditional manner, or under the kitchen grill. Allow around six per person if you are serving them with other foods. Trim off the extra-long green leaves and any excessive outer casing, but leave at least one protective layer – you want the <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> to be roughly the diameter of a baby leek. Grill them on a high heat for 2–3 minutes, until the outer layer chars. Peel this off before eating, then dip into whichever <em>romesco</em> sauce you choose (my favourite is on <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_304">here</a>).</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec116"><a id="pg_284"/>Escalivada</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan roasted vegetables</p>
<p class="flush_left">In essence, this is just a collection of vegetables, oven-roasted or flame-grilled in their skins – most commonly red peppers, aubergines and onions – which are taken off the heat, skinned and cleaned of seeds, sliced, then eaten warm or allowed to get cold, dressed with oil and vinegar. However, every household will have their own way of enhancing the taste experience or stretching the dish with extra ingredients. María, the mother of my friend Núria Mayans Pla in Osona in Catalunya, makes a wonderful <em>escalivada</em> that unusually includes baked potatoes, which soak up the dressing beautifully and make the dish a little more filling, so I have given them as an option in this recipe. Other people add goat’s cheese, anchovies or sardines, which go very well with the juicy, fruity, roasted flavours of the peppers, onions and aubergines. Or you could add some roasted <em>piquillo</em> peppers from a jar (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Whatever you use, the success of the dish depends on the quality of your ingredients. Ideally, you want sun-ripened peppers and aubergines, which soften easily, and super-sweet onions. Out of season, or even if you are short of time, it is sometimes better to use jarred peppers and aubergines, which might have a better flavour. And equally important is the dressing: if you use an exquisite vinegar such as a Moscatel this will enhance the taste enormously.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium baking potatoes (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium onions, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 aubergines</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, cut into slivers</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium red peppers</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon good vinegar, such as Moscatel or Chardonnay</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">a handful of good black olives or 1 teaspoon Empeltre black olive pâté (or some good black olives, stoned and crushed)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="forhead">Optional</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 tinned cured anchovy fillets in oil, or sardines, or 100g crumbly goat’s cheese</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little chopped parsley (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">If using the potatoes, put them into the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until tender. Wrap the onions in foil and put into the oven for 45 minutes. Cut slits in each aubergine, and push a sliver of garlic into each one. Place on a baking tray in the oven for 30 minutes. Add the peppers to the tray for the last 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the skins from all the vegetables and cut into rough strips.</p>
<p class="method">Combine the oil, vinegar, garlic and seasoning for the dressing, toss through the vegetables and leave in the fridge for 3 hours, so that the flavours can mingle.</p>
<p class="method">To serve, arrange the vegetables to make the most of the different colours: either lay them out separately on a long plate with the potatoes to one side, or, if you are not using potatoes, you can layer them up in a more delicate presentation.</p>
<p class="method">If using olive pâté, or crushed olives, add a little extra virgin olive oil to loosen, then drizzle this over the dressed vegetables. Otherwise, add the olives to the plate. If using the anchovies or sardines, arrange them on top, or if using goat’s cheese crumble it over and, if you like, scatter with a little chopped parsley.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec117"><a id="pg_286"/>Pisto manchego de Ana Barrera con huevos rotos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Ana Barrera’s tomato and courgette ‘ <em>pisto’</em> with fried eggs</p>
<p class="flush_left">Throughout Spain you will find different interpretations of <em>pisto</em> and it can be very, very good, or extremely dull. Ana’s version is very, very good: full of warm colours and rich flavours. It is similar to ratatouille, but cooked slowly, for longer, with fewer ingredients, so it relies heavily on their quality, in particular the abundance of ruby ripe tomatoes which Ana first makes into a sauce. It is this that gives the <em>pisto</em> its lovely colour, which ratatouille often lacks.</p>
<p class="indented">Ana serves her <em>pisto</em> in the traditional way, with 2 eggs very lightly fried, so that the white is not crispy and the yolk is still runny. She breaks them up with a knife and fork and mixes them in – they will cook a little more in the heat of the vegetables. You barely see them in the finished dish, but they really enrich it.</p>
<p class="indented">At Brindisa, we add just the yolks – 3 are enough for 6 people – as this is where the flavour is concentrated. We break the eggs and slide each yolk into a teacup, then heat some olive oil in a pan and pour just enough into the cup to cover and lightly cook the yolk (you could do this with boiling water if you prefer). Then we lift out the yolks with a slotted spoon and arrange them on top of the vegetables, ready to be mixed in. If you want to be quite smart you could serve the <em>pisto</em> in individual bowls with an egg yolk perched on the top of each one.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6</p>

<p class="ingredients">2–3 eggs, lightly fried, or yolks cooked as above (optional)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the sauce</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2kg very ripe tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little salt or sugar as necessary</p>
<p class="method">To make the sauce, put the chopped onion and whole tomatoes into a large pan and drizzle with the olive oil (rather than heating the olive oil first). Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat and cook very, very slowly for 2 hours. Put through a fine sieve and taste. You are looking for a rich tomato flavour nicely balanced between sweetness and acidity. If it tastes too acidic, add a touch of sugar, and if too sweet, counteract this with a little salt.</p>
<p class="method">Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan, put in the peppers and cook for about 30 minutes, very gently, until they are quite soft, then add the onions and cook very slowly for about 30 minutes, until completely soft.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, heat some more olive oil in a separate pan, add the courgettes and, again, cook gently for about 30 minutes, then add to the pan of onion and peppers and cook for a further 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">If too much oil has come to the surface at the end of this time, drain it off, then add the tomato sauce and cook for at least 15 minutes more. Taste and again season with salt and/or sugar, if necessary. If serving with eggs or yolks, arrange these on top.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec118"><a id="pg_287"/>Cigrons guisats a la catalana</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Chickpeas Catalan-style with saffron and almond <em>picada</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">My friend Jordi Puigvi lent me a wonderful book called <em>La Cuina que torna</em>, written by Josep Lladanosa, who was the chef at the very famous and respected <em>7 Portes</em> restaurant in Barcelona, which has been there for 170 years and specialises in Catalan cooking, particularly rice dishes. Lladanosa is now in his seventies, and is a prolific writer of fascinating books that delve into the history and techniques of Catalan cooking as far back as the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>La Cuina que torna</em> means ‘the dishes that come back’, i.e. old favourites, and it particularly caught my eye, as it is divided into chapters such as Food of the Poor (which includes pulses and offal; Food of the Rich, which includes meat; and Food of the Gods, which features game and fowl. I particularly like the Food of the Poor chapter, with its economical dishes designed to stave off hunger and give you strength, such as this chickpea dish which combines many different flavours.</p>
<p class="indented">The tomato flavour in this dish should be present, but not overwhelming; however, it does rely on sweet, ripe, seasonal tomatoes, or cherry tomatoes. If you really don’t feel you are getting enough flavour from your tomatoes, you could add a jar of bought <em>sofrito de tomate</em> or about 300g of homemade instead (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_318">here</a> for the recipe).</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g dried chickpeas, such as the small <strong><em>pedrosillano</em></strong>, or 600g jarred, cooked chickpeas</p>
<p class="ingredients">10g bicarbonate of soda (if using dried chickpeas)</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 ripe medium tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g blanched almonds, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 threads of saffron, soaked</p>
<p class="ingredients">a big handful of parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="method">If using dried chickpeas, soak them the night before in warm water with the bicarbonate of soda. Drain and put into a pan, cover with cold water, bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer for about 1½ hours, until tender. Drain, again, reserving the cooking water.</p>
<p class="method">Put the eggs into cold water and bring to a simmer gently so that the shells don’t crack, then cook gently for 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water, then peel and slice.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan, add the onions and cook very, very gently for about 20 minutes, until translucent and sweet, then add the tomatoes and cook for a further 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the cooked chickpeas (or jarred ones) together with about 200ml of the reserved cooking water, or liquid from the jar, topped up if necessary with water, and heat through.</p>
<p class="method">With a pestle and mortar, pound the chopped almonds with the saffron, parsley and garlic. Blend with another 50ml of the reserved cooking liquid (or water if using jarred chickpeas), then add to the pan of chickpeas and sauce. Stir through, taste and season.</p>
<p class="method">Serve topped with sliced eggs.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="recb10"><a id="pg_288"/>PATATAS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Potatoes</p>
<p class="flush_left">One vegetable that really comes into its own on the tapas menu is the potato – often with some lardons, or slivers of <em>chorizo</em> or black pudding added. Spain was the gateway to Europe for the potato when it arrived from the Americas, so it is well loved. And the Spanish can be as obsessive about varieties as we often are in the UK, extolling the virtues of their local crops, such as Bufet from Cerdanya in the Pyrenees. The mountain potato has grown there since the end of the nineteenth century, when the seeds were brought in from Brittany of a variety called Institut Beauvis, which became Bufet in Catalan. It can be white or purple and has a creamy flesh and a fabulous, slightly sweet, almost chestnutty flavour, but because the production, especially of the purple potatoes, is very small, it can be expensive. Bufet is the preferred potato for <em>trinxat de la</em> <em>Cerdanya</em>, the Pyrenean potato, bacon and cabbage patty that always reminds me of bubble and squeak.</p>
<p class="indented">Then there is Bonita, the ancient potato from the Canaries that is of Andean origin and comes in a range of colours from black to red, yellow and white, each of which might have its own descriptive name, such as ‘partridge-eye’.</p>
<p class="indented">Across Spain there are endless variations of <em>patatas a lo pobre</em> – ‘poor man’s’ potatoes with whatever else a family had in the larder added to them – perhaps some mushrooms and garlic, green pepper or tomatoes. Our friends Pepe and Mercedes (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_80">here</a>) told us a story that I particularly like about a version known as <em>patatas a lo pobre estilo merluza</em>, poor man’s potatoes hake-style, in which the potatoes are cooked in fish stock, then mixed with green peas, parsley and coriander and finished off with chopped cooked egg white and grated egg yolk. Who knows whether it is true or not, but the idea was apparently that if you were eating outside, when your neighbours walked past, the aroma and look of the dish might convince them that you weren’t eating a humble dish of potatoes, but hake in green sauce.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec119"><a id="pg_289"/>Patatas enmascaradas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">‘Masked’ or ‘dirtied’ potatoes</p>
<p class="flush_left">Not very photogenic, but delicious, this Catalan dish is also called <em>patatas ensuciadas</em> (tainted). The rather unflattering names refer to the changing and blackening of the white potato by the black pudding (<em>morcilla</em>, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>), or <em>botifarra negra</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p450a">here</a>), so the first time I made this and took it to our warehouse kitchen to share with my non-Catalan Brindisa colleagues I was afraid they would be horrified, but in fact they loved it and wolfed it down. Even so, I find that if you cream the potatoes and thoroughly mix in the black pudding, as is the tendency in Catalunya, the resulting dish can have a look of cowpat about it, so I prefer to mash, almost chop, the potatoes very roughly, and mix in the black pudding quite lightly, so that the effect is of black and white, with some texture to it.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Patatas enmascaradas</em> is a regular home-cooked combination of the kind known as <em>de toda la vida</em>, literally ‘of always’, among Catalans living inland, especially in the mountainous area of La Berguedà. It is a firm favourite with our friend Enric, the chocolate wizard of Rovira Chocolates (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p34a">here</a>), and his uncle Francésc – I always find it comforting to discover that even great aesthetic artists such as Enric like nothing better than to sit around the table at their home in Castellbell i el Vilar and share simple, traditional potato dishes like this one.</p>
<p class="indented">This particular version was perfected with the help of my friend Boojum.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4 as a side dish or 6–8 as a tapa with other dishes</p>
<p class="ingredients">30g pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg floury potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g <strong><em>panceta</em></strong> or bacon, chopped, plus 1 slice of <strong><em>panceta</em></strong> or whole rasher</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g <strong><em>botifarra negra</em></strong> or <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> with onion, skinned and broken up</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped mint</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="method">Toast the pine nuts in a dry pan until golden and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Cook the potatoes until just tender in just enough boiling, salted water to cover, then drain through a colander and place this back over the still-hot pan, to allow them to steam a little and dry off.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the chopped <em>panceta</em> or bacon, plus the whole slice of <em>panceta</em>/rasher, until crispy, then lift out, drain on kitchen paper and keep to one side. Put the black pudding pieces into the same pan and cook for about 3 minutes, moving them around, but also letting them catch a little on the base of the pan until you have crispy little nuggets.</p>
<p class="method">Crush the potatoes roughly, add the black pudding, chopped <em>panceta</em> or bacon, parsley and mint, and just draw them through the potatoes with a fork. What you are aiming for is a contrast of white and black rather than the potatoes and black pudding all merging into one colour. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Serve with the whole crispy slice of <em>panceta</em>/rasher on top, and sprinkle with the reserved toasted pine nuts.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec120"><a id="pg_290"/>Patatas a la importancia</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Potatoes with tomatoes and almonds</p>
<p class="flush_left">The almonds really add character to the potatoes and make this a filling winter dish, especially good alongside small plates of grilled fish. Typically, you would serve them in a terracotta <em>cazuela</em>, the famous round or oblong dish that can be used on top of the stove or in the oven.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g blanched almonds, preferably Marcona (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p90a">here</a>), plus a few extra to garnish</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5kg potatoes, such as Vivaldi</p>
<p class="ingredients">salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 200ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_316">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Lay the almonds on a baking tray and put into the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, until golden. Remove from the oven, cool, then pound in a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p class="method">Cook the potatoes, whole and unpeeled, in salted water until just tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Drain, and when cool enough to touch, cut into slices about 1.5cm thick.</p>
<p class="method">Have the beaten eggs and some flour ready in separate shallow bowls. Coat the potato slices first in egg and then flour, shaking off the excess.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a pan. Make sure it is big enough so that the oil doesn’t come further up than halfway. Put in the potato slices and fry them gently until golden. Lift out and drain in a single layer on kitchen paper, then transfer the slices to a wide, flameproof casserole or <em>cazuela</em> (the traditional terracotta dish).</p>
<p class="method">Pour away some of the oil from the pan in which you cooked the potatoes, leaving a couple of tablespoons only. Put the pan back on the heat, add the onion and garlic and cook gently until soft, but not coloured. Add the tomato <em>sofrito</em>, the pounded almonds and chopped parsley and cook briefly. Add 200ml of water to the mixture, stir well, then spoon over the top of the potatoes in the casserole. Cover with a lid (if using a <em>cazuela</em>, use foil) and cook over a low heat until the potatoes are completely tender, adding a little extra water if the sauce becomes too thick.</p>
<p class="method">Serve garnished with a few crushed almonds.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec121"><a id="pg_292"/>Patates estofades amb rossinyols</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Potato and girolle sauté</p>
<p class="flush_left">Another warming and autumnal combination adapted by our executive chef, Josep, from a recipe by Llorenç Petrás, the wild-food man from Barcelona (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_268">here</a>). Whenever we make it at home for the family it just flies off the table. The best surprise when you combine potato and mushroom is how aromatic the dish becomes.</p>
<p class="indented">Traditionally for certain one-pot dishes such as this, the potatoes are chopped in a particular irregular way, using a technique known as <em>cascada</em>, or ‘cracking’ (from the verb <em>cascar</em>). The potatoes are first cut into quite big chunks of about 4–5cm, then you insert a small, sharp knife halfway into each chunk and twist the blade until the potato breaks into jagged pieces (<em>cascadas</em>), making a cracking sound as it does so. Because the potato breaks unevenly, as if along fault lines, the cell walls stay more intact and less exposed than if you sliced through them with a knife. So as they simmer, less starch is released and the potatoes cook evenly all the way through rather than being slightly softer on the outside.</p>
<p class="indented">If using a green pepper, it is best to find a thin-skinned variety, which will usually be less bitter.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g girolles or other wild mushrooms, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of rosemary, about 2cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a small green pepper (optional), roughly chopped, about 2cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (mild paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 ripe tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g potatoes, peeled and broken <strong><em>cascada</em></strong>-style into rough 2cm pieces (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_292">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt (if necessary)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sugar (if necessary)</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 6 blanched almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan, then add the whole garlic clove, frying gently until golden brown. Add the onion and cook gently over a medium heat until it also begins to turn brown, but not crispy. Remove the garlic clove and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Add the mushrooms to the pan along with the thyme, bay leaf and rosemary and fry over a medium heat for around 5 minutes, until the mushrooms release their juices, but don’t let them boil.</p>
<p class="method">Add the green pepper, stirring in well, and continue to fry over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until just tender. Sprinkle in the paprika and let it fry for 30 seconds before adding the grated tomato. Cook on a steady simmer for 3 minutes, add a twist of black pepper, then stir in the potatoes, making sure they are well covered with oil, mushrooms and tomato. Continue to cook until the edges are beginning to brown, then add 250ml of cold water and bring the contents of the pan back to the boil. Taste and if necessary add a pinch of salt and the sugar.</p>
<p class="method">Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for around 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, make a simple <em>picada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>). Crush the reserved garlic using a pestle and mortar. Add the almonds and mash into a paste. Loosen with 4 tablespoons of water, then add the mixture back to the pan of mushrooms and potatoes at the end of the cooking time. Let the <em>picada</em> heat through briefly, sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve hot.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec122"><a id="pg_293"/>Patatas revolconas con sus torreznos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Paprika tumbled potatoes with lardons</p>
<p class="flush_left">I love the name of this dish: <em>revolconas</em> is derived from the word <em>revolc</em>ó<em>n</em>, which means a tumble or roll around in the hay, kissing and canoodling, so there is something very romantic and fun about the idea of the lardons (<em>torreznos</em>) and the potatoes frolicking together.</p>
<p class="indented">I first ate <em>patatas revolconas</em> way back in the early heady days of Brindisa when I and my great school friend Tara O’Connor were on a trip to see Julián Sánchez García, our bean supplier in Ávila.</p>
<p class="indented">We walked high up into the Gredos mountains, where icy cold lakes irrigate the growing beans, and as Tara and I were wearing shorts, we were frozen. So on our way back to the village of El Barco, where Julián sorts and grades the dried beans, he took us to a mountain bar, where they served up this wonderful dish of creamed potatoes, reddened and flavoured with smoky <em>pimentón</em>, with chunky bacon pieces in it. Central heating in a bowl!</p>
<p class="indented">Since then I have eaten it many times at Ana Barrera’s restaurant in Madrid (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>), where it is a staple, loved by all her regulars. It is typical of her style of cooking that she takes these kinds of dishes you would make at home – but raises them to a highly exacting level.</p>
<p class="indented">She makes the dish with <em>papada ibérica,</em> slabs of pork jowl from Ibérico pigs, which she buys semi-cured and prepared to her own specifications, from a particular butcher. The <em>papada</em> consists mainly of silky-white, acorn-fed, beautifully sweet and tasty fat, with the thinnest streaks of lean pork running through the base. There is nothing visually delicate about Ana’s <em>torreznos</em>; she cuts them into quite doorstep-like chunks – about 2cm x 1cm thick – which she sautés in olive oil to which they add their own fat, until they are crispy-crunchy on the outside and delicate and melting – almost liquid – on the inside. Then she uses the oil from cooking them, flavoured with paprika from La Vera, near to her native Ávila, to make the most delicious, warming crushed potato.</p>
<p class="indented">This idea of flavouring oil with paprika is something many people do, especially in northern Spain, when cooking all kinds of vegetables. For example, you might blanch some cauliflower, then sauté it briefly in oil, just enough to colour it, lift it out, then flavour the oil with paprika and pour it back over the cauliflower. My friend Ambrosio in Burgos (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>) calls this oily paprika ‘sauce’ <em>salsa preve</em>, and it can be enhanced with garlic, dried peppers, parsley and vinegar. It is also used to flavour meats or fish from the barbecue. Just a note of caution: be careful not to burn the paprika, as it will give the oil a bitter flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">If you can’t find <em>papada</em>, you can use <em>panceta</em> instead. Ana also recommends you use a quite neutral potato with a floury texture, as the potato flavour shouldn’t dominate; instead it should really absorb the oil and paprika, and take on its smoky, bittersweet flavour.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg potatoes, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 250g <strong><em>panceta</em></strong> or <strong><em>papada ibérica</em></strong>, cut into chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ of an onion, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon bittersweet paprika, plus a little extra to finish</p>
<p class="method">Cook the potatoes gently in just enough salted, boiling water to cover, with the garlic and bay leaf.</p>
<p class="method">While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil, put in the chunks of <em>panceta</em> or <em>papada ibérica</em> and seal quickly, then reduce the heat and keep moving the pieces around so that they cook slowly and take on a golden colour, but don’t burn. This will take about 5 minutes. They should be crispy on the outside and very soft inside. Lift out and drain on kitchen paper. Add the onion to the oil and cook for a few minutes, just to flavour the oil, then remove it. Take off the heat and let the oil cool a little, then add the paprika, stirring well.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_294"/>When the potatoes are tender, drain them over a bowl, so that you reserve the water. Discard the garlic and bay leaf.</p>
<p class="method">Add the potato water, a little at a time, to the oil and paprika, being careful to avoid spitting, and stirring well. Crush the potatoes, then gradually work in the flavoured oil and potato water a little at a time. The potato should taste strongly of the paprika.</p>
<p class="method">Serve topped with the lardons and sprinkle, if you like, with a little more paprika.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec123">Patatas bravas Brindisa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fried potatoes with Brindisa <em>brava</em> sauce</p>
<p class="flush_left">If I am honest, I have never quite understood why this particular potato dish is so much more popular than others – especially as I have frequently encountered it done very badly, with potatoes that are crunchy on the outside, but not cooked properly inside, or a sauce that is either weak, watery and separating, or overpoweringly hot. However, since it is probably the most famous Spanish potato dish and we do have it on the menu at Brindisa, I couldn’t write a book without including it.</p>
<p class="indented">Of course, once you start talking to Spanish cooks about <em>patatas bravas</em>, like <em>tortillas</em> and <em>croquetas</em>, everyone has a critical viewpoint on the way to make it ‘properly’, but in my experience, the best way to achieve the right crunch and cooking of the potatoes is to use King Edwards, cut them into squares and blanch them briefly first, as you would for roast potatoes, then drain, dry and deep-fry them. Potatoes done this way are also good served just with <em>alioli</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_136">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">The original <em>brava</em> sauce, which was typical of Madrid, was actually quite thin, with a meaty background flavour as it was made with the stock left over from a <em>cocido</em> (stew), to which tomatoes and peppers were added. However, I think it should be thick enough to properly cling to the potatoes. We like to give ours a freshness by using a whole red chilli, which can be topped up with dried varieties to adjust the heat to your preference – though the aim is not to make the sauce so hot that you can’t appreciate the other flavours.</p>
<p class="makes"><a id="pg_295"/>Serves 4 as a tapa with other dishes</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g potatoes, preferably King Edward, peeled and cut into squares of about 2.5cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml vegetable or sunflower oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="forhead">For the salsa brava</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 fresh red chilli pepper or a pinch of dried chilli flakes (plus extra flakes if required)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ a large leek, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g ripe medium tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon tomato purée, if needed</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt, or to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sugar, or to taste</p>
<p class="method">First, make the <em>brava</em> sauce. If using a fresh chilli pepper, preheat the grill, roast the pepper for 2 minutes on each side to bring out the flavour, then leave to cool and remove the stalk.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a pan, add the onion, carrot, leek, garlic and the whole roasted chilli pepper, if using, and cook very slowly for 25–30 minutes, until the vegetables are soft, but not coloured, stirring from time to time to make sure they are not catching.</p>
<p class="method">Either grate the tomatoes or, if you prefer, de-skin and de-seed them (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_206">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Add the tomatoes to the pan. If you are using chilli flakes instead of a fresh chilli, add them now. Simmer over a very low heat for 1¼ hours, stirring frequently. Taste and add extra dried chilli if necessary to give more heat. The sauce should be a rich, deep orange colour, but if your tomatoes aren’t the ripest, you might want to help the colour – and flavour – with a tablespoon of tomato purée.</p>
<p class="method">When you are happy with the spiciness, take the pan off the heat and blend the sauce in a food processor until it is as thick as mayonnaise. Taste and if necessary season with salt and/or a pinch of sugar.</p>
<p class="method">Cook the potatoes in boiling water for 10 minutes, until tender if pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, then drain in a colander and leave to dry.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a deep pan (making sure it comes no further than a third of the way up). It needs to be around 180°C, but if you don’t have a thermometer, put in a small piece of potato and if it sizzles the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p class="method">Put in the potatoes and deep-fry for about 3 minutes, until they are golden and crunchy all round. Drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">Sprinkle with salt and serve with the <em>brava</em> sauce. You can spoon this over the top of the potatoes, or do as I prefer and serve it on the side, so that people can take as much or as little as they like.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Salt-wrinkled potatoes</p>
<p class="flush_left">Every visitor to the Canary Islands will be offered <em>papas arrugadas</em>, which is their famous dish of wrinkled potatoes (<em>papas</em>), served with a red and/or green <em>mojo</em> sauce (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>) – though I also think the potatoes are wonderful with <em>romesco</em> sauce (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_304">here</a>). Sometimes some crumbled goat’s cheese and fried almond slices will be sprinkled over the top, in which case the dish is known as <em>papas garrapiñadas</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">The variety of potato they use is Bonita, which is small, irregular in shape, with dark yellowy insides, quite floury in texture and with a strong flavour. For a small potato it has a thick skin, which does actually wrinkle away from the flesh, though you may find you don’t get the same effect with English potatoes.</p>
<p class="indented">You need to cook the potatoes in lots of salty water – originally it would have been sea water, so the idea is to recreate the same ratio of salt to water (sea water is 3.5 per cent salt). The locals say that if you have enough salt in the water the potatoes will float.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>

<p class="method">Put the potatoes into a pan with enough salted water to cover (use a ratio of 50g sea salt to 1.5 litres of water). Bring to the boil and let the potatoes cook until they are just tender. Drain them, leaving just a little water on them (as you would when draining pasta), then put them back into the pan over a very low heat. Don’t cover them, just let them dry off for about 7 minutes, rolling them around in the dry pan so that they don’t burn. You will see the salt crystallize around the potatoes.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the heat and cover with a tea towel for about 20 minutes, until there is a fine patina of salt on the skins of the potatoes. If you are lucky, they will also have wrinkled a little.</p>
<p class="method">Serve with the <em>mojo rojo</em> and/or <em>mojo verde</em> drizzled over.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘everyone has their own variation’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Many regions have their own favoured sauces, for example the <em>salmorreta</em> of Alicante, made with <em>ñora</em> peppers, tomatoes and garlic, which is added to the local rice and seafood dishes and stews.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">The mojos of the Canaries</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Some of the most famous, however, are the Canarian <em>mojos</em> – these are more like a pesto than a sauce – which are inevitably served in traditional fashion alongside salt-wrinkled potatoes, <em>papas arrugadas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_296">here</a>), or grilled fish such as the local <em>cherne</em> (sea bass), but are also increasingly being used in more imaginative ways. On one trip to Gran Canaria, at Restaurante Nelson in Agüimes, I ate a starter of the local, delicate white Palmero goat’s cheese, grilled lightly on the <em>plancha</em>, so that it had a little bit of crust on the outside, but was soft and gooey inside, served with a green coriander <em>mojo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p300a">here</a>) and tomato jam (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_533">here</a>), and it was really delicious.</p>
<p class="indented">The two most typical <em>mojos</em> are made with either green or red peppers (<em>mojo verde</em> or <em>mojo rojo</em>), but there is no standard recipe: everyone has their own variation, using different herbs, garlic, a drop of vinegar, perhaps, and like an Italian talking about pesto, every Canarian islander will tell you <em>theirs</em> is the only true way.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p298a">Mojo verde Brindisa</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Brindisa Canarian green sauce</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is one of the <em>mojos</em> we make all the time at home – it is slightly more delicate than its red counterpart, made with a sweeter vinegar and less garlic, but it still punches quite hard.</p>
<p class="indented">It really suits potatoes, cooked in any style, and goes especially well with tapas of squares of firm white fish such as <em>cherne</em> (sea bass), floured and lightly fried.</p>
<p class="indented">Again, because you are dealing with small quantities, you could use a pestle and mortar – but this <em>mojo</em> is designed for making in a blender.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 300ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g bread, fried in olive oil and broken into small pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons ground cumin</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">4–6 heaped tablespoons chopped coriander or parsley, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">300ml olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Blend all the ingredients apart from the salt and the oil, then add the oil slowly and season to taste.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head"><a id="pg_300"/>Mojo rojo picón Brindisa</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Brindisa Canarian hot red sauce</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Mojo rojo</em> is the typical sauce for serving with <em>papas arrugadas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_296">here</a>), though you could also choose <em>mojo verde</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>). This is the version we make in our Brindisa kitchens, using the hot <em>guindilla</em> pepper in equal quantities with garlic cloves. We make it often at home and use it to add to a tapa of grilled cutlets of lamb, beans and pulses, or even a burger, steak slider or sandwich. If you want to reduce the heat of the sauce you can add a little fresh or roasted red pepper to the blend (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#g1">here</a>). Some people add pieces of fried bread to thicken the sauce, but I feel that it is fresher without.</p>
<p class="indented">With such small quantities it is easy to make by hand using a pestle and mortar, but if you want to use a blender, put in all the ingredients, except the oil, and blend to a paste, then slowly add the oil while continuing to blend.</p>
<p class="makes" id="g1">Makes 300ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 long <strong><em>guindilla</em></strong> chilli peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a red pepper (or the equivalent roasted and peeled pepper from a jar) (optional, to reduce the heat)</p>
<p class="ingredients">¾ teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">75ml wine vinegar, such as Cabernet Sauvignon</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml olive oil</p>
<p class="method">First, prepare the peppers by soaking them in warm water for 20 minutes. Drain them and scrape out the flesh.</p>
<p class="method">Grind the cumin seeds using a pestle and mortar and put through a fine sieve. Return to the mortar with the rest of the ingredients, except the olive oil, and pound to a paste. Add the olive oil slowly and work it in until well combined.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p300a">Mojo verde con pimiento y cilantro</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Coriander <em>mojo</em> with green peppers</p>
<p class="method">This recipe was given to me by Miguel García, one of our Soho chefs who is from Tenerife and always has the calmness and smile typical of island life. It is a variation on the green sauce recipe for serving with <em>papas arrugadas</em>. A softer, herby <em>mojo</em>, it is good with fish, cuttlefish and squid tapas, as well as pan-fried semi-cured or even lightly smoked goat’s cheese.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 300ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">2–3 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons chopped coriander</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped parsley (optional, if you want to soften the coriander flavour)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼–½ a fresh green pepper, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a fresh green chilli (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">180ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="method">As with the red version of this, the traditional way to make the <em>mojo</em> is using a pestle and mortar, but the easy way is to whiz everything, except the oil, in a blender, then add the oil slowly at the end to allow it to emulsify properly.</p>
<p class="method">If using a pestle and mortar, first crush the garlic cloves with the salt (the salt helps to smash the garlic). Add the chopped coriander, parsley, if using, and the cumin, and grind until you have a paste. Add the fresh green pepper and chilli, if using, and continue to grind, until you once again have a paste.</p>
<p class="method">Add the oil, a little at a time, until it is all incorporated. Finally, mix in the vinegar. Do this just before serving, to keep the powerful green colour that the coriander gives to the sauce. If it feels too thick, add a few drops of water.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head"><a id="pg_301"/>Mojo de naranja</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Orange and coriander sauce</p>
<p class="flush_left">My good friend Boojum is a great cook who ran a National Trust café in Stackpole Quay in Pembrokeshire, Wales, but has also spent a great deal of time in Spain and the island of Mallorca, where she and her family have a home. Living so near the sea she has access to very fresh fish, so is constantly looking for good ways of serving it – and when she and I were testing sauces for this book, we were intrigued by a recipe for a <em>mojo</em> made with bitter oranges in a little book of Canarian cooking that I found in a shop at Las Palmas airport. We thought it would be amazing with tapas of grilled fish. In fact, the rather sketchy recipe in the book ended up as just a starting point from which we departed quite a long way, changing the bitter oranges for sweet ones, but we loved the result: fragrant with orange, coriander and soft Moscatel vinegar yet pungent with garlic (though you can reduce the number of cloves if you prefer a milder taste). As well as being great with fish, it is lovely spooned on to chicken casseroles.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 300ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 small slices (about 20g) stale country-style/ sourdough bread with the crusts cut off</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 juicy oranges</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 teaspoons Moscatel vinegar</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small pan, put in the bread and fry briefly until just golden. Remove and set aside. Pound the garlic to a paste with the salt, using a pestle and mortar, add the bread and keep pounding, then put in the coriander leaves and pound to a smoothish paste.</p>
<p class="method">Cut the oranges in half across the middle and squeeze the juice into the mixture in the mortar, working it in with the pestle all the time. Tear out the remaining pulp from the oranges (avoiding the pith and seeds) and incorporate. Work in the remaining olive oil, and then the vinegar.</p>
<p class="method">Pour into a bowl and then leave to stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour, to let the flavours develop.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Almogrote Brindisa</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Canarian cheese sauce</p>
<p class="method">We make this chunky cheese sauce in our Food Rooms in Brixton to serve as a dip with little breadsticks, and everyone seems to love it. What is especially pleasing is that when we first started offering it almost no one had previously heard of <em>almogrote</em>, so it has been rewarding to introduce something so simple but quite intriguing.</p>
<p class="indented">Sometimes called <em>mojo de queso, almogrote</em> can be used in a similar way to the <em>mojo rojo</em> and <em>mojo verde</em> (red and green sauces, see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_300">here</a>) which you find all over the Canary Islands, and though its texture is heavier, it is equally fantastic with potatoes.</p>
<p class="indented">Historically, <em>almogrote</em> is related to the Roman <em>moratum</em>, a sauce made with cheese, pounded with garlic and herbs, and more recently the <em>picada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>) or even an <em>alioli</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_136">here</a>). There are versions of <em>almogrote</em> all around Spain. In Castilla they call theirs <em>almodrote</em>, and in Catalunya, where it is known as <em>almedroc</em>, the sauce appears in two of the region’s ancient cookery books: <em>Llibre de</em> <em>Sent Soví</em>, the oldest manuscript of its kind, which details dishes from the kitchens of the wealthy in the fourteenth century, and the sixteenth-century <em>Llibre del Coch</em> (literally ‘The Cookery Book’), the first edition of which is attributed to ‘Master Robert’, cook to King Ferdinand of Naples.</p>
<p class="indented">Despite this tie to Catalunya the sauce seems to have found its long-term home on the Canarian island of La Gomera, where I have eaten many different versions, some with chilli and tomatoes added, or, more adventurously, cooked <a id="pg_302"/>egg yolk, cinnamon, nutmeg or ginger. It can be spooned on to <em>papas arrugadas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_296">here</a>) or small, halved potatoes that have been boiled in their jackets; served simply with crackers for tapas; or added to grilled meats or vegetables.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally it was a subsistence recipe designed to make use of old and dried-out pieces of cheese, though if you grate some good cheese it will be much tastier. It is usually made with a mature goat’s cheese – at the Food Rooms we use Majorero (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p531aa">here</a>) – however, it would also be good with a semi-cured goat’s cheese such as Payoyo from Andalucía (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p524b">here</a>) or Tiétar from Ávila. We also make it with Manchego (sheep’s milk), and you could even use the cow’s milk Castellot (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p510">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">The sauce has to emulsify in the same way as mayonnaise or <em>alioli</em>, so you have to add the oil or water carefully and slowly. In <em>Sent Sovi</em> there is a tip which suggests that if the sauce doesn’t bind, the thing to do is take a spoonful of it, warm it through, then mix it back in.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 300g</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 <strong><em>choricero</em></strong> peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g hard goat’s or sheep’s cheese, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g olive oil</p>
<p class="method">First prepare the peppers by soaking them in warm water for 20–30 minutes. Drain them well, then scrape out the flesh.</p>
<p class="method">It is best to use a blender for this, so put in all the ingredients except the oil, and blend, then add the oil slowly, continuing to blend, to allow the sauce to emulsify properly.</p>

<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_303"/>Almond sauces of Catalunya</h4>
<p class="flush_left">There is a big debate among cooks over the difference between the more famous <em>romesco</em> sauce, used mainly to dress grilled vegetables, potatoes and fish, and the extremely similar Catalan <em>xató</em> sauce, which is used for <em>xatonada</em> salad, made with salt cod (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec70">here</a>). There is also a third, similar sauce known as <em>salvitxada</em>, which is made with raw, rather than roasted garlic (as used in the other two) and is more like a dressing or Canarian <em>mojo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">In all the discussions I have had with Catalan home cooks and chefs I have never found any consensus over texture, ingredients, or their quantities. Everyone has their own recipe that they insist is the one and only, and the arguments are perpetuated particularly in the Catalan villages of San Pedro de Ribes, Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltru, and Villafranca del Penedès, where annual competitions are held to judge the best of the various sauces.</p>
<p class="indented">Some say that bread should be used in <em>romesco</em> but not in <em>xat</em>ó. Others dispute this, but say instead that <em>romesco</em> doesn’t contain parsley, whereas <em>xat</em>ó does. Sometimes the garlic and tomatoes – used in both sauces – are roasted in the oven before peeling, or sometimes they are held over a gas flame to blacken them, which adds a smoky characterful flavour. The verb that describes this charring over a flame is <em>escalivar</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">There are many variations of <em>romesco</em> alone, and since one of the best known ways of serving it is with <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_283">here</a>), some people even distinguish their recipes as <em>salsa de cal</em>ç<em>ots.</em> I have included three favourite versions, which illustrate the subtle differences you can achieve with a small set of ingredients. They are pretty interchangeable, and all are good with vegetables, fish or chicken. However, I think that if you are serving <em>romesco</em> with <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> you need a sauce with a creamy texture such as our own Brindisa recipe see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_304">here</a>.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p303a">Xató sauce</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is specifically designed to go with the <em>xatonada</em> (salt cod) salad see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec70">here</a>, and has less garlic than the romesco sauces.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 200g</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tomato</p>
<p class="ingredients">1–2 baguette slices or 2 <strong><em>picos de pan</em></strong> (mini breadsticks), broken into small pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch each of salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon roughly chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas 3.</p>
<p class="method">Roast the nuts on a tray in the preheated oven for 8 minutes, keeping a careful eye on them and turning the tray if necessary to keep the nuts at the edges and the back from getting burnt. Give the tray a gentle shake every now and then. Once the nuts are dark golden in colour, take them out of the oven and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Turn the oven up to to 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">Wrap the garlic clove in foil, place on an oven tray with the tomato and put into the oven. Roast the tomato for about 15 minutes, until its skin is beginning to blacken, and leave the garlic clove in for a further 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the skins from both, chop the tomato and crush the garlic and keep to one side. Crush the nuts and bread with the salt and pepper, using a blender or a pestle and mortar, then add the parsley and reserved tomato and the garlic and blend or pound further. Slowly add the olive oil a little at a time, blending or pounding well after each addition so that the sauce doesn’t split. Finally, stir in the vinegar.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head"><a id="pg_304"/><strong><em>Romesco</em></strong> sauce Brindisa</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is the sauce we serve in our restaurants and tapas bars, with grilled fish and/or <em>cal</em>ç<em>ots</em> in season. The difference here is that the garlic, almonds and bread are fried to give a deeper flavour, and the sauce has a smoother texture.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 250g</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 <strong><em>ñora</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_280">here</a>)</p>

<p class="ingredients">75g blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 thin slice of bread</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="method">About 2 hours ahead, split open the <em>ñora</em> peppers and put into a bowl, then pour a little boiling water from the kettle over them to rehydrate them (alternatively, if you are pushed for time, put the peppers into a pan of boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes to soften them). Once the skin has softened, scrape out the flesh with a knife and keep it to one side, discarding the skins.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the grill or the oven to as high as it will go (220°–250°C/gas 7–9) and grill or roast the tomatoes whole for about 15 minutes, until the skins are shrivelled and charred. Peel, if you like, and put into a blender or mortar.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a frying pan, put in the garlic and fry gently, without colouring, then lift out and keep to one side. Put the almonds into the pan and fry until golden, then lift out. Finally, put the bread into the pan and fry until well browned, then lift out. Make sure you don’t let any of the ingredients burn.</p>
<p class="method">Put the reserved pepper flesh, garlic and bread into the blender or mortar, and pulse/pound until well mixed. Next add the reserved almonds and pulse/pound briefly, then add the rest of the oil slowly, a little at a time, blending or pounding well between each addition. Finally, stir in the vinegar.</p>

<p class="flush_left">This is from Montserrat Fruitos (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_406">here</a>) and is unusual in that it contains no sun-dried <em>ñora</em> peppers, which most Catalans insist upon. Instead Montserrat uses only unsmoked <em>pimentón</em> (paprika). I like this with potato dishes, salt cod <em>brandade</em> and grilled white fish.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 200g</p>
<p class="ingredients">15 blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 hazelnuts</p>

<p class="method">Squeeze the vinegar from the bread and put into a blender or mortar. Peel the remaining clove of garlic and add to the blender or mortar along with the reserved peeled garlic and tomatoes and all the remaining ingredients, except the olive oil. Pulse-chop or pound a few times to mix the ingredients briefly, as you don’t want the sauce to be too smooth at this point. Now add the olive oil slowly as you blend or pound, until you have a thick, emulsified sauce that is quite smooth but still retains some texture.</p>

<p class="recipe-head"><a id="pg_305"/><strong><em>Romesco</em></strong> sauce Joan Puigcercós</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is the sauce favoured by Joan Puigcercós, our former politician friend in Santa Maria d’Oló in Catalunya (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_138">here</a>). It is really delicious, very nutty, quite thick and rough-textured, with all the flavours of peppers, tomatoes, garlic and mint coming through. It is good with <em>escalivada</em> and grilled meats.</p>

<p class="method">About 2 hours before you want to make your sauce, split open the <em>ñora</em> pepper and put it into a bowl, then pour a little boiling water from the kettle over it to rehydrate it (alternatively, if you are pushed for time, put the pepper into a pan of boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes to soften it). Once the skin has softened, scrape out the flesh with a knife and keep it to one side, discarding the skin.</p>
<p class="method">Either use tongs to char the skins of the tomatoes and one of the garlic cloves over the flame of a gas ring, or put them under a hot grill for 15–20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then remove the skins and discard the tomato seeds.</p>
<p class="method">Put the tomato flesh and garlic into a blender or a mortar. Add the reserved pepper flesh and the remaining raw garlic clove, peeled, and pulse-chop or pound together, then slowly add the oil a little at a time, blending or pounding well between each addition.</p>
