<h2 class="h2b">SALADE AUX AMANITES DES CESARS</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Caesar Mushroom Salad</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>As I’ve said, these are the finest of fine mushrooms, with a colour and taste that is unique. You could use ceps, or even girolles, instead. The first time I ate a salad like this was in Lugarno. I had never heard of Caesar mushrooms before then and I’ve since been hooked by their vibrant appearance and delicate flavour. That night, which sits deliciously clear in my memory, I ordered a second plate of</em> ovoli <em>(‘little eggs’ in Italian) and although the next course was juicy crustaceans cooked at an easy-scenting distance on a grill fired with vine embers, it had no chance that evening. Use a really fruity olive oil for this</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
200g (7oz) Caesar mushrooms, cleaned<br/>
1 small bunch fresh rocket, sliced<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) Parmesan, freshly shaved<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) fruity olive oil<br/>
Sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Slice the Caesar mushrooms as finely as possible with a very sharp knife. Lay them around your plates and scatter over the sliced rocket and Parmesan. Drizzle over the olive oil, and season with the salt flakes and just a little pepper.</p>
