introduction</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The key to Spanish home cooking is its honesty. It is simply a combination of the very best basic ingredients and a little fuss-free preparation.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that Spanish cuisine has evolved dramatically over the last few decades. The <em>Nueva Cocina</em>
 has hit international headlines and taken the restaurant world by storm. Traditional dishes are turned on their heads making dining out a roller coaster ride for the senses. <em>Paella</em>
 is transformed into a packet of shellfish infused Rice-Krispies while a squid ravioli might just explode in your mouth. But even Ferran Adrià, the master magician of this molecular gastronomy, insists that it is special occasion food. In fact, he goes further still, recommending that you eat at his restaurant just once in a lifetime for its spell to really work. The cutting edge <em>cocina</em>
 may have put Spain firmly on the Michelin map but it has done little to change the way most people eat on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="indent">The pace of modern life, and newly found affluence, has played much greater roles in moulding the home kitchen. Slow-cooked bean stews are increasingly replaced by a choice piece of meat or fish, ready in a matter of moments on the griddle. In the past such extravagance would have been unthinkable in much of Spain, particularly during the hungry years that followed the Civil War. But, ironically, today it is the hotpots of beans and chickpeas that come out on high days and holidays when cooks are prepared to spend their precious time slaving over a hot stove. Yet one thing has not changed, the profound appreciation for ingredients, where as much thought and importance is given to selecting the right type of rice as picking the best lobster.</p>
<p class="indent">Discerning home cooks and passionate gourmets still go to the market to pick up the freshest local produce on offer. Some city <em>mercados</em>
, or markets such as Barcelona’s Boquería or Valencia’s Mercat Central are awe-inspiring buildings packed with everything from butchers and fishmongers to entire stalls of snails or wild mushrooms. Meanwhile, a weekly harbour-side market in Galicia may amount to little more than a fresh produce stall, a van from the local bakery and a fisherman selling the catch of the day. The latter certainly lacks the variety but will provide a feast all the same. What could be more delicious than a fabulously fresh, grilled sardine served with the traditional corn and rye bread? It is all down to eating what is in its prime, following seasons and regional specialities.</p>
<p class="indent">And so I have headed to the markets of Spain to research this book, a fascinating and enlightening experience. There were certainly days when I began to question my own sanity. One occasion, six months pregnant, scaling steep cobbled streets in 40 degrees heat only to be greeted by a sea of laced knickers and tablecloths, is memorable for all the wrong reasons. In the villages of the Alpujarras, high in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the <em>mercado semanal</em>
, or weekly market, turned out to be little more than a local fruit and veg’ van doing its rounds. By the time I had turned up at the fourth market running I’m sure the vendor thought that he had acquired a stalker. Yet there are so many unexpected occasions when a town square comes to life with stalls of salt cod, pungent cheeses, cured sausages and picturesque mounds of fruit and vegetables. But the most captivating part of any provincial market is the small huddle of locals with their truly seasonal fare: a bucket of spindly wild asparagus, a biscuit tin of dried camomile, a misshapen cheese or a wheelbarrow of cherries.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page9"></a>
The produce on offer varies enormously across the regions. A Mediterranean customer will expect an entire stand of olives, recognizing favourite varieties at a glance while a legume-lover of Asturias will carefully peruse the vast selections of dried beans before finally making his choice. Markets live and breathe the country’s history too. The salted, wind-dried tuna or <em>mojama</em>
, of Cádiz and Alicante is a Phoenician legacy, while the wafts of coriander and mint as you enter Malaga’s bustling market through the ancient Moorish gate transport you back to the days of the Nasrid Sultans. Meanwhile, the pork, apples and cider of the North are not just results of a cooler climate but betray their Celtic heritage too.</p>
<p class="indent">Markets can be wonderful places to eat – late breakfast, early lunch or a snack on the hoof, there is always something on offer. A plate of warm octopus, straight from the pot, is a Galician speciality while the <em>churros</em>
 van does brisk trade in its doughnut fritters down south in Andalucia. Pinotxo’s bar in the Boquería market is a fabulous example of the Spanish passion for honest, good food. Brothers Albert and Jordi, cook a constant stream of down-to-earth dishes on the minuscule stove behind the counter, using the best ingredients that the market has to offer. You have to move fast if you want a look in. The regular clientele of chefs, shoppers and neighbouring vendors have their names on each dish while it is still in the pan; nothing could be fresher or tastier.</p>
<p class="indent">The market stallholders and customers alike are a great source of recipes and tips, their enthusiasm fuelled by an immeasurable pride in their own region and produce. And, while a particular fresh pepper or peach may be impossible to find in a different area, or country for that matter, there are plenty of key ingredients that are, thankfully, widely available. The ancient Iberians had to be ingenious in their methods of preserving food to last the long harsh winters of the inland plains or stand up to the stifling heat of an August day. This necessity gave us the cured meats, salted fish, cheeses and dried pulses that are exported all over the world today. Just a pinch of smoked Spanish paprika or slither of exquisite <em>jamón Serrano</em>
, or Serrano ham will immediately give your local vegetables the Iberian touch.</p>
<p class="indent">Ingredients are key to successful cooking, a seemingly obvious fact that is often bizarrely overlooked by many of us living in the fast lane of the western world. A tired piece of hake will never taste great, no matter how much attention you give it; you’d be better to open a can of quality tuna. So stock up your store-cupboard with a few Spanish essentials and head out to the market, be it in Bristol or Bilbao, in search of the finest produce you can get your hands on and you will be well on your way to re-creating the real taste of Spain.</p>

<h1 class="section" id="int-s01">marvellous mercados</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Spain has dozens of fabulous food markets but here is a very subjective selection of my favourites, the unmissables, just in case you happen to be in the neighbourhood. Some are weekly affairs that bring new life and bustle to quiet backwater towns while others are fixed, municipal markets.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">Fixed daily markets, open Monday–Saturday</h2>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mercado de la Boquería (Barcelona)</strong>
 – Without a doubt Spain’s largest and finest market. Quite apart from the incredible variety of stalls it is a fabulous place to eat breakfast or lunch. Bar Pinotxo or El Quim are my favourite spots.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mercado de Chamartín (Madrid)</strong>
 – A “boutique” market if there is such a thing. An exclusive selection of the nation’s finest food all under one small roof.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mercado Central de Málaga (Andalucia)</strong>
 – Enter through the ancient Moorish archway into an Aladdin’s cave of exotic fruit, fresh herbs and wonderful fish. And, visit the nearby Casa Aranda for some of the best <em>churros</em>
, or fritters, in Spain.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mercado de Abastos, Pontevedra (Galicia)</strong>
 – A seafood lover’s Utopia with an incomparable selection of fish and shellfish from the Atlantic and fertile <em>Rías</em>
, or estuaries.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mercado de Abastos, Santiago de Compostela (Galicia)</strong>
 – A stunning setting in the old town where as well as the permanent stalls there are always dozens of locals sitting outside selling their home-grown fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mercado Central de Valencia</strong>
 – A magical Art Deco building, streaming with natural light houses an incredible selection of stalls, particularly good for fruit, vegetables and seafood.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">Weekly markets</h2>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cáceres (Extremadura)</strong>
, Wednesdays – A small food section in the huge weekly market. It is worth a visit for a glorious selection of local sheep and goat’s milk cheeses, <em>chorizos</em>
 and mountains of seasonal cherries.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cangas de Ónis (Asturias)</strong>
, Sundays – A truly local affair with fabulous bread, cheese, cured meats and plenty of smallholders with their own fruit, vegetables, eggs and artisan cheeses.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Granollers (Catalonia)</strong>
, Thursdays – Arrive early to eat breakfast at the legendary Fonda de Europa. It will be packed with the all the local gents eating <em>Cap I Pota</em>
, stewed calf’s head and foot, but you may prefer something lighter. A great selection of live poultry, eggs, fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="Image00013.jpg" />
</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Gernika (Basque Country)</strong>
, Mondays – Plenty of fresh produce from local farmers, Sheep’s cheese, peppers and beans in particular. A flourishing organic presence too.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>León (Old Castille and León)</strong>
, Saturdays – The Plaza Mayor is transformed into a glorious food market. Large stalls of salt cod, cured meats, fruit and vegetables and plenty of locals with boxes of their own apples, walnuts or whatever the season has to offer.</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="page11"></a>
<strong>Plasencia (Extremadura)</strong>
, Tuesdays – The bustling farmers’ market has been held in the Plaza Mayor since the 12th century. Fabulous fruit and vegetables, cherry liqueur and cowbells. A huge congregation of cloth capped farmers chatting and doing business too.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tolosa (Basque Country)</strong>
, Saturdays – The recently restored market has a beautiful setting on the bank of the Oria river. Local beans, peppers, sheep’s cheese and wild mushrooms are the star players.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>La Feria de Padrón (Galicia)</strong>
, Sundays – Huge baskets of the celebrated <em>tapas</em>
 peppers, <em>pimientos de Padrón</em>
 and a great selection of <em>chorizos</em>
, Cow’s milk cheeses and rye bread. Head for the food tents to savour some freshly cooked octopus or barbecued beef, washed down with local wine.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="heading_id_5">Annual</h2>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Fira del Gall (the Poultry Fair), Vilafranca de Penedés (Catalonia)</strong>
, the last weekend before Christmas – A live poultry market where punters buy their festive bird direct from producers and then hand it over to be prepared for the pot. A service offered gratis by the organizers. A great variety of poultry and an incredible display of healthy Spanish realism.</p>
<h1 class="section" id="int-s02">the store-cupboard</h1>
<p class="nonindent">It is liberating to wander the market on the look out for the freshest piece of fish or the finest local vegetables, secure in the knowledge that all the other necessary ingredients for the feast await you back at home.</p>
<p class="indent">A well-stocked larder transforms both shopping and cooking into much simpler and more enjoyable tasks. You have more time, more scope for spontaneity, and throwing together pre-dinner nibbles or a last minute supper is never a problem.</p>
<p class="indent">This small selection of key, non-perishable ingredients will bring the true flavour of Spain to your table.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Alcohol</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">White and red wine should always be at your disposal. Extremely complex, expensive wines are wasted in the pot but a cheap bottle of paint stripper can ruin a dish too. The oxidized dregs from last month’s dinner party just won’t do.</p>
<p class="extract">Sherry gives a wonderful depth of flavour to many dishes and contrary to popular belief does not keep ad infinitum once opened; a perfect excuse to have a tipple yourself, while you do the cooking. <em>Vi Ranci</em>
 is an oxidized, sweet white wine used in the Catalan kitchen, but a sweet sherry can be substituted.</p>
<p class="extract">Brandy and <em>anis</em>
, or aniseed liqueur are used in both savoury and sweet dishes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Fish and shellfish</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Canned clams and mussels make excellent instant nibbles to enjoy with a glass of wine or sherry.</p>
<p class="extract">Salted anchovies are sometimes used in sauces or salads, but are most often enjoyed with a drink. The best are from Cantabria and Catalonia. I adore the <em>boquerones en vinagre</em>
, the vinegar pickled anchovies, available in vacuum packs.</p>
<p class="extract">Canned tuna, especially the premium <em>bonito del norte</em>
, albacore, is a wonderful salad standby.</p>
<p class="extract">Salt cod, or <em>bacalao</em>
, is sometimes tricky to come by outside Spain, so it is worth snapping up when you can get it (see page 44). Keep it somewhere cool, dry and preferably airtight unless you fancy the entire cupboard smelling of fish.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Fruit</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dried apricots, figs, prunes and sultanas are often used in delicious combinations with poultry, meat and game. They also make popular accompaniments to cheese. Look out for the plump raisins from Málaga – heaven soaked overnight in brandy or sweet sherry and served with ice cream.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Pulses</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">A selection of dried chickpeas, lentils and beans is vital for good hearty stews and soups (see pages 86–99), but do keep a fast turnover as all legumes eventually go stale. It is also an idea to keep some of the good-quality jars of ready cooked <em>judiones</em>
, or butter beans or chickpeas for quick last minute suppers.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Nuts</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nuts are best bought whole and raw, then roasted or ground when needed (see page 108).</p>
<p class="extract">Almonds are the most ubiquitous Spanish nuts, nibbled with drinks, and also a key ingredient in numerous sweet and savoury dishes. Look out for delicious Marcona almonds.</p>
<p class="extract">Hazelnuts, walnuts and pine kernels should be bought in small quantities and used quickly before they turn rancid and stale.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Olives and capers</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Olives make the perfect accompaniment to a drink and keep very well in brine or olive oil. Green olives, such as the <em>manzanilla</em>
 or <em>gordal</em>
 are the most popular table olives in Spain, often stuffed with anchovies or peppers. Tiny purple <em>arbequina</em>
 olives from Catalonia are fabulous too.</p>
<p class="extract">Capers are useful for salads and sauces. The larger caperberries are wonderful with cured meats or served with a selection of <em>tapas</em>
.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">The Spanish produce and use more olive oil than any other country in the world. The cold-pressed <em>Aceite de Virgen Extra</em>
 is usually reserved for salads, dipping bread into, or drizzling on cooked dishes where its complex flavours can be appreciated. There are dozens of top quality extra virgin olive oils on offer, many with their own <em>Denominación de Origen</em>
 (DO) [see page 16].</p>
<p class="extract">The flavour can vary enormously from green, grassy oils from the early harvest through to the fruitier, golden oils made with the riper olives. Climate, soil and the type of olive will all affect the end result too. It is all a question of personal taste, just as you may prefer one wine to another. My personal favourites, at the moment are from the Baena DO in Andalucia and the Siurana DO in Catalonia.</p>
<p class="extract">The milder, second pressing oil, referred to purely as <em>Aceite de Oliva</em>
, is used for cooking and frying. The oil should be kept somewhere cool and dark and used within 6 months of opening.</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page13"></a>
<img alt="" src="Image00014.jpg" />
</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page14"></a>
<img alt="" src="Image00015.jpg" />
</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="page15"></a>
<strong>Peppers</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Canned and bottled peppers are useful for salads and as tasty garnishes for cooked dishes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<em>Guindillas Vascas</em>
 are pickled green chilli peppers. They range from sharp and sweet varieties to the seriously fiery numbers that add a fabulous punch to a bowl of beans (see page 91).</p>
<p class="extract">
<em>Pimientos del Bierzo Asados</em>
 are a particularly good type of roasted and peeled capsicum peppers.</p>
<p class="extract">
<em>Pimientos de Piquillo</em>
 (see page 107) have a more piquant flavour. They may seem expensive but a small 220 g/8 oz can will yield about 16 peppers, roasted, peeled and ready for stuffing.</p>
<p class="extract">Dried <em>ñoras</em>
 peppers and <em>choricero</em>
 peppers look beautiful hanging in the kitchen and will keep well for a few months. They give an authentic flavour to many sauces and stews. Paprika makes a good substitute when they are not available.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cured pork</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<em>Salchichón</em>
, <em>longaniza</em>
 or the Catalan <em>fuet</em>
 are firm, cured pork sausages (see pages 48–9). They are deliciously chewy and a great treat to offer with drinks or to keep hunger at bay while preparing a meal. Remove the skin before slicing, as it has a horrible habit of getting caught between the back teeth.</p>
<p class="extract">
<em>Chorizo</em>
 (see page 49) is ideal for flavouring stews and bean dishes or cooking with a little wine or cider for a quick snack (see page 54). Vacuum packed soft semi-cured <em>chorizo</em>
 will keep for a few weeks in the refrigerator while the harder, fully cured variety will keep for up to a year in a cool, dry place.</p>
<p class="extract">
<em>Jamón</em>
 (see pages 48–9) is best sliced just before eating as it can dry out but can be purchased in vacuum packs. I like to have a couple of small packs of the chopped pieces, the size of French <em>lardons</em>
 (diced bacon), in store ready for cooked dishes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Rice</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">The Levante, or eastern regions of Spain consume huge quantities of rice. The vast proportion is short-grain rice used for <em>paellas</em>
 and soupier <em>arroz</em>
 dishes. La Bomba rice is the most reliable, and needless to say, expensive variety on offer. Long-grain rice is also used for some salads and supper dishes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Spices</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Paprika, ground dried pepper or <em>pimentón</em>
 is the most extensively used spice. It ranges from the sweet, <em>dulce</em>
, through sweet and sour, <em>agridulce</em>
 to the hot, <em>picante</em>
. <em>Pimentón</em>
 from the Murcia in the east is traditionally sun-dried while the paprika from Extremadura, <em>De La Vera</em>
 in particular, is smoked over oak. It is wise to have some of each in store.</p>
<p class="extract">Saffron, the world’s most costly spice, is best purchased in small quantities as whole strands (stigmas) rather than ground. It gives colour and earthy flavour to many stews, particularly rice dishes.</p>
<p class="extract">Cinnamon, cumin and aniseed are best bought as sticks or whole seeds, being ground as and when required.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>
<em>Tomate frito</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<em>Tomate frito</em>
 is a simple sauce of sieved fried tomatoes with olive oil sold by the can or jar. Some varieties can be rather too sweet but a good-quality version makes a quick option to throw in with beans or over rice.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wine vinegar is used in many sauces and <em>escabeches</em>
, or pickles. White wine vinegar sits on the table alongside olive oil, allowing individuals to dress their own salad.</p>
<p class="extract">
<em>Vinagre de Jerez</em>
, sherry vinegar, is aged in the sherry barrels giving it an unbelievable depth of warm, intense flavour. It is delicious added to <em>Gazpacho</em>
 (see page 150) and salads.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="Image00016.jpg" />
</p>
<h1 class="section" id="int-s03">a stamp of quality – the <em>Denominación de Origen</em>
</h1>
<p class="extract">The <em>Denomición de Origen</em>
 (DO) or literally designation of origin, is a regulatory system set up by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It works like the French <em>Appellation</em>
 system but in the Spanish case it stretches to dozens of products and not just to wine.</p>
<p class="extract">When you buy a cheese, an extra virgin olive oil, cured meat or wine from a DO you are guaranteed a certain quality. The ingredients and the entire production process, as well as the geographical origin of each product have been subject to strict regulations. And there are quite literally dozens of foodstuffs with their own DO to look out for, from cheese to chickpeas, from peppers to pork.</p>
<p class="indent">DO products are easily identified, wearing their badge with obvious pride. They are definitely worth tracking down, particularly when you are in unfamiliar territory. Saffron, for instance, is a justifiably expensive spice, requiring well over a hundred crocus flowers to produce just one gram of the precious dried stigmas. But how can you be confident that you are buying the good stuff with its characteristic toasty flavour or in fact, that you are buying saffron at all? Well that is where the assurance of a DO label is invaluable.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet there is nothing to say that a classified vinegar, honey or any product for that matter, should necessarily be superior to its unregulated neighbour. DO produce often comes with a high price tag to match its status and a local supplier may well be able to introduce you to a bargain alternative blessed with equal virtues.</p>
<h1 class="section" id="int-s04">what to drink?</h1>
<p class="extract">Spain has more land under vines than any other country in the world and so it will come as no surprise that wine and water accompany virtually every meal. Beer may be consumed in ever-increasing quantities in the <em>tapas</em>
 bar but when it comes to eating, nothing can begin to compare with the marriage of food and wine. Even children are allowed a splash of wine at the meal, often watered down with <em>gaseosa</em>
, or lemonade.</p>
<p class="indent">I shall make no attempt to give an all encompassing view on such a vast subject, there are after all over one hundred recognized wine regions to deal with. But, here are a few pointers when it comes to selecting a Spanish wine.</p>
<p class="extract">The DO system (see above) becomes a little more complicated where wine is concerned. A DO wine will be a mainstream, quality wine while a DOC is considered the next step up the ladder in both price and quality.</p>
<p class="indent">Spain has always been known for its red wines, those from Rioja in particular, but nowadays there is plenty of competition. Extremely fine reds with international reputations to match are now produced in Ribera del Duero, Navarra and Priorato. Huge investment and modern techniques are bringing more and more areas into the picture too. Valdepeñas and Jumilla may be the places to look for bargains today, but it is wise to seek the advice of a good wine merchant.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to white wine the crisp Albariños of the Galician Rias Baixas are fabulous with seafood. Even the regions of Rueda and Rioja that used to produce some pretty flabby, oaky styles have taken on a new lease of life producing more contemporary, deliciously fresh styles. The ever-popular <em>Cava</em>
 of Penedés, Spain’s answer to Champagne, deserves a mention too – an ideal glass of fizz for a celebration.</p>
<p class="indent">But my personal favourites are those wines so unique to Spain – the sherries. I am amazed by the number of wine lovers who have yet to succumb to the charms of sherry. And, if you think it is an aperitif reserved for the ‘twin-set and pearls’ brigade, then think again.</p>
<p class="indent">From the chilled dry <em>Finos</em>
 and <em>Manzanillas</em>
 that taste divine with olives, almonds and a myriad of <em>tapas</em>
 to the raisiny depths of a sweet <em>Pedro Jiménez</em>
, there is a sherry for every occasion. Nutty <em>Amontillados</em>
 match seafood beautifully while <em>Olorosos</em>
 make a fabulous match for cheese. Small, half bottles of sherry are an excellent idea, since contrary to popular belief sherry does go off, particularly the dry unoxidized styles of <em>Fino</em>
 and <em>Manzanilla</em>
. I would also not recommend consuming sherry in too large a quantity. Many years ago I spent a night on the tiles in San Lúcar de Barrameda drinking the local <em>Manzanilla</em>
. I had been swept up in the revelry and excitement that precedes the annual <em>Romería del Rocío</em>
, a spectacular pilgrimage in the Virgin de Rocío’s honour, and hell, did I pay for it the next day!</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page17"></a>
<img alt="" src="Image00017.jpg" />
</p>
<h1 class="section" id="int-s05">useful utensils</h1>
<p class="extract">The traditional Spanish kitchen is devoid of much specialist gadgetry but there are a few bits and pieces that could certainly help you to cook like a local.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>
<em>Cazuelas</em>
</strong>
 are fabulously useful, terracotta cooking pots with straight, low sides. They come in all sizes: from huge vessels big enough to feed the entire family down to individual <em>tapas</em>
 dishes. The tiny 4 cm/1½ inch diameter versions are perfect for <em>Crema Catalana</em>
 (see page 119). This all-purpose earthenware can be used for gentle frying over a gas flame, for roasting in a hot oven and even looks attractive enough to serve at the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Always ‘cure’ a <em>cazuela</em>
 before using it for the first time. Soak it in water for a few hours and then place it in the oven filled with water for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>A heat diffuser</strong>
, to set over your stove, can be very useful as many dishes are simmered slowly on the top of the hob. You can, of course, place them in a low oven instead, if you prefer.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>The mortar and pestle</strong>
 are essential in the traditional kitchen. Most are ceramic bowls with a wooden pestle, but stone versions also work well. The mortar must be large enough not just for crushing spices but for mixing sauces and seasonings too, at least 15 cm/6 inches in diameter. Modern cooks often use a blender instead but purists will tell you that the texture and flavour is never the same.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>A small, deep omelette pan</strong>
 is key to the perfect <em>tortilla</em>
. A 20 cm/8 inch, non-stick pan with deep sides will make a juicy five-egg omelette.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>A <em>paella</em>
 pan</strong>
, or very large frying pan is a must for successful <em>paellas</em>
 (see pages 97–8). A 40 cm/16 inch base will feed 6–8 people. Pans are usually made from light steel and should be oiled slightly before storing or they will rust, rather like a wok.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>The <em>pasapurés</em>
</strong>
 is a rotary sieve that performs the same job as a food processor while simultaneously straining out bones, skins and pips. It is fabulous for preparing soups, purées, jams and jellies. It is often known by its French name, the <em>mouli-legumes</em>
.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Small metal moulds</strong>
 are ideal for preparing individual puddings such as <em>Flan</em>
, <em>Crème Caramel</em>
, or serving moulded portions of rice – 200 ml/7 fl oz is the ideal size.</p>
