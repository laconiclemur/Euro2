<p class="author1"><span class="txit">riso alla salvia</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Most Americans use Arborio rice only when preparing risotto. However, it is also very delicious if you cook it as you would conventional rice and blend it with herbs and butter. It makes a tasty side dish in place of potatoes or beans. For a simple and delicious dinner, cook rice according to this recipe and add a drained 3.5-ounce can of Italian tuna and 2 teaspoons rinsed capers. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and serve.</p>
