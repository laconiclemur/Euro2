  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_109" class="calibre1"></a>I love the smell of roasted meat slowly cooking in the oven – just by the smell I know it’s a Sunday morning. Since living in England, I have become accustomed to enjoying a ‘roast dinner’ and look forward to the weekly ritual, whether it’s traditional roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, pork with apple sauce or a stuffed roast chicken, all served with lovely roast potatoes and vegetables.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Italians enjoy roasts too, but as they tend to be served after a <em class="calibre4">primo</em> (first course) of perhaps pasta or risotto, there is less need for so many accompaniments and the meat is often simply served with a salad. Classic Italian roasts of beef, veal, pork and lamb tend to be laden with herbs, which really enhance the flavour of the meat; my <em class="calibre4"><a href="part0012_split_002.html#ch6sec1" class="calibre1">Arrosto di manzo alle erbe</a></em> is a good example.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Oven roasting is a very similar process to spit roasting – cooking meat over an open fire – which has been done since ancient times. Spit roasting ensured that no part of the meat dried out as it turned on the spit and fat and juices ran over the surface of the meat. Spit roasting whole lambs, goats and pigs remains popular in Sardinia. <em class="calibre4">Porceddu</em> (suckling pig) infused with local myrtle leaves is cooked in this way in rural areas of the island and for celebrations like weddings. Another ancient method still used in inland parts of Sardinia is <em class="calibre4">incarralzadu</em>, in which the animal is cooked underground in a large hole and a fire made above. Sardinians have always been very traditional in their ways, probably because of their island location, and this way of cooking is still very much alive and celebrated today.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Oven roasting, where the heat takes a long time to reach the centre of the food, is mostly used to cook tender joints of meat. Pot-roasting allows you to use tougher, more economical, cuts of meat and is very popular in Italy; in this method, a large piece of meat is first browned, then cooked slowly with liquid. Both methods are very simple: once in the pot or roasting tin, you can more or less leave the meat to its own devices – just remember to baste the oven joint and ensure there is enough liquid for the pot roast.</p>
