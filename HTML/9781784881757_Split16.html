<p class="tx2"><b>Any time we use shellfish such as crabs, prawns (shrimp), crayfish, langoustines and lobsters we buy them with their heads and shells so that we can keep them for making a stock. This broth adds a wonderful flavour to any seafood dish and no shop-bought stock compares to it. We use it for the farro soup on <a href="9781784881757_Split82.html#page_138">farro soup with prawns</a>, but you can also use it in seafood pasta dishes or in a fish sauce.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 2 LITRES (3½ PINTS/8½ CUPS)</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1.5 kg (3 lb 5 oz) raw seafood shells and heads</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 medium carrot, halved lengthways, or large handful of carrot peelings</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 white onion, roughly chopped, or large handful of onion peelings</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 litres (5¼ pints/12¾ cups) hot water</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil in a large stock pot over a medium heat. Add the seafood shells and heads with the carrot and onion. When the shells start to brown and stick to the bottom of the pan add the wine, increase the heat and let it reduce for 4–5 minutes. Bash the shells, particularly any prawn or lobster heads, with a wooden rolling pin to release the juices and break up the shells. Pour in the hot water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1–1½ hours. We don’t skim this broth as you lose the flavour and the lovely orange colour by doing this. Remove from the heat. Strain the stock into a large jug or bowl, squeezing the juices from the shells by pressing down on them with a ladle. Discard the shells. Use the stock straight away or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can also simmer the stock for a further 30 minutes–1 hour to reduce it and then freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
