<h2 class="h2b">SOUPE DE GAMBAS AUX CONFIT DE TOMATES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Tiger Prawn Soup with Confit Tomatoes</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>One of the wonderful by-products of buying bread daily are recipes like this, developed over time to use up the leftovers. This is a type of gazpacho enriched with the</em> gamba <em>stock. Sweet, plump</em> gambas, <em>or tiger prawns, are the simplest of crustaceans to use: they peel like a dream, the shells break up easily and produce the most fragrant of all bisques. I serve this soup cold but if you prefer it hot you could just leave out the cucumber and the bread. You can make it a day or so before you serve it</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 raw tiger prawns in their shells<br/>
3 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
2 tsp tomato concentrate<br/>
1 large red pepper, seeded and roughly chopped<br/>
¼ English cucumber, roughly chopped<br/>
2 large, very ripe Roma tomatoes<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
50g (1¾oz) bread, soaked in 100ml (3½fl oz) olive oil<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) water<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
Pinch of caster sugar (optional)</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO SERVE</span><br/>
250g (9oz) <em>Confit de Tomates</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006b.html#page166">see here</a></em>), using cherry tomatoes<br/>
4 tbsp <em>Pistou</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006f.html#page170">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Twist off the heads of the tiger prawns, then remove the shells starting from the underside of the prawns, leaving just the last piece of shell with the tail on. Keep all the heads and shells for the sauce. Next, slit the prawns down their backs, not cutting through them completely, and remove the intestine. Set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Sauté the tiger prawn shells for a minute or so in half the oil until the shells begin to change colour, then add the tomato concentrate. Sauté for a further minute until the tomato concentrate starts to darken, then cover the prawns with water. Bring to the boil and skim, then cook over a fairly high heat for 10 minutes. Purée the shells with the liquid in a blender and strain through a fine sieve. Set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Purée the red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, garlic, the olive-oil-soaked bread and the water in a blender together with the stock made from the tiger prawn shells. Season well with salt and cayenne. The soup is great if there is a little bite to it. Add a pinch of sugar if necessary.</p>
<p class="normala">Fry the tiger prawns in the remaining oil for 3–4 minutes until they are bright pink and no longer transparent. Serve the soup in deep plates, topped with the prawns and the <em>confit</em> tomatoes. Drizzle over the <em>pistou</em> and serve.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON THE PRAWN SHELLS</span></p>
<p class="normala">If you are using tiger prawns for anything without the shells, keep the latter, freeze them and bring them out when you have enough to make either this recipe or a bisque on its own.</p>
