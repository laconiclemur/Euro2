<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">E</span>ver since childhood I’ve loved soup, and I still find myself making it—even on the hottest of summer days. My grandmother Nonna Tropiano made a fresh batch once or twice a week year-round when my mom was growing up. Chicken soup was her favorite. She used every part of the chicken—even scraping and scrubbing the feet before adding them to the pot. While not as resourceful as she in the kitchen, when I was struggling as an actor in New York after college, I found that making a large pot of chicken soup or buying a bowl of split pea soup from a deli provided a nutritious, filling, and inexpensive meal. It was a comfort to know that a little soup could go a long way. Whether you’re on a tight budget or a tight schedule, our family soup recipes are varied, delicious, cheap, and easy to make.</p>
