<p class="normal"><b>Red chard is a salad leaf that’s not used so much in the home kitchen, but is popular with chefs. It’s almost like spinach, but less buttery and cooks very quickly so you want to add the leaves at the very last minute, just before the eggs. Also, to intensify the flavor of the dish, I have added pickled shallots, which bring a touch of acidity and crunch. But the main feature is the Vacherin Mont d’Or, which is a soft, rich, creamy cow’s milk cheese from the Jura region, in Franche-Comté. It is made by traditional methods and is only available during the September to April season. My region, I love it and what memories it brings…</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 20 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 teaspoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 ounces Jerusalem artichokes, peeled, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large red onion, sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">3¼ ounces red chard leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 ounces soft, creamy cheese, such as Vacherin Mont d’Or</p>
<p class="acktxt">olive oil, for dressing</p>
<p class="acktxta">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PICKLED SHALLOTS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons Chardonnay vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 teaspoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large banana shallot, thinly sliced into rings</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the pickled shallots, put the vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and bring to a boil. Put the shallots in a heatproof bowl and when the liquid is boiling, pour it over the shallots. Leave them to cool about 10 minutes, which is long enough to pickle the shallots perfectly.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, heat the oven to 315°F. Melt the butter in a large, nonstick, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. When it is foaming, add the Jerusalem artichokes and onion and cook 4 to 5 minutes until they are just soft and slightly caramelized. Add half of the red chard leaves and toss twice to mix.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Season the eggs with salt and pepper, then pour them over the vegetables in the pan. Turn the heat up to high and spoon the cheese in small dollops all over the top. When the edges of the omelet start to bubble and thicken slightly, run the edge of a rubber spatula quickly around the pan to loosen, then put the pan in the oven 4 to 5 minutes until the omelet is just cooked. Check the omelet is cooked by gently pressing the top to see if it springs back lightly. If it doesn’t, return the omelet to the oven 2 minutes longer and check again.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Dress the remaining red chard with a little olive oil and a touch of salt and pepper. Drain the shallots. Serve the omelette topped with the shallots and finished with the dressed red chard on top.</p>
