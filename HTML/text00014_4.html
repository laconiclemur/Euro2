he bakery is always busy. Many Spaniards buy their daily <em>barra de pan</em>
 and the tooting horn of the bread van is still a familiar sound in small villages that lack their own <em>panadería</em>
. Bread accompanies every meal, soaking up juices and satisfying appetites, and often taking the place of the potatoes or rice that we might choose to serve. Thankfully the factory-produced sliced loaf, usually referred to as <em>pan bimbo</em>
, has few followers, and is most likely to be found on the breakfast buffet at dubious hotels or in a plastic, petrol station, sandwich known as a <em>bikini</em>
. Meanwhile, <em>pan de molde</em>
, refers to the square-shaped loaf and, if picked up in the bakery, may be quite acceptable for cooking or sandwiches, but it is certainly not served at a meal. The Spanish loaf has a free, curvaceous form, which varies across the regions.</p>
<p class="indent">Most bread is white. In fact the quest for a Granary or wholemeal loaf will often lead you to a health food shop where all the poor souls with dodgy digestive systems are sent. The white bread contains little salt and stales quickly, but is often made into breadcrumbs or used to thicken soups and sauces. It is certainly worth looking out for the stalls of uneven crusty loaves that are baked in wood-fired ovens and sometimes sold in the country markets. In Catalonia the typical <em>pa de pagès</em>
 is a fabulously chewy loaf, with a dark crust, that keeps very well. It is heaven eaten, as <em>pa amb tomàquet</em>
, with tomato flesh and olive oil, the local answer to bread and butter.</p>
<p class="indent">Galician bread is another story. Rye and corn replace or accompany the wheat in many traditional loaves. Once a sign of hardship, these tasty sourdough breads are now appreciated for their depth of flavour and wonderful texture. Castille is often known as the Spanish breadbasket, with its vast swathes of wheat but the average, bland white bread can’t begin to compare with the honest, hearty loaf of Galicia. Even the artisan wheat bread has its magic. The outdoor market in Ourense is a collection of bizarre little kiosks resembling beach huts or garden sheds. The local produce is fabulous but my lasting memory is the selection of incredible bread. A local speciality of rye bread studded with juicy sultanas made the most delicious picnic with some fresh Galician cow’s milk cheese.</p>
<p class="indent">Snacks can be picked up at the baker’s in some regions. The <em>Empanada</em>
, a Galician flat pie, is fast food at its best. It is available by the slice and stuffed with anything from cockles to spiced pork. Meanwhile, in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands they have the <em>Coca</em>
, rather like a pizza but eaten cold. <em>Coques</em>
 can be sweet or savoury, or, as in the case of the sugar and pork crackling variety, a combination of the two. <em>Bollos preñados</em>
, or pregnant buns, are an Asturian invention, a loaf of bread baked with <em>chorizo</em>
 and bacon inside: an instant sandwich.</p>
<p class="indent">Sweet biscuits, cakes and breakfast pastries are usually purchased rather than baked in the home. Some are sold in the bakery, others in a specialist <em>pastelería</em>
 where assistants require a degree in origami paper folding to achieve the feats of packaging expected. At weekends ladies bear immaculate parcels of goodies home to the family, a Basque custard tart or a <em>Brazo de Gitano</em>
, a ‘gypsy’s arm’ sponge stuffed with caramel cream. Northerners bake with butter, while the rest of the country use pork fat and olive oil. Little, crumbly biscuits are a speciality of central Spain and the South. The <em>panadería</em>
 in Seville’s Triana market is a treasure-trove of these <em>polvorones</em>
 and <em>roscas</em>
, each individually wrapped in old-fashioned greaseproof paper stamped with a sacred virgin or a company crest.</p>

empanadas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">galician flat pies</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The fortunate locals of Santiago de Compostela can pick up a slice of ready-made <em>empanada</em>
 from any number of the bakeries around the city. There is a myriad of flavours on offer too, such as scallop, octopus, lamprey, tuna, salt cod or pork. Some have a cornmeal or a pastry crust, but the most popular are encased in a deliciously thin bread dough.</p>
<p class="indent">Making an <em>empanada</em>
 is quite a time-consuming business but your labours will be rewarded with a remarkably resilient transportable feast.</p>

<strong>20 g/¾ oz fresh yeast or 1 tsp dried easy-blend yeast</strong>
</p>

<strong>3 tbsp hand-hot water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>350 g/12 oz strong white flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>125 g/4½ oz cornmeal, <strong>
<em>masa harina</em>
</strong>
 or finely ground <strong>
<em>polenta</em>
</strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tbsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 ml/2 fl oz white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½ fl oz olive oil, plus extra for oiling</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 g/2 oz lard, chopped into 1 cm/½ inch dice, you could use vegetable fat instead</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 egg, lightly beaten</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 egg lightly beaten, to seal and glaze</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the yeast and water to a paste in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the flour, cornmeal, salt, wine, olive oil, lard, beaten egg and yeast paste in a large bowl and stir the mixture to combine, then pull it together with your hands. It should feel soft and quite sticky, if there is any dry flour left in the bowl add a splash more water. You will have a job to roll the dough out thinly later if it is too dry.</p>
<p class="extract">Knead the dough for a couple of minutes until well combined and smooth. Place it back in the bowl and cover with a baking tray or clingfilm and leave to rise for at least 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, make your filling (see recipes opposite).</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="extract">On a lightly floured surface, roll out half the dough to a 5 mm/¼ inch thickness to fit a large baking sheet. Oil the baking sheet and lay the dough on top. Now pile on the filling, spreading it evenly and leaving a 2cm/¾ inch margin around the edge. Brush the edge with a little beaten egg.</p>
<p class="extract">Roll the remaining dough to the same size and lay it over the filling. Crimp the edges together, twisting over the dough to form a rope-like edge. Brush the entire <em>empanada</em>
 with beaten egg and, using a fork, pierce the top with lots of holes.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then bake in the hot oven for 20–30 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.</p>

 and then add the pork to the pan in 2 batches, allowing it to brown a little. Set the pork aside with the <em>chorizo</em>
.</p>
<p class="extract">Next cook the onions in the same oil until really soft, at least 20 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the peppers and continue cooking until these soften too. Add the garlic and paprika and then, once you can really smell the garlic, add the oregano and tomato purée.</p>
<p class="extract">Stir in the pork and <em>chorizo</em>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_9">vegetable coca</h1>
<p class="indent">Staggering around a market laden with heavy baskets of goodies can be a hungry business and a perfect excuse for a nibble on the move. <em>Coca</em>
 is the Spanish answer to <em>pizza</em>
 – a thin dough topped with delicious vegetables or even a sugary crust, but unlike its Italian cousin very rarely containing cheese. It is sold by the slice from bakeries and market stands all over Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands. Although it would make a delicious lunch or picnic dish, I have yet to get a piece home. There is something delightfully decadent about scoffing it on the street, straight from the greaseproof paper.</p>

pan de centeno gallego</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_11">galician rye bread</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Galicia is home to many fabulous traditional breads. Ironically, these gloriously chewy, dense loaves were born out of poverty. When wheat was too expensive an option the locally grown rye and corn were used instead. Nowadays a few small bakeries in the west still produce the moist <em>pan de maíz y centeno</em>
, a hefty dough traditionally eaten with sardines. Meanwhile, a mixture of rye and wheat flour produces the characteristic <em>pan de país</em>
, or country bread found all over the region.</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to begin this bread at least 24 hours in advance.</p>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>10 g/⅓ oz fresh yeast</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>350–400 ml/12–15 fl oz hand-hot water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 g/9 oz rye flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 g/9 oz strong white bread flour, plus extra sifted, for sprinkling</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>olive oil, for oiling</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the yeast to a paste with 2 tbsp water in a bowl and then stir in the flour and remaining water. Place in a large bowl with plenty of room for expansion. Cover with a damp cloth and leave at room temperature for at least 24 hours or better still for 2 days. It should smell slightly sour. If you are not ready to use the starter yet, keep it in a jar in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="extract">For the dough, mix the yeast and a couple of spoonfuls of the water to a creamy paste.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the rye flour and strong flour in a large mixing bowl, make a well in the centre and add the salt, creamed yeast and starter dough. Next add enough of the hand-hot water to make a soft but not too sticky dough. Tip the dough onto a large flat surface and knead for about 10 minutes. It will become smooth but do not expect too much elasticity since rye does not contain the same stretchy gluten as wheat.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the dough back in the bowl, cover and leave to rise at room temperature for at least 1 hour, maybe 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Oil a large baking sheet.</p>
<p class="extract">Knock back the dough and shape it into a large, flat round. Place the dough on the prepared baking sheet, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise again until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="extract">Sprinkle the dough with sifted flour. Bake for 1 hour, or until the bread just slips off the baking sheet and sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">You may like to vary the proportion of rye to wheat flour. More rye and the bread will be denser and heavier, more wheat and it will produce an altogether lighter crumb.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Sultanas can be added to the dough after it has been knocked back. I find it easiest to incorporate the fruit by flattening the dough as if making a pizza, sprinkling with sultanas and then rolling up tightly. At this point you can shape the dough as above.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">almond biscuits</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Bakeries all over Catalonia sell bags of these tasty little biscuits. Beware, they are hard enough to chip a tooth on, but soft and heavenly once dipped in a <em>café solo</em>
, or espresso, or a sweet sherry, which they soak up like a sponge. <em>Carquinyolis</em>
 are closely related to Italian <em>cantuccini</em>
, although to doubt their local origin would be heresy in these parts.</p>
<p class="indent">These biscuits are traditionally made with almonds, the national nut, but you could try them with hazelnuts instead, in which case I would replace the lemon zest with orange.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_15">breakfast sponge cakes</h1>
<p class="nonindent">These little cakes are a Spanish institution and the perfect accompaniment to a hot chocolate or coffee. <em>Churros</em>
, or dough fritters, may have hit the international stage as the most popular breakfast snack but they are rarely eaten at home. They are best bought from the market van or café, hot and crisp, straight from the sizzling cauldrons of oil. Meanwhile, <em>magdalenas</em>
 grace the domestic table all over the country.</p>
<p class="indent">There are regional variations: the butter-rich <em>sobao pasiego</em>
 from the dairy lands of the North, the interior’s pork fat <em>mantecado</em>
 and the denser-textured olive oil <em>magdalena</em>

<strong>Tips when baking</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Whenever you are baking cakes or soufflés use the bottom heat option on your oven, if you have the choice. As the heat rises it will help the mixture rise too.</p>
<p class="indent2">Try not to open the oven door to peep at your cakes for at least half of their cooking time or the sudden drop in temperature could cause the cakes to sink.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Quite how this popular sponge roulade earned its rather bizarre name is a mystery but it is sold in <em>pastelerías</em>
 all over the country, invariably filled with a deliciously creamy custard. I came across a similar recipe from León with the elevated title of Tronco del Vaticano, or Vatican Log, this time covered with delicious chocolate and filled with strawberries. Another version, from Tenerife in The Canary Islands, was filled with <em>dulce de leche</em>
, a thick caramelized milk from South America, and slices of local banana. So, although you may feel a little intimidated by all the whisking, folding and rolling, once mastered this is an extremely versatile recipe.</p>

Now you can make the filling. Heat the milk, cinnamon and lemon zest gently in a small saucepan and leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, beat the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl, then add the cornflour, stirring to remove any lumps. Strain the milk, a little at a time onto the egg mixture, stirring as you go.</p>
<p class="extract">Rinse out the pan and pour in the egg and milk mixture. Stir over a medium heat for about 5–10 minutes until the custard bubbles and thickens. Add the vanilla extract, or a little rum, brandy or sherry, if you prefer and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="extract">Unroll the sponge carefully, just enough to fill it and spread over the <em>crema pastelera</em>
. Roll the cake up again, using the paper to help you, and dust with icing sugar.</p>

<strong>For the Chocolate and Strawberry Vatican Log</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Slice about 250 g/9 oz of strawberries (raspberries are delicious too), and lay them on top of the custard filling before rolling up the sponge.</p>
<p class="extract">Carefully melt 300 g/10 oz of good quality plain dark chocolate with 50 g/2 oz unsalted butter. The most foolproof way is in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, but you may just dare to use your microwave, on its lowest setting for about a minute.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the mixture to cool and thicken for a minute or two before pouring over the roulade.</p>
<p class="extract">And, for those with a very sweet tooth…</p>

<strong>The Tenerife Banana Roulade</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Make a half quantity of <em>crema pastelera</em>
 and mix this with 5 tbsp <em>dulce de leche</em>
, a thick caramelized milk from South America now available in Spain and elsewhere too. Slice 5 tiny Canary Island bananas, or 3 ripe bananas and place in a bowl. Squeeze over the juice of 1 lemon.</p>
<p class="extract">Spread the <em>crema</em>
 mixture over the sponge, top with the bananas and roll up as before.</p>
