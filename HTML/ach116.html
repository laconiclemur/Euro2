<p class="noindentb">This recipe is a great example of learning to trust your instincts and not being afraid to try things. The first version we tested didn’t come out well at all. We tried again, all working together, and finally arrived at this version. Serve this dish as a side dish with simply prepared fish, meat, or chicken.</p>
