<p class="author1"><span class="txit">agnello con carciofini</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">The use of lean meat from the leg of lamb gives this stew a light and subtle flavor. It may be prepared two days in advance up to the point where the lemon juice and eggs are added. Simply reheat and then complete the recipe. Spoon this stew over a wide pasta noodle such as pappardelle. It may also be served preceded by <a class="nounder" href="ach100.html#page_196">Asparagus Risotto</a> and accompanied with <a class="nounder" href="ach111.html#page_218">Escarole</a>.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Remove the tough outer leaves of the artichokes. Trim <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch off the tops of the artichokes and discard. Cut the artichokes in half. Remove any of the fine choke from the center and discard.
