 MALT TIFFIN</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0001380">
<em>My sister once made tiffin years ago, when we were all just starting out in high school. I remember it was absolutely delicious, and I was so impressed by how few ingredients it involved. Since then, I have enjoyed experimenting with the recipe and adapting it to create new flavour combinations. The recipe never strays from its simplicity but I always find an excuse to incorporate my favourite chocolate treats. This particular tiffin recipe has the distinct flavour of my favourite malt drink, and – even better – it has my favourite chocolate malt balls running through it too!</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Line a 23 x 12cm loaf tin with baking paper. If you just line the base and the two longer sides with a strip of paper, this will make it easier to pop the tiffin out when it has set.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001389">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the dark chocolate, butter and malt extract into a heatproof bowl, and place over a pan of water simmering on a low heat till the chocolate and butter have melted. Set aside to cool for a while.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001390">

</span>
 I like to crush the biscuits in a food processor, to get fine crumbs. But you can put them into a ziplock bag and use the end of a rolling pin to crush them down if you prefer.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001391">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Once the chocolate has cooled, add the crushed biscuits and mix until there are no more dry bits of biscuit left.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001392">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Add the chocolate malt balls whole and give them a thorough mix through. Drop the mixture into the tin and press down firmly to make sure it is well packed. Flatten on top and leave to set in the fridge for at least 2 hours.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001393">

<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Take out of the tin before serving. Remove the paper and dust with the malt powder. Cut into slices and serve.</p>
