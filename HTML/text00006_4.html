he shellfish stall, or <em>parada de mariscos</em>
, is invariably the most arresting sight in the Spanish market. The sheer volume and variety of crustaceans and molluscs on offer is mind-boggling. It is also, without a doubt, where the most cash changes hands too. The Spanish have an insatiable appetite for seafood and are prepared to pay exorbitant prices to satisfy their craving. Prices soar before every festival and bank holiday, and there are plenty of those, while the Christmas season often sees prices double. So, despite the fact that Spain lands vast quantities of shellfish on her lengthy shorelines, do not expect a bargain. In fact, demand often far outstrips supply. It is not uncommon to see crates of tiny blue swimmer crabs from Scottish waters or mounds of Irish <em>cigalas</em>
, or Dublin Bay Prawns, beside the local catch. Yet, of one thing you can be certain: the best variety and quality of shellfish you will find anywhere in Europe; the locals are discerning customers.</p>
<p class="indent">A trip to the shellfish stalls in Barcelona’s Boquería market is an unforgettable experience. Assistants with immaculate hair styles and scarlet lips nudge the live crustaceans as you pass, causing a shock wave of clattering claws across the piles of crushed ice. There are delicacies from every corner of Spain: spiny lobsters, spider crabs, deep red <em>carabinero</em>
 prawns and translucent grey shrimp, bundles of razor clams and nets of mussels. You name it, it’s here. So where does one begin? Well, it would seem that the locals are as indecisive as the rest of us and many of the traditional dishes include half a dozen different species in the same pot, or <em>paella</em>
.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>lonjas</em>
, or wholesale markets, on the coast are well worth a visit. The quayside at Pálamos on the Costa Brava comes to life in the late afternoon. Crate upon crate of the legendary local prawns are hauled into the saleroom, auctioned and then whisked away by the awaiting fleet of refrigerated vans, all in a matter of minutes. Thankfully there are a handful of small traders who sell to the public too. A few stunningly fresh <em>gambas a la plancha</em>
, or griddled prawns, are my idea of heaven, you can keep your lobster any day. In fact, nothing can beat tucking into the local speciality in situ: freshly shucked oysters on Vigo’s Ria de la Pescadería or sweet pilgrim scallops on the dockside in Finisterre. Galicia certainly does top the menu when it comes to shellfish. The shallow Western <em>rias</em>
, or estuaries, make fertile beds for oysters, scallops, clams and mussels. And the local market at Pontevedra is a mind-blowing spectacle with over 200 stands of gloriously fresh seafood.</p>
<p class="indent">The Spanish are adventurous consumers too. Cauldron’s of octopus bubble away at Galician country markets providing shoppers with a quick snack, a far cry from the ubiquitous hot dog. Raw sea urchin coral is an Asturian treat while the Basques love to prise periwinkles from their shells with a pin. Tiny bundles of sea slug fillets, known rather perplexingly as <em>espardenyes</em>
, or <em>espadrilles</em>
, are a delicacy in Catalonia. But the <em>percebe</em>
, or goose-necked barnacle, tops the bill. This tubular creature clings to the roughest stretches of the northern coastline, and the collectors famously risk life and limb to snatch their rare prize from amidst dashing Atlantic breakers. The orange flesh that is sucked from the centre of the barely cooked barnacle is a pure taste of the sea, exquisite in its subtlety. And so it is, that a bizarre crustacean resembling a reptilian toe can fetch up to 180 Euros a kilo.</p>

gambas pil pil</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">sizzling garlic prawns</h1>
<p class="nonindent">A tapas bar classic all over Southern Spain: the prawns are a solo act so they must be the freshest you can buy. This is a last minute dish that should sizzle its way to the table. It is best cooked in a small, ovenproof terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
, which is also ideal for serving. Take great care not to burn the garlic or the entire dish will be bitter. Some crusty white bread dipped in the garlickly oil is sublime.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2–3 small dried chillies, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz fresh prawns, peeled with tails left intact</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>pinch of salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>pinch of sweet paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a small, ovenproof terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
, or frying pan over a high heat. Add the garlic and chillies and cook for a matter of seconds until you can smell the heady wafts of garlic.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the prawns and cook until just pink and firm. Sprinkle with salt and paprika and serve quickly so that the prawns are still sizzling in the cooking juices.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 You may like to add a tablespoon of dry sherry together with the prawns and garnish the dish with chopped parsley.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Know your shrimps and prawns</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">
<em>Camarones</em>
 are tiny shrimps, which turn white when cooked and are eaten shell and all. In Cádiz they are cooked in delicious fritters, <em>tortillitas</em>
.</p>
<p class="indent2">
<em>Quisquillas</em>
 are small brown shrimp, which are often added to the popular scrambled egg dish, <em>revuelto</em>
.</p>
<p class="indent2">
<em>Gambas</em>
 are transparent prawns that turn a stunning pink when cooked. They are fabulous cooked <em>a la plancha</em>
, or on the griddle, or <em>pil pil</em>
 style.</p>
<p class="indent2">
<em>Carabineros</em>
 are large tasty prawns with dramatic red shells even when raw.</p>
<p class="indent2">
<em>Langostinos</em>
 are the huge, over 20 cm/8 inch, striped prawns often known as tiger prawns.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Making prawn stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Never throw away raw prawn shells or heads, they make wonderful stock, which is a great base for any seafood dish. Place them in a large pan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat slightly and simmer gently for 20 minutes. Strain the stock into a bowl. I like to squeeze absolutely all the juices from the heads and shells in the sieve using the bottom of a ladle. This gives a cloudy but wonderful stock. You could add onion, carrot, parsley stalks, peppercorns or slices of lemon to the pan for extra flavour.</p>

almejas a la marinera</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_5">clams a la marinera</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The ground floor of Pontevedra’s market is almost entirely devoted to seafood, with the half dozen butchers’ stalls destined to play second fiddle on the sidelines. This is Spain’s shellfish capital with a spectacular selection of crab, lobster, scallops and, of course, the mussels and clams that are farmed in the shallow, warm waters of the <em>rias</em>
, or estuaries, that punctuate Galicia’s west coast.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the wide variety of clams on offer is the highly prized <em>almeja fina</em>
, or carpet shell clam. It also goes by the name of <em>almeja de Carril</em>
 and when you visit the nearby harbour of Carril it is easy to see why. The waters are a forest of stakes, each post marking the boundary of an individual clam bed, a highly productive business passed down among the locals from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 garlic cloves, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 small onion, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 small dried chilli, left whole</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1.5 kg/3¼ lb fresh clams, ideally <strong>
<em>almejas finas</em>
</strong>
, cleaned (see right)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 ml/2 fl oz <strong>
<em>fino</em>
</strong>
 sherry or dry white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 ml/2 fl oz water or fish stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>fresh white bread, to serve</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large pan with a tight-fitting lid, add the garlic, onion and chilli and fry gently until the onion is soft and transparent. Sprinkle over the flour and stir for a moment or two.</p>
<p class="extract">Next add the clams together with the parsley, sherry or wine and water or fish stock. Cover with the lid and increase the heat and cook, checking every couple of minutes and stirring, until the clams have opened, leaving the flesh lusciously juicy. Discard any clams that are still closed after cooking.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve at once with plenty of white bread to soak up the delicious sauce.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
 Try adding a little finely chopped <em>jamón Serrano</em>
 with the garlic and onion.</p>
<p class="extract">Cook this recipe with mussels, but because the mussel shells are lighter you will only need 900 g/2 lb to serve 4. They will also cook more quickly, so keep a watchful eye on them: overcooked shellfish is tough and rubbery.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and cleaning clams</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Only buy clams, and mussels, if most of their shells are closed. Lots of open shells indicate that they are not very fresh. Tap any open shell before cooking, and if it does not close discard it. The animal is dead and could cause food poisoning.</p>
<p class="indent2">If you want to buy clams, or mussels, ahead of time then place them in a very cool larder or your refrigerator covered with a damp cloth.</p>
<p class="indent2">Clams can sometimes be very sandy, so it’s worth soaking them in salt water for a few hours to sluice them of any grit. Some people add breadcrumbs or oatmeal too to help the process.</p>
<p class="pagebreak"></p>

<h1 class="section0" id="heading_id_6"><a id="page22"></a>
mejillones gratinados</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_7">grilled mussels</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Spain is the world’s leading producer of mussels. At first glance the <em>rias</em>
, or estuaries, of western Galicia seem to be packed with sinister fleets of battleships that, on closer inspection, turn out to be hundreds of small rafts. Huge, lusciously tender mussels grow on ropes suspended from these rafts. This highly productive farming makes them an absolute bargain in comparison with other, more elusive, shellfish. Another advantage of rope-grown mussels is that they don’t contain grit like their wild cousins that live on the seashore, which are constantly washed by the sandy tide.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 kg/2 ¼ lb fresh mussels, cleaned and steamed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 onion, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 red pepper, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>85 g/3¼ oz unsmoked bacon, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp tomato purée</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 tbsp breadcrumbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the ‘lids’ from the mussels, leaving them on the half shell. Place them in a large, shallow ovenproof dish and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion, red pepper and bacon and fry until they begin to colour. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until you catch its fantastic aroma. Add the tomato purée and turn off the heat.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the parsley, breadcrumbs and extra virgin olive oil together in a bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat your grill to medium. No grill? An extremely hot oven will do. Next spoon the onion mixture over the mussels and top with the breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="extract">Place under the grill until the mussels are sizzling hot and the breadcrumbs are crisp and browned.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 You can partially pre-prepare this dish. Steam the mussels and set them in their baking dish, cover with clingfilm and <strong>make sure</strong>
 to refrigerate them until you are ready to use. Prepare the sauce and, <strong>once cooled</strong>
, spoon over the mussels and refrigerate. Top with the breadcrumbs and place under the grill at the last moment.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 You may like to spice up the sauce with a pinch of hot paprika or a couple of tiny dried chillies.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing and steaming mussels</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Ensure that all the mussels are closed before cooking. Any open mussels should be given a sharp tap, if they remain open then discard them. Don’t take any chances; they could cause bad food poisoning.</p>
<p class="indent2">Scrub the shells and remove any hairy ‘beards’.</p>
<p class="indent2">Add a few tablespoons of wine or water to a large saucepan with a lid and add the mussels. Cover and place over a high heat for about 3–4 minutes. As soon as all the mussels have opened they are ready. Discard any that remain closed.</p>
<p class="indent2">The cooking liquid makes a fabulous stock base if it is not used immediately in the recipe, just be sure to strain away any grit if you are using wild mussels.</p>

vieras a la gallega</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_9">galician scallops</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The scallop shell has great significance across northern Europe; it is the symbol of Galicia’s Santiago de Compostela, where the shrine of St James has drawn penitent pilgrims from the far reaches of Christendom for over a thousand years.</p>
<p class="indent">Scallops are still a common treat in Santiago, simply baked in their shells with a little wine, parsley and garlic. I particularly like this version with a touch of salty <em>jamón</em>
 that serves to emphasize the natural sweetness of the scallop.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>A small, hazelnut-sized knob of butter</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 onion, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>85 g/3¼ oz thick slice of <strong>
<em>jamón Serrano</em>
</strong>
, diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½ fl oz dry white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp breadcrumbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 large sprig of fresh parsley, chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 large or 12 medium scallops, shucked and prepared (see right)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 230°C/450°F/Gas Mark 8.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and the butter in a pan, add the onion and fry until it is soft and translucent. Next add the garlic and the <em>jamón</em>
, do not remove any fat, this will render and add to the flavour of the sauce. Once the garlic has begun to colour pour in the wine, increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid is reduced by half.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, oil 4 scallop shells, individual terracotta <em>cazuelas</em>
, or gratin dishes with a little bit of olive oil and put into the oven to heat through.</p>
<p class="extract">Next pour the remaining olive oil into a bowl, add the breadcrumbs, parsley and a pinch of salt and mix together.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the scallops, with their orange roe, in the preheated dishes. Pour over the sauce, top with the breadcrumbs and bake in the oven for 5–10 minutes until the scallops are just opaque. Serve at once.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 If you are entertaining, you could prepare the sauce and breadcrumbs ahead of time and then throw everything together at the last moment.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying scallops</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Ideally buy scallops in their shells because these will not have been ‘soaked’, a process using tripolyphosphate by which scallops are plumped with extra moisture. ‘Soaked’ scallops are often not as fresh as their ‘dry’ counterparts and tend to boil in their own juices rather than sear. Many frozen scallops have been ‘soaked’.</p>
<p class="indent2">Ask your fishmonger to remove the scallops from their shells.</p>
<p class="indent2">If you are buying ready-shucked scallops the white abductor muscle, the scallop meat, should have a creamy tinge rather than the white glow of a soap commercial, which belies the use of phosphates.</p>
<p class="indent2">Try to find the premium priced, hand-harvested diver scallops, they are less muddy and kinder to the sea bed than the dredged variety.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing scallops</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Remove the thick white membrane around the outside of the scallop meat as well as the small tough muscle opposite the coral. If the scallops are really large you may cut them in half horizontally when searing or frying.</p>
<p class="indent2">Be extremely careful not to overcook scallops as they will lose their melt in the mouth sweetness, becoming tough and rubbery.</p>

pulpo a la gallega</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_11">galician octopus</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Market day in Ribadavia was particularly dank; even the locals scuttled around looking miserable under their umbrellas and they are used to the damp. This southerly Galician town is often shrouded in the thick mist that floods up the Miño river valley from the Atlantic. A small crowd huddled around the <em>pulpería</em>
, or octopus stall, Galicia’s answer to the hot dog van, waiting for the first round of tender tentacles. A lady snipped up the freshly cooked flesh with scissors while her ruddy cheeked accomplice began dunking the next octopus in and out of a huge copper cauldron of water. The small wooden plate of warm <em>pulpo</em>
 dressed with olive oil and paprika and washed down with a glass of the local Ribiero wine was a welcome antidote to the drizzle.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ onion, left in 1 piece</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 bay leaves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 cleaned and ‘tenderized’ octopus, weighing about 1–1.8 kg/2–4 lb (see right)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp sweet paprika and a pinch of hot paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Place the onion and bay leaves in a very large saucepan, fill it with water and bring it to the boil. Once boiling hard, ‘shock’ the octopus by dipping it in and out of the water 3 or 4 times with a pair of tongs until the tentacles begin to curl. This will keep the skin intact and give a deliciously tender result.</p>
<p class="extract">Reduce the heat slightly to a good simmer and continue to cook for about 30–45 minutes, or until a skewer slides easily through the flesh. Remove from the heat and leave the octopus to rest for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the tentacles into thick slices, the locals use a pair of scissors for the job, and pile them onto a wooden board or plate. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with salt and paprika.</p>
<p class="extract">Tuck in with a cocktail stick while the octopus is still warm.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 The cooked octopus can be covered and kept for a couple of days in the refrigerator, just make sure you let it come back to room temperature and add the seasoning at the last minute.</p>
<p class="extract">Any leftovers would be delicious in a typical <em>empanada</em>
 (see page 130).</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cleaning and tenderizing octopus</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">To clean the octopus, begin by turning back the tentacles, revealing the mouth and beak. Remove the beak and cut away the muscles that hold the innards inside the head. You can now turn the head inside out and remove any entrails before washing thoroughly. Give the suckers a good wash too to remove any stubborn sand.</p>
<p class="indent2">Tenderizing an octopus is a much easier job than you might imagine. You can forget all those tales of a half-hour pounding the fresh octopus on the rocky shoreline or thrashing it around in the washing machine or even a cement mixer, which you just happen to have to hand, 48 hours in the freezer will do the trick.</p>

salpicón de mariscos</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">shellfish vinaigrette</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Here is a truly refreshing mixture, a treat when shellfish is fabulously fresh and sweet. You can play around with the recipe according to what is at its best, any selection of lobster, crab, prawns, shrimps, octopus, squid, baby cuttlefish, clams or mussels will be delicious. The absolute key to this dish is not to overcook the fish. You will need to begin a few hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4–6 as a starter</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ lemon, sliced</strong>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz fresh mussels, cleaned, steamed and removed from their shells (see page 22)</strong>
</p>
<p class="aserves0"><br/>
</p>
<p class="aserves0">for the vinaigrette</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 green pepper, very finely diced (think kaleidoscope)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tomatoes, peeled and finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp onion, very finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by boiling a large saucepan of salted water with the lemon quarters, onion, bay leaf, parsley stalks and peppercorns. Drop in the prawns and once the water has come back up to the boil, cook for 1 minute. Remove the prawns with a slotted spoon and cool under cold running water.</p>
<p class="extract">Peel the prawns, reserving the heads and shells for stock (see page 20). Remove the black thread that runs down their back with a sharp knife as it can be rather gritty, then cut in half lengthways.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, using the same water in the pan, bring it back to the boil and quite literally dunk in the squid rings and tentacles until they turn opaque, a matter of seconds. Any longer and you will end up with rubber bands. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix together all the ingredients for the vinaigrette in a bowl large enough to hold your shellfish. Add the prawns, squid and mussels and stir well. Place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight, stirring from time to time.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve chilled.</p>

<p class="extract">Place the flour on a large plate and sprinkle with the salt. Add the squid rings and toss until coated.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat enough oil for frying in a deep saucepan or deep-fat fryer until a bread cube browns in about 30 seconds (see page 81). Add the squid in batches, too much at a time will lower the heat of the oil and the squid must cook quickly or they will become tough and chewy. As soon as the squid are golden remove with a slotted spoon and leave to drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="extract">Once all the squid is cooked serve immediately garnished with the lemon segments, preferably with a bowl of <em>Allioli</em>
 to dip into.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cleaning squid</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Hold the squid in one hand and pull on the tentacles with the other. Set the empty body aside and deal first with the tentacles, head, silvery ink sack and innards.</p>
<p class="indent2">Cut the tentacles off just below the eyes. Remove the tough little beak right in the centre of the tentacles; it will pop out if you push your finger through the middle. Remove the ink sac from the innards, if using, taking care not to puncture it.</p>
<p class="indent2">Now back to the body. Scrape the membrane from the body and pull off the fins; these can be used too. Pull out the cartilage or ‘quill’ from the body then wash thoroughly leaving you with a white, empty tube, which is perfect for stuffing.</p>

<strong>1 kg/2¼ lb small squid, cleaned and prepared (see opposite) with ink sacs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 onions, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp breadcrumbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp hot non-smoked paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>300 ml/10 fl oz fish or chicken stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 ripe tomatoes, grated (see page 152)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bay leaf</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 sachet of cuttlefish ink (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz red wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>freshly cooked white rice or bread, to serve</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Chop the tentacles and wings of the squid into pieces.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a pan, add half of the onions and fry until soft and transparent. Next, add half of the garlic and the tentacles and cook until you can smell the garlic. Add half of the parsley and the breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="extract">Use this mixture to stuff the squid bodies. Take care not to overfill them or they will split during cooking. Seal each body with a cocktail stick.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the flour on a plate, add the squid and toss until coated. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the squid until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Now, using the same pan, fry the remaining onion until transparent. Add the remaining garlic and the paprika and stir for a minute. Pour in the stock, tomatoes and bay leaf and simmer.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, place the ink sacs in a sieve over a bowl and break them open with a spoon. Pour over the wine, working it through the sacs with the spoon. Repeat this process 2 or 3 times.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the ink and wine mixture to the sauce together with the squid and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and simmer over a low heat for 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Garnish with the remaining parsley and serve with white rice or bread.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 You could add two slices of <em>jamón Serrano</em>
, finely chopped, with the stuffing.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing cephalopods</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">All cephalopods, octopus, cuttlefish and squid, should smell sweet and fresh with no hint of ammonia. They freeze well, in fact octopus becomes more tender with at least 48 hours freezing. If you are not using them straight away remove the innards from squid and cuttlefish.</p>
<p class="indent2">Ink imparts extra flavour, along with a dramatic look, to many squid and cuttlefish dishes. Cuttlefish ink is more plentiful and also reputedly sweeter than squid ink and is available in small sachets from delicatessens and fishmongers.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_19">seafood ‘operetta’</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The seafood stands in Barcelona’s Boquería market are a shellfish showcase. With so many varieties of crustacean on offer choosing can be a mind-boggling experience. This recipe solves the problem, just take a little of everything you fancy. Feel free to direct your own Operetta: the seafood can be varied according to what is available on the day, your personal taste and budget.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>400–600 g/14–1¼ lb hake, cut into 4 steaks (cod or halibut would be wonderful too)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>400–600 g/14–1¼ lb monkfish, cut into 4 steaks</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>12 prawns, shells left on</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 langoustine/Dublin bay prawns, or <strong>
<em>cigalas</em>
</strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 medium onion, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp Spanish brandy</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 dried chilli, left whole</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bay leaf</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp sweet paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>few saffron strands</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 ml/7 fl oz dry white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 ml/7 fl oz fish stock (see page 34)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 large squid, cleaned and cut into 4 pieces</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 fresh clams, cleaned (see page 21)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 fresh mussels, cleaned (see page 22)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>crusty bread, to serve</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the flour and salt together on a large plate, add the fish and toss until coated. Shake off any excess flour.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or shallow casserole, add the fish and fry until there is a little colour on both sides. You are browning rather than cooking it through at this stage. Set aside once golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the prawns and langoustine to the pan and fry until just pink, then set aside too. Now, using the same oil, fry the onion until translucent, then add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour on the brandy and shake the pan over the heat until it flames. Once the alcohol has burned off add the chilli, tomatoes, bay leaf, paprika, saffron and most of the parsley and cook for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour in the wine and fish stock and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Add all the reserved seafood together with the squid, mussels and clams. Cover the pan. If you don’t have a lid a baking sheet will do and continue to simmer for about 8–10 minutes until the mussels and clams have opened.</p>
<p class="extract">Using a slotted spoon, remove the bay leaf and chilli. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve at once with some good crusty bread.</p>
