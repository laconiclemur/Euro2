<h2 class="h2b">TARTE ORANGE ET CHOCOLAT</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Chocolate, Orange and Pine Nut Tart</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>There’s nothing really that links chocolate to Provence, but you’ve got to have a few chocolate desserts in any book… The pine nuts and orange are more typical and combine to balance the richness of this sticky, cooked chocolate mousse. The tart can be made a day or so in advance, kept in the fridge and cooked on the day of serving, so long as once it is cooked, it doesn’t go back in the fridge</em>.</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">CHOCOLATE SHORTBREAD PASTRY</span><br/>
80g (3oz) unsalted butter<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) icing sugar, plus extra for dusting<br/>
1 egg yolk<br/>
80g (3oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br/>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">ORANGE ZEST AND SAUCE</span><br/>
4 oranges<br/>
200g (7oz) caster sugar<br/>
Salt</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FILLING AND TOPPING</span><br/>
75g (2¾ oz) chocolate, 72% cocoa solids, chopped<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) unsalted butter, diced<br/>
4 eggs, separated<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) caster sugar<br/>
40g (1½ oz) cocoa powder<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) pine nuts</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">For the chocolate shortbread pastry, mix all the ingredients together until totally smooth, either by hand or in the food processor. The mixture will seem very wet but don’t worry, it’s meant to be this way. Put plenty of flour on your hands and shape the mixture into a flat circle. Wrap it in clingfilm and put in the fridge for at least half an hour to harden before rolling.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the orange zest in long thin strips, using a vegetable peeler. Next, with a small sharp knife remove the remaining skin, segment the oranges and squeeze all of the juice from the cores. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the orange zests for 1 minute and refresh under cold running water. Repeat this, then put the orange zests into a small pan with the juice and the sugar (but not the segments).</p>
<p class="normala">Bring to the boil, then simmer over a low heat for about 10 minutes until the orange zests are almost transparent. Transfer half of the zests to a piece of greaseproof paper, then chop the other half as finely as possible and reserve in a small bowl. Add the orange segments to the remaining syrup.</p>
<p class="normala">To roll the pastry, lay a large sheet of clingfilm flat on your work surface. Flour it well then place the chocolate pastry in the centre. Flour the pastry and top with another sheet of clingfilm then roll it out away from yourself, turning it 45 degrees between each roll to ensure that it is an even thickness. Continue rolling until you have a round slightly larger than your 20cm (8in) flan ring, and put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes. Remove the top layer of clingfilm, lift the pastry over your rolling pin and place it with the side with the clingfilm still on it facing upward over the top of the flan ring. Ease it into the sides of the ring before pressing down the edges. Remove the bottom layer of clingfilm.</p>
<p class="normala">For the filling, melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of barely simmering water or in the microwave on its lowest setting. Stir in the butter and the finely chopped orange zest, then remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="normala">In a mixing bowl whisk the egg whites until firm, then add the sugar gradually and continue whisking until stiff. Fold in the egg yolks, then sieve in the cocoa powder and fold in gently with a spatula. Take a third of this mixture and stir it vigorously into the still warm chocolate. Do be vigorous or the chocolate will set. Fold this mixture into the remaining egg white, then turn it all into the lined flan ring.</p>
<p class="normala">Sprinkle the pine nuts over the top then bake the tart in the preheated oven for 20–25 minutes until the outsides are firm but the centre is still slightly runny. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes before removing the ring.</p>
<p class="normala">When you are ready to serve, sprinkle the top with icing sugar and top with the reserved orange zests. Serve at room temperature with the orange segments and syrup.</p>
