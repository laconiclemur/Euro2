 This book is dedicated to all those who came into my life and left the gift of sweet memories. I thank you.</p>
<p class="parag">I would like to thank all at Pavilion who supported this book and made it possible. To Krissy Mallett who first approached me, Katie Cowan and Stephanie Milner who helped throughout. Great thanks also go to Dan Hurst for his patience with my English, Valerie Berry and Alex James Gray who brought the recipes to life, Yuki Sugiura for her beautiful photographs, Alexander Breeze for filling the photographs with such lovely things and Laura Russell for framing everything so beautifully with her design. Thanks also to Sophie Yamamoto who pulled it all together.</p>
<p class="parag">I owe a huge debt to my mother who inspired most of the recipes, Tamara Melikishvili, my sister–in–law, who provided illustrations for the book, and Nina Anjaparidze, Zaira Chantladze and Clive Crotty who supplied images of Georgia.</p>
<p class="parag">Special thanks must also go to Eldar Shengelaia who provided posters of his movies for inclusion in these pages and Natalia Jughedi for making that possible.</p>
