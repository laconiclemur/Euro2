<p class="summary1">Panellets <span class="italic">are the traditional sweets of All Saints’ Day in Catalonia, when they are eaten with roasted chestnuts and sweet wine. Mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes are commonly added to the mixture when they are made commercially, because almonds are expensive. But they are best made using ground almonds alone for the marzipan paste. In reality, it is the labor that makes them expensive: the tricky part is pressing the pine nuts into the marzipan balls and making them stick. It is the kind of sweet that you would make as a special Christmas gift. It is best to make the marzipan paste ahead, even the day before.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES ABOUT 20 SWEETS</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 cups ground almonds</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="qun">2½ tablespoons water</p>
<p class="qun">1 egg white</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup pine nuts</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the ground almonds, sugar, and lemon zest in a food processor, add the water, and blend to a paste. You should not need any more water to produce a paste, but you will have to blend for a long time until the oil from the almonds is released and binds the ingredients into a firm soft paste. Wrap the paste in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Take small lumps of the marzipan paste and roll them into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, between the palms of your hand. When you have shaped them all, lightly beat the egg white in a small bowl. One at a time, roll each ball in the egg white, then take a handful of pine nuts and press them into the ball, holding it in your hand. It is not easy to make them stick—you will have to push them in with your finger. Then roll the pine nut–encrusted ball in the palm of your hand so as to cover it with a film of egg white. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bake the balls in a preheated 400°F oven for about 10 minutes, until they are slightly golden. Do not try to take the <span class="italic">panellets</span> off the baking sheet while they are hot—they will be too soft. Wait until they have cooled and firmed.</p>
