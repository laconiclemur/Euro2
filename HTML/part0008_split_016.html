			<p class="rec-intro">This is a boozy delight and takes me back to my days as an apprentice when charlottes were in fashion. All kinds of flavours and perfumes were used but my all-time favourite is this pear version. I use canned pears, which may come as a surprise but they work beautifully. </p>

			<p class="body">You will need a charlotte mould or a loose-based 20cm cake tin. First make the biscuit for lining the mould. Separate the eggs and whisk the yolks with 160g of the caster sugar until pale. Whisk the whites until frothy, add the remaining caster sugar and whisk again until firm. Gently fold this into the yolk mixture. Once nearly all the egg white is incorporated, fold in the flour – take care not to over mix. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the biscuit mixture in a piping bag. Pipe a circle of dots on to a non-stick baking mat. The circle should be the same diameter as the mould and the dots should be touching. Next pipe another circle in a spiral on to another mat to form the base of the charlotte. Pipe the rest of the mixture in diagonal strips on to a separate non-stick baking mat, piping the strips close together so they touch. Dust with icing sugar and bake all the biscuit at 210°C/Fan 190°C/Gas 6½ for 12 minutes or until cooked. Leave to cool. </p>
			<p class="body">Set the circles aside. Cut out sections of the strips the same depth as the mould to line the sides. Line the base of your mould with the biscuit circle, then line the sides with sections of the strips, making sure there are no gaps. Moisten with a little of the pear syrup and liqueur. </p>
			<p class="body">Now make the bavarois mixture. Place the gelatine in iced water to soften. Whisk the yolks and caster sugar in a bowl until pale. Pour the pear syrup into a saucepan, then add the milk powder and vanilla pod and bring to the boil. Pour the boiling pear milk on to the yolks, mix well, then tip back into the pan and cook until it’s thickened and coats the back of a spoon. Once the mixture reaches 82°C (check with a thermometer) remove from the heat and add the drained, squeezed gelatine. Pass through a fine sieve and leave to cool a little before adding the pear liqueur. Cover with cling film and chill. </p>
			<p class="body">Once the mixture is cold and semi-set, fold in the whipped cream. Pour half the mixture into the lined mould, add plenty of chopped pear, then pour on the rest of the bavarois. Leave to cool overnight, then top with the circle of biscuit dots and serve. This also freezes well so can be made in advance. <span class="char-style-override6"></span></p>
