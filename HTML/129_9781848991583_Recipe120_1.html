<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_201"/><b>Apple, Raspberry</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Thyme Puffs</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Depending on whether I had time to pop into the local bakery, I used to eat these chaussons—literally “slippers”—on the way to or from school, but we used to make them at home, too. You might call these apple turnovers—the idea is the same, but I make them in a slightly different way. The puff pastry gives them a beautifully warm, buttery crunch just before you reach the fruit, full of sweet acidity. There should be more fruit than pastry, so make sure the mix is not too runny or they can be tricky to close. And, I can assure you apple, raspberry and freshly picked thyme leaves are fabulous together!</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 large cooking apples, peeled, halved, cored and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">a little all-purpose flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 pound 10 ounces rolled all-butter puff pastry dough, thawed if frozen, cut into 12 fluted 3-inch circles</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 egg</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup fresh raspberries</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 thyme sprig</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the sugar, all the apples and 2 tablespoons water, cover and cook gently 8 to 10 minutes until the apples are cooked but not completely pureed. Remove the lid, then turn the heat up slightly so the liquid just starts to evaporate. Keep moving the apple around the pan with a spatula to help drive off the moisture and dry out the apple until you have a dry puree. Transfer the puree to a bowl and leave to cool completely. (The puree must be dry and cold before you start to make your <i>chaussons</i>, otherwise the dough will just melt and collapse.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Heat the oven to 350°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Dust a countertop with a very little flour, then lay a dough circle on the dusted surface and roll with a rolling pin just once to the top and the bottom; you want the circle to become elongated into a slight oval shape. Repeat with the remaining circles. Lay all the ovals vertically out in front of you on the countertop. Mix the egg and salt with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put a spoonful of apple puree on the bottom one-third of a dough oval, ¾ inch from the side. Put 4 raspberries on top of the purée and a little sprinkle of the thyme, then brush the egg wash around the bottom edge of the oval—nothing so far has come above the halfway mark. Fold the top half of the pastry over to cover the filling, then gently press the edges together to seal. Brush the top of the dough with the egg wash, taking care not to get any on the back of the folded pastry, which would run down and make the pastry stick to the cookie sheet. Using a spatula, carefully lift each one onto the prepared cookie sheet. Use the back of a fork to make a crisscross pattern on top.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Bake 12 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. If not, return them to the oven 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and serve warm with a cup of coffee or Earl Grey tea.</p>
