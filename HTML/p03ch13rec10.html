<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">People visit the island of Majorca in January and February for the joy of seeing the almond trees in blossom; a magnificent pink and white spectacle that fills the air with a bittersweet perfume. The trees provide Spain with many of the almonds that are used in the country’s famously long repertoire of almond pastries and confections. This ice cream is a specialty of the island and is often served with its famous</span> ensaimada <span class="italic">(see page 111). It is really a water ice, but the almond milk gives it a creamy texture. Adding a few drops of almond extract will give a more pronounced flavor, but be careful not to add too much, as the taste will be overpowering.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound blanched whole almonds</p>
<p class="qun">1½ cups sugar</p>
<p class="qun">4½ cups water</p>
<p class="qun1">3 drops of almond extract (optional)</p>
<p class="recsum">Grind the almonds as fine as possible in a food processor.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bring the sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Stir in the ground almonds and the almond extract, if using, and bring to a boil again. Remove from the heat and let cool. Then pour into ice cube trays. Cover the trays with plastic wrap and let freeze overnight in the freezer.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Turn out the almond ice cubes (if they are rock-hard, let stand for a few minutes before processing them), drop them into a food processor, in two or three batches, and process to a very fine, creamy slush. (You can serve the slush right away, but crushing the ice cubes in the blender makes such a noise that you may not want to do it when people are there.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the slush into a serving bowl or individual bowls and return to the freezer, covered with plastic wrap, until ready to serve. If it has frozen hard when you take the ice cream out of the freezer, wait 10 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="recsum">To shape the ice cream into a dome that is easy to unmold, line a bowl with plastic wrap, pour in the processed mixture, and cover with another piece of wrap. Freeze overnight. To serve, remove the plastic wrap on the top, then turn out onto a serving platter and remove the other piece.</p>
