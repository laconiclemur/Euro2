<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Apple trees are mentioned in Asturian monastery documents as early as the eighth century. By the twelfth century, smallholders were contracted to plant and tend a certain number of apple trees for the benefit of their landowners. The clergy covered their extensive lands with apple trees. In Asturias today, apples are an important part of the local economy. They are used to make cider and also appear in dishes both savory and sweet. In this dish, the apples are sometimes cooked in the oven with the chicken, sometimes sautéed separately in butter (Asturias is dairy country), sometimes accompanied by raisins, sometimes by white grapes. When my friend Alicia Ríos and her assistant, Simon Cohen, sent out e-mails to their friends asking for their favorite recipes, Ana Isabel Lozano sent me this one, which has become one of my favorites. The apple inside the cavity gives the chicken a fruity aroma and the freshly pressed grape juice gives it a caramelized glaze. In Asturias, they would use Reineta apples, but Golden Delicious are a good substitute.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 Golden Delicious apples</p>
<p class="qun">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds seedless white grapes</p>
<p class="qun">1 chicken (about 3½ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">⅓ cup (5⅓ tablespoons) butter</p>
<p class="recsum">Peel and core the apples. Cut one in half or quarters, to fit easily inside the chicken, and cut the rest into 8 slices each. Drop them into a bowl of water with the lemon juice to prevent them from discoloring.</p>
<p class="summary">Blend half the grapes in a food processor. Collect their juice by pressing the mush through a fine strainer into a bowl, using a wooden spoon. You should get about 1 cup of juice.</p>
<p class="summary">Stuff the chicken with the halved or quartered apple and put it in a baking dish.</p>
<p class="summary">Sprinkle with salt and pepper and rub with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Turn the bird breast side down and pour about ½ cup of the grape juice over it.</p>
<p class="summary">Roast in a preheated 375°F oven for 45 minutes. Turn the chicken over, pour the remaining grape juice over it, and return to the oven. Roast for another 30 minutes, or until the chicken skin is browned and caramelized and the juices run clear when you cut in between the leg and the body of the bird with a pointed knife.</p>
<p class="summary">While the chicken is roasting, heat the butter with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Put in the drained apple slices and the remaining grapes and sauté over medium heat, turning the fruit once, until the grapes are soft and golden and the apples tender and caramelized. This can take 20 minutes. Transfer to a baking dish, with their juices, and reheat in the oven when you are ready to serve.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary">Substitute a handful of dark or golden raisins or 6 to 8 moist pitted prunes, cut into pieces, for the sautéed grapes; add them to the skillet with the apples.</p>
