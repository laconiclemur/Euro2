  <p class="chap-para">This is a lovely dish made from the chicken cooked in the <a href="part0007_split_006.html#ch1sec5a" class="calibre1">Chicken broth recipe</a>. Serve as an antipasto or a main course with lots of good bread to dip into the dressing. You will need to marinate it overnight in the fridge and you can leave the finished dish to infuse for another day. If you want a short cut, instead of preparing the vegetables, use a jar of ready-made preserved <em class="calibre4">giardiniera</em>, which is an Italian mixed vegetable pickle sold in good delis.</p>
