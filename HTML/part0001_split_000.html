			<p class="textblackmiddle" xml:lang="en-US"><a id="soups1"></a>The word <span class="italic">souper</span> means to have supper and a good soup can indeed be the main part of a meal in France, especially in the countryside. A French soup will be wholesome with plenty of vegetables, perhaps a little meat and, depending on the part of France, some butter, cream or olive oil. Soups are very regional dishes and there are many different recipes for such classics as onion soup – each claiming to be the ultimate. There are also lighter, more elegant soups such as consommés that are ideal served as a starter for a special meal. </p>
