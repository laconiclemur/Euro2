<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Widely enjoyed from the central heartland of the country outward to the coasts, this is an elegant dessert—and also an excellent way to use a half bottle of leftover red wine. The pears, carefully stewed in wine aromatized with cinnamon and lemon peel, take on a bold ruby color. The final syrupy sauce should be a touch sweet, but not cloyingly so. This will allow the sweet freshness of the pears to surface and the warm tones of the wine to blossom.</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6 RIPE BUT QUITE FIRM PEARS, SUCH AS ANJOU, BOSC, CONFERENCE, OR BARTLETT, ABOUT 3 POUNDS/1.4 KG TOTAL</li>
<li>HEAPING ¼ CUP SUGAR</li>
<li>2 CUPS/480 ML MEDIUM RED WINE</li>
<li>1 SMALL CINNAMON STICK</li>
<li>PEEL OF ½&gt; ORGANIC LEMON, WHITE PITH SCRAPED AWAY</li>
<li>¼ CUP/35 G PINE NUTS, DRY-TOASTED <a href="247-chapter183.html#page_340">(SEE PAGE 340)</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Peel the pears without removing the stems, leaving them whole. Trim the bottoms so that the pears can stand upright.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large, deep sauté pan, dissolve the sugar in the wine over medium heat, add the cinnamon stick and lemon peel, and set the pears gently in the liquid, laying them down on their sides. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 40 minutes, or until the pears are tender but not mushy. As they cook, swirl the pan and baste the pears from time to time (to keep the coloring and flavoring even), as well as turning them occasionally, being careful as they scar easily. (To turn, grasp by the stem with your fingers and use a spoon to cup the bottom of the pear.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Remove the pan from the heat and let cool, swirling it from time to time (to keep the coloring even). Transfer the pears and liquid to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Place a chilled pear upright on each dessert plate—preferably a white one, to show off the color of the syrupy sauce—by holding the stem and cupping the bottom with a spoon. Drizzle some of the liquid over the pears. Sprinkle some pine nuts around the pooled sauce before serving.</p>
