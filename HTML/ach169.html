<p class="noindentb">My father’s family prepared cream puffs for dessert during the Christmas and Easter holidays or when special company was invited for dinner. Over the years they used different recipes for cream puffs from a variety of cookbooks, but the recipe for the cream filling always remained the same. The filling may be prepared two days in advance. Cover and refrigerate. Return to room temperature and stir briskly before filling the cream puffs. The filling may also be frozen for up to three months.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large eggs, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups granulated sugar</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Cut a <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slice off the top of each cream puff and set aside. Remove any soft dough from inside the puff and discard. Generously fill each puff, capping it with the reserved top. Arrange on a serving platter. Place a few tablespoons of confectioners’ sugar in a fine-mesh sieve. Shake over the filled cream puffs to dust lightly, and serve.</p>
