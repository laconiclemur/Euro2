</h1>
<p class="pf">In the winter the cows were kept in the barn due to the immense amounts of snow that would fall. They had to have fresh water every day, and I was assigned the duty of pumping the water for the cows. The pump was little and the tank was very big, so I would climb onto a wooden platform and had to jump up and down with the pump handle. Sometimes the water never seemed to rise in the tank. At other times, when the pumping became routine, I’d daydream and the water would overflow. The water from the tank went through pipes to cups that were in front of the stanchioned cows, and while I pumped I would study the markings on the cows.</p>
<p>We made our own butter when I was very young. Later, we abandoned the practice in favor of selling whole milk that was separated in the creamery rather than on our farm.</p>
<p>Nätti (the name is Finnish for “cute”) was my family’s favorite cow. She was reddish brown with bright white spots on her that seemed to outline images. Sometimes her spots looked like profiles of people, sometimes like animals. Nättie’s eyes seemed to bulge on her thin head. She was the oldest cow in the barn and her horns were curly. Isä used to say, “You could count her years by the rings on her horns.”</p>
<p>Lizzie was a honey-blond cow. She was always fat and had a big udder. I used to think that Lizzie would make a perfect grandmother if she were a person. Lizzie was slow and peaceful and next oldest to Nättie.</p>
<p>Pansy was <i>my</i>
 cow. I had such a personal attachment to her. She was pretty, bright black and white, and streamlined—I always thought that if Pansy were a person she would be a pretty aunt with a good figure. I remember holding her tail while Mummy or Isä milked her. I was proud to hold Pansy’s curly tail because she was my cow!</p>
<p>Tillie was black and white, too, and awfully temperamental. She kicked for no reason at all sometimes. Her manure was always soft and would really splash. I thought she did that on purpose. Tillie gave lots of milk but always had bull calves.</p>
<p>Lola was big boned, didn’t give much milk, and I milked her. She was a light-blond cow, and the athletic type, I thought. I remember the time she placed her hoof mark on the chest of my pretty pink sunsuit. The stain never really washed out.</p>

<p class="figcap">Beloved Pansy, my favorite cow.</p>
</div>
<p>Then there was one we called “Crazy Cow.” She jumped, kicked, and swatted her tail for no reason. She was small but gave a lot of milk. All her daughters turned out to be crazy cows, too.</p>
<p>Three Titter was a cow who had one damaged teat and could only be milked from three of her teats. Her milk production matched that of the average cows in the barn, so we kept her.</p>
<p>The Floodwood Creamery kept a record of the names of all the cows in our barn. When heifers gave birth and began producing milk, they needed to have a name. Isä was “out of names” and when our cow Lulu’s heifer became a milk producer and had to be named, he named her “Ulul”—spelling the name of her mother backward.</p>
<p>One day Nätti went missing. She was old but still gave lots of milk, and she had just freshened that spring (which means she had had a calf). Cows in the springtime were let out to pasture when the new grass became juicy and green. By evening and morning of each day, their udders were nearly bursting with milk.</p>
<p>It was a sunny morning when I was around twelve years old that Nätti went missing. We searched the woods and brush behind the east field where the cows had been grazing. We even searched the riverbank, where the cows seldom went. We called the neighbors and they joined in the search. No luck.</p>
<p>What seemed strange was that we couldn’t hear her bell either. Nätti was the leader of the herd—an office appointed by her peers. She was always at the head of the line as we called the cows in for milking at morning and evening. My father had a special call for the cows: “Sipu, sipu, sipu.” Those words don’t actually mean anything, but if anyone used those words, the cows would come ambling straight to the barn.</p>
<p>“Sipu, sipu, sipu!” we would call, and there would come old Nättie at the head of the line, her bell swinging from left to right, followed by the remaining twenty-nine members of the mostly Guernsey herd. This morning the beckoning call failed to bring in the leader. Two days went by and still no trace of our favorite lead cow.</p>
<p>There was no evidence, either, of Nättie being stolen by cattle rustlers. No, she was much too old to be worth that kind of effort; besides, we lived at the dead end of a county road and the pastures were hidden behind groves of poplar, aspen, and pine trees. It would have been impossible for anybody to come in with a truck because our driveway was a full quarter mile long and they would be in full view of the house and the barn.</p>
<p>Nättie had obviously lost her way in the woods. After all, she was an old cow. Do cows get Alzheimer’s disease?</p>
<p>Tillie, Lola, Lulu, Ulul, Daisy, Violet, and all the rest plodded into the yard behind the barn, likely out of habit and looking forward to relief because their udders were uncomfortable and bulging with milk. If only they could talk. The faithful herd filed into the barn and headed right for their own stalls. Stanchions closed, we washed their udders, attached the cups of the milking machines, and relieved each one of her burden. After the machines were removed, we “stripped” each cow of the remaining milk in their udders (if we didn’t do that, they would gradually produce less milk as time went on—kind of like rechargeable batteries that have not fully depleted their energy before being recharged). Each cow would be turned out, one at a time, through the back door of the barn when they were finished. Each would head to the watering tank for a nice long drink and then amble out to the pasture again.</p>
<p>That particular day when Nättie was missing, there was a pall over the farm. My father, Mummy, the neighbors, hired men, and various relatives combed the woods listening for any sound of life as they searched for the missing cow. The search continued for three days.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the fourth day, Isä (who I always thought had a clairvoyant sense about him) had a dream in which he was told to head east of the usual pasture that ran toward a swampy area surrounded by alder brush. Convinced of his vision, he headed toward that spot as soon as daylight broke. Sure enough, he heard a muffled groan.</p>
<p>There, sunk into the muck, was our beloved Nättie! Only the ridge of her back was above the mud, her head was pointed upward, and she was still breathing.</p>
<p>I don’t know how they did it, but with a tractor, ropes, pulleys, and straps, my father, mother, relatives, and hired men managed to pull old Nätti out of the quicksand. Another few hours and she would have been buried alive. She had been rescued just in time.</p>
<p>Nättie was laid on a sledge and brought back to the barn, where we scrubbed her down with warm water. She drank gallons of water. Her once plump body was bony and her udders were thin. Isä was advised to “put her down,” but he just couldn’t. Nättie lived several more years, but never really regained her milk production. That was okay. We loved her until she died.</p>
<p class="psec">A few years later, as a sophomore or junior in high school, I took a class that combined public speaking and English. At school, I was always a little afraid of baring my soul and talking about my life on our farm. All through school, even my friends wouldn’t come out to the farm. Ever. I was a country kid. But I really wanted to talk to others about my life on the farm and the things I loved there. For instance, I wanted to explain my love for the cows in the barn. I loved them so much. So one day, for my public speaking class, I wrote a speech about that.</p>
<p>When it came time to read our writing aloud, I honestly wasn’t trying to be funny. I was seriously describing the pleasures of milking a cow on a forty-degrees-below-zero morning. When it is that cold, I can’t think of a cozier place to be than the barn. The sounds of the cows munching on the hay in the manger in front of them, with the strains of Famous Lashua the Singing Cowboy in the air. Mummy always said that cows were happier when there was music in the air. It made the cows “drop their milk” more easily when the barn is full of the strains of a song. We always had a radio on, and sometimes I would sing along with the tune.</p>
<p>I loved to be perched on a short, three-legged stool, my head against the warm belly of a cow as I squirted milk beginning with the <i>zing, zing</i>
 into an empty pail that soon grew to a <i>swoosh, swoosh</i>
 as the milk grew deeper and the foam built on top of the white liquid. The cows were my warm friends, especially on a bitterly cold morning. I had learned by then that each cow radiates about 4,300 BTUs per hour! Now that’s why a barn is a cozy place to be.</p>
<p>So all I could think of writing and talking about at the moment was how pleasant it was to be milking cows on a forty-below day. I proceeded to tell twenty of my classmates all about it. As I told the story, the teacher, Miss Wennerstrom—who was about as wide as she was tall—began to laugh so hard she had to sit down. She began to jiggle all over and then laugh out loud. This made the whole class laugh before I could even finish the story. As I read she laughed harder, and then the whole class started laughing. I wondered if the class could smell barn on me. Seriously, though, I just wanted to let my teacher and my classmates know where I was coming from.</p>
<p>My story didn’t make any peer points for me, but I did get a good grade in the class—Miss Wennerstrom rarely smiled. I couldn’t see what was so funny.</p>
<div class="recipe">
<p class="rph" id="rcp08">
<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Finnish Baked Cheese (Leipäjuusto)</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">The formula for this recipe is based on one that Lauri Sauko (director of Salolampi language camp) shared. It enhances the milk with extra milk powder and heavy cream. The dry milk adds a great deal of bulk to the cheese. Rennet can be ordered through the Internet from cheesemaking supply houses.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 gallon skim milk</p>
<p class="rpil">3 cups instant dry milk (Lauri says Carnation works best)</p>
<p class="rpil">1 quart heavy cream</p>
<p class="rpil">1 rennet tablet</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup water</p>
<p class="rpill">1 teaspoon salt</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Mix milk, dry milk, and cream well in a large, heavy pot and place over lowest heat until milk reaches 110°F.</p>
<p class="rp">Crush rennet into the water and add to the milk; stir in the salt. Cover and do not stir anymore. Turn off the heat and let stand 1 hour until milk curdles and looks like a custard. It is okay to let it stand 2 to 3 hours (in fact, some recipes call for putting the pot in the refrigerator at this point to stand overnight).</p>
<p class="rp">With a long spatula or knife, cut the curd into 1-inch squares. The curd and whey should separate. If curd is very soft, place over low heat again for about half an hour.</p>
<p class="rp">Line a colander with dampened cheesecloth. Place over a large bowl or pan to collect the whey. Pour milk mixture into the cloth-lined colander. Drain well.</p>
<p class="rp">Transfer curds to a large rimmed cookie sheet or pizza pan. Press into a firm, evenly thick round cake.</p>
<p class="rp">Broil until cheese shrinks from sides of the pan. Pour off whey. Invert cheese onto another pan and broil to golden brown. (I had to invert mine several times onto another pan and broil again.)</p>
<p class="rpl">This recipe makes a large squeaky cheese, which can be cut into portions, wrapped, and refrigerated until you’re ready to eat it.</p>
