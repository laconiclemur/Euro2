<p class="flush_left"><a id="pg_7"/>Brindisa began, not so much with a plan, more on a shoestring and with an idea, as a salute to the real, largely undiscovered artisan food of Spain. The name, which comes from the Spanish <em>brindis,</em> means ‘to make a toast’, or ‘raise your glass’; and what began over 28 years ago with a few stunning cheeses never seen in the UK before just gathered momentum, as more like-minded people jumped aboard and helped to propel a kind of Spanish food revolution.</p>
<p class="indented">People always ask me: why food, and above all why <em>Spanish</em> food? And more commercially hard-nosed people have often said, ‘How on earth did you make it work?’ given the hoops we had to jump through in the early days, before Spain was a part of the EU. I would travel hundreds of miles to seek out small producers and growers in remote regions and mountains, to try to convince them to be brave and let us sell their produce in Britain, where, in the late eighties, the popular notion of Spanish food and drink was still largely limited to holiday resort <em>paella</em> and <em>sangría</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">My answer is that, although when I was younger I would never have dreamed my future would be that of a trader, a kind of pioneering spirit, entrepreneurship and lust for travel seems to have run through the generations in our family. My grandfather on my mother’s side, Eric Popper, known as Opa, was a truly inspirational figure who managed a trading post in Kota Kota in Malawi, which eventually became the country’s biggest agricultural/rice co-operative society, while my paternal grandfather, Augustine Lavery, was an old-fashioned, cautious bank manager from Leytonstone, who instilled a judicial understanding of money and business into myself, my twin siblings, Mark and Michele, and sister Moyna.</p>
<p class="indented">We were privileged enough to have all our grandparents with us until we were in our twenties, and the stories that echoed among the older folk conjured up pictures that still stay in my mind. Opa’s tales, especially, were rich and wonderful. He was a German of Jewish extraction. All his family seemed to be traders, and his wife’s family were mariners of Norwegian origin. He was trading silk in Hamburg when in the early thirties life in Germany began to become uncomfortable, so they headed for Cyprus, where they bought some land. Opa dug an irrigation system and planted a citrus farm, working with the local communities. When he later found himself a job with the government of Nyasaland (now Malawi), much of what he did involved teaching local rice growers to develop new techniques. Again he introduced a proper regime of irrigation, this time to the natural swamp plains, for the cultivation of rice. He built a mill, traded the rice, and managed the Kota Kota Produce and Trading Society. As the quality of life improved for the growers, Opa set up small general stores in the district, the largest of which became like an old-fashioned department store where the local community could buy everything from sugar, flour and tinned sardines to cloth, haberdashery, needles and watches.</p>
<p class="indented">By all accounts he was a fantastic employer with considerable entrepreneurial spirit, and when he and my grandmother eventually returned to the UK, they brought back files which documented everything Opa had done: the measurements of the fields, all the tasks, everything recorded in unbelievable detail.</p>
<p class="indented">I suppose what I took most from his story was the idea of working the land from scratch, respecting the food that it gives, the skills it supports and the livestock it nurtures. His enterprise was a good model: he created jobs, opened up new markets, and used trade to feed money directly back into rural communities, to help sustain and regenerate family livelihoods. In recognition he was awarded an MBE.</p>
<p class="indented">Add to Opa’s influence my father’s great love of Spain, which rubbed off on our whole family; my mother’s wonderful, healthy home cooking and her love of sharing it, often with crowds of people, which she inspired in all her children; my own childhood in Africa and Asia, which opened up my senses to a diversity of ingredients; and the seeds of Brindisa were all there.</p>
<p class="indented">Everything really began to crystallise when, after taking a degree in Spanish, Iberian and <a id="pg_8"/>Latin American Studies, I moved to Spain, where I taught English for three years and immersed myself totally in Spanish life. I was completely knocked out by the air-dried hams, sausages, cheeses, olives, anchovies and other foods, but above all, it was people’s intrinsic understanding of food that was so mind-blowing. In the markets every Spanish housewife would know which of the mounds of exquisitely coloured dried beans were the best, which fish were the freshest of the catch, or which tomatoes the sweetest, whereas at that time back in England, people were buying ingredients because a celebrity cook said so, or because a magazine told them it would change their life. It wasn’t part of the British culture to <em>know</em> and <em>feel</em> about food in the same way.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Spain on a Bantam 125</h4>
<p class="flush_left">I had always felt the call of Spain, perhaps because my father had a yearning to be there and immerse himself in the language, the food and culture. Spain, post-war, was a country full of mystery and wildness, recovering from the experience of its own gruesome civil war, which was little understood by the rest of the world, and my father was fascinated by it all.</p>
<p class="indented">Dad had learned to speak Spanish when, during his military service, he had found himself convalescing from polio in a military hospital in Kuala Lumpur and, to while away the time, had asked for one of those old yellow and blue <em>Teach Yourself Spanish</em> books. After he returned to the UK in 1953 and went to read law at Oxford, he hankered to visit Spain, so on his first vacation the following year he borrowed a Bantam 125cc motorbike from a student friend and, with a small grant from the Oxford Society and little else, like Laurie Lee in his famous book <em>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</em>, pointed the bike in the direction of San Sebastián.</p>
<p class="flush_left">Imagine: all the way to the Basque coast!</p>
<p class="indented">From there, in the space of a month, he took in Salamanca, Ávila, Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona and Ripoll, sleeping under the stars or in hay lofts and empty barns wherever he met generous farmers in hospitable villages, and occasionally managing to afford a basic <em>pensión</em>. On his next university vacation he travelled to Andalucía by train, and in his final summer he found himself a job in Galicia teaching a nine-year-old boy English. In three summers he had covered almost all the regions of mainland Spain. Dad’s stories of his adventures were full of the joy of discovering Spanish hospitality and companionship, the literature and the landscape, and his infectious enthusiasm rubbed off on the rest of the family. So it was probably inevitable that I and my brother, Mark, chose to study Spanish.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Food of the streets</h4>
<p class="flush_left">After military service my father joined the Colonial Service – which is how I came to be born in Malawi. When independence came and my parents returned to the UK – by now with three children in tow – he flirted with the idea of the Spanish wine trade, but in the end he chose to work for a multinational company in Nigeria and then Brunei, where I was brought up, travelling back and forth to convent boarding school in Essex from the age of nine.</p>
<p class="indented">Even at an early age I understood that you learn about people and culture as much through the way they shop for food and cook and eat, as through their houses and history. Food is a language that illustrates a place, people, seasons and values better than anything else I know. I can still recall the intoxicating concoction of sights, smells and colours in the market of Lagos in Nigeria: a heady mix of street food, ripe tropical fruit and drains. I would eat paw paws and mangoes among the noisy chatter and bartering, surrounded by women with beautiful, block-printed Adire cloth wrapped around their hips and heads. African cloth has a unique smell that I can still find in the fabric shops of Brixton.</p>
<p class="indented">I loved the sweet, dense loaves at the bread stall, and once I sneaked around the back to watch the enormous baker working an old tin bath of dough. The buckets of sweat were running off his big, black, muscley body into <a id="pg_9"/>the bath, and I thought half the bread that was baked from the dough must be made of him!</p>
<p class="indented">Once Dad was working in Brunei I couldn’t wait to leave drab school meals behind for the school holidays, which meant wok-cooking in the markets: pak choy and grilled langoustines, delicate chicken satay, beef rendang, or <em>char kway teow</em> – spicy wide, flat noodles, with prawns, chicken, bean shoots and chives, which we often ate out of newspaper on the go, and which, I later discovered, makes an excellent hangover breakfast!</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lunch on a rubbish dump</h4>
<p class="flush_left">One memory, from a few years later, really stands out, because it underlines for me the generosity of sharing food even in dire circumstances – something that underpins so many of the simple, sustaining dishes in this book, dishes that are born of the need to feed family and friends, even in hard times. As part of my university studies, my friend Annabel and I spent time at Lima’s Católica University, then travelled around Peru and Ecuador, discovering yet another world of food and flavour. On a memorable Palm Sunday we were invited to family lunch with cousins in ‘the country’ by a local woman called Isabel and her daughters, who all looked like Diana Ross. Isabel first befriended us after we bought single cigarettes from her kiosk in Rimac, a suburb of Lima which at that time was known as <em>‘un pueblo joven’</em>, a poetic way of describing a semi-slum.</p>
<p class="indented">We bumped along a dirt track, with stones bouncing through the holes in the floor of her old car, towards the beach and what looked like sand dunes stretching for miles, until we got closer and realised that they weren’t dunes, but mountains of rubbish. These were the city rubbish dumps and the cousins lived in two brick houses in the middle of them, making their living <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> style from selling whatever of value they could sift from each new batch. While the children were outside picking through the rubbish, looking for pieces of leather, metal, or whatever they could salvage, Annabel and I were given seats at a canvas-covered table, and lunch of rice, avocado and steak: only us; no one else ate. Over 30 years later I still remember that food vividly, because every mouthful was intertwined with the local shapes, sounds and smells and the touching embarrassment of this lovely family going hungry themselves, while they cooked, waited on and welcomed guests they had never met before.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Costa Brava to Barcelona</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Of all the places I have come to know in Spain, Catalunya is the most familiar and perhaps closest to my heart, since I lived there for three years and my brother lives there still. The land, the people I met and stayed with, and the places and producers I got to know, are all an integral part of why Brindisa happened in the first place.</p>
<p class="indented">The summer I finished my degree I had some time on my hands before starting a teaching course in Barcelona in the autumn, so I went with my parents for a holiday to the beautiful town of Begur on the Costa Brava. Because I spoke Spanish, I quickly made friends locally, and, though I had planned to move on and work as an au pair in Valencia, they said: ‘You can’t go – stay here!’ One of the friends was Pepa Salvador, who gave me a job in her restaurant, La Salsita, despite the fact that I was very green, and my previous job experience was limited to working in a toy factory and helping with the hop and fruit harvests near my parents’ home in Hampshire.</p>
<p class="indented">The dishes of the coast, with their natural emphasis on fish and seafood, tend to be more colourful than the typical sausage, bean and vegetable dishes of inland Catalunya, which taste delicious, but often look brown and dark; and Pepa always tried to make her dishes visually stunning. Favourites included her <em>gazpacho</em> and <em>suquet de peix</em> (the famous, glorious fish stew), along with <em>suquet de rascassa i congre</em> (made with potato, scorpion fish and crab). Hake would be served with bright parsley sauce, or monkfish would be pan-fried in butter with slices of apricot, roasted pine nuts and raisins. <a id="pg_10"/>There were stand-out meat dishes too, such as pork loin with prune sauce, and <em>conejo al ‘jas’</em>, a juicy rabbit stew sweetened with carrots and tomatoes (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec166">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">I started work at La Salsita at six every evening and finished at around two in the morning. My job was to hand-write the menus, prepare the starters, serve the puddings and make coffees. We had a crazy mix of culture and dialect in the kitchen. Pepa’s business partner, Marta Aramburu, was from Uruguay, and so we always had <em>matambre</em> on the menu, a Uruguayan dish of slices of beef, rolled up and stuffed with hearty local ingredients such as <em>chorizo</em>. There was an old lady who did the washing up and spoke in old Catalan, which at that time was almost unintelligible to me – and almost everyone else – and Jeti de Swart, who was the waitress and Catalan-Dutch. She and I shared lodgings in a little beach house. It was a memorable and hedonistic summer in this era of liberation after the Franco years, when good food, drink, freedom of expression and friendships without boundaries were all becoming central to life again and the people I knew were compellingly optimistic.</p>
<p class="indented">La Salsita also serviced a <em>chiringuito</em> (a little bar) on the beautiful Platja Fonda in Aiguablava, one of the wilder local beaches, which offered the usual snacks, such as <em>pan con tomate</em> (tomato bread), with ham, <em>chorizo</em> and cheese. The beach could only be reached by a long flight of steps down the cliff, so all the ingredients had to be taken around in a little speedboat by a wonderful, sadly late friend, Alex Veiga Sol, the dynamo of our group, who ran the <em>chiringuito</em> by day and helped in the restaurant at night.</p>
<p class="indented">At midnight at La Salsita the tables would ease off and we would serve ice creams and sorbets, drinks and coffees, usually to a bunch of our friends who would linger on in the bar’s beautiful little stone courtyard. When we closed up, there was no thought of going to sleep. Instead we would all head for the nightclubs until about five in the morning, stagger back down to our little lodge on the beach and finally sleep until midday. Then for myself and Jeti there would be a few hours in the sun and back up the hill to the restaurant again for work at six.</p>
<p class="indented">Sometimes after these crazy nights we would wind up breakfasting at Alex’s <em>masia</em> (farmhouse) in Pals, watching the sun come up, or we would gather there for long Sunday lunches in the sunshine, sometimes twenty of us around the table. In between courses someone would inevitably break into song, because Alex’s passion, other than the best food and wine, was serious flamenco music, and many of his friends were guitarists, singers and dancers.</p>
<p class="indented">Our impromptu get-togethers inspired him and his sister to set up a restaurant at the <em>masia</em>, where he built an outdoor terrace for musicians to play, while people danced. It was tough, though, to turn spontaneous good times into a business, and when Alex’s ill-health took over it all ended in 1986. But the community of friends still gathers in his memory every Thursday at the house of one of the gang. I joined them recently at Pepa’s home, where she prepared a nostalgic Salsita menu, which included her famous <em>conejo al ‘jas’</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec166">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Finally, though, I had to leave the beach and head to Barcelona, where I trained to teach English as a foreign language. Fortunately many of my coastal friends were returning to the city too, so I shared a flat with some of them in a part of the city called Tres Torres, where one of the closest of the friends, Alex Sardà, ran the Dos Torres bar with its triangular garden of palms, cacti and bright flowers. Alex knew Barcelona intimately and introduced me to amazing late-night places to eat, to guitar bars and tapas bars such as El Xampanyet in the narrow stone streets of the old town, where they served such wonderful anchovies, and on Sundays he and I would seek out hillside places overlooking the city where the cooking and eating took place outside under the tall trees. He was one of seven children and his mother, Rosa, was always ready with weekday lunch for any or all of them, their families and friends – including myself and my brother, Mark, on a regular basis. Any time that <a id="pg_11"/>you pitched up between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. there would always be food for you. I still visit her, and nothing has changed.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Cottonwool city</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Once I got my teaching qualification, I wanted to get out into the countryside. I was lucky in that one of my sister’s friends lived in the same village as the former politician and writer Matthew Parris, whose mother, Terry, along with a local lady, ran the Anglo-Català School in Manlleu, north of the town of Vic, in inland Catalunya, approaching the Pyrenees. Both Terry’s daughters, Debby and Belinda, were teachers there and expecting babies so they needed help at the school. When I arrived in Manlleu the whole family ‘adopted’ me. They were so kind, and I stayed at first with Debby and her husband Manel, a dairy farmer.</p>
<p class="indented">Manlleu sits in La Plana de Vic, an undulating plain that has a microclimate all of its own, and at certain times of the year it is enveloped in a mist so thick that Vic itself – the capital of the region – becomes like a cottonwool city, in which you can’t see anything as you walk around. My friends elsewhere in Spain all talked about this mist, known as <em>la boira</em> – and either they had seen old Sherlock Holmes films and assumed I was used to a permanent and worse fog in London, or they would throw up their hands and say: ‘<em>La boira, la boira!</em> How can you live with this?’ But it is <em>la boira</em> that is partly responsible for the special conditions in which it is possible to cure the very best <em>salchichón</em>, and while I was with Debby and Manel I learned how to make these traditional cured sausages.</p>
<p class="indented">Each year the family carried out the annual slaughtering of their pig in the winter months, and Manel’s mother, Isabel, had the task of butchering the carcass on the large cellar table for the making of the year’s supply of <em>salchichón de payés</em> (country sausages) and thin <em>fuets</em>. All hands were needed for the big task-list of chopping, piecing-up, mincing, salting and seasoning with black pepper, then stuffing the sausage casings and tying up the ends, while over the huge fire, a blackened pot, about 2 metres in diameter, bubbled away with the ingredients for the <em>morcilla</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Since I was the tallest, my job was to climb on to the high stool to hang the <em>salchichón</em> and <em>fuets</em> from the long nails which had been driven into the beams decades ago. I must have hung around eighty sausages that afternoon. How things have changed. Debby and Manel have since become vegetarians and animal rights activists campaigning against bullfighting. These days their only farm animals are rescued, and the house is free of milk and cheese as well as meat.</p>
<p class="indented">I couldn’t live with Debby and Manel for ever, so I moved out to the nearby village of Roda de Ter, to share a flat with one of my students, who was about the same age as me, Núria Mayans Pla. Although still so young, Núria had already been widowed for five years and still wore her widow’s black on Sundays. She was working as a seamstress, making clothes for designer shops, and had never held dinner parties before – at the time it wasn’t a very Spanish thing to do – but I had so many friends and family members visiting that she began to rediscover the fun-loving person she used to be, as we cooked and entertained constantly.</p>
<p class="indented">On Sundays we would go to the family house where her mother, María, would cook lunch for us, along with Núria’s sister Rosa, and brother Josep, who worked the nightshift in the local slaughterhouse. I was considered one of the family, and I have never forgotten the way María included me in these wonderful meals. There would be plates of cold grilled vegetables, dressed in vinegar and oil, then a big dish which would reflect the season. My favourites included chicken with wild mushrooms (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec161">here</a>) and duck with local wild pears (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec164">here</a>), which would take her two days to prepare.</p>
<p class="indented">In all I spent three years living and working in Catalunya, sharing meals and cooking with inspirational friends. Then, when my parents eventually returned to Hampshire, after living in Africa and Asia, I decided it was time to come <a id="pg_12"/>home too. So in 1986 I came back with a vague, idealistic idea of introducing people to the wonderful diversity of foods I had discovered on my travels, some of which had never been seen in Britain before, and telling the stories of the artisans who produced them.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Small beginnings</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In an odd twist of timing, I came home just as my brother, Mark, having spent a couple of years climbing the City ladder, decided that he wanted to jump off and set up his own business in Barcelona, which he was certain was the liveliest and fastest up-and-coming city in Europe.</p>
<p class="indented">For four decades, under General Franco, Spain had been cut off from trade with the rest of the world, but since he had died in 1975 there was a huge sense of possibility and, little by little, produce from abroad, such as basmati rice, began appearing in shops for the first time. Mark saw a great opportunity to introduce high-quality, traditional British foods such as Scottish salmon, Stilton cheese and English biscuits to good food shops in Barcelona. The licensing for the Stilton, in particular, was very complicated, as Spain was not yet a member of the EU. Mark might order 200 kilos of cheese and apply for a licence for it, and then the Spanish authorities would come back with permission for only 30 kilos, so I would help him sort through the bureaucracy – though not always successfully.</p>
<p class="indented">Franco had industrialised, standardised and compartmentalised the production of certain foods such as pork and wheat with a view to higher yields. But now an idealistic ‘neo-rural’ movement of sons and daughters of farmers, who had left the land and taken city jobs, were taking their commercial skills back to the countryside, setting up small businesses, growing organic vegetables, making raw milk cheeses and rediscovering local grape varieties for unusual wines. So after a year of importing British foods to Spain, Mark realised he could also send some of this produce to Britain, and we agreed to set up a company together. First he found a supplier of table Rioja, the first pallets of which I stored in the garage of my parents’ home in Hampshire, and I began selling the wine in London. Then he met one of the first Spanish suppliers to select traditional artisan cheeses from around Spain. He was able to gather together cheeses from six different regions, including Idiazábal, made with sheep’s milk in the Basque country; Menorcan Mahón, from cow’s milk; and a goat’s milk cheese from Trujillo, Extremadura. On a memorable night in London, Mark, my sister Michele and I devoured an entire box of these cheeses, along with the Spanish wine, and we were thrilled at the excellence of what we were tasting. But who would I sell these hitherto unknown cheeses to?</p>
<p class="indented">My first port of call was Products from Spain, then in Charlotte Street, a company which had been importing Spanish foods since 1950. I asked the sons of the founders, George and Robert López, if they would be interested in buying some artisan cheeses, since they only sold Manchegos and blended cheeses, and they said yes. My first order. So in 1989 I invested around £800 in cheese and my father helped me with the weighing for my first despatch. It was the widest range of Spanish cheese ever seen on British soil.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">A cheese in a tin</h4>
<p class="flush_left">My next order, the one that really crystallised in my mind what Brindisa should stand for, was my first raw sheep’s milk Castellano cheese, similar to a Manchego, but made in the north with a different milk, and matured in olive oil. I discovered it in among some bottles of Ribera del Duero wine on a stand at a trade fair in London. It was made by Ambrosio Molinos in Burgos, in the middle of Castilla y León. Ambro was a discerning cheese-maker and a ball of fun, who has become a lifelong friend.</p>
<p class="indented">Small-scale sheep farming was nothing new to me. Dad had always hankered after being a farmer and when we settled back in England my parents bought a house with four or five acres and started buying traditional breeds. So for 15–20 years we ate all our own lamb, <a id="pg_13"/>and occasionally supplied mutton to friends. The whole family was involved in the lambing and sometimes if it snowed, we would bottle-feed newborns next to the Aga in the kitchen if they caught a chill. The idea of making cheese from sheep’s milk, however, was considered quite an unusual thing in Britain. I am sure that when people first began buying Pecorino they were unaware that it was made with milk from sheep, and not cows. So it was of great interest to me to realise that in most areas of Spain and the islands, traditional breeds were valued as much for their milk and cheese as for their meat.</p>
<p class="indented">From the moment I first visited Ambro, his family and his herd of 100 per cent Churra sheep (see <a href="chapter_003.html#box6">here</a>) at his farmhouse, with its beautiful barns and carved feeding troughs – such workmanship – I was bowled over. The Churra sheep are the prettiest creatures: white, with black-tipped ears, eyes and hooves, and I felt so at home among the animals and in the maturing cave, with its eating space and chimney. Ambro would grill unweaned Churra lamb chops over vine prunings and pour red wine. Right from the start, I realised that one of the principles of Brindisa must be to do its utmost to help keep such small rural businesses alive and thriving.</p>
<p class="indented">Ambro’s cheese was stunning – creamy with hints of toasted caramel and almond, with a long elegant finish – and it came in a simple but beautiful tin which specified that it was made with the milk of Churra sheep. Even now people remember it; it took on an almost mythical status because it was such a novelty at a time when virtually no one had seen Spanish raw milk cheese, let alone one from a specific breed of sheep – and in a tin, too. Buying that cheese was one of those strokes of luck that can put you on the map. I knew it was something extraordinary, and with the arrogance of youth I boldly rang up some of the innovative, creative chefs who were making their mark at the time, such as Alastair Little, Simon Hopkinson at Bibendum, and Rowley Leigh at Kensington Place, to ask if they would be interested in tasting it, and they all bought it.</p>
<p class="indented">I really didn’t have any money but I was quite fearless. My parents, who had been our first customers, emotional backers and common-sense advisers, continued to offer storage and office help, but the boxes of cheese were now way too big for a domestic fridge, and what I needed was some proper, free warehousing. So I asked the local milkman if he had any space in his fridge that I could use for a few months, while I worked out what to do next. Amazingly, he obliged. It could only be a short-term solution, of course, because all my clients were in London, but then came my next stroke of luck.</p>
<p class="indented">Flicking through a magazine I spotted a photograph of a chap in a smart Burberry suit in his London loft. The caption read, ‘Michael Day, director of the Huge Cheese Company, London’. Michael was very well connected and supplied most of the restaurants in London, so I called him up, told him my story and said, ‘Would you look after my cheese?’ He said yes, and so I had my first base in London. I used to go out at 6.30 in the morning with his van and visit the chefs in their kitchens, telling them about my cheeses.</p>
<p class="indented">By now I was sleeping and working in the living room of the flat that I shared with my two sisters in Maida Vale, and taking orders from chefs like Mark Hix at 2 a.m. but I still had no proper commercial base.</p>
<p class="indented">Fortunately, two friends, Vicky Fuller and Robert Lyle, who had an office in Tite Street, SW3, offered to field calls and type letters. My brother, Mark, continued to invest in our big idea, but I needed a working partner, and by chance I bumped into Emma Ranson, another old friend who had been born in the same hospital as me in Malawi. We had known each other as teenagers in West Africa, and again at university. Emma spoke Spanish and had just returned to London after working in Madrid. She was game to join me, and together we worked like Trojans, badgering chefs and shops all over the country, and commuting between London and Spain.</p>
<p class="indented">From cheese we began importing peppers, anchovies, vinegars and olive oils, cured meats, sausages and <em>turrón</em> from producers whose foods <a id="pg_14"/>we tasted at fairs and markets, or spotted in good food shops in Madrid and Barcelona, forging relationships with farmers, cheese-makers and artisans which remain firm to this day.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Space-hopping</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Back in London, Emma and I constantly moved from space to space, as our needs grew. First we found a corner of a warehouse in Bermondsey (just a stairwell and a fridge, really), then a funny little triangular-shaped building in Crouch End that one customer said was just like a wedge of cheese. We shared it with a French food importer, and the snails that he housed in nets would often escape and leave glistening trails all over our beautiful bottles of estate olive oil. There was no heating and it was so cold in winter we wrapped ourselves in blankets and wore thick socks and woolly hats. At lunchtime the guys in what was Florians restaurant opposite would sit us down next to heaters and thaw us out with big bowls of soup. Then we moved to Bankside, and finally to Park Street in Borough Market. I was still selling mainly to chefs such as Steve Carter and Richard Corrigan, who were working with Stephen Bull at his bistro in Blandford Street and his restaurant, Fulham Road, respectively. They were among the first to start serving <em>chorizo</em> and carving cured Serrano hams in front of customers and, as the fashion grew for chefs to source really good olive oils, Richard, especially, was something of a pioneer. He and Steve loved the Arbequina oil from Tarragona, with its tropical banana taste.</p>
<p class="indented">Next I targeted R. García &amp; Sons, on Portobello Road, where Rafael García told me he was only interested in Spanish staples, and that the artisan and farmhouse speciality products I was offering – goat’s cheese in olive oil, fruit wheels, estate oils, etc. – were far too expensive, and his customers would never buy them. It took two years of me visiting the shop every few months, begging him to give in and allow me to feature some of the produce in his window on a strictly sale or return basis, before he relented. Within days he rang me up asking for more, and became one of our best customers.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="pg14a">Borough beginnings</h4>
<p class="flush_left">It is hard to imagine now, when Borough Market and its surrounding shops and restaurants are a bustling, colourful, eclectic magnet for food lovers, but in 1992, when we moved into a warehouse around the corner in Park Street, this was a desolate area, a forgotten island in a big city, with tumbleweed and many empty cages inside the market gates. So much so that I felt unsafe walking to the tube station at night.</p>
<p class="indented">Gradually, though, things began to change, and on Saturdays we opened up the doors of the warehouse to friends, family and anyone who had shown interest in our foods over the years, to come and taste. Scott Boden, who during the nineties was Brindisa’s finance director and business partner, set up a barbecue outside, grilling mini <em>chorizos</em> and spearing them with cocktail sticks for people to dip into bowls of <em>Romesco</em> sauce, and before long the word had spread and people were travelling across London, attracted by an event that only a few people knew about, and going home with whole cheeses, trays of jarred <em>sofrito</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_316">here</a>) and 5-litre cans of olive oil.</p>
<p class="indented">Next, along with Neal’s Yard Dairy and Turnips vegetables, we took an extra retail and storage space in the market itself, and in 1998 the food writer Henrietta Green held her first Food Lovers’ Fair there, the success of which convinced the trustees to regenerate the place. It was all new and very exciting. Our cage was right in the centre of the market, and as well as cheese, cured meats, tinned fish and oils, we began selling homemade strings of dried <em>ñora</em> and <em>guindilla</em> peppers, and bouquet garnis known as <em>farcellets</em> – these were things unseen in a British market, and turned out to be so popular that friends all knuckled down and made hundreds of them by hand. You could visit any one of their homes and find dried peppers and <em>farcellet</em> strings hanging everywhere.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_15"/>From the stall we opened the Borough Market shop on a corner of the market; we also moved our wholesale and logistics operation to a warehouse in Balham and, finally, launched the tapas bars and restaurants – the opening of the first of which was a mammoth moment for all of us. After over 15 years of importing the best Spanish food we could find, I wanted a showcase for it. I had dreamed of bringing these wonderful hams, sausages, cheeses, olives and conserved fish together on plates for customers to relax and enjoy, along with authentic Spanish cooking and a glass of fine Spanish sherry or wine. At first I was fearful of moving from warehouse to table, but our long-term friend, Mark Hix, came to see the space in Southwark Street, and at once we visualised a tapas bar there. He put me in touch with his then-colleague at Caprice Holdings, Ratnesh Bagdai, who had years of experience in setting up restaurants, and with him on board, I found the courage to press on.</p>
<p class="indented">And so suddenly in October 2004 it all came together. I had a team of chefs, led by José Pizarro, who was then cooking at the Eyre Brothers restaurant and was a long-time customer of Brindisa. He was looking for a new chapter in his life and from day one we were full. Since then we have opened more restaurants and bars, even in Barcelona, and from the beginning I loved the energy of them, and the feeling that even though it might be a big red London bus that passes the windows, people can enjoy the true food of Spain in its proper context.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="pg_15a">The never-ending journey</h4>
<p class="flush_left">All of us at Brindisa are still constantly learning. You can never sit back and think you have got there. There is always more to discover or improve, and the excitement of both is intoxicating. My own journey has been a series of light-bulb moments, of discovering that, in the hands of skilled and passionate producers, ingredients we are so familiar with, like anchovies or olives, are capable of being elevated to new levels of excellence and sometimes quite extraordinary heights. And I never stop being struck by the deep culture of respecting food and tasting and identifying flavours that is ingrained in families who have passed their extraordinary skills down through the generations. The last time I visited our honey supplier, Ferran Alemany, and his family in the hills of Lleida outside Barcelona, some of the young children of the honey packers arrived home from school. When they saw that a new batch of the great drums of honey had arrived, they were so excited they ran over, threw off the lids, peered in and tasted some from each barrel with little spoons, saying: ‘Hey, the orange blossom is tasting good.’ It was stunning to realise that they could recognise immediately which honey was which, and I was reminded how close people in the Spanish countryside, particularly, are to the source of their food, when sometimes our supermarket culture can make us feel quite distant and removed.</p>
<p class="indented">I like to think that by supporting such dedicated smallholders and artisans we play a small part in helping to preserve traditions, jobs, rural environments and ecosystems that might otherwise be lost or abandoned.</p>
<p class="indented">Recently my husband, Rupert, and I went to Zamora, to see a cheese-maker friend, Sarah Groves-Raines, who is married to a Basque wine-maker, Patxi, and makes her cheese in the smallest of dairies near the Portuguese border. The tiny place where they live is almost like an African village, with the houses camouflaged under the rock, and the heat in summer is almost as intense. As we arrived an old woman in a heavy skirt and wellington boots was sweeping her yard with a branch of broom shrub; and there was a little store with a formica counter and a wood-burning stove where you could warm yourself when the temperature dropped in winter, and buy everything from matches to sardines. The scene reminded me of my grandpa Opa’s stories and how the seeds of the Brindisa journey were sown all those years ago. Of course, I never saw Opa’s store in Kota Kota, but this was just the way I had always imagined it to be.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box1"><a id="pg_16"/>A Way of Eating</h2>
<p class="flush_left">I think there is often a misconception about what Spanish food is all about. People have an image of dishes full of vivid, hot colours and fiery spices. But this isn’t the everyday reality in Spain, any more than flamenco dancing.</p>
<p class="indented">In fact, many traditional recipes can seem very plain to the modern multicultural British palate, and the use of seasoning, spicing and decoration tends to be quite restrained, mainly because the emphasis is on using full-flavoured ingredients, from local vegetables to seafood, wild game, new season pulses, and hams and sausages made from specific breeds, and letting them stand up for themselves without the need for the condiments we use so freely in the UK.</p>
<p class="indented">Spain is evolving, like most European countries, and supermarkets have infiltrated the towns and cities, but I don’t believe that its food and producer markets will ever be replaced. Where supermarkets exist in smaller towns or villages, especially, they frequently sell local breads and regional specialities and often avoid selling meat, so as not to compete with the independent butchers.</p>
<p class="indented">Changing times and work patterns have inevitably impinged on traditional meals, as they have all over Europe. Years ago when I first lived in Spain I would have laughed at the idea of people snacking on the run, and I still find it odd to see a British-style sliced white sandwich encased in a plastic triangle in a Spanish shop – but neither would I have imagined British families holding tapas parties. That said, even though there is no rule book, in general the Spanish still have their own way and pace of eating, since the working day typically starts at 8 a.m. (much earlier in farming communities), stops at 2 p.m. for a two-hour lunch, and finishes at around 7–8 p.m.</p>
<p class="indented">This means that <em>desayuno</em> (breakfast) and/or the mid-morning snack are still very important meals in Spain, whether they involve coffee or hot chocolate, <em>churros</em> or pastries, or a hearty sustaining farm-worker’s meal. I’ve eaten silky bacon from acorn-fed Ibérico pigs in the forests of the Dehesa, tucked into chunks of country bread, cured meats and red wine with smallholders on perishingly cold hilltops, and eaten porridge made from <em>gofio</em> (toasted grain flour) with cheese-makers in the sunshine of the Canary Islands. On our numerous visits to the olive mills of Núñez de Prado and Olivar de la Luna in Córdoba in Andalucía, we have been treated to <a id="pg_17"/>the typical mid-morning feast of warm farmhouse bread from the wood-burning oven, sun-ripened tomatoes and oranges dressed with freshly pressed olive oil and honey, cracked green Manzanilla olives, eggs from the local farm, ham, cheese, oven-baked salt cod and sauté potatoes. And in Catalunya I have breakfasted with dairy farmers on runny, creamy yogurts made from goat’s and sheep’s milk, and sheep’s milk junket (<em>cuajada de leche de oveja</em>), similar to Italian <em>panna cotta</em>, but made with whole milk set with rennet and eaten with fresh fruit and honey, sometimes pine nuts.</p>
<p class="indented">Then there is often the pre-lunch <em>vermut</em> or <em>aperitivo</em>, a well established indulgence which involves popping into a local bar for a vermouth and perhaps a tin of cockles, before the main meal of the day.</p>
<p class="indented">However, the meal that is almost sacrosanct in Spain is lunch. I would be devastated if the Spanish lost their desire to lunch in a spectacularly slow and generous way. In England this indulgence is usually relegated to Sundays. But in Spain, on any day of the week, it is so enjoyable to feel no guilt about taking more than an hour’s break from work and to allow yourself to relax over good food and conversation. It might be a simple meal in a local restaurant – often a plate of vegetables or lentils, followed by grilled fish or meat: steaks or chops and a salad – or a visit to the family home where a mother or grandmother would have lunch prepared. In small towns and villages, especially, the whole week’s lunches are often mapped out in a time-honoured pattern. Monday might be <em>croquetas</em> or <em>canelones</em> using up leftovers from the big Sunday meal, then there might be a stew day, often involving beans or pulses; a rice day, a fresh fish day, a meat day, and a salt cod day, depending on the locality and markets.</p>
<p class="indented">Since during the week the evening meal is usually just a light supper, children coming home from school love and need <em>merienda</em> (tea) at 5–6 p.m. It could be a wedge of bread, dredged with olive oil and a sprinkling of sugar, María biscuits with a slice of <em>membrillo</em> (quince paste) inside, or a square of cake. Many of the recipes that are popular for <em>desayuno can</em> also double up as <em>merienda</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Of course, the aspect of Spanish eating and drinking that has truly caught the imagination all over the world is the tradition of tapas. In the towns and cities, workers typically drop into a bar for a beer or sherry and a series of small snacks at the end of the working day. Then they will go home for something simple like soup, salad – perhaps with tinned fish or seafood – or small fresh fish or cuts of meat popped on the <em>plancha</em> (hotplate or grill). Or mothers and grandmothers might make big <em>tortillas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#reca5">here</a>), <em>empanadas</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_400">here</a>) or savoury <em>coques</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>) so that everyone can help themselves to a slice.</p>
<p class="indented">Sundays are the days when families and friends gather together for big meals: usually a series of tapa-like small plates, followed by shared casseroles, rice dishes or roasted meats. Sometimes it will be a family effort of home cooking, at other times everyone <a id="pg_18"/>will gather in a favourite restaurant. In the villages in mountainous regions, families will often have converted ancient caves into weekend and holiday dens where they set up tables and chairs, wine stores and grills for barbecuing.</p>
<p class="center_head">ROOTS AND REGIONS</p>
<p class="flush_left">Many of the ingredients we consider to be cornerstones of Spanish eating were originally introduced by the people who settled there over the centuries. The Romans, who arrived in 218 BC, brought olives and grapes; and the Moors, who invaded in 711 AD, introduced almonds, saffron and other spices and herbs, such as cumin and coriander.</p>
<p class="indented">Religion played its part, too. In 1492, when the Jewish people were expelled from Spain and the Moorish people faced persecution, one of the ways that Christians demonstrated their faith was by the conspicuous consumption of pork, a food culture that has embedded itself ever since. And Catholicism gave rise to Lenten recipes involving much salted fish and other suitable foods during days of abstinence, as well as celebratory Easter dishes.</p>
<p class="indented">The sixteenth century saw another major sea change in the flavours and colours of Spanish food when tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate and, importantly, peppers – which eventually came to be dried and ground to make <em>pimentón</em> (paprika) – were first brought back by explorers from the New World.</p>
<p class="indented">Some of the foods and recipes from the north of Spain have a noticeably French or Italian feel to them, as at one time Catalunya stretched into France as well as Italy, so inevitably there were cross-overs of influences, techniques and ingredients; so, for example, while the cooking of the Mediterranean usually involves olive oil, in the north you often see the use of local butter and cream.</p>
<p class="indented">Closer to current times, people still have vivid memories of the hunger and poverty after the civil war, and many recipes that make good use of basic ingredients, such as bread, potatoes, milk, olive oil and garlic, date from this time when nothing could be wasted.</p>
<p class="indented">Before improved transport and refrigeration enabled ingredients to be distributed all around the country, typical dishes were necessarily local, developed around whatever was able to be grown, farmed or fished – and those traditions still shape the cooking in each region, city, town, village and family.</p>
<p class="indented">The great Catalan journalist and writer Josep Pla observed: <em>‘La cocina de un país es su paisaje puesto en la cazuela’ –</em> ‘the cooking of a country is its own landscape put into a cooking pot’ – and the regional foods and dishes of Spain still reflect a whole gamut of different landscapes and microclimates from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, from hot, dry and dusty to rich, green and fertile, from sun-drenched beach to cold and remote mountain, cut with icy rivers, sometimes so remote that the night sky is absolutely pure, with no unnatural light.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_19"/>And in some regions, such as Castilla y León, the biggest in Spain, there is something of everything, which is why it has been one of the greatest sources of ingredients for Brindisa. It is hard to imagine anything that you can’t find in this vast area, which covers the wild forest of Palencia, verdant valleys such as that of the Tiétar river; open country; and mountains, including parts of the Picos de Europa range, the Sierra de Francia and the Sierra de Gredos, where eagles, owls, black vultures and peregrine falcons fly and the climate is harsh: biting winds and cold temperatures for about eight months of the year and baking, suffocating heat for the rest of the time. But the drying winds and high altitude have always been perfect for the slow curing of meats – though changing weather patterns are beginning to confuse things, making it harder to cure foods naturally.</p>
<p class="indented">Since the region is also blessed with seasonal rain, the rich pastures, where goats and sheep and cows graze, help to create the best milk for some famous cheeses such as the goat’s milk Monte Enebro, sheep’s milk Zamorano and Castellano, and blue cow’s milk Valdeón. The meadowland, watered by springs and dried by the winds, is also perfect for growing legumes, particularly the maroony-coppery-coloured <em>alubia de Ibeas</em>, the typical bean used for <em>olla podrida</em>, a hearty stew originally made with any meat that could be had. And in El Bierzo, the area to the south of the Picos and bordering Galicia, with its high altitude and fertile river valleys, the red peppers and vine-ripened tomatoes are exceptionally concentrated in flavour and colour.</p>
<p class="center_head">THE ISLANDS</p>
<p class="flush_left">Both the Balearic and Canary Islands lend a different perspective to Spanish food and since as a family we visit them often, the foods of the islands feature throughout this book.</p>
<p class="indented">Mallorca, in particular, is an island of huge contrasts between luxurious converted farmhouses owned by wealthy people from Madrid and abroad, and smallholdings where a few fruit trees or beehives might be kept to make jam or honey, or small groves of fig, almond, chestnut or olive trees can be harvested for local sale and subsistence. Often small farms will be high up in the mountains in stunning but rough terrain, where families live so remotely that they struggle even to get enough water without bringing it in by mule. Most jobs are done manually and sometimes old traditional stones are still used for milling corn. Visiting producers in these unspoilt pockets in the warm sun, with the eagles circling above, is always magical, but then I am not bound to make a living in such challenging circumstances.</p>
<p class="indented">Menorca, home of Mahón or Maó cheese (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_530">here</a>), is the island I know best, and I have included many of my favourite local recipes: the <em>ensaimadas</em> I love to have with a mid-morning coffee (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec10">here</a>), <em>banyetas</em> made with <em>sobrasada (</em>spreadable spicy <a id="pg_20"/>sausage similar to the Italian <em>nduja</em>), <em>flaons (</em>cheese puffs, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_25">here</a>), <em>pastissets</em> (crumbly biscuits, see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec5">here</a>), the simplest of tomato soups, <em>oliaigua</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec59">here</a>), and <em>perol de cordero</em>: oven-baked lamb with tomatoes and potatoes (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec176">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">By contrast, even though they belong to Spain, the Canary Islands are an intoxicating mix of Africa, the Americas and Europe. La Palma is home to the biggest cheese in all of Spain, Palmero (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p531a">here</a>), as well as to the salt pans of Fuencaliente on the southernmost tip of the island, where the salt from the sea is evaporated through a series of ponds, and finally piled into pyramids of beautiful pure crystals ready to be sold to shops throughout the islands. In the brightly coloured food markets there are stalls full of avocados and papayas, mangoes, <em>duraznos</em> (peaches) and <em>cherimoya</em>, dried peppers and dried herbs and plants that are used for teas and herbal remedies. <em>Cola de caballo</em> (horsetail) – a long, hairy plant that pre-dates the dinosaurs – is one of the best known for making into a tea or infusion, said to help ease stomach ache. At the fish stalls the evocative names on the labels next to the varieties are often completely different from those you find on the mainland. <em>Lenguado sahariano</em>, for example, means Saharan sole –the idea of a desert fish might sound odd, but since the Canaries are closer to Africa than Spain, it makes some kind of sense!</p>
<p class="indented">Canarian bananas were the first to be exported to Britain, which is why the quay and warehouse where they unloaded at West India Docks was given the name Canary Wharf. There are a number of varieties that are grown, and the smoothies and juices that you can make from them are irresistible. Green bananas (<em>polines</em>) are often boiled, mixed with potato and then eaten with green coriander <em>mojo</em> (the famous pesto-like sauce made with herbs, spices and sometimes hot peppers, pounded together with oil, see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>); or they might be fried to eat with the local dish of <em>Arroz cubano</em>: rice, tomato <em>sofrito</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_318">here</a>) and fried egg.</p>
<p class="indented">Although a typical Canarian meal will inevitably include a red or green <em>mojo,</em> usually served with fish, potatoes or grilled cheese, in the winter parts of the island can be very cold, and rural work needs sustaining food. So as well as sunshine food there are also hearty soups such as <em>potaje de berros,</em> made with beans, potatoes and watercress (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#rec79">here</a>), and stews such as <em>rancho canario</em>. Typically they will be made with vegetables like <em>choclos</em> (maize cobs), peppers and cabbage, perhaps with some salted pork ribs added and enriched with starchy vegetables, such as potato, pumpkin, <em>bubango</em> (a pale green, spotted courgette) and green bananas, or bulked out with pieces of <em>fideo</em> (pasta, see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_366">here</a>). And whereas in mainland Spain such big meals are usually eaten at lunchtime, in the Canaries people often eat these slowly-cooked one-pot dishes for dinner to warm them before going to bed.</p>
<p class="center_head"><a id="pg_21"/>RECIPE COLLECTING</p>
<p class="flush_left">The recipe-gathering for this book has frequently provoked passionate arguments between friends, cooks and chefs from different regions, towns and villages, all insisting their own version of a particular dish is the one and only, which just underlines how much, even today, Spanish cooking is influenced by both history and geography.</p>
<p class="indented">Many of the recipes have been given to me by long-standing friends who have cooked them for their families all their lives but in most cases never written them down before. Others are dishes introduced by our Spanish chefs to the Brindisa restaurants and tapas bars in London.</p>
<p class="indented">As for me, I am not a chef, but an avid cook who has grown up with the love of feeding and gathering family and friends around the table that my mother inspired in all her children, and during the writing of this book our kitchen at home has been full of Spanish friends and chefs, helping to test and tweak favourite recipes – some new, some old.</p>
<p class="indented">Brindisa is all about the best produce that Spain can offer, and ultimately that is what I wanted the recipes to celebrate, so I have also included a handful of recipes from the close circle of leading non-Spanish chefs, like Sam and Samantha Clark, Fergus Henderson, Mark Hix, Peter Gordon and Jeremy Lee, who have supported me since the crazy early days, accompanying me and my colleagues on memorable trips to Spanish farms, vineyards and olive groves, and becoming firm bean, <em>chorizo</em>, Ibérico ham or anchovy ‘friends’.</p>
<p class="indented">They haven’t necessarily used these ingredients in Spanish-style dishes on their menus, but they have chosen to showcase them in their own way, not only because they love the quality and flavour, but, in common with everyone at Brindisa, they have a great respect for the care, skills and heritage that have gone into the production of beautiful food.</p>
