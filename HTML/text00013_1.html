<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">There Were Ten of Us</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">I am very fortunate to have grown up in a home full of brothers and sisters. To understand who I am, you must understand a little about them, too, and our lives together on the farm in Floodwood.</p>
<p>I was two years old when my brother Leonard, the second oldest in our family, was born. By the time he was a year old or so, my parents recognized that there was something wrong. Deafness runs in the Luoma family, but they didn’t want to believe Leonard might be affected. My dad had a brother named Walter who was born deaf and died early in life from tuberculosis. They didn’t want to believe that this trait would be inherited. I recall my parents taking Leonard to every doctor they could, and it was a doctor in Rush City who finally gave them the news. Leonard was born deaf with weak (or no) audio nerves. I remember Mummy weeping. He appeared to be a perfect baby with strong bones and “all ten toes” as the old saying goes.</p>
<p>As a baby and as a toddler, Leonard noticed everything and was superactive and fearless. When he was about four years old, our father started to build a new barn for the farm. The barn stood thirty-two feet high and forty feet long with the typical rounded roof. Near the top of the roof during construction, there was a long and narrow plank that ran from the front to the back of the barn’s frame.</p>
<p>To the horror of my parents, Leonard climbed fearlessly to that narrow plank and ran back and forth from the front to the back again and again, some thirty feet off the ground. You couldn’t yell at him because, of course, he couldn’t hear. I don’t know how they got him down to the ground; all I know is that my six-year-old heart was beating like a drum. Finally, they did get him down, but there was no way to explain the danger to him and the fright we all felt.</p>
<p>Two years later Leonard was enrolled in the Minnesota School for the Deaf in Faribault, now called the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf. It was a sad and happy situation for the family. We so looked forward to Christmas and summer holidays, anxious to see how much language he had learned. It was always a sad day when Leonard had to return to school, but we were thankful and happy that he had such a great opportunity to learn communication skills along with the traditional curriculum that we had in school. This was in the days before American Sign Language was used. At home, we learned to spell-sign words, so we could communicate with Leonard in a very rudimentary but convenient manner. Today, we all would have learned ASL.</p>

<p>Faribault was known for producing blue cheese. The students at the Minnesota School for the Deaf were taken on regular field trips to the blue cheese caves and obviously were treated to samples. These samples developed a taste for blue cheese in most of the students, including my brother. I especially remember his delight when we’d buy a square of Treasure Cave blue cheese. Later, the company that bought the caves moved their production to a facility in another state and closed down Treasure Cave in the Faribault area in the 1990s. To this day, one of the best gifts I can give Leonard is a hunk of blue cheese.</p>
<p>My sister Marion came next. She and I did a lot together growing up and were always the best of friends—from peeling “popple” (our name for poplar trees) in the woods, to caring for the chickens, to barn work. We made up stories to entertain each other while picking berries, weeding the garden, and doing chores. Even today, Marion and I have a special “sisterly” connection. We taught each other to be terrible shoppers. On our trips to Duluth, we lusted over items in Woolworth’s, Kresge’s, or the Ben Franklin stores where we could buy a little vial of Blue Waltz Perfume for twelve cents or a little fake watch with hands that were permanently fixed so that the face read ten minutes to the hour or twenty minutes after. We would look at each other and ask the question, “Can I live without it?” Of course, the answer was always yes, so we didn’t spend any of our hard-earned money to buy anything. Even today, we follow the “Can I live without it?” rule.</p>
<p>Lillian, my parents’ fourth child, was born on the day that I created the Salt Cake. Lil was always popular in high school, an athlete, cheerleader, adventurer—she was all around a lot of fun to be with. Her cooking adventures were not as serious as mine, but what I learned from her early experiences has given me a chuckle. Directions for a cake recipe said to cream the butter and sugar together. Noticing there was no cream in the ingredient list, Lil was puzzled, so she just dumped in some cream. I never did find out how that cake turned out.</p>
<p>When Lil was born, I had begged my parents to name her Betty Mae after a beautiful dark-haired doll I had gotten as a Christmas present that came prenamed “Betty Mae.” My doll had dark curly hair and a pretty face. Mummy and Isä promised that the “next” baby girl would be called Betty Mae.</p>
<p>Betty Mae has since been questioned as to why a “northern girl” like her has such a “southern” name. But so it was. Betty Mae was born eighteen months after Lillian. She is the only one of us six girls who has dark hair! Betty Mae and Lillian were pals all through school; both of them were cheerleaders and shared friendships. Betty Mae went on to become a home economist.</p>
<p>Eugene, the sixth one to join the family, was the second son of the family after a string of girls, and I am sure his arrival delighted my father. He now had another son to whom he could pass on the resourcefulness required for country living. Eugene was quick and wily and learned his lessons well. He and Rudy (the next in line) would figure out all kinds of things, from ways to trap fish in the St. Louis River to outsmarting the game warden when they trapped weasels in the wintertime.</p>
<p>Eugene, always thinking, has invented so many things we can’t keep up with him. One of his most successful gadgets is the Zip-It, a simple little tool you can use to unclog drains. When his long-haired daughter (all girls seem to have long hair these days) was at home, clogged drains were a regularity. So Eugene took a plastic strip (the kind that are used to secure boxes during shipping), cut notches on the sides, and used that to pull the stuff out of the drain.</p>
<p>Next came my brother Rudy—and seemingly always with mischief on their minds, Rudy and his older brother Eugene were inseparable. Only eighteen months apart, they did everything together, even after both of them grew up and got married. In this photo they look like lonely little kids—however, they probably had devised some plan and were about to head out to do it. It was Eugene with the ideas, and Rudy who would carry them to fruition.</p>
<p>Years later, Alvin, the fourth boy, was born into the family. Eugene and Rudy were admonished by Mummy and Isä to always include Alvin in their activities. Considering him a nuisance, one day they put Alvin into a gunnysack and hung him from a birch tree in the woods. Later, at the dinner table, Mummy noticed that Alvin was missing. “Where is Alvin?”</p>
<p>Rudy and Eugene guiltily glanced at each other, and one of them said, “Oh, we forgot! We hung him in a gunnysack in a tree!”</p>

<p>When I asked Alvin how he managed to spend all that time hung in a tree, he replied that he just fell asleep, crying, but knew somebody would come and get him. The mosquitoes, he recalls, were terrible as they bit right through the burlap gunnysack.</p>
<p>Even as grown-ups, Rudy and Eugene traveled together, worked on home projects together, devised schemes together, planned their hunting shack, and spent time there thinking of projects, solving problems, and telling jokes. After Eugene developed muscular dystrophy, Rudy became his right-hand man. He was always there ready to help out.</p>
<p>Of the ten of us, Rudy, the seventh child, was the most unlikely one to leave us first. He was only sixty-three, the tallest, and probably the fittest of us all. He was hit by a massive heart attack on a sunny December morning while drinking coffee and reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>The last time they were together, Rudy was laid out on a gurney in the ER and Eugene, devastated, sat in his motorized scooter. What was he going to do now? “Rudy’s gone” was a hard reality to comprehend for us all. We loved him so much.</p>
<p>My sister Nancy was born with a motherly instinct. When I was in college and dating Dick, Nancy was in fourth or fifth grade and Mummy was pregnant again, embarrassingly for the tenth time. Nancy had been sworn to secrecy, as Mom was hesitant to announce to the world that there would be one more Luoma on the planet.</p>
<p>The complication was that Isä had had his tubes tied and was supposed to be sterile. This threw my parents into a terrible quandary. Isä accused Mummy of sleeping with the milkman, the veterinarian, almost every man who came to the farm. She was devastated, as she had never done such a thing. She insisted that he was the father of her unborn child.</p>
<p>Isä later went to his doctor to get himself checked out—and sure enough, the tubes had come untied!</p>
<p>This all happened the year Dick and I became engaged. Nancy was so excited about the prospect of a new baby in the house, she could hardly contain herself.</p>
<p>As news in small towns tends to spread, eventually, Nancy’s friend on the school bus asked her, “Is your mother going to have another baby?”</p>
<p>Nancy, wanting to tell her friend that there would, indeed, be a baby in the house, blurted out, “No, but Peachie is!”</p>
<p>Of course, this news was bound to spread even more quickly. When Mummy heard about it, she got on the party line (our country telephones at the time were all hooked to a single party line) and called her sister Helen, talking about the new baby she was about to have. She could hear the <i>click, click, click</i>
 as the neighbors picked up their phones. The news was out—and I was off the hook!</p>
<p>Alvin, like his brothers, is a guy with many talents. A horticulturist at heart, he spent his working days for Minnesota Power as a lineman. When I was a student at the university and home for a weekend, Alvin (in grade school at the time) would wake me up enthusiastically on Saturday morning to show me plants he had grown. They were long, skinny things that in the winter, with a dearth of sunshine, grew leggy and thin. But he was so excited to show me his latest.</p>
<p>He took the harassment from his older brothers in stride. When they accused him of being really, really dumb, they asked him smartly, “How much is one and one?” Alvin answered, “Two!”</p>
<p>“How much is two and two?”</p>
<p>With eyes smartly closed, pursed lips, he answered, “Two and two is easy!”</p>
<p>One summer, Eugene and Rudy decided they would try to raise enough money to buy a motorbike by doing chores. Of course, with Alvin being so young, he was not capable of doing as many things as the older boys, but he did contribute what bits he could and their goal was eventually accomplished. They bought a used motorbike.</p>
<p>The older brothers, having raised most of the money for the bike, told Alvin, “The only thing you earned was the air in the tires!”</p>
<p>Alvin’s answer, “Well, then, I’ll take my air back!”</p>
<p>Dawn, the infamous number ten in the family, wasn’t going to be left behind! A straight A student and an accomplished flutist, she went on to the University of Minnesota to become an architect. Her designs are creative—in fact, she designed the home we now live in. But that’s not all. She tried her hand at retail children’s clothing, then gave up the idea. Dawn is now the family expert on the Minnesota Twins, and she follows baseball religiously!</p>
<p>It turned out that Dawn and our daughter, Cathy, were separated in age by only two years. So, Dawn was “Auntie Dawn” to Cathy—a position that seemed hilarious as they made mud pies together.</p>
