<h2 class="h2b">GIGOT DE LOTTE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Baked Monkfish</em></h3>
<p class="normall0">Gigot <em>usually refers to a leg of lamb. This is a little Provençal twist, as the garlic-studded tapering tail end of the monkfish resembles a</em> gigot.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1 large piece of monkfish, about 1kg (2lb 4oz)<br/>
8 small artichokes, trimmed<br/>
16 small potatoes, scrubbed<br/>
12 shallots, peeled<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Juice of 2 lemons<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) olive oil<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
1 small bunch fresh thyme, leaves picked from the stalks<br/>
150ml (5fl oz) dry white wine<br/>
1 small dried chilli<br/>
4 strips Dried Orange Zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>)<br/>
1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Boil the artichokes, potatoes and shallots in plenty of salted water with the juice of one of the lemons for 20 minutes until almost cooked. Strain them, toss with a third of the olive oil, salt and pepper, then put them in the bottom of an ovenproof dish.</p>
<p class="normala">Make a dozen or so little incisions in the monkfish. Slice the garlic into slivers and push them into the holes. Put the monkfish into the dish with the artichokes, potatoes and shallots, pour over a little more olive oil and sprinkle with some of the thyme, salt and pepper. Roast for 35 minutes, then check with a skewer at the thickest part of the fish. If the tip comes out warm, remove the monkfish from the dish. Keep it warm, and put the vegetables back in the oven for 5–10 minutes until well browned.</p>
<p class="normala">Pick the garlic out of the fish, chop it and mix with the white wine, juice of the second lemon, dried chilli and orange zest. Reduce all of this by half. Stir in the remaining olive oil and thyme and the flat-leaf parsley, and spoon over the monkfish. To serve, slice both fillets of monkfish away from the bone and cut each in half in turn. Serve with the vegetables.</p>
