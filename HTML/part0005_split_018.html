			<p class="rec-intro">This is real cuisine bourgeoise – rich, opulent and satisfying. The cooking method ensures a moist and flavoursome bird and this recipe also works well with guinea fowl.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 2</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1½ tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ onion, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">40g long-grain rice</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">80ml chicken stock (see <a href="part0010_split_002.html#chicken-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g cooked foie gras, diced (optional)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g shelled pistachios</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp game jus (see <a href="part0010_split_014.html#game-jus" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g cooked truffles, diced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 hen pheasant</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">thin slices of pork back fat </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 tbsp Malmsey Madeira wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">First prepare a rice pilaf for the stuffing. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Place an ovenproof pan on the hob, melt ½ tablespoon of the butter and sweat the onion until softened. Add the rice and stir to coat all the grains in butter, then pour in the chicken stock. Bring to the boil, then transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove and set aside for 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="body">When the rice is cool, gently mix in the foie gras, then add the pistachios, game jus and diced truffles. Season well. </p>
			<p class="body">Remove the wishbone from the pheasant and stuff the bird with the rice mixture, which should fill the cavity. Truss the bird to seal the neck and rear. Cover the bird with the slices of back fat and tie them securely in place. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6.</p>
			<p class="body">Heat the oil and remaining butter in a casserole dish and, when hot and foaming, add the bird and colour it on all sides. Place the dish in the oven with the bird breast-side up. After 10 minutes, add a spoonful of Madeira and put the lid on the casserole. Repeat this until the bird has been cooking for 40 minutes, then take the dish out of the oven, remove the fat and set the bird aside to rest. </p>
			<p class="body">Add the cream to the casserole dish and any juices that have run from the bird, then season. Put the dish on the hob, bring the liquid to the boil and reduce to a sauce consistency, then pass through a fine sieve. Spoon out the stuffing and carve the bird. Serve with the sauce, stuffing and some seasonal vegetables, such as braised cabbage.</p>
