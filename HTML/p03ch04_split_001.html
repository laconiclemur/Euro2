<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Soups were the comfort everyday foods of the peasants and shepherds.</span> Those based on fried bread and garlic sustained the shepherds of central Spain. The cold gazpachos of Andalusia were made by laborers in the fields. Spain’s fish soups are said to be fishermen’s soups, although I doubt that fishermen put in the wine and brandy that go in most of them today. You will find these in the chapter on fish, because they are substantial and can be served as the main meal.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Potajes,</span> hearty vegetable soups with beans, chickpeas, and lentils, are from the Castilian interior and the mountains of northern Spain. They were everyday meals that turned into festive stews when <span class="italic">jamón,</span> chorizo, <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (blood sausage), pig’s ears and trotters, and spareribs were added. You will find some of these celebratory dishes in the chapter on bean and chickpea stews.</p>
<p class="summary">Delicate broths resulting from a <span class="italic">cocido,</span> a pot of boiled meats (page 498), with added vermicelli or rice, bits of ham or chicken, and chopped hard-boiled eggs, are popular everywhere. And cream of vegetable soups are found in parts of Spain where they have luscious vegetable gardens.</p>
