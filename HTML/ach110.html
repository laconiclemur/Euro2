<p class="author1"><span class="txit">broccoli di rape alla tropiano</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Many of the recipes in this book call for reserving some of the cooking water before draining vegetables or pasta. This flavorful water is used in place of tap water to achieve the right consistency in a finished dish. If you refrigerate or freeze cooked broccoli rabe, store it in an airtight container filled with cooking water.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 pounds broccoli rabe (about 2 bunches)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Snap off the flowered stems and leaves of the broccoli rabe, discarding the tough stems. Coarsely chop the remaining stems, leaving the buds whole, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli rabe and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the cooking water to the broccoli rabe and set aside. (This may be done several hours in advance.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Warm the olive oil in a sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook to flavor the oil but do not brown the garlic, about 2 minutes. Add the broccoli rabe along with 2 tablespoons of the cooking water. (More water may be added, 2 tablespoons at a time, if the broccoli rabe begins to stick to the pan.) Cover and simmer to flavor the broccoli rabe with the garlic, about 3 minutes.</p>
