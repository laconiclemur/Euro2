    <p class="textbox_title">MAN CAN LIVE BY BREAD ALONE</p>

    <p class="textbox"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>ravel though Portugal, and you’ll be dazzled, perhaps dizzied, by the incredible number of dishes in which bread plays a major role. Originally used as a way to stretch meals, bread now remains a part of the cuisine due to flavor. Here’s a short list of the most popular bread-based dishes you’re likely to find on menus and in homes:</p>

    <p class="textbox1"><em>Açorda</em> is a bread soup that can range from loose to dense, depending on where you’re dining. It’s made by stirring water, broth, or stock into cubed day-old bread. It can be studded with seafood, infused with herbs such as cilantro, or enriched with eggs.</p>

    <p class="textbox1"><em>Ensopado</em> is a stew—meat, fish, or shellfish—in which all the luscious juices are sopped up by slices of fresh, toasted, or deep-fried bread lining the bottom of the serving dish.</p>

    <p class="textbox1"><em>Sopa seca,</em> or dry soup, is a homey preparation favored in the north. A deep baking dish is filled with bits of the previous days’ meals, from meats to vegetables, covered with thick slabs of bread, and doused with stock. Then the whole thing is slid into a piping-hot oven to dry slightly.</p>

    <p class="textbox1"><em>Migas</em> (literally, “bread crumbs”) is the driest of the bunch. It’s made by beating meat drippings, and sometimes leafy greens such as spinach, into crumbled bread. The mixture is then tossed in a hot skillet to form a crust and served as a side dish.</p>

It’s one of the dishes most copied in Portuguese restaurants today. For the classic, and a few of the variations, see below.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his recipe has been in the Costa side of my family, in one form or another, since at least the beginning of the last century, when my maternal grandmother began making it after she emigrated from the Azores to the States in 1920 as an eighteen-year-old newlywed. Beans are a traditional side dish in Portugal, especially for pork and beef. Whenever I visit my parents, I place an order for these well in advance, because no one makes them better than Momma Leite. But we ignore the side-dish rule and eat them by the bowlful for Sunday supper.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">W</span>hen I was a kid, our family gatherings were so unwieldy they were held in my uncle José’s garage or under my dad’s grape arbor, where we’d be lined up at long, mismatched tables. My aunts would crouch down beside me, the seams of their dresses screaming over the expanse of their thighs, as they held up bowls, platters, and dishes for my perusal. That’s power for a six-year-old. When our family got even larger, we had to rent halls to hold all of us. Somewhere along the way, an aunt, or cousin, or cousin of a cousin brought this dish. I’m eternally grateful to whoever it was.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">M</span>y friend restaurateur Miguel Júdice gave me this recipe. Well, not exactly. It was part of a vastly complicated, utterly delicious dish from one of his restaurants that I knew would be impossible to cook at home. So I deconstructed it, tossed out some elements that were definitely not Portuguese, and kept the rest. What I like about this, besides its being a snap to make, is that it’s a poster child for Portugal’s new generation of cooks and cooking: it honors the country but looks beyond its borders. Olives and Carolino rice, both grown in Portugal, are two traditional staples that play nicely against the Italian cheeses.</p>
