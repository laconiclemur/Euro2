<h1 class="chapter">tiziana’s stuffed aubergines</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is Giancarlo’s cousin Tiziana’s recipe from Buonconvento in Tuscany. She makes stuffed aubergines (eggplant) quickly for a standby lunch or starter. They keep well in the fridge so you can prepare them the day before and cook them just before serving.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>3–4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 aubergines (eggplant), sliced into 1 cm- (½ in-) thick lengths</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250 g (9 oz/1 cup) ricotta, drained</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of chives, finely chopped (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of mint leaves, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>10 g (½ oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 tablespoons <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">Homemade Tomato Sauce</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split23.html#page_41">Fresh Tomato Passata</a></b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Brush a little of the oil over an oven tray and lay the aubergine slices in a single layer on it. Brush the tops of the slices sparingly with the remaining olive oil. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and bake for 20–25 minutes until soft and lightly golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, mix the rest of the ingredients (except the tomato sauce) together in a bowl to form the stuffing. Season to taste and, when the baked aubergines are just warm to the touch, put a tablespoon of the stuffing onto the thin end of each aubergine slice. Roll them up and place them seam side down in a lasagne dish. Spoon a little tomato sauce over each roll and bake for 20 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling hot and just starting to brown. Serve warm with a green salad.</p>
