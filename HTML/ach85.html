<p class="author1"><span class="txit">lasagne vérde</span></p>
<p class="noindent">During our family stay in Italy, we found ourselves in Bologna—the only city, it seemed, where there was an orthodontist who could replace my sister’s retainer. During this day trip we ate lunch at a restaurant that specialized in <span class="txit">lasagne vérde.</span> I can only say that to this day, it remains one of the finest meals I have ever eaten. Soon my mother had perfected the recipe, and this dish tops the request list when she prepares family birthday dinners.</p>
<p class="indent">This dish can be made using <a class="nounder" href="ach54.html#page_114">Homemade Pasta</a>, but it is also very tasty made with commercial fresh pasta or dried pasta. Either way I recommend using a combination of both egg, or standard yellow, noodles and spinach, or green, noodles for a colorful and flavorful dish.</p>
<p class="indentb">If you are using homemade noodles, leave them the width they are when they come out of the pasta machine and then trim them to fit the length of the pan. This way you will need only two of these wider noodles to complete each layer of lasagna. The directions in this recipe are based on using commercial pasta that is narrower, so each layer will require three noodles. The lasagna may be prepared, cooled completely, and refrigerated for two days before baking and serving. It may also be frozen and should be defrosted before baking.</p>
