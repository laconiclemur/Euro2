<h2 class="h2b" id="page170">PISTOU</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Basil Purée</em></h3>
<p class="normal1"><em>The basil purée familiarly known as</em> pesto <em>is generally associated with Italy, but</em> pistou <em>has been known and used in Provence for just as long as it has been anywhere in Italy. A wonderful old friend in the village, who used to have an Italian neighbour with whom she constantly argued, spent an afternoon convincing me of this. She also reminded me that she’d been around for a long time, and so knew a thing or two</em>…</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>The blanching of the basil may come as a real surprise. This will be the first and only time I’ll give you a recipe where a tiny bit of flavour is sacrificed, but the vibrant colour more than makes up for it. Once again, unless you need the exercise I cannot see any reason for using a mortar and pestle instead of a food processor. This basic recipe makes enough to use for one recipe of</em> Soupe au Pistou <em>(<a href="chapter_003e.html#page78">see here</a>), or to sauce grilled fish or lamb for four; with a few additions, it can be used to dress pasta or risotto (<a href="#pasta">see here</a>). I think it is always worth making double or more so you’re never without a burst of Provence</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">MAKES ABOUT 100g (3½ oz)</span><br/>
50g (1¾ oz) fresh basil leaves<br/>
1 garlic clove, peeled<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Blanch the basil leaves in boiling water for no more than 30 seconds, then immediately plunge into cold water. Drain very well.</p>
<p class="normala">Put all the ingredients into the food processor and blend on pulse until smooth. Store in a small airtight jar in the fridge for no longer than a week, covered with a layer of olive oil to prevent discoloration.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps"><a id="pasta"/>ON DRESSING PASTA OR RISOTTO</span></p>
<p class="normala">If you add 30g (1¼oz) pine nuts to the basic recipe above, plus a little extra oil and 50g (1¾oz) freshly grated Parmesan, you will have enough sauce for pasta for four. Add about 20g (¾oz) more Parmesan to that and you have enough for risotto for four.</p>
