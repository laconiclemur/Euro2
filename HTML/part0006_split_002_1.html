			<p class="rec-intro">This is the traditional way to cook and serve calf’s head and is still a best seller in the big bustling brasseries you find throughout France. The head is cooked in a solution called a blanc which is prepared with a tablespoon of flour per litre of water, plus salt and some vinegar or lemon juice. The blanc should then be covered with a layer of fat, such as beef or veal suet, to seal the pot and prevent oxidation and therefore discoloration of the item being cooked. This is an aficionado’s way of eating calf’s head – very filling and not for the faint-hearted! It’s sometimes made with the brain poached separately and added to the dish on serving. It should be served with boiled vegetables and potatoes all in one big deep bowl, with sauce ravigote.</p>

			<p class="body">Make sure all the hair has been removed from the head, then put it in a huge pot and cover with cold water. Quickly bring the water to the boil, then drain and rinse clean. Rub the head with a cut lemon half. </p>
			<p class="body">Make the blanc by pouring cold water through a sieve into the pot and adding a tablespoon of flour per litre. Add salt (5 grams per litre), 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, the onion and the bouquet garni. Bring this to the boil, then leave to cool slightly. Add the calf’s head, then bring to a gentle simmer and cover with a layer of beef or veal suet. You can use a wet tea towel instead of the suet if need be. </p>
			<p class="body">Cook the head for about 2 hours or until tender, then leave to cool. Drain, peel the tongue and cut the tongue and head meat into big chunks about 2–3cm thick – use everything, even the ears!</p>
			<p class="body">Make the sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Cook the vegetables separately in salted water, then cut the carrots and leeks into large pieces. </p>
			<p class="body">Serve the meat piping hot with the vegetables and the ravigote sauce. If necessary, reheat the meat and the vegetables in a little of the blanc.</p>
