<p class="author1"><span class="txit">caponata</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the dish that really launched the collaboration between Gianni and my parents on this book. I remember Gianni at my wedding to my wife, Kate, commenting over and over how delicious the <span class="txit">caponata</span> was. He kept asking me if my mother had in fact made it, and I assured him that she had. That confirmed his admiration for my mother’s cooking, and I watched as he returned to the hors d’oeuvre table for another helping at least half a dozen times. As a result of the mutual admiration between Gianni and my parents, what started out as a Tucci family cookbook has grown by at least half with Gianni’s input.</p>
<p class="indentb">Caponata should taste <span class="txit">agro dolce,</span> which means slightly sweet and slightly sour. It makes a delicious accompaniment to grilled meat or fish and may be prepared up to one week in advance. Cover and store in the refrigerator, then return to room temperature or reheat before serving.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 medium-size eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 5 cups)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups onions, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup celery, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 28-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon capers, drained, rinsed, and dried</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon pine nuts</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon sugar, plus 2 teaspoons</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat.

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Stir in the onions and cook until wilted, about 4 minutes. Stir in the celery and then the tomatoes, crushing them <a id="page_11"/>with your hands or the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Simmer over medium-low heat until the tomatoes begin to sweeten but the celery is still crisp, about 15 minutes. Stir in the capers and pine nuts. Transfer this vegetable mixture to the casserole with the eggplant.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a small saucepan set over low heat, stir the sugar and vinegar. Warm until the sugar dissolves. Stir into the eggplant mixture in the casserole. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Cover the casserole and simmer over low heat, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes are cooked and the vegetables are tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the caponata warm or at room temperature.</p>
