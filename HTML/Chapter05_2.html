<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><small>EATBALLS WERE THE</small> first thing I ever learned how to cook. When I was five or six years old, my grandmother taught me how to roll the meatballs that she’d sear in a pan with oil she’d seasoned with garlic. Every single time she made them, I’d steal a few from the hot pan as they were cooking and eat them, and she’d yell, “MICHAEL!!!!” because they were still raw in the middle.</p>
<p class="indent">I didn’t care because the meat was so fresh and the meatballs were so good, it was impossible not to eat them, especially when the whole house smelled like garlic. Sometimes I’d roll the meatballs while she cooked them, and other times she’d let me hold the wooden spatula and move them around in the pan so they’d get nice and brown while she rolled the next ones to go into the oil. It was a team effort.</p>
<p class="indent">It took me a long time to realize this, but my grandmother is the reason I cook today. Her encouragement and expectations in the kitchen from such a young age taught me a solid work ethic. She instilled in me a sense of pride—that feeding people isn’t just something you should do . . . it’s something you should <i>want</i> to do. And, most importantly, she showed me how just a few simple ingredients can turn out amazing food that makes people happy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_104"/>The recipes in this chapter are inspired by my family—my grandmother, my Aunt Connie, my mom. Unlike the rest of the book’s recipes, which are meant to be served in small portions, these recipes can feed four to six people, family-style. If you have kids, I hope you’ll bring them into the kitchen and let them help with some of these recipes, and encourage them to appreciate cooking. You never know how it might one day positively impact their life like it did mine.</p>

<p class="noindent">Instead of using the pizza dough recipe for a calzone, you could always make your own pizza! Just place a pizza stone in the oven before preheating it. Preheat the oven to 475°F, and once it reaches 475°F, wait another ten minutes before putting the pizza in. This ensures the pizza stone is hot all the way through, which is really important.</p>
<p class="indent">Roll out the dough into an 8–10-inch circle on a semolina flour-or cornmeal-dusted surface to prevent sticking. Top with whatever you like, and bake for 10–12 minutes, until the crust is nice and golden brown.</p>
<p class="indent">I’m a big fan of experimenting with different pizza toppings and trying what you like best. Still, here are a few combinations you might want to try, based on recipes from this book:</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Veal piccata was a popular dish in my hometown when I was growing up, but I like my veal dishes to have a little more depth and breadth of flavor and texture. This lightly breaded and pan-fried veal is light and creamy, and the basil and lemon brighten the asparagus salad.</i></p>

<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>1.</b></span> Set up a breading station using three separate shallow bowls: one for flour, the second for eggs. In the third bowl, whisk together the panko, Parmigiano-Reggiano, oregano, parsley, lemon zest, salt, and ground chili flakes.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>2.</b></span> Dredge the veal in the flour, then egg, then bread crumb mixture and set aside.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> Heat the olive oil and garlic in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Sauté the garlic for 12–15 minutes, until golden brown.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> While the garlic is sautéing, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Set a bowl of ice water to the side. Add a tablespoon or two of kosher salt to the boiling water and blanch the asparagus for 2 minutes. Shock the spears in ice water until chilled. Completely dry with paper towels or clean dishtowels. Slice on the bias into bite-size pieces.</p>
<p class="step"><a id="page_136"/><span class="color"><b>5.</b></span> In a small mixing bowl, whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, honey, salt, and white pepper. Toss with the asparagus and tomatoes, until nicely coated.</p>
