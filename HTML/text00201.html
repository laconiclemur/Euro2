 APPLE, FIG, BRIE &amp; HONEY STRUDEL</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0001916">
<em>My brother-in-law’s favourite dessert in the whole wide world is strudel, which he usually buys frozen from the supermarket freezer aisle. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with ready-made desserts, I enjoy making him my own versions to see if I can create one that he likes even better. Granted, I don’t make the pastry in this recipe, but I’m also a firm believer that there is absolutely nothing wrong with a bit of shop-bought pastry – it’s how you plait it here that really makes the difference.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0001926">
<span class="blue">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7 and place a baking tray in the oven.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001927">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 The pastry should come rolled, with baking paper already around it. Unravel the pastry and lay it on the work surface, on its paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001928">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Make two light scoring marks along the pastry to divide the piece lengthways into three equal strips (don’t actually cut through, as you need it all to stay joined together), then make a mark 5cm in from both ends of each score mark. Cut from the 5cm mark as shown <a href="text00202.html#nad01101">here</a>
 , to remove a small section of pastry from each corner, which will leave a small central rectangular flap at each end.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001929">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Starting from the 5cm mark, make parallel angled cuts in the two outside strips of pastry, 2.5cm apart, leaving the central strip untouched and ready to fill.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001930">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Chill the prepared pastry in the fridge for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001931">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Lay the apple on top of the chilled pastry base, down the central strip. Now add the figs, followed by the Brie. Drizzle the honey all over.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001932">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Fold over the rectangular flap of pastry at one end. Then alternate the pastry strips over the filling until you reach the end, and finish by folding over the second rectangular flap.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001933">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Brush the pastry with beaten egg and sprinkle with the sugar.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001934">
<span class="blue">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Take the hot baking tray out of the oven and place the pastry, still on its baking paper, on the tray. Bake for 25–30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001935">
<span class="blue">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the tray. Dust with a little icing sugar to finish.</p>
