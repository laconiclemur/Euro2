<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Every region has its own version of</span> cocido. <span class="italic">It is the most basic one-dish meal of Spain, served as two or three courses—the broth, or</span> caldo, <span class="italic">being the first, with added vermicelli or rice, followed by the vegetables, sometimes served as a separate course, and the meats. Although it’s likened to the French</span> pot-au-feu <span class="italic">and the Italian</span> bollito misto, <span class="italic">it is heavy with its own history and emotional connections. It is said to have evolved from the Jewish Sabbath dish</span> adafina <span class="italic">(see page 29), and that pork was added in the early period of the Inquisition. One of the best versions of</span> cocido <span class="italic">is the much-loved Catalan</span> escudella i carn d’olla, <span class="italic">which includes</span> pelotas<span class="italic">—large meatballs added to the broth. The Madrid</span> cocido, <span class="italic">made with the local chickpeas, is the most famous. If you search for</span> cocidito madrileño <span class="italic">on the Internet, you can find comedy acts about it and hear a popular song from the fifties that translates into something like this: “Don’t talk to me about Roman banquets, about the menu at the Plaza in New York, or about pheasant, foie gras, or lobster . . . my sustenance and my pleasure are the touch that a loving woman gives to the</span> cocidito madrileño<span class="italic">.”</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">When the Congressional Club in Washington published their first international cookbook in the early twentieth century, they included a recipe for</span> cocido<span class="italic">, signed by the Spanish king Alfonso XIII. The recipe was from the head chef of the queen’s kitchen, Candido Collar. In restaurants in Madrid,</span> cocido <span class="italic">is on the menu on Wednesdays. At home, a simple version can be cooked any day of the week (paella or</span> canelones <span class="italic">are eaten on Sundays), while a grand version is prepared for festive occasions. Leftovers are eaten for several days; typical dishes made with them are</span> croquetas <span class="italic">(page 166) and a hash called</span> ropa vieja <span class="italic">(literally, old clothes).</span></p>
<p class="summary">Cocido <span class="italic">sounds very complex—it is an event—but it is not difficult, just a matter of many things boiling at the same time in several large pots.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound beef, knuckle or shin</p>
<p class="qun">2 marrow bones (beef, veal, or ham)</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound slab bacon or fresh pork belly, in one piece</p>
<p class="qun">4 chicken thighs</p>
<p class="qun">1¾ cups dried chickpeas, soaked (see Soaking Beans, page 487)</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium onion, stuck with 3 cloves</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">3 carrots</p>
<p class="qun">8 new potatoes, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound green beans (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">2 celery stalks</p>
<p class="qun">3 turnips, halved (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound green or Savoy cabbage, cut into quarters</p>
<p class="qun">7 ounces semi-cured chorizo</p>
<p class="qun">7 ounces <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (Spanish blood sausage), preferably the type with onions</p>
<p class="qun">½ to ¾ cup vermicelli, broken into small pieces</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">2 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">OPTIONAL FOR SERVING</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 small baguette, cut into slices and toasted (for the bone marrow)</p>
<p class="qun">Tomato Sauce (page 145)</p>
<p class="qun">Extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">A choice of pickles, such as gherkins, small onions, and <span class="italic">guindillas</span> (mild green chiles pickled in vinegar)</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the beef, marrow bones, bacon or pork belly, and chicken thighs into a very large pot, and add enough water to cover by about 1½ inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a few minutes before removing the scum that has formed on the surface. Add the drained chickpeas and the onion and cook for 2 to 3 hours, until the meats are very tender, adding salt to taste after the first hour or so—you will need a good amount. Skim off the scum that comes to the surface occasionally and keep adding enough water to keep the meats well covered. You want plenty of broth to serve as soup at the end.</p>
<p class="summary">Half an hour before you are ready to serve, cook the vegetables—the carrots, potatoes, green beans, if using, celery, turnips, if using, and cabbage—in a large pot of boiling salted water for about 20 minutes, until tender. Drain, and pour the cooking water over the meat to add to the broth.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, cook the chorizo in simmering salted water for 10 minutes, then add the <span class="italic">morcilla</span> and simmer very gently for another 10 minutes (be careful—the <span class="italic">morcilla</span> will fall apart if you cook it too long); drain.</p>
<p class="summary">To serve the broth as the first course, strain at least 2 quarts of the broth—reserving the rest to keep the meats moist—into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, add the broken vermicelli, season to taste, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the vermicelli is soft. Serve the broth and vermicelli.</p>
<p class="summary">Then reheat the chickpeas, meats, and sausages in the remaining broth, and transfer them to a deep platter. Cut the meats into pieces and the sausages into thick slices, and arrange on the platter.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, reheat the vegetables, except the cabbage, and arrange on another platter. Reheat the cabbage in the oil, with the whole garlic cloves to give it flavor, and add to the platter.</p>
<p class="summary">You can serve the vegetables as a course on their own before the meats and chickpeas, or lay everything out on the table and let people help themselves. If you like, serve the marrow from the bones on toasted slices of baguette. Put the warmed tomato sauce in a bowl, and put a bottle of extra virgin olive oil and plates of pickles on the table for people to help themselves.</p>
