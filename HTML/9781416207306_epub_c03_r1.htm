<p class="nonindent">Fritto misto is a traditional tapas or appetizer comprised of a selection of deep-fried meats, fish, and vegetables. This recipe is a combination of deep-fried calamari, whitebait, and shrimp, with a interesting crunch of zucchini for good measure.</p>
<p class="hanging01">about 4 cups inexpensive olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup squid rings</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup whitebait or smelts</p>
<p class="hanging">8 large raw shrimp, peeled, tail shells left on</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. white pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small zucchini, cut into thin rounds</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 lemons, cut into wedges, for serving</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 300°F. Line a large baking pan with plenty of paper towels.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the olive oil into a large saucepan or deep-fat fryer and heat to 375°F. To test the temperature, add a cube of bread to the pan. At 375°F, it will brown in 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="extract">Season the seafood lightly with salt. Mix together the salt, pepper, and flour. Toss the seafood and zucchini, a few pieces at a time, in the seasoned flour and deep-fry, in batches, for 1 minute until crisp and lightly golden. Use a slotted spoon to lift onto the paper-lined pan to drain. Keep warm in the oven while you cook the rest. Serve hot with the lemon wedges.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This popular way of serving shrimp in Spain should arrive at the table <em>pil-pileando</em>, which means the fragrant scarlet oil should be bubbling and spluttering as the dish is set down. If you can’t find king prawns, royal red shrimp are a good substitute.</p>
<p class="hanging01">12 raw medium king prawns, peeled and deveined</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1–inch piece dried red chile, seeded</p>
<p class="hanging">small pinch paprika</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the prawns in a bowl, sprinkle with the salt, and toss. Let stand 15 minutes and then pat dry.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the oil in a medium-sized pan over high heat. Add the garlic and dried chile and stir. When the garlic becomes golden, add the prawns and stir until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the paprika and parsley for the last 30 seconds of cooking. Transfer to a serving dish with the oil and serve with bread to dunk.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Salted cod has been produced in countries around the Atlantic for over 500 years. Once soaked and rehydrated, it has a delightfully subtle and surprisingly unsalty flavor. These days, with fishing stocks declining, cod is often replaced by more sustainable fish such as pollock.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the aïoli</p>
<p class="hanging">2 organic free-range egg yolks</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch salt</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup canola oil</p>
<p class="hanging">20 strands saffron, soaked in 1 tbsp. boiling water</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the fritters</p>
<p class="hanging">9 oz. salt cod</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup mashed floury potatoes (such as russet)</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. milk or cream</p>
<p class="hanging">3 scallions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="hanging">3 free-range eggs, separated</p>
<p class="hanging">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">vegetable oil for frying</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the saffron aioli, place the 2 egg yolks in a bowl and add salt, garlic, and lemon juice. Whisk to combine. Dribble in the oil, as slowly as you possibly can, whisking continuously (an electric mixer makes this much easier). Continue to whisk until both oils are incorporated. You should end up with a thick, unctuous, garlicky mayonnaise. Stir in the soaked saffron, including the water that the strands were steeped in. This can be kept, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</p>
<p class="extract">Soak the salt cod in cold water in the refrigerator 12–24 hours in advance, changing the water halfway through. Drain the water, rinse the salt cod, then place it in a pan, cover with fresh water, and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and leave for 5 minutes. Remove the fish <a id="page75"/>from the pan. Peel off the skin and flake the fish, removing any tiny bones. Add the mashed potatoes, milk, scallions, parsley, egg yolks, and salt to taste. Mix well. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and fold into the mixture. Heat a saucepan a third full of oil until a bit of bread sizzles and browns in a minute. Add the salt cod mixture in tablespoonfuls and fry until brown all over. Drain for 2 minutes on paper towels, then serve with the aïoli on the side.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This recipe encapsulates the simplicity of rustic Spanish cooking. The mingling flavors of the marinade combine beautifully with the sweet succulent prawns, while charred edges from the barbecue or griddle give the slightest of crunches and a heady smoked aroma. You can substitute jumbo shrimp, but the king prawns or royal red shrimp look much more authentic.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 king prawns, heads off, deveined, but shells on</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. smoked paprika</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the prawns in a bowl with the salt, garlic, paprika, olive oil, and lemon zest. Mix, then let marinate for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat a griddle pan or barbecue grill on high until it begins to smoke. Lay the prawns on the pan or grill and cook for 2–3 minutes on each side until charred on the outside but nice and opaque in the middle. Sprinkle with the lemon juice in the last minute of cooking. Transfer to a serving dish and eat with your fingers.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Rosemary and oily fish are a marriage made in heaven! Make sure you get your fish merchant to butterfly the sardines, which means the center bone is removed, leaving a boneless piece of fish. As a result, these lovely crisp little fishes can be served whole on rustic toast to be eaten with ease and pleasure.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 sprigs fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">4 slices sourdough bread</p>
<p class="hanging">extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">8 fresh sardines, butterflied</p>
<p class="nonindent">Remove the leaves from the rosemary sprigs and chop them very finely. Mix with the salt and then pound in a mortar and pestle until the salt turns a little green from the rosemary oil. Set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat a dry griddle pan on high heat until it is smoking. Griddle the slices of bread until slightly charred on both sides. Lay the slices on 4 plates and drizzle each one with a little oil. Season the sardines with half the rosemary salt, then add them to the dry griddle, skin-side down, and cook for 1–2 minutes per side. Remove and lay 2 sardines on each piece of bread and sprinkle with the rest of the rosemary salt to serve.</p>

<p class="nonindent">It is important in this recipe that the pan is exceptionally hot so the squid is quickly cooked to tender perfection. Squid must always be cooked very fast over high heat or slowly over a long period, otherwise the result is a chewy, rubberlike disaster.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 large squid (about 1/2 lb.), membrane and sac removed</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">zest of 1 orange</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. hot smoked paprika</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Open up the squid by cutting along the side seam. Wash and dry thoroughly. Very gently, with the tip of a sharp knife, score the squid in a crisscross pattern. Cut into 4 pieces. Place the squid in a bowl with the salt, garlic, orange zest, paprika, and olive oil. Let marinate for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat a griddle over a high heat until it is smoking, and then lay the pieces of squid on the griddle. (I like to weight them down to stop them from curling up, using something heavy like another pan.) Cook for 1–2 minutes on each side. Cut into 2 1/2–inch diamonds and place on a serving plate.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Clams and Spanish chorizo make an exceptionally good combination. The smoky meatiness of the sausage brings an interesting dimension to the seafood. I recommend serving this in a big tapas dish, with a few chunks of crusty bread to mop up the delicious spicy juices at the end.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 lb. small clams (I like cherrystone clams)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 (3–oz.) piece semidry Spanish chorizo, chopped into small cubes</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 red chile, finely chopped</p>
<p class="nonindent">Scrub the clams in cold water and dispose of any broken ones. Heat the oil in a lidded pan. Add the chorizo and fry for 3 minutes or until the chorizo starts to turn golden. Add the garlic and chile, and then the washed clams. Cook for about 3 minutes with the lid on. When all the clams are open, serve immediately in a tapas dish.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This unusual dish of sweet scallops accompanied by the deep iron flavor of morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) and crisped sage leaves is quite spectacular.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tbsp. (1/8 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">a few leaves of fresh sage</p>
<p class="hanging">4 large diver scallops</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 (3–oz.) Spanish blood sausages (such as morcilla), each cut into 4 pieces</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place a pan over high heat and add the butter. When it starts to foam, add the sage leaves and scallops. Let the scallops caramelize, so don’t move them for 1–2 minutes, then flip them over and cook on the other side. If the sage starts to scorch before the scallops have cooked, remove from the pan. Remove the scallops once they have turned golden and are caramelized on both sides but are still opaque in the center.</p>
<p class="extract">When the scallops have been removed, add the sausages to the pan. Fry for 1–2 minutes or until they have blackened and crisped on the outside but are still soft in the center. Serve the scallops, sausages, and sage together in a serving dish.</p>

<p class="hanging01">1/4 cup good olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">6 oz. chorizo, cut into thin slices</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 large onion, finely diced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 red bell pepper, diced</p>
<p class="hanging">2 large tomatoes, seeded and diced</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch dried red pepper flakes</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup paella rice (such as Goya brand)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. smoked paprika</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cups chicken stock heated with 1/4 tsp. saffron strands</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">8 chicken thighs, each chopped in half</p>
<p class="hanging">8 raw small clams, cleaned</p>

<p class="hanging">6 raw jumbo shrimp in shells</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cups (1 lb.) raw squid, cleaned and sliced</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat half the olive oil in a paella dish or heavy saucepan. Add the chorizo and fry until crisp. Add the garlic, onion, and pepper, and heat until softened. Add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and rice. Stir until all the grains of rice are nicely coated and glossy. Add the paprika and wine, and when it is bubbling, pour in the hot chicken stock and season with salt and pepper. In a separate skillet, heat a tablespoon of oil and brown the chicken thighs, then add them to the paella dish and cook for 5–10 minutes. Place the clams in the dish with the joint facing down so that the edges open outward. Sprinkle in the peas and continue to cook gently, uncovered, for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil with the garlic cloves in a separate pan. Add the shrimp. Fry quickly for 1–2 minutes, then add them to the paella. Repeat with the squid and add them to the paella. Scatter the chopped parsley over the paella and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">If you have not used it before, do not be put off by the squid ink. It is a very familiar ingredient in coastal Mediterranean cooking, where it is prized for its subtle iron flavor.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">4 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 red chile, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup diced cleaned squid plus 2 small squid, cleaned for garnish</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup paella rice (such as Goya brand)</p>

<p class="nonindent">Over moderate heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy skillet. Fry the scallions, garlic, and chile for 1 minute. Add 1 cup diced cleaned squid and fry until lightly colored and the pan is dry. Remove everything from the pan and set aside. Heat the remaining oil in the pan, add the rice, and fry for 2–3 minutes. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil. Pour in the fish stock and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes or until the rice is nearly cooked. Meanwhile, for the garlic squid garnish, slice the small squid into rings, keeping the tentacles whole. Heat the olive oil and garlic in a skillet over medium heat, add the squid, and pan-fry for a few minutes until golden brown. For the last minute, add the Brussels sprout leaves. Sprinkle in the chopped parsley and set aside. Stir the reserved squid and scallion mixture into the rice. Add the squid ink with a little more stock if necessary. Stir well. At this stage the rice should be perfectly cooked and should take on the dark black color of the ink. Stir in the butter and season with salt and pepper. Serve the squid garnish on top of the blackened paella.</p>
