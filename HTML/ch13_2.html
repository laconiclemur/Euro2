<p class="noindent">Spanish restaurant desserts today often offer an exhilarating ride on the wild side. El Celler de Can Roca’s pastry chef, Jordi Roca, makes sweets that reproduce the aromas of popular fragrances. It’s uncanny! First, diners are handed a paper swatch scented with perfume. Then comes Roca’s composition of loquats, apricot sorbet, and warm peaches, layered with notes of honey, roses, lilac, and mallow, which perfectly matches the flowery fragrance of the Lancôme Trésor on the paper swatch. A mélange of eucalyptus, orange blossoms, nutmeg, and mint tastes like granita from heaven and smells like Ralph Lauren’s Polo. At Arzak restaurant in San Sebastián, a strawberry shake explodes in an extravagant cascade of pink bubbles, thanks to dry ice that <a id="page_398"/>chemically reacts with the milk. At El Bulli I ate a dessert that smelled like a pound cake, looked like a pound cake, and arrived in a loaf pan. One bite revealed a tromp l’oeil: a cake fashioned from frozen “air” that dissolved on the tongue—pastry station meets chemistry lab meets performance art.</p>
<p class="indent">Compared to this avant-garde alchemy, classic Spanish confections belong to an entirely different world: a rich sugary blend of Roman, Sephardic, Arab, and Catholic traditions. The Moors introduced sugar cane and sophisticated methods of refining its juice into sugar. Soon after the Muslim conquest of Spain in the eighth century, acres of sugary reeds were planted in the Andalusian countryside. In just a few centuries, there were dozens of sugar mills in the region—no small feat considering that elsewhere in medieval Europe sugar was still a scarce luxury. Almonds, another defining flavor in Spanish sweets, were first planted in Spain by the Phoenicians. Arabs kept on cultivating the nuts, singing praises to the beauty of the almond trees that covered Andalusian valleys in pinkish white lace when they blossomed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_399"/>Turrón and marzipan, Spain’s most famous almond confections, date back to the time when Arabs held sway. So does the repertoire of sugary fritters, candied fruit, sweets bathed in syrup, and stove-top puddings and custards, such as <em>arróz con leche</em> and <em>natillas</em> (a kind of crème anglaise). When Arabs and Jews were expelled in 1492, convent nuns took over Spain’s pastry kitchens, perfecting the art of cookies, fritters, sponge cakes, and marmalades. One striking feature of traditional Spanish sweets—an excessive reliance on egg yolks—is a holdover from the days when egg whites were used to clarify sherry and leftover yolks were donated to Andalusian nuns.</p>
<p class="indent">When Catholicism led to a premium on eating pig, another ingredient, lard—which lends an inimitable crumbliness to Spanish holiday cookies—became fundamental. The French contributed the caramel so essential to making flan. And these days even the nuns are keeping up with the times (just try the stylish banana and hazelnut tart from the Clarisa Sisters on <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_405">page 405</a>). Playing tradition against innovation, the desserts in this chapter offer the best of both worlds: an apple and nut tart updated with rosemary, dramatic chocolate treats, imaginative granitas and ice creams, and intriguing Ferran Adrià–inspired whimsies, like the gorgeous parfait that daringly combines yogurt, rose water, and . . . beets. Welcome to the New Spanish pastry kitchen!</p>

<p class="box-title">SWEET SCIENCE</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">I’m contemplating my dessert at El Celler de Can Roca, Catalonia’s most innovative restaurant after El Bulli. In front of me is a gossamer caramel bubble the size of a grapefruit, with the pearlescent silvery sheen of a vintage Tiffany vase. “Puncture it,” the waiter instructs. I comply, watching in utter amazement as sweet-fragrant wisps of olive-wood smoke emerge from inside. When I break the bubble completely, I discover a lush scoop of smoke-tinged porcini ice cream. Underneath lurks a layer of porcini carpaccio bathed with olive oil and scattered with pine nuts, not sweet but not quite savory. Puzzling, magical, and a technical miracle—smoke is trapped in a bubble handblown like glass from high-tech sugar derivatives—the dessert is like Cirque du Soleil for the taste buds. It is also proof that some of the most exciting culinary innovations these days are coming out of Spain’s pastry stations.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The revolution began in the late 1990s, when Dalíesque chef Ferran Adrià of El Bulli and his pastry-whiz brother, Albert, first began dismantling boundaries between sweet and savory kitchens. Olive oil, vinegars, spices, herbs—even foie gras and truffles—were boldly incorporated into desserts. Techniques normally confined to the pastry station—mousses, ice creams, gelatins, granitas—were grafted onto tapas and main courses, each new dish a delicious slap in the face of convention. Adrià’s obsession with textures led to a vocabulary of groundbreaking methods now common among Spanish chefs: airy <em>espumas</em> (foams whipped in a canister of nitrous oxide), hot and cold gelées set with such unusual jelling agents as agar agar, bubbly “airs,” <em>crujientes</em> (gossamer brittles), intriguing iced powders. Other pastry provocateurs have followed suit. All but banishing flour and butter from their repertoire, they wow diners instead with daring juxtapositions of flavors and textures.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">ROSEMARY-SCENTED APPLE AND NUT TART</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TARTA DE MANZANA PERFUMADA CON ROMERO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Xavier Canal, the favorite baker of Barcelona’s smart set, is a great master of apple tarts. In this one, he fills a crumbly tart shell with pine nut and almond custard and tops it with diced apples briefly cooked in rosemary syrup. The rosemary accent is faint but intriguing; if you want to intensify the herbal flavor, add a little finely minced rosemary to the apples. Once you’ve made this version, Xavier suggests trying a saffron-infused pastry cream (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_box2">following page</a>). The tart can be prepared ahead and put together before serving.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup plus ⅓ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup lightly toasted pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup lightly toasted slivered almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Rosemary-Scented Tart Shell (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_401a">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large fresh rosemary sprigs, twisted and smashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into small dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Cocoa powder, for dusting the tart</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the eggs and ¼ cup of the sugar in a small bowl and whisk to mix.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the pine nuts and almonds in a food processor and process until finely ground. Add the flour and ¼ cup sugar and pulse until well combined. Add 6 tablespoons (¾ stick) of the butter and pulse briefly until the mixture begins to form moist clumps. With the motor running, gradually add the egg mixture, processing just until all the ingredients are well combined.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Scrape the almond mixture into the tart shell, spreading it evenly (you may have more than will fill the shell). Bake until the filling is set and the top is light golden, about 35 minutes. Transfer the tart to a rack to cool completely.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Meanwhile, prepare the apples: Place the remaining ⅓ cup sugar, the rosemary, and ½ cup water in a microwave-safe dish and heat on high power for 2 minutes (microwaving releases rosemary flavor better than boiling). Let the rosemary syrup stand for 30 minutes, then strain it.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_401"/><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until they begin to release their juice, about 3 minutes. Add the rosemary syrup, cover the skillet, and cook until the apples soften, about 5 minutes. Uncover the skillet and cook, stirring gently a few times, until the apples are soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. The apples should be moist and intact, not mushy. Let cool completely.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> To assemble the tart, arrange the apples evenly in the tart shell. Using a sifter, lightly dust the top of the tart with cocoa powder and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ONE 9-INCH TART</strong></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The lovely hint of rosemary in this pastry is a marvelous complement to the apple filling on the previous page, as well as the Saffron Pastry Cream below. Think of it, too, for fruit tarts—especially pear, plum, and peach.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_402"/><strong>1¼ cups all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup confectioners’ sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 tablespoons ice water</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the flour, confectioners’ sugar, and rosemary in a food processor and pulse 6 or 7 times to crush the rosemary just a bit. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Transfer the dough to a bowl, sprinkle on 4 tablespoons ice water, and stir until it is evenly distributed. Pinch a piece of dough between your fingers. If it doesn’t hold together, add more ice water. Gather the dough into a ball. Lightly flour a work surface, then flatten the ball into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (The pastry can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the disk of dough between two pieces of lightly floured parchment paper, and roll it out to an 11-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, press it into the side of the pan, and trim the overhang. Freeze, covered with aluminum foil, for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> While the pastry is chilling, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Without removing the aluminum foil, fill the tart pan with pie weights or dried beans, then bake it on the center rack for 20 minutes.

<p class="sb-uln">3 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="sb-uln">⅔ cup sugar</p>
<p class="sb-uln">1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 2 tablespoons very hot water</p>
<p class="sb-uln">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="sb-uln">1 ½ cups half-and-half</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">1. Place the egg yolks, ⅓ cup of the sugar, and the saffron mixture in a medium-size bowl and whisk until thick and pale yellow. Whisk in the flour.</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">2. Place the half-and-half in a heavy medium-size saucepan over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Gradually whisk ½ cup of the hot half-and-half into the egg mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the saucepan of half-and-half, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking, until it thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the pastry cream into a small bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pastry cream and let cool completely, then refrigerate it for 1 hour. Spread the pastry cream evenly in a prebaked tart shell and continue with Step 5 of the Rosemary-Scented Apple and Nut Tart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_400">previous page</a>). <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 1 ½ CUPS</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3o">VALENCIAN ORANGE TART</h3>

<p class="image"><a id="page_403"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0403_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Valencian Orange Tart</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Once a source of immense wealth for the city, oranges are a symbol of Valencia. They feature in this citrus-intensive, not-too-sweet tart, which is just the ticket after a filling meal. Since the orange slices decorating the tart are not peeled, be sure to use thin-skinned juicy California oranges; thick-skinned oranges will not work. Blood oranges or a combination of orange and lemon slices make a nice variation. For an extra jolt of citrus, serve the tart with the refreshing Tangerine Sorbet (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_442">page 442</a>), Agua de Valencia Granita (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_444">page 444</a>), or a good store-bought citrus sorbet.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 medium-size thin-skinned California oranges, scrubbed well</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ cups fresh orange juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup sugar, plus more for caramelizing the tart</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon grated orange zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons orange flower water (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1 cup best-quality orange marmalade</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Prebaked Tart Pastry (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_404a">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_404"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cut off and discard a thick slice from each end of the oranges. Using a sharp knife, cut the oranges into ⅛-inch-thick slices. Place the orange juice, sugar, grated orange zest, and orange flower water, if using, in a wide pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the orange slices; if they are not submerged in liquid, add a little water. Reduce the heat to low and let the oranges simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Let the orange slices cool in the cooking liquid, then drain them and gently pat them dry with paper towels. Cut the orange slices in half.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> To assemble the tart, spread the marmalade evenly in the bottom of the tart shell and arrange the halved orange slices on top in concentric circles, overlapping slightly. Bake it on the center rack until the oranges are very soft and lightly browned, 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler. When the tart is just cool enough to handle, wrap aluminum foil around the edge of the crust so that it doesn’t burn when the tart is caramelized. Sprinkle sugar in a thin, even layer over the tart and broil until the sugar is caramelized, 4 to 7 minutes, depending on the heat of the broiler, being very careful not to let the tart burn (you can also use a kitchenware blowtorch to caramelize the tart). Let the tart cool to room temperature before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ONE 9-INCH TART</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">THE CLARISA NUNS’ BANANA &amp; HAZELNUT TART</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TARTA DE PLATANOS Y AVELLANAS HERMANAS CLARISAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Of all the Spanish cookbooks I own, one of my favorites is <em>Repostería Monacal de las Hermanas Clarisas</em>—a mouthwatering volume full of sweets compiled from various convents of the St. Clara order. Nuns are recognized in Spain as master bakers, and conventual cookbooks are incredibly popular. What’s striking about this tome is that, in addition to the usual <em>yemas</em> (egg yolk sweets) and <em>mantecadas</em> (crumbly lard cookies), it contains some seriously sophisticated desserts, demonstrating that the good sisters are keeping up with the times. This tart is a terrific example: sweet triumph from the sisters at the fifteenth-century convent of Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza in Alcalá de Henares, a town close to Madrid. It consists of a pastry shell filled with a tangy pineapple cream, topped with pineapple-macerated bananas and baked under a hazelnut streusel. The pastry, the filling, and the nut topping can all be prepared ahead and the tart assembled and baked at your leisure. Divine, indeed.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PASTRY SHELL:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 sheet puff pastry (from a 17¼-ounce package), thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE HAZELNUT TOPPING:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped skinned hazelnuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE BANANA AND CREAM FILLING:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large bananas, cut on the diagonal into medium-thin slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups pineapple juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons cornstarch</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Prepare the pastry shell: Flour a work surface, then, using a floured rolling pin, roll out the puff pastry to a roughly 12-inch square. Cut out an 11-inch circle by tracing around a plate or an 11-inch tart pan with the tip of a paring knife. Transfer the pastry circle to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press it against the side of the pan. Prick the pastry all over with the tines of a fork, cover it with plastic wrap, and freeze for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_406"/><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> While the pastry is chilling, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Remove and discard the plastic wrap from the pastry, then bake it on the center rack until light golden, about 20 minutes. When cool enough to handle, press gently on the bottom to deflate it. Let the pastry cool until ready to use. (The pastry shell can be baked up to a day ahead. Store at room temperature, covered loosely with aluminum foil.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Make the hazelnut topping: Place the hazel-nuts, flour, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a mini food processor and process until moist crumbs form. Scrape the topping into a bowl and refrigerate it, covered, while you prepare the filling.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_407"/><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Make the banana and cream filling: Place the bananas in a bowl, add the pineapple and lemon juices, and let stand for about 20 minutes. Strain the soaking liquid into a medium-size saucepan. Set the bananas aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Bring the soaking liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat. Place the sugar and cornstarch in a medium-size bowl and whisk to mix, then beat in the egg yolks. Gradually whisk ½ cup of the hot soaking liquid into the egg mixture, then whisk it into the saucepan with the remaining hot liquid. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the custard is thickened and just beginning to bubble around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the custard into a bowl and let cool slightly. Whisk in the butter, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the custard, and let cool to warm. It will keep for 4 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> To assemble the tart, spread the custard evenly in the pastry shell. Arrange the bananas on top of the custard in concentric circles and sprinkle the hazelnut topping evenly over them. Bake the tart on the center rack until the top is brown and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a rack and serve at room temperature. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ONE 9-INCH TART</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">SWEET BLESSINGS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Walking up to the small, discreet window at a convent’s entrance, I ring the bell and place a few euros on a wooden tray. The thin, black-cuffed hand of a cloistered nun hands me a box; a voice offers a blessing. Overcome by sweet piety, I walk away, slowly unwrapping bundles of cinnamon-dusted cookies, the insanely rich candied egg yolks called <em>yemas,</em> and confections shaped like the bones of a saint. High on sugar, I imagine the bakers sequestered behind convent walls skinning almonds, blanching orange peel, and patiently beating eggs laid by the convent hens.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Nuns have been guardians of Spain’s sweet traditions for more than five centuries. Although the idea of sisters who bake like angels is decidedly Catholic, many of their confections are actually of Muslim heritage—a sweet irony. When Moors were expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century after some eight hundred years of domination, recipes for their pastries rich in honey, almonds, and sesame seeds were preserved and perfected at convents. “Their products are often the culmination of centuries of tradition, and are made from jealously guarded recipes transmitted from one abbess to another in secret handwritten notebooks,” writes Xavier Domingo in <em>The Taste of Spain.</em> For the sisters, confectionary was more than simply a hobby that killed time between prayers. With sugar considered a status-laden luxury, sweet gifts were their way of currying favors from visiting dignitaries and repaying noble families at holiday times for endowments. In the nineteenth century, as support for religious orders waned, some convents began relying on confection sales as their main source of income. These days <em>repostería conventual</em> makes up a small industry, flourishing in some two hundred convents all over Spain.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The repertoire of conventual sweets is vast. There are the ubiquitous lard cookies, such as <em>polvorones</em> and <em>mantecadas;</em> anise ring cookies called <em>roscos;</em> and <em>borrachuelos,</em> dainty cakes soaked in syrup or wine. There are dense nut confections, airy sponge cakes, and a long litany of marmalades and candied fruit. Whenever I’m in Toledo I visit the church of Santo Tomé—not to admire El Greco’s <em>The Burial of the Count of Orgaz,</em> but to stock up on the amazing marzipans made by its nuns. I never leave Seville without a box of <em>yemas</em> prepared by the cloistered Augustinian sisters of the San Leandro convent according to a fifteenth-century recipe. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever passed a convent in Spain without emerging with a parcel of sweets. It’s reassuring to know that God will forgive me for this little indulgence.</p>

<p class="noindent">Not even the most devoted Catalan gourmands know about Fonda Xesc, a gem of a haute rustic restaurant hidden away on a small winding road too obscure for most people to find. What a shame. My recent meal there included a sublime <em>coca</em> with fresh figs and foie gras, a squid and artichoke rice for the ages, and these delicious caramelized fig tarts. I count the days until I can make it back to Fonda Xesc, and in the meantime, I make these tarts whenever fresh figs are in season. For an unusual grace note, you can sprinkle a few fresh rosemary leaves instead of the cinnamon on each tart before baking. I love these with Honey and Cinnamon Ice Cream.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 sheets (one 17¼-ounce package) frozen puff pastry, thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons unsalted butter, chopped, plus more for greasing the baking sheet</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons honey, preferably rosemary or orange blossom</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>16 to 20 ripe purple figs (about 1½ pounds), trimmed and cut lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Ground cinnamon, for dusting the tarts</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Honey and Cinnamon Ice Cream (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_439">page 439</a>) or store-bought vanilla ice cream (optional), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_408"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Lightly flour a work surface, then, using a floured rolling pin, roll out a sheet of puff pastry to a roughly ⅛-inch-thick rectangle. Using a small plate as a template, cut out two 6-inch rounds and wrap each one in plastic. Repeat with the remaining sheet of puff pastry, cutting out 2 more rounds and wrapping them in plastic. Refrigerate the puff pastry rounds for at least 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly butter a large baking sheet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the butter and honey in a microwave-safe bowl and heat on high power until the butter is melted, 15 seconds, then stir to mix.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Unwrap the puff pastry rounds and arrange them on the baking sheet; sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the sugar over each. Fold in the edge of each round to form a ½-inch border. Arrange the fig slices on the pastry rounds in concentric overlapping circles. Brush each tart generously with some of the honey and butter mixture and sprinkle cinnamon very lightly on top. Bake the tarts in the upper third of the oven until the figs are tender and the pastry is golden, about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Change the oven setting to broil. Sprinkle each tart with 1½ teaspoons of the remaining sugar and caramelize it under the broiler, taking care not to burn the pastry, about 2 minutes. (You can also use a kitchen blowtorch, if you have one, to caramelize the sugar.) Let the tarts cool on a rack for about 10 minutes. Serve warm, accompanied by ice cream, if desired. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 4 TARTS</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">BLUE CHEESE &amp; PEAR TART</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TARTA DE QUESO AZUL CON PERAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Anyone who likes pears with blue cheese will love this worldly, surprising tart with its smooth, mousselike cheese filling and a topping of sliced, wine-poached pears. The recipe was passed on to me by María Jesús Gil de Antuñano, one of Spain’s premiere food writers and recipe developers, who writes a weekly recipe column in <em>El País,</em> the country’s most widely read newspaper. While Cabrales would seem like the authentic choice of cheese, Roquefort is equally, if not more, popular in Spain and is recommended by María Jesús. Gorgonzola or Danish blue will also work, and you can vary the proportions of blue cheese and cream cheese according to the pungency you desire. Start ahead to give the tart sufficient time to set.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE BLUE CHEESE FILLING AND PASTRY:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¾ cups half-and-half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (from 2 envelopes)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces Roquefort or another blue cheese, at room temperature, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Prebaked Tart Pastry (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_404">page 404</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_409"/><strong>FOR THE PEAR TOPPING:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large firm Bartlett pears, peeled, cored, and cut in half lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups full-bodied dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the blue cheese filling: Pour the half-and-half into a medium-size bowl. Place the gelatin and ¼ cup water in a small heatproof bowl and let sit until the gelatin softens, about 10 minutes. Place the bowl with the gelatin in a small skillet of barely simmering water and stir until the gelatin dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the water, pour ½cup of the half-and-half into the gelatin mixture, stirring it well, then gently whisk the gelatin mixture into the remaining half-and-half until well blended.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the cream mixture, Roquefort, cream cheese, and sugar in a food processor and process until completely smooth. Scrape the cheese mixture into the tart shell and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Cover the tart loosely with plastic wrap, making sure it doesn’t touch the top of the filling, and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the tart is chilling, prepare the pear top-ping: Place the pear halves and wine in a medium-size saucepan that will hold them snugly (if the wine doesn’t cover the pears, add a little water). Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then add the sugar and cinnamon stick, stirring gently to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, turning the pears once, until they feel tender when pierced with a skewer, about 20 minutes. Let the pears cool in the poaching liquid, then, using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a bowl to cool. Cook the poaching liquid over high heat until it is reduced to about ⅓ cup, about 12 minutes. Cool it to room temperature.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> To assemble the tart, slice the pears lengthwise into medium-thin slices. Remove the tart from the refrigerator. Arrange as many pear slices as will comfortably fit on top of the filling in concentric circles. Spoon a little of the reduced poaching liquid on and around the pears, and to make slicing easier, place the tart in the freezer for about 20 minutes before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ONE 9-INCH TART</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3o"><a id="page_410"/>BASQUE CREAM AND CHERRY TART</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PASTEL VASCO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The <em>pastel vasco</em> is a symbol of Basqueness every bit as much as the <em>txapela</em> or games of jai alai. Mark Kurlansky devotes a whole chapter to it in his <em>The Basque History of the World.</em> The sweet, Kurlansky notes, was likely created in the eighteenth century, when it was known as <em>bistochak</em> and was rather breadlike. While enjoyed on both sides of the border, the tart is actually more of a cult (and a little bit tastier) on the French side, where it’s called <em>gâteau basque.</em> Traditionally, the crumbly, nutty pastry is filled with either pastry cream or with preserves made from the local black cherries (this version is similar in taste to linzer torte). In some circles mixing the two fillings would be considered heretical, but the results are so wonderful I find it hard to resist tampering with tradition.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PASTRY:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup slivered almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup confectioners’ sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2¾ cups all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon baking powder</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 tablespoons (1¼ sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg yolk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon almond extract</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons anise liqueur, such as Spanish anís dulce or sambuca</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE FILLING:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons plus 1½ teaspoons flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon almond extract</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon anise liqueur</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup finely ground almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>¾ cup best-quality cherry preserves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon milk, for the glaze</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_411"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the pastry: Place the almonds, 2 tablespoons of the confectioners’ sugar, and the 2 tablespoons of flour in a food processor and process until the almonds are finely ground. Add the remaining flour and the baking powder and process just to blend.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the butter, the remaining confectioners’ sugar, the egg and egg yolk, vanilla and almond extracts, and liqueur in a large mixing bowl and, using an electric mixer at low speed, cream until creamy and fluffy. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the almond mixture until completely combined. Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the dough is chilling, make the filling: Heat the milk in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat until it is hot but not boiling and begins to bubble around the edges. Remove the milk from the heat. Place the 3 egg yolks, the sugar, and flour in a bowl and whisk until completely blended (the mixture will be very thick). Gradually whisk in the hot milk. Pour the milk mixture into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens and boils, 3 to 5 minutes. Strain the pastry cream through a sieve into a bowl and whisk in the vanilla and almond extracts, liqueur, and the ground almonds. Place a piece of waxed paper directly on top and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Meanwhile, flatten each ball of dough into a disk. Press one of the disks into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Cover with plastic wrap. Lightly flour the other disc on both sides, place it between two pieces of waxed paper, and roll it out to a 10-inch circle. Refrigerate both pieces of dough for at least 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Spread the cherry preserves on the bottom of the tart. Spread the pastry cream over the preserves, making sure it is evenly distributed. Place the top crust over the tart and pinch the top and bottom edges together, being very careful not to tear the pastry. Brush the top of the tart with the egg yolk glaze and, using a sharp knife, make several slits in the top for the steam to escape. Place the tart pan on a sturdy baking sheet and bake on the center rack until golden brown, about 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Transfer the tart to a rack and let cool in the pan completely, at least 2 hours, before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ONE 9-INCH TART</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COCA DE POMAS DE ABUELAS DE SILS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">One of my trophies from the cooking session with the Grandmothers of Sils (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_412">page 412</a>) was the recipe for this moist, satiny apple cake flavored with lemon yogurt and ratafia, a brown herbal liqueur. Since ratafia is a rarity outside Catalonia, the <em>abuelas</em> suggest substituting an anise liqueur. Cointreau or an apple brandy, like Calvados, are also good options. The cake is rustic and unadorned, delicious for breakfast, <em>merienda</em> (a late-morning snack), or afternoon coffee or tea. It’s best when made a day ahead.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong><a id="page_413"/>Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_412"/>THE GRANDMOTHER OF SILS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The Grandmothers of Sils are a phenomenon in Catalonia—as famous as superchef Ferran Adrià. Some ten years ago, a dozen old ladies in the drowsy Catalan hamlet of Sils (population 3,000) decided to form a cooking club. Their idea was to exchange and record traditional recipes that would otherwise disappear with their generation. Today the club is sixty grandmothers strong, and when <em>las abuelas de Sils</em> recently published a cookbook, it struck such a chord that the volume is now in its eighth printing. And more books are on the way. The grandmothers, meanwhile, are busy appearing on television, being photographed with dashing celebrity chefs, and flying all over Spain to demonstrate their homey dishes in places like the Hotel Ritz in Madrid. Grandmothers in the rest of the country are green with envy.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">A TV camera greeted me at the door when I arrived in Sils to have lunch with the grandmothers. A young independent producer was recording every detail of the grandmothers’ lives for a reality show. Inside the musty old home of one of the women, a TV news crew was filming yet another program about the <em>abuelas</em> of Sils. I felt as if I had walked into a celebrity wedding. Unfazed by it all, the grandmothers, who were sprightly and impeccably coiffed, just kept on cooking. In a vast kitchen with a live hearth and an antique stove, an octogenarian named Rosario was busy stirring a frugal soup of bread, mint, and olive oil. Around the table, a clutch of old ladies sat arguing about how to improve stewed chicken with salsify, their signature dish. Did it need a ground almond <em>picada</em> or not? A commotion ensued when it was time to caramelize the <em>crema catalana,</em> a custard with a burnt-sugar topping. One grandmother stuck a long-handled flat iron into the hearth. The reporters rushed in. Lights, camera, action . . . With a dramatic swoosh, the red-hot iron branded the sugar. “Encore,” the producers demanded.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Finally, we sat down to lunch. The <em>abuelas</em>’ dishes were straightforward and appropriately grandmotherly, full of the deep rustic flavors one no longer finds in cities these days. Long-simmered pig’s feet were improbably paired with snails, an example of the Catalan penchant for combining <em>mar i muntanya</em> (sea and mountain). That stewed barnyard chicken flavored with salsify, a deliciously fleshy root traditional in Catalan country cooking, was offered. “People almost stopped using salsify,” one grandmother noted, “but we feel it deserves to be resurrected.” She rushed back to the kitchen, emerging with <em>cazuelas</em> of robust baked macaroni with pork ribs and veal stewed with wild mushrooms. Everyone agreed that the <em>crema catalana</em> turned out very fine. As did the big fluffy apple cake flavored with ratafia, an herbal liqueur (you’ll find the recipe on the <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_411a">previous page</a>).</p>
<p class="sb-indent">For days after my visit, people in Barcelona kept stopping me on the street. “Hey, haven’t I see you somewhere?” “Weren’t you the one on TV with the famous Grandmothers of Sils?” This was my own five minutes of Catalan fame.</p>

<h3 class="h3o">LAURA’S CHEESECAKE WITH PINE NUT GLAZE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TARTA DE QUESO CON FRUTOS SECOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The Casa Robles restaurant is as famous a landmark in Seville as the Moorish Giralda tower. In charge of desserts here is Laura Robles, the proprietor’s daughter, whose sweets winningly combine tradition and innovation. With its glasslike glaze of pine nuts and white raisins, Laura’s cheesecake is as luscious as it is dramatic to look at. A mixture of cream cheese and ricotta is a good approximation of the creamy San Millán cheese Laura uses. And while she suggests a clear apple juice for the glaze, a light white dessert wine, such as a muscat or sweet riesling, would be another interesting option. If you’re not in the mood to make the glaze, just stir the pine nuts into the cheesecake batter. As the cake bakes, the nuts will rise up, forming a natural topping.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_414"/><strong>FOR THE CHEESECAKE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound (two 8-ounce packages) cream cheese</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>15 to 16 ounces ricotta</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon orange flower water (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grated zest of 1 large lemon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grated zest of 1 medium-size orange</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE GLAZE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup golden raisins</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup sweet or medium-dry sherry, or ⅓ cup sweet white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2¼ teaspoons (1 envelope) unflavored gelatin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup clear apple juice or light white dessert wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup lightly toasted pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the cheesecake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Line the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with aluminum foil to seal it, fold the edges underneath, then assemble the pan. Butter the sides of the pan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the cream cheese, ricotta, cream, and sugar in a large mixing bowl and, using an electric mixer, beat at medium speed until well blended and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the flour until incorporated. Gradually add the eggs and the egg yolks, beating well after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl. At low speed, beat in the lemon juice, orange flower water, if using, and the lemon and orange zests. (Alternatively, the batter can be mixed in a food processor; add the eggs one at a time through the feed tube.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and give it a light tap on the counter to level the batter. Set the pan in a large baking dish and pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake the cheesecake until the top looks set but the cake still jiggles when you tap the pan, about 55 minutes. Leave the cake in the oven for 1 hour with the door ajar. Transfer the cake to a rack and let cool for another hour. Drape plastic wrap over the cake and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Make the glaze: Place the raisins and sherry in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute on high power, or heat in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until the sherry is very hot. Off the heat, let the raisins soak for about 30 minutes. Drain the raisins and pat thoroughly dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the gelatin in a small saucepan, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the apple juice over it, and let stand for 5 minutes. Add the remaining apple juice and heat over medium-low heat, stirring, until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Pour the gelatin mixture into a metal bowl and place it in the freezer until it just begins to thicken but is still completely pourable, 15 to 25 minutes. Start checking the gelatin after 15 minutes and do not leave it in the freezer too long; it sets very quickly.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To glaze the cheesecake, first lightly press the raisins and pine nuts into the top, distributing them evenly. They should completely cover the cake. Using a tablespoon, dab the gelatin mixture over the cake until it is covered in a thin, even layer (you will probably not need all of the gelatin mixture.) Refrigerate the cake, uncovered, until the glaze is completely set, about 2 hours.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">CATALAN COCA WITH CUSTARD &amp; CANDIED FRUIT</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COCA DE SANT JOAN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In Catalonia, the summer solstice fiesta of Sant Joan is celebrated with this sweet, spongy <em>coca</em> topped with a lush smear of pastry cream and a colorful scattering of candied fruit and nuts. Although historically the bread was round (as an homage to the sun), today the <em>coca</em> is shaped into a rectangle and accompanied by sips of sweet muscatel wine. Spectacularly delicious, it’s now as popular for Christmas as it is for Sant Joan.</p>
<p class="indent">The base of the cake consists of an airy, buttery <em>brioix</em> (brioche) dough that’s quite similar to the French original but less tricky to make. Because the dough is too soft to knead by hand, you’ll need a mixer with a dough hook attachment.</p>
<p class="indent">Cut into dainty rectangles, this enormous <em>coca</em> is ideal for a large holiday party. To serve a smaller group, don’t attempt to halve the dough recipe, make the whole batch, use what you need to make a smaller <em>coca,</em> and freeze the rest for later (covered with plastic wrap, the dough will keep for about 2 months). This is one of my all-time favorite festive sweets.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 packed teaspoons fresh yeast, or 1 package active dry yeast (2½ teaspoons)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup warm whole milk (about 115°F)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons sugar, plus ⅓ cup sugar for decorating the cake</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2⅓ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for sprinkling on the dough</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon aniseed, crushed in a mortar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon almond extract</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon orange flower water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>14 tablespoons (1¾ sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Pastry Cream (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_416a">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chopped mixed candied fruit (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup pine nuts, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the yeast, milk, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a warmed medium-size bowl and stir until the yeast dissolves. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the salt and ⅓ cup of the flour. Set the sponge in a warm place, cover it with plastic wrap, and let rise for 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the eggs, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the aniseed, almond extract, and orange flower water in the warmed bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat at medium speed until the eggs are pale yellow. (This can also be done with a handheld mixer.) Scrape the risen sponge into the mixer bowl and beat briefly. With the mixer running, add the butter, 2 or 3 pieces at a time, beating for 2 to 3 minutes at medium speed (the butter <a id="page_416"/>won’t be completely melted). Beat in the remaining 2 cups flour, ½ cup at a time. Exchange the beater for a dough hook. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic and easily pulls away from the bowl, about 8 minutes. The dough will be very soft, almost like butter.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Lightly sprinkle a large warmed bowl with flour and scrape the dough into it. Sprinkle a little more flour evenly on top to prevent the dough from drying, cover it with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Deflate the dough by lifting it by the edges and dropping it back into the bowl. Sprinkle the top with flour, cover the bowl again with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. It will rise slightly. (The dough can be prepared up to this point a day ahead.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Let the dough come to room temperature (about 20 minutes), then place it on a very large baking sheet and pat it into a rectangle about 16 by 8 inches. Cover with a clean linen kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Smear the dough generously with the Pastry Cream, leaving a ½-inch border on all sides (you may not need all of the Pastry Cream). Scatter the candied fruit and pine nuts decoratively on top. Bake the <em>coca</em> on the center rack for exactly 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> While the <em>coca</em> is baking, place the remaining ⅓ cup sugar in a bowl and sprinkle 2 teaspoons cold water over it. Using your hands, work the water into the sugar until it forms clumps (if the clumps are too moist, add a couple more tablespoons of sugar). Remove the <em>coca</em> from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 350°F. Working very quickly and gently, so as not to deflate the dough, pat the sugar clumps all over the top of the <em>coca.</em> Bake the <em>coca</em> until the edges are golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in a part not covered with Pastry Cream comes out clean, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">9.</span></strong> Transfer the <em>coca</em> to a rack to cool. Cut it into rectangles (3 by 1¼ inches is a nice size) and arrange on a plate. Alternatively, serve the <em>coca</em> on a large wooden board and let your guests cut their own.</p>

<h3 class="h3o">CHOCOLATE CUSTARDS WITH A CITRUS CLOUD</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>NATILLAS DE CHOCOLATE CON NATA Y CITRICOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The pairing of dark chocolate and citrus is unbeatable, which is why I’m so in love with this recipe from the legendary Basque chef Juan Mari Arzak. Taking off on <em>natillas</em>—the thin custard that the Spanish adore—he flavors it with chocolate and tops it with a foamy cream whipped with citrus-infused syrup and lightened with beaten egg whites. The play of textures and flavors is to die for.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>9 tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate, grated or very finely chopped, plus a little grated chocolate, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh orange juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grated zest of 1 lemon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grated zest of 1 large orange</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grated zest of ½ pink grapefruit</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large egg whites, chilled (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_note2">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Small mint leaves, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_418"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the egg yolks and 5 tablespoons of the sugar in a large bowl and whisk until well blended.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the milk in a heavy medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Gradually whisk the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture. Return the egg mixture to the saucepan and stir over medium heat until the custard thickens enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 12 minutes. (It should have the consistency of a thin crème anglaise.) Do not let the custard boil, or it will curdle. Off the heat, add the chocolate, stirring constantly in one direction until it is melted and smooth. Strain the custard into a bowl, let it cool a little, then divide among 6 or 7 dessert glasses or small wineglasses. Cover the glasses with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place 3 tablespoons sugar and the orange juice in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> When ready to serve, whip the cream until medium-stiff peaks form.

<p class="caption"><strong>White Chocolate Mousse with Passion Fruit Gelée</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">The very first time I visited the Guggenheim in Bilbao, I’m not sure what impressed me more, Frank Gehry’s titanium extravaganza or the fittingly avant-garde lunch prepared by the museum restaurant’s former chef Bixente Arrieta. The meal ended with a battery of miniature futuristic desserts, stylishly arranged in shot glasses, on skewers, and on porcelain spoons. Among them were glasses of sensational white chocolate mousse trapped under a cap of passion fruit gelée. Bixente has since left, and I never did get the recipe. But my version comes pretty close. While I normally find white chocolate too cloying, when paired with the tartness of yogurt and passion fruit, it tastes just right.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 cups plain whole-milk yogurt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 to 8 ounces best-quality white chocolate, finely chopped or grated</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2¼ teaspoons (1 envelope) unflavored gelatin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup strained fresh passion fruit juice, or 1 cup thawed frozen passion fruit puree (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_note4">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ to ½ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the yogurt in a sieve lined with cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Let the yogurt drain for about 2 hours. Stir well before using.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the white chocolate and cream in the top of a double boiler, set over simmering water, and stir until the chocolate is completely melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl. Let stand until cool and just beginning to thicken, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Using a spatula, thoroughly stir the drained yogurt into the chocolate mixture until completely combined.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Divide the chocolate mousse among 6 small squat glasses, martini glasses, or glass bowls and refrigerate, covered, until slightly set, 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the gelatin in a small saucepan, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the passion fruit juice over it, and let stand for 5 minutes. Add the remaining passion fruit juice and heat over medium-low heat, stirring, until the gelatin completely dissolves. Add ⅓ cup sugar, stirring until it dissolves. Taste the passion fruit mixture; if it seems too tart, add the remaining sugar. Let the passion fruit mixture cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Remove the mousse from the refrigerator and slowly pour about 2½ tablespoons of the passion fruit mixture over each, being careful not to mix the passion fruit with the mousse.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MOUSSE DE CHOCOLATE CON ACEITE DE OLIVA Y SAL MALDON</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This thrilling Dalíesque marriage of flavors—dark chocolate and fruity olive oil, with a strange and wonderful accent of salt—seems to spell out <em>nueva cocina.</em> But actually, Catalan chocolate–olive oil desserts go back further in time. As historians have told me, after World War II, when luxury ingredients such as chocolate were strictly rationed, Catalans would melt a piece of chocolate, spread it on toast, and sprinkle olive oil and a bit of salt on top for a sweet-savory treat (you’ll find the recipe on <a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_167">page 167</a>). Avant-garde chefs took the idea and ran with it.</p>
<p class="indent">As you serve this sweet, prepare for drama: Some people go wild over it, others raise their eyebrows, but either way, it will be the talk of the evening. While the mousse is easy to make, good ingredients are essential: the best, darkest chocolate with at least 70 percent cacao content; an extra-fruity, slightly peppery olive oil that can stand up to the chocolate; and the flaky British sea salt called Maldon (look for it at specialty food shops). Because the dessert is so explosively flavorful and unusual, serve tiny scoops of it in stylish glasses or glass bowls. And only to your most adventurous friends.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>9 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate (at least 70 percent cacao), finely chopped or coarsely ground in a food processor</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Best-quality fruity, peppery extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Very thin unflavored Italian bread sticks, for serving (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the cream in a small, heavy saucepan and heat it over medium heat until it is hot but not boiling and begins to bubble around the edge. Place the chocolate in a metal bowl and pour the hot cream over it all at once. Let the cream stand for 2 to 3 minutes while the chocolate melts. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir the chocolate mixture in a circular motion, starting at the center of the bowl and <a id="page_423"/>working your way out to the side. Be careful not to stir too vigorously, or you will add too much air to the ganache. Keep stirring until all the chocolate is melted and completely blended with the cream. Scrape the mixture into a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours. The mixture will firm as it sits.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> To serve, using a melon baller, scoop balls of the mousse into small wide tumblers, or “minimalist” glass bowls. Pour 2 to 3 teaspoons of the olive oil around but not over the mousse and judiciously sprinkle salt on top. If desired, serve with very thin breadsticks for dipping into the mousse. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 6 TO 8 SMALL SERVINGS</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">SEPARATION ANXIETY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">This chocolate mousse consists of ganache, a simple, classic emulsion of chocolate and cream used for truffles. While the cooking method, suggested to me by the test kitchen team of the <em>Los Angeles Times,</em> is fairly foolproof, emulsions are fragile things and sometimes they do break. You will know if it does—it’s when the mixture looks oily or slightly curdled. To repair the ganache, use the following method from the chocolate diva, Alice Medrich: Heat one quarter cup heavy (whipping) cream to a simmer, transfer it to a medium-size bowl, and begin whisking in the broken ganache, bit by bit, as if making mayonnaise. It will come together.</p>

<h3 class="h3o">HOT CHOCOLATE WITH MERINGUE STARS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CHOCOLATE CON CROCANTES DE ALMENDRA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Adapted from a dessert of Josean Martínez Alija, the very young but astonishingly talented chef at the Guggenheim Museum restaurant in Bilbao, this is perfect to serve during the winter holidays. Josean’s cutting-edge version features an extremely concentrated unsweetened chilled cocoa soup touched with salt and afloat with meringue stars and a scoop of house-made Star Anise Ice Cream. I opted for something cozier, adding solid chocolate to the cocoa powder for a richer texture, serving it hot, and skipping the iconoclastic salt. You can make Star Anise Ice Cream yourself or use store-bought ice cream—vanilla or coffee—sprinkling the dessert with a little cinnamon, grated nutmeg, or freshly ground star anise.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE MERINGUES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large egg whites, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup minus 1 tablespoon superfine sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup finely ground lightly toasted almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE CHOCOLATE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cup best-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, such as Valrhona</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons instant espresso or coffee powder (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_note5">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate, grated or finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Star Anise Ice Cream (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_437">page 437</a>), or 1 pint store-bought vanilla or coffee ice cream</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the meringues: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 250°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or better yet, Silpat pan liners).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the egg whites and salt in a mixing bowl and, using an electric mixer, beat them on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add the superfine sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Increase the speed to high and continue beating until the whites are stiff and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, carefully fold the ground almonds into the egg white mixture.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_424"/><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Spoon the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a ⅜-inch plain tip. Pipe out star shapes on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them evenly. Bake the meringues on the center rack until they are dry, about 1 hour, switching the position of the baking sheets halfway through the cooking. Let cool in the oven with the door ajar for 30 minutes. Then carefully peel the stars off the parchment paper and transfer them to a rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. (The meringues can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Make the chocolate: Place 2 cups water in a heavy medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the cocoa and coffee powders and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Stir in the chocolate, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring in one direction, until completely melted.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Pour the hot chocolate into wide glasses or big, pretty cups. Top each with a small scoop of ice cream and a meringue star. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 12 TO 14</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch13_note5"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> You can use ¼ cup brewed espresso in place of the instant. Reduce the water to 1¾ cups.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CHOCOLATE CALIENTE DE MARICEL, SIGLO XVII</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">My friend Maricel Presilla is amazing. A brilliant chef and restaurateur with a PhD in medieval Spanish history, she is an expert in the <a id="page_425"/>cuisines of Latin America and one of the world’s preeminent chocolate scholars, as evident in her erudite tome <em>The New Taste of Chocolate.</em> Adapted from a recipe in her book, this hot chocolate—spiced with achiote, dried rose buds, vanilla, cinnamon, and chile, among other things—is the closest you’ll ever come to a taste of the drink as it might have been enjoyed by the Spanish nobility in the Age of Discovery. Maricel’s inspiration was the first European treatise on chocolate, written by Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma in 1644, some 125 years after the Spaniards had encountered the potent pairing of chocolate and spices in Mexico. The potion is completely bewitching. One sip, and you’ll understand why hot chocolate was deemed so addictive as to be dangerous.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 cups water or whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup achiote (annatto) seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 blanched almonds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 toasted hazelnuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>), skinned</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 plump vanilla beans, preferably Mexican</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ ounce dried rose buds (rosa de Castilla) (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_box1">box</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon aniseed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size cinnamon sticks, preferably canela (Ceylon cinnamon)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 whole dried arbol or serrano chiles</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon orange flower water (optional) Sugar</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the water or milk and the achiote seeds in a heavy 3-quart saucepan and bring to a low boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer until the achiote colors the liquid bright orange, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, finely grind the almonds and hazelnuts in a mini food processor.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Strain the achiote liquid, discarding the solids; return the liquid to the saucepan. Cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and, using the tip of a small knife, scrape the seeds into the saucepan. Add the vanilla bean pods and the ground nuts, rose buds, aniseed, cinnamon sticks, and chiles. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until infused with the spices, about 10 minutes. Add the chocolate and salt and stir until the chocolate melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the orange flower water, if using. Taste for sweetness, adding sugar to taste. Strain the hot chocolate through a fine sieve into a tall narrow pot.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Froth the chocolate until foamy using a Mexican wooden <em>molinillo</em> (chocolate beater), a cappuccino frother, or an immersion blender. Or whisk the hot chocolate vigorously with a wire whisk. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10</strong></span></p>

<p class="sb-noindent">If you can’t find dried rose buds for this special hot chocolate, substitute a quarter teaspoon of rose water or omit them. All the other ingredients can be easily found at Hispanic groceries and some supermarkets. For best results Maricel suggests using chocolate made with Venezuelan cacao beans (such as El Ray Gran Saman or Chocovic Ocumare), which would have been the likely choice in seventeenth-century Spain. For a more chocolaty taste, use all water; for a softer, more luscious drink, use milk.</p>

<p class="sb-noindent">In the seventeenth century, Spaniards flavored their hot chocolate with aniseed, dried rosebuds, nuts, chiles, and achiote. In the twenty-first century, adventurous Spanish pastry chefs are spiking their dark, sumptuous creations with balsamic vinegar, jasmine, pink peppercorns, even smoke! Are Spanish taste buds reverting to type?</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In 1502, Columbus encountered chocolate off the coast of present-day Honduras, where he was accompanied by his son Ferdinand. The pair intercepted a Mayan trading canoe stocked with cacao and observed the Indians drop a few almondlike beans to the ground. Ferdinand later wrote that the Indians panicked so utterly, he thought “an eye had fallen from their head.” Columbus might not have realized that cocoa beans carried the status of currency in that part of the world (sacks of beans were even considered an acceptable form of tax payment). However, chocolate’s value and ceremonial significance weren’t lost on the Spanish colonizers in Mexico, who reported back of Aztec nobility drinking frothy bitter cacao from golden vessels.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Probably introduced to Spain in 1544 by a group of Kekchi Maya chaperoned by Dominican friars, chocolate became an instant sensation—helped along by rumors of its aphrodisiac properties that trickled in from the New World. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, author of <em>History of the Conquest of New Spain,</em> reported that chocolate was served to the emperor Montezuma from goblets of fine gold before he went to visit his wives. Other accounts credited it with magical healing powers or medicinal properties. Initially suspicious of chocolate, Spanish clergy engaged in endless debates about whether it was liquid or solid and thus permissible—or not—during Lent. But soon, even the church gave in, falling under chocolate’s dark sensuous spell. According to historical documents, the Grand Inquisitor himself indulged in huge cups of hot chocolate, prepared for him by the nuns at his service.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">While Mayan and Aztec aristocrats took their chocolate cold and usually bitter (or occasionally sweetened with honey), Spaniards got the bright idea of mixing in another colonial product: sugar cane. Spanish missionary nuns in Mexico were probably the first to sweeten the bitter ground cocoa with sugar; apparently, the sisters amassed small fortunes selling this potion to the chocolate-craving colonial elite. The Spaniards in Mexico (particularly ladies and clergy) became so addicted to chocolate that “their strength failed them if they did not have it at their accustomed hour,” according to one report. The Spanish further perfected the art of chocolate drinking by frothing it with a nifty wooden beater called a <em>molinillo,</em> an improvement on the Aztec technique of pouring it from vessel to vessel. From the early seventeenth century on, hot chocolate was de rigueur in Spain, a treat especially enjoyed by noble <em>señoras,</em> who would throw afternoon parties, serving the drink with sweet dainties like candied fruit, sponge cakes, and nougat.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Spaniards’ affection for hot chocolate has never waned. Every <em>madrileño</em> who ever partied until <em>madrugada</em> (the wee hours of dawn) knows the address of Chocolatería San Ginés, an ancient café in Madrid conveniently located near most of the major nightclubs. At 7 A.M. lines snake around the block as revelers wait to be revived with a cup of puddinglike chocolate so thick, rich, and dense it can qualify as an alternative energy source. The classic accompaniment is a <em>churro,</em> a crisp fried cruller for dipping.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">If you haven’t dunked <em>churros</em> in chocolate at dawn, you haven’t been to Spain.</p>

<h3 class="h3o"><a id="page_427"/>CHOCOLATE-COVERED ALMOND CAKE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TORTA DE ALMENDRAS CON TRUFA DE CHOCOLATE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Almond cakes are so ubiquitous in Spain that after a while you stop noticing them—too much of a good thing. This one, however, frosted with a dark chocolate ganache, is in a league of its own.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE ALMOND CAKE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces (slightly more than 1½ cups) blanched whole almonds, preferably marcona, lightly toasted (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large eggs, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE RUM SYRUP:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup dark rum</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE CHOCOLATE GANACHE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate (at least 70 percent cacao), grated in a food processor</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the almond cake: Place the almonds and ½ cup of sugar in a food processor and process until very finely ground.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the eggs in a warm mixing bowl and, using an electric mixer, beat them until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the remaining ½ cup sugar and continue beating at high speed until the eggs are pale yellow and approximately triple in volume, 3 to 4 minutes. Working in batches, beat in the almond mixture and the flour, alternating with the olive oil and milk. Stir in the lemon zest and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with a circle of waxed paper. Generously butter the paper and the sides of the pan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and tap it on a counter to level the batter. Bake the cake on the center rack until a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let the cake cool on a rack for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> While the cake is cooling, make the rum syrup: Place the rum and sugar in a small saucepan. Add ½ cup water and heat, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Run a thin knife around the side of the cake to loosen it, then remove the side of the pan. Invert the cake onto a plate and remove the bottom of the pan and the waxed paper. Prick the cake all over with a fork and generously brush it with the rum syrup, waiting for the syrup to be absorbed before brushing on more. Cover the cake loosely with plastic wrap and let stand for about 1 hour to fully absorb the syrup.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_428"/><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Make the chocolate ganache: Place the cream in a small, heavy saucepan and heat it over medium heat until it is hot but not boiling, and begins to bubble around the edge. Place the chocolate in a metal bowl and pour the hot cream over it all at once. Let the cream stand while the chocolate melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir the chocolate mixture in a circular motion, starting at the center of the bowl and working your way out to the side. Be careful not to stir too vigorously, or you will add too much air to the ganache. Keep stirring until all the chocolate is melted and completely blended with the cream. (If by some chance the ganache “breaks”—begins to look oily or slightly curdled—you can fix it following the instructions on <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_422">page 422</a>.) Let the ganache stand at room temperature until thickened but spreadable, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> Place the cake on a cake platter, spread the ganache generously over the top and the sides, and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ONE 9-INCH CAKE</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3a"><span class="green-1">HAZELNUT MOUSSE WITH ESPRESSO GRANITA</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MOUSSE DE AVELLANAS CON GRANIZADO DE CAFE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">So utterly magical is the combination of hazel-nuts, caramel, and strong coffee it seems that every modern restaurant in Spain offers some kind of riff on this dessert. Granitas are a cinch to make, but if you’re pressed for time, top the hazelnut mousse with a small dollop of good store-bought chocolate sorbet. For a different texture you can add some broken amaretti, pieces of pound cake, or macaroons to the bottom of each glass.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ cup plus ⅓ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup heavy (whipping) cream at room temperature, plus ¾ cup chilled cream, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup brewed espresso or strong black coffee</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup hazelnut liqueur, dark rum, or brandy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup toasted hazelnuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>), skinned and finely ground</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Espresso Granita (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_446">page 446</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons grated dark chocolate, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_429"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the ½ cup sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a heavy medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar is dissolved, cook the caramel without stirring until it begins to bubble and color, about 5 minutes. At it cooks, swirl the pan gently and brush down the sides with a wet pastry brush to remove the sugar crystals. Continue cooking until the caramel turns dark amber, 1 to 2 minutes longer, swirling the pan carefully and watching that the caramel doesn’t burn. As soon as the syrup is dark amber, turn off the heat and add the ⅓ cup cream and the espresso, standing back, as the mixture will sputter vigorously. Using a wooden spoon, stir the caramel thoroughly, then cook it over low heat, stirring, until it is smooth, 1 minute. Let the caramel cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the liqueur, the remaining ⅓ cup sugar, and the eggs in a metal mixing bowl and whisk to mix. Keep whisking until the eggs are well beaten and the mixture is frothy.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Set the mixing bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water, without letting the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Whisk and stir the custard until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (it will register 160°F on a candy thermometer), 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the custard from the heat, let cool for about 5 minutes, then stir in the hazelnuts. Transfer the custard mixture to a blender, add the caramel, and blend until very smooth, adding a little cold cream if the mixture seems too thick to blend and scraping down the sides of the blender container. Scrape the custard mixture into a bowl and let cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Whip the ¾ cup chilled cream until stiff peaks form. Set aside about ½ cup of the whipped cream and refrigerate it, covered. Gently but thoroughly fold the remaining whipped cream into the custard until completely blended. Cover the mousse with plastic wrap and chill for 2 to 4 hours. (It won’t be as thick as mousses containing gelatin.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> To serve, place some coffee granita in a parfait glass or other tall, slender glass. Top with some of the hazelnut mousse, then with more granita. Spoon a dollop of the reserved whipped cream on top and sprinkle it with grated chocolate. Repeat with the remaining granita, mousse, and whipped cream, working quickly so that the granita doesn’t melt. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3o">YOGURT CREAM WITH HONEY GELEE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CREMA DE YOGUR CON GELATINA DE MIEL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">At a recent meal at Roig Robí, a Barcelona restaurant I adore, I fell in love with this dessert from the mother-daughter chef team of Mercé Navarro and Inma Crosas. It consisted of a <a id="page_430"/>pretty glass bowl filled with thick yogurt, which was topped with squares of honey gelée and a dollop of mandarin sorbet that practically burst with citrus flavors. The sweet felt as healthy and virtuous as it was delicious. Homemade sorbets add a special touch and are a simple proposition, if you own an ice-cream maker. However, if you have a source for high-quality mandarin or orange sorbet, feel free to substitute. This dessert is extremely easy, but everything needs to be made ahead, so plan accordingly.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ teaspoons (1 envelope) unflavored gelatin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup honey, preferably orange blossom</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups plain goat’s milk yogurt, or Greek yogurt or other good-quality whole-milk yogurt, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Tangerine Sorbet (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_442">page 442</a>), or 1 pint store-bought tangerine sorbet</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the gelatin in a small saucepan, sprinkle 2 tablespoons water over it, and let stand for 5 minutes. Add the honey and ⅓ cup water and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring until the honey liquefies and the gelatin dissolves. Pour the mixture into an 8-inch-square baking pan and refrigerate, covered, until set, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the yogurt in a sieve lined with cheesecloth and set over a bowl (if you are using Greek yogurt it is not necessary to drain it). Let the yogurt drain in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. Stir well before serving.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> To serve, using a sharp knife, cut the honey gelée into roughly 1½-inch diamonds or squares. Spread about ½ cup of the drained yogurt in each of 8 pretty glass serving bowls, then top with a dollop of sorbet and a few pieces of gelée. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Ethereally light and completely unusual, here’s a sweet guaranteed to end a meal with a bang. It’s adapted from the guru of avant-garde Spanish cooking, Ferran Adrià. The first time I served it for a dinner party, I wasn’t sure how my guests would react to such a cutting-edge confection. They went wild, and I’ve been making it ever since. Serve it in small glasses as a palate cleanser before a more substantial dessert.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 sweet fragrant strawberries, hulled and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons (1 envelope) unflavored gelatin</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the gelatin in another small saucepan, sprinkle 2 tablespoons water over it, and let stand for 5 minutes. Strain the hot strawberry <a id="page_431"/>liquid into the saucepan with the softened gelatin, discarding the solids. Place the saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, until the gelatin completely dissolves. Stir in the rose water. Divide the gelée among 8 very small glasses, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the yogurt in a sieve lined with cheesecloth and set over a bowl.

<h3 class="h3o">MY CHRISTMAS BREAD PUDDING</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BUDIN DE PAN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">One winter, the year that I was renting a flat in Madrid, a friend bestowed an enormous <em>roscón de reyes</em> on me—a Christmas ring cake adorned with sugar and candied fruit. We picked and nibbled for days, and when it got stale, I baked the leftovers into tasty pudding. As American bakeries don’t usually carry <em>roscón,</em> at home I’ve made a delicious version with panettone, the Italian Christmas cake. If you can’t find panettone, this will also be good made with brioche. Just increase the amount of sugar to two thirds of a cup and toss in some diced candied fruit.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound panettone (available at Italian bakeries and some markets), cut into 1-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Spread the panettone cubes on a large rimmed baking sheet and bake on the center rack, stirring once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Turn the oven off.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, milk, and cream in a large bowl, and whisk until completely smooth. Place the toasted panettone in a round earthenware <em>cazuela</em> 10 to 12 inches in diameter or a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Pour the egg mixture over it and let stand for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. (The bread pudding can be refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap, for several hours before baking.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Dot the top of the bread pudding with butter and bake until puffy and golden and the custard is set, about 1 hour. Let cool for about 30 minutes, then serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MACEDONIA DE FRUTAS, BAR PINOTXO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">There are few food rituals in Barcelona more revered than a late, post-shopping breakfast at Bar Pinotxo, the venerable food counter by the entrance to La Boqueria market. By 11 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span> the feeding frenzy is on, with vendors and shoppers thronging the stools. But my favorite time to hang out there is around eight in the morning, when I can observe the cooks at work. One familiar sight is a young girl dicing fruit for Pinotxo’s signature <em>macedonia,</em> a fruit salad that, depending on the season, will contain apples, pears, kiwis, mangos, and ruby pomegranate seeds. Like everything at Pinotxo, the salad is simple and no-nonsense but wonderful, relying on the bounty of the produce surrounding the tiny kitchen. It makes a pretty and easy dessert, but I like it best as part of a brunch buffet or even as a late-afternoon snack, with a dollop of organic yogurt. Feel free to vary the fruit and to add berries, slivered mint, and/or a dash of liqueur, such as Grand Marnier.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 cup fresh orange juice</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Fantastical lollipops, often in outrageously outré flavor combinations, are a signature at El Bulli, Ferran Andrià’s temple of experimental cuisine. Coming down to earth for his book dedicated to home cooking, Adrià devised these easy and entertaining meringue-coated fruit skewers. <em>Chupa Chups Julio Verne,</em> or Jules Verne lollipops, is what he calls them, no doubt because their look resembles something out of old-fashioned science fiction. Apple halves serve as a base so the skewers can stand upright in the oven. For serving, the “cloud-covered” fruit skewers look dramatic stuck into an unpeeled half pineapple.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 large egg whites</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large apple, cut in half</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">When I spent the holiday season in Madrid, I kept overhearing ladies exchange recipes for this classic Christmas compote, which combines dried and fresh fruit with red wine infused with vanilla and spices. Dried fruit in Spain—figs, <a id="page_434"/>peaches, cherries—is of exceptional quality, so seek out excellent organic dried fruit for the compote. If the prunes are very soft, add them along with the fresh fruit. Adjust the amount of sugar depending on the sweetness of the apple and pear; the liquid shouldn’t be syrupy sweet. The compote is wonderful on its own or with a scoop of Honey and Cinnamon Ice Cream (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_439">page 439</a>) and/or pound cake. If you’re serving the compote over ice cream or cake, you might want to strain it. Set aside the fruit, then cook the poaching liquid until it is reduced by half.</p>

<h3 class="h3o">LOURDES’S LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HELADO DE FRESAS DE LOURDES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">My elegant Madrid friend Lourdes Plana is the ultimate foodie. A former editor of <em>Restauradores</em> (a restaurant magazine) and a recipe columnist for a very popular women’s weekly called <em>Mía,</em> she now organizes Madrid-Fusión, a high-profile food conference that draws the world’s greatest chefs. She is the kind of cook who can turn something as basic as strawberry ice cream into a sensational treat. Unlike most strawberry ice creams, which rely on an egg-based custard, this one is just pure berries mixed with whipped cream. The berry flavor is particularly vivid, and the texture is somewhere between parfait and gelato. Make it in strawberry season when the berries are at their fragrant best. Lourdes suggests serving this freshly churned, or at least not frozen solid.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound fragrant ripe strawberries, hulled and chopped (about 2¾ cups)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 ⅓ cups heavy (whipping) cream, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the strawberries, lemon juice, and sugar in a food processor and puree.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the cream in a large bowl and whip it until medium-stiff peaks form. Thoroughly fold in the pureed strawberries. Refrigerate the strawberry mixture until chilled, then freeze it in an ice-cream maker following the manufacturer’s instructions. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 1 QUART</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HELADO DE MELOCOTON CON COMPOTA DE MELOCOTON</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In this delightful recipe, the great Catalan chef Carme Ruscalleda of the Michelin two-star Restaurant Sant Pau proves that you don’t need an ice-cream maker to have a frozen treat prepared <em>al momento.</em> Diced peaches macerated in muscatel infused with mint complement a no-fuss ice cream made of cream cheese and frozen peaches. Ripe white peaches are lovely in the compote.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PEACH COMPOTE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ripe aromatic peaches, blanched, peeled, pitted, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ to 1½ cups white dessert wine, such as Spanish white muscatel, Italian moscato, or American muscat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large fresh mint sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE ICE CREAM:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound frozen peaches, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ounces cream cheese (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13_note6">Note</a>)</strong></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">A basic ice cream custard is the little black dress of frozen desserts, infinitely adaptable to flavors beyond the predictable vanilla. As Spanish chefs will attest, herbal ice creams are wonderful with warm tarts and fall fruit desserts, particularly those made with apples; tea-flavored ice creams add a touch of adventure to chocolate desserts; and pepper ice creams pair beautifully with both berries <em>and</em> chocolate.</p>
<p class="sb-indentb">The Basic Custard you’ll find here can be infused with any of the flavors that follow. Just bring the milk mixture to a boil with the desired seasoning and let it stand. Heating the milk mixture in a microwave oven is a neat trick, as microwaving releases the fragrance of the aromatics better than cooking on a stove top does. For a lighter, more vividly flavored ice cream, double the amount of milk and omit the cream.</p>
<p class="sb-uln"><strong><span class="blue">BASIC CUSTARD</span></strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln">2 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="sb-uln">2 cups heavy (whipping) cream</p>
<p class="sb-uln">Ice-cream flavoring (suggestions follow)</p>
<p class="sb-uln">8 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="sb-uln">⅔ cup sugar</p>
<p class="sb-uln">1 small pinch of salt</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">1. Place the milk and cream in a large, heavy saucepan and bring just to a boil over medium-high heat with the flavoring of your choice. Or place the milk, cream, and flavoring in microwave-safe container and microwave on high power for 3 minutes. Let stand, covered, for as long as directed for the particular flavoring and strain if necessary, then bring back to a boil and turn off the heat.</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">2. Place the egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a medium-size bowl and whisk until very smooth. Pour about a quarter of the hot cream mixture into the eggs, stirring constantly and vigorously. Stir another quarter of the hot cream into the egg mixture, then whisk it into the saucepan with the remaining cream.</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">3. Cook the custard over medium-low heat, stirring constantly (make sure to stir around the bottom and side of the pan), until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Never let the custard boil or the eggs will curdle. (If the custard does curdle a little, a whiz in a blender should fix it.) As soon as the custard thickens, immediately pour it through a fine sieve set over the bowl. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and refrigerate the custard until chilled, at least 4 hours. (The custard can be made up to 2 days ahead.)</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">4. Freeze the chilled custard in an ice-cream maker following the manufacturer’s instructions. <strong>MAKES ABOUT 1½ QUARTS</strong></p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong><span class="blue">VARIATIONS: BEYOND VANILLA</span></strong></p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>BAY LEAF:</strong></span> Use 6 large fresh bay leaves or 4 dried bay leaves. Let stand for 2 hours. Strain before making the custard. This ice cream is sensational with <em>tarte tatin</em> and other warm apple desserts.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>BERGAMOT:</strong></span> Heat the milk mixture and ¼ cup loose Earl Grey tea leaves in a saucepan until it just begins to boil. Cover the pan and let steep for 15 minutes. Or add 5 Earl Grey tea bags to the hot milk mixture.

<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>LEMON AND LAVENDER:</strong></span> Use ⅓ cup dried lavender leaves and the zest of 2 lemons cut into long strips. Let stand for 1 hour. Strain before making the custard.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>PEPPER:</strong></span> For <strong>white pepper</strong> ice cream, use 1½ teaspoons crushed white peppercorns along with the seeds and pod of 1 vanilla bean. Let stand for 1 hour. Strain before making the custard.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HELADO DE ARROZ CON LECHE CON SALSA DE CARAMELO AL CAFE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Rice pudding finds its way into all kinds of exciting desserts in modern Spanish kitchens. It’s turned into ethereal creams and foams, set with gelatin and used as a filling for tarts, and transformed into a frozen treat, as here. For anybody who loves rice pudding <em>and</em> ice cream, this is heaven. (Of course, the rice pudding is also delicious on its own, unfrozen.) The ice cream is best served soft and freshly churned; when frozen too long it tends to solidify and becomes somewhat grainy. If you’re making it ahead, let it sit at room temperature for about twenty minutes before serving. The caramel and coffee sauce is a perfect foil, but I also love this ice cream with a tart fruit puree or with drizzles of sweet, raisiny Pedro Ximénez sherry. I thank María Jesús Gil de Antuñano, one of Spain’s most prolific and popular recipe developers, for allowing me to adapt her recipe.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 cups whole milk</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_440"/>SPANISH ICE CREAM: THE LATEST IN COOL</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Combining ice with food or drink goes back millennia, to China, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome. Credit for Spain’s love affair with <em>helado</em> can be traced to Moorish caliphs sweltering in Granada who had ice hauled down from the cool peaks of the Sierra Nevada to make sherbets—refreshing slushes of fruit, honey, and ice. In the 1560s Basilius Villafranca, a Spanish physician living in Rome, produced the first solid cream-based chilled dessert, employing ice sprinkled with saltpeter. By the seventeenth century, Spain’s ice trade was booming; muleteers transported it from mountain tops to big cities, where it was stored in vast underground ice houses called <em>pozos de nieve</em>. Though Spain is as fond of ice cream as any hot Mediterranean country, its <em>helados</em> were delicious but not especially memorable. Until, that is, Ferran Adrià and his pastry-chef brother Albert came along.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">I will never forget my first tasting menu at Adrià’s restaurant in 1997. Among other avant-garde provocations—smoked water mousse, sardines with raspberry foam—I sampled a stunning Parmesan ice-cream sandwich, a thrillingly outlandish sorbet of caramelized eggplant, a celestial savory scoop of frozen <em>ajo blanco</em> (almond gazpacho), and a crunchy caramel tube filled with an intriguing smoked bacon ice cream. I’ve never looked at vanilla ice cream again.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Blurring boundaries between hot and cold and sweet and savory became one of Adrià’s signature trademarks, soon copied by young chefs all over Spain. No longer confined to dessert status, ice creams, sorbets, and granitas appear on modern menus in shot glasses as tapas or as cool counterpoints to fish, meat, or vegetables. White asparagus with truffle ice cream, anyone? Or how about raw oysters with a cool dollop of soft fennel ice cream and a flourish of spicy orange granita? Thanks to powerful emulsifying machines like the Thermomix and to secret alchemical formulas that include converted sugars and high-tech stabilizers, Spain’s techno ice creams are smoother and airier than anything you might have tasted before. The flavors are bright and attention grabbing, ranging from sweet (smoked chocolate, caramelized quince, rice pudding) to savory (cèpes, artichokes, foie gras, sea urchins) to savory-sweet (cheese, olive oil, sherry vinegar). A space-age contraption called a Paco Jet, which aerates frozen mixtures at very high speed, allows Spanish chefs to garnish dishes with <em>polvo helado</em> (frozen dust) of, say, cheese, smoked potato, or chiles. The latest sensation? Liquid nitrogen: a gas that flash-freezes at negative 196°C. A substance dipped in the vaporous nitro bath can emerge solid on the outside yet liquid within; it can even be both cold <em>and</em> hot. Ice creams and sorbets freeze in an instant, with all the ingredients perfectly integrated and softly gelled. Not to stop there, Adrià is playing with a teppan nitro, his sci-fi take on the Japanese-style teppanyaki griddle—it freezes instead of heating.</p>

<h3 class="h3o">ROQUEFORT ICE CREAM WITH PEARS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HELADO DE ROQUEFORT CON PERAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Combining the cheese and dessert courses into one delicious package, cheese ice creams are featured on many modern Spanish menus. Blue cheese ice cream in particular is a tasty and terrific idea. While pears make perfect sense, the ice cream can also be paired with other fruit, especially figs, either fresh, roasted, or in a quick compote. Instead of Roquefort, you can substitute Gorgonzola. And try making the ice cream with a mild or aged goat cheese, too.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE ROQUEFORT ICE CREAM:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ cups half-and-half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces Roquefort, finely crumbled</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 vanilla bean</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large strip of lemon zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size, ripe but firm Bartlett pears, peeled, cored, and cut into small dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_442"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the Roquefort ice cream: Place the half-and-half, corn syrup, and Roquefort in a heavy medium-size saucepan and heat over medium-low heat, stirring, until the cheese is completely melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not let the half-and-half boil. If the mixture doesn’t quite seem smooth enough, strain it into a clean saucepan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a medium-size bowl and whisk until very smooth. Pour about a quarter of the hot half-and-half mixture into the egg mixture, stirring constantly and vigorously. Stir another quarter of the half-and-half into the egg mixture, then whisk it into the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Cook the custard over medium-low heat, stirring constantly (make sure to stir around the bottom and side of the pan), until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Never let the custard boil or the eggs will curdle. (If the custard does curdle a little, a whiz in a blender should fix it.) As soon as the custard thickens, immediately pour it through a fine sieve set over a bowl. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and refrigerate the custard until chilled, at least 4 hours. (The custard can be made 2 days ahead.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Freeze the chilled custard in an ice-cream maker following the manufacturer’s instructions, then transfer it to a container and freeze it briefly, about 1 hour. The ice cream is best freshly churned. If making ahead, let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Make the pear compote: Place the wine, sugar, and ¾ cup water in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and, using the tip of a small knife, scrape the seeds into large saucepan. Add the vanilla bean pod and the lemon zest and simmer to infuse the wine mixture, 5 minutes. Add the pears and a little more water if there doesn’t seem to be enough liquid in the pan and bring the liquid back to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer the pears until they are very soft but still hold their shape, about 20 minutes. Add lemon juice to taste and transfer the compote to a bowl. Refrigerate, covered, until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To serve, remove and discard the lemon zest and the vanilla bean pod from the compote.

<h3 class="h3c">GREAT GRANITAS</h3>
<p class="noindentt">Moorish nobility in medieval Andalusia chilled down with sherbets made with ice transported from the mountains. In present-day Spain, <em>granizados</em> (granitas) shine in contemporary desserts and even in appetizers and entrées. A breeze to prepare and requiring no fancy equipment other than a metal pan and a sturdy fork, the unusual <em>granizados</em> here, both sweet and savory, are perfect summer refreshers.</p>
<p class="indent">To make a granita, pour the mixture into a shallow metal dish, such as a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan or a 9-inch metal pie plate (the shallower the dish, the faster the granita will freeze). Cover the granita with aluminum foil and place it on a level shelf in the freezer. Freeze until ice crystals begin to form on the sides and the bottom of the pan, about 30 minutes, then stir it with a fork and return it to the freezer. Keep stirring and mashing the granita as the ice crystals continue to form, about every 30 minutes or so, until all the liquid has been completely frozen. This should take about 3 hours for most flavors, longer for granitas containing alcohol. Then, fluff and mash the granita one final time and leave it in the freezer for another 20 minutes or so before serving. If you’re making the granita ahead of time, transfer it to a plastic container and keep it frozen for as long as you need. Fluff with a fork before serving.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_444"/>How much sugar you add to the recipes that follow will depend on your taste. Keep in mind, however, that the sweetness fades once the granita is frozen.</p>

<p class="noindent">Valencia’s signature cocktail, <em>Agua de Valencia</em> is an enticing blend of freshly squeezed orange juice, <em>cava,</em> and a liqueur. Each bar has its “secret” recipe. Transformed into granita, it’s a treat with sliced strawberries soaked in a bit of Cointreau or alongside a chocolate or citrus dessert, such as Valencian Orange Tart (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_402">page 402</a>).</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MAGDALENAS DE NARANJA Y PISTACHOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The irresistible tea cakes called <em>magdalenas</em> are Spain’s answer to French madeleines or American muffins. Their fluffy, light texture resembles madeleines, but <em>magdalenas</em> are shaped like cupcakes or muffins and contain the healthier olive oil instead of butter. This version comes from Barcelona’s master baker Xavier Canal, who has contributed other terrific sweets to this book. The Moorish-inspired flavors—orange, nuts, and a touch of orange flower water—are particularly enticing. For a variation, Xavier suggests flavoring half of the batter with orange and pistachios (use half the amounts indicated) and the other half with anything from dark chocolate chips to whole raspberries or blueberries to almond extract. While the <em>magdalenas</em> do keep nicely, they are best warm. Baked in mini muffin tins, they are great for coffee breaks or breakfast or as after-dinner petits fours. Don’t use olive oil that is too assertive or peppery.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong><a id="page_449"/>1 cup cake flour (not self-rising)</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest, or more to taste</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the eggs in a large warm mixing bowl and, using an electric mixer, beat them until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the 1⅓ cups confectioners’ sugar and continue beating at high speed until the eggs are pale yellow and approximately triple in volume, about 5 minutes. Working in three batches, beat in the sifted flours, alternating with the cream, orange juice, and olive oil. Stir in the pistachios, orange zest, and orange flower water. Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Stir the batter well before proceeding.</p>

Do not let the <em>magdalenas</em> overbake; they dry out in an instant. Let the <em>magdalenas</em> cool on a rack for about 20 minutes, then remove them from the tin(s).

Serve thin slices of it with coffee after a festive meal, or take it as a gift to your friends—in Spain no one would ever show up for a holiday meal without bearing <em>turrón.</em></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 large navel oranges</strong></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">In Spain, there is no better way to say “Feliz Navidad” than with a gift of <em>turrón,</em> a confection too exquisite to be simply called nougat or fudge. Come Christmas time, the lines at Casa Mira, Madrid’s antique <em>turrón</em> house, are so long, matronly salesladies dispense small tastes to shoppers to sweeten the wait. Whenever I’m in Madrid during the winter holidays I always join the queue—especially to snag some free samples and get a few Christmas recipes from the ladies in line.</p>
<p class="sb-indent"><em>Turrón</em> these days can get pretty baroque, ranging in flavor from candied egg yolk to coconut, praline, truffle, and glacé fruit. Purists, however, swear by the two “original” kinds: the soft luscious <em>turrón</em> from Jijona and the deliciously brittle Alicante <em>turrón,</em> both produced in the Levante, where <em>maestros turroneros</em> have been plying their trade for over five centuries. The word is possibly from the Latin <em>torrere,</em> to toast, while <em>turrón’s</em> ingredients—honey and nuts—point to the Arabic heritage of the sweet.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The <em>turrón</em> production season starts in September and lasts until early winter, when the Christmas and Epiphany fiestas are finally over and everybody has pretty much overdosed on the confection. The defining ingredient is the locally grown marcona almonds, which are toasted, crushed and mixed with egg whites, and heated with sugar and wild orange blossom and rosemary honey. After a long, thorough grinding and blending, <em>turrón</em> is shaped into blocks and cut into the characteristic slabs, the sight of which make Spanish mouths water. The country consumes over 35,000 tons of <em>turrón</em> a year, most of it during Christmas. <em>Feliz Navidad!</em></p>

Place the figs in a bowl that will hold them snugly. Pour the hot brandy over the figs and let soak for about 30 minutes, stirring several times. Drain the figs thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. (If you’d like, the brandy can be reused in baking or to plump dried fruit.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Using the tip of a small, sharp knife, make a deep incision in the bottom of a fig and push an almond inside. Repeat with the remaining figs and almonds. (Calimyrna dried figs often come tightly pressed together in round packages. If this is the case, once the figs are stuffed, pat and squeeze them lightly between your fingers to restore their round shape.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the chocolate in a small stainless-steel mixing bowl set over a pot of simmering water or in the top of a small double boiler (over simmering water) over low heat and stir until it melts completely, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter and stir until the chocolate mixture is glossy, then <a id="page_453"/>remove from the heat. The melted chocolate mixture needs to be at least 1½ inches deep to cover the figs. If the level in the mixing bowl or double boiler is too shallow, scrape about half of it into a 1-cup measure, replenishing it as needed.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Line a small baking sheet or a large plate with aluminum foil or use a Silpat pan liner, if you have one. Holding a fig by the stem, dip it in the chocolate mixture, turning to coat it completely and letting the excess drip off. If the stem is not long enough to hold, you can skewer the fig on a toothpick. Place the chocolate-dipped fig on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining figs.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Refrigerate the figs until the chocolate is completely set, about 2 hours. After an hour, use a thin spatula or knife to gently separate the figs from the aluminum foil or pan liner so they don’t stick. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 16 FIGS</strong></span></p>
