<p class="tx2"><b><i>Verdure alla griglia</i> are usually slices of courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), (bell) pepper, asparagùs and sometimes onions and tomatoes cooked quickly on a grill. Thin slices of courgette, red onion and radicchio can be dry-fried in a frying or a griddle pan, which is what we have done in the photograph opposite. However, they do take a while and you have to watch them carefully and turn them frequently so that they don’t bur. My favourite way to grill them is dry-grilled over a proper charcoal fire then dressed with good olive oil and salt. But since we don’t have an open fire in our kitchen, we pan- or oven-roast them instead. They are wonderful on their own, as <i>contorni</i> or as the base for a sauce instead of pasta.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>This versatile recipe can be used with any vegetable you have that roasts well. As Tuscans follow the seasons, naturally soft vegetables such as aubergines, courgettes and cherry tomatoes are available at the same time of year – summer. They roast quickly and pair well. Similarly, winter vegetables such as cauliflowers, celery, celeriac and carrots make a wonderful winter roast and have slightly longer cooking times, so do bear this in mind. Onions, celery, herbs and garlic go well with both.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<h4><span class="u">SUMMER ROASTED VEGETABLES</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>2 red (bell) peppers, quartered, cored and seeds removed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 courgettes (zucchini), cut into 1 cm (½ in) slices</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 large aubergine (eggplant), cut into 1 cm (½ in) slices</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 medium red onions, peeled and cut into 12 wedges</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5–6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (enough to coat the vegetables)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 garlic cloves, skin left on</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4–5 sprigs of fresh thyme and/or rosemary</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">WINTER ROASTED VEGETABLES</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 medium red onions, peeled and cut into 12 wedges</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>⅓ celeriac, cut into wedges similar to the size of the onions</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 medium carrots, cut into batons the size of your little finger</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 celery stalk, cut into 2 cm (¾ in) slices</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 leek, trimmed and cut into 2 cm (¾ in) slices</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5–6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (enough to coat the vegetables)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 garlic cloves, skin left on</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4–5 few sprigs of fresh thyme and/or rosemary</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F/Gas 6). Put the vegetables in a large bowl with a big pinch of salt, a few twists of pepper and the oil, and mix thoroughly with your hands. Lay them on a baking tray in a single layer. This is important – if they overlap or are piled on top of each other, the vegetables will steam rather than roast, and become soggy. Squash the garlic cloves lightly with the flat side of a large knife to release their flavour. Add them to the tin. Tuck the herbs under the vegetables to stop them burning.</p>
<p class="tx">Roast for 25–35 minutes, or until the vegetables are starting to brown around the edges and are just cooked through. Serve straight away or allow to cool to room temperature</p>
