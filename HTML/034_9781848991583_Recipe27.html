<p class="normal"><b>Gnocchi is a kind of dumpling made with potato or semolina, and the name comes from the Italian word nocchio meaning “knot in the wood,” which I find very charming. You will see I’ve changed the shape slightly to make the gnocchi easier to roll and I also deep-fry them to give a crisp, golden outside. The carrot juice dressing is great and so is the crunchy almond topping.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes cooling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups almond milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">1⅓ cups extra-fine semolina, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon sunflower oil, plus extra for deep-frying</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup blanched almonds</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ ounces stale sourdough bread, torn into small pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon roughly chopped chervil, or dill or chives, plus extra to serve</p>
<p class="acktxt">2½ cups carrot juice</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Pour the almond milk into a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat, then slowly pour in the semolina. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring continuously with a spatula, until you have a thick, stiff paste. Remove the pan from the heat and season with salt and pepper, then stir in half the butter and all of the Parmesan.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Generously dust the countertop with semolina. Take a small ball of the mixture about 1 inch in diameter. Roll it on the countertop with the palm of your hand into a cylinder about ⅝ inch in diameter, gently pressing one end, while still rolling, to form a point. Roll again in the semolina to fully coat, then leave to one side. Repeat to make the remaining gnocchi.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and the almonds and fry 1 to 2 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until they are lightly colored. Drain off any excess oil, then add the remaining butter, the bread and garlic and toss to combine. After another 1 to 2 minutes, when the butter is foaming, toss once more, then drain in a strainer. Tip the contents of the strainer onto a double layer of paper towels and leave to cool and become crunchy. Roughly chop to a crumble consistency, season with a little salt and pepper, then stir in the chervil and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Pour the carrot juice into a saucepan and cook over medium heat about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces by half and is slightly syrupy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Meanwhile, pour enough sunflower oil for deep-frying into a deep-fat fryer or a deep, wide saucepan and heat to 325°F, or until a cube of bread browns in 40 seconds. Add the gnocchi, a few at a time, to the hot oil and deep-fry 3 to 4 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked all the way through and crisp and golden on the outside. Drain on paper towels and keep warm while you fry the remaining gnocchi. (You can reheat the fried gnocchi just before serving by briefly returning them to the hot oil, then draining again on paper towels.) Serve the gnocchi hot, sprinkled with the almond crumb and finished with a generous drizzle of carrot juice and a sprinkling of chervil.</p>
