<p class="normal"><b>In this recipe, I have poached the pollock in coconut milk with lemongrass to add an Asian accent, but not too much as I’m still influenced mainly by the cooking of my home country, France. This is a favorite of my wife, Claire—say no more, the girl knows! You can mash any leftover sauce into your mashed potatoes to go with this dish, if you like.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">2½ cups whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¾ cups coconut milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 pollock fillets, skin on, about 5 ounces each</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 garlic cloves, unpeeled, lightly crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 lemongrass stalk, bruised</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">Creamed Mashed Potatoes (see <a href="017_9781848991583_Recipe11.html#pageid_20">page 20</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the cream and coconut milk in a wide, shallow sauté pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, melt the butter with the oil oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat until the butter turns golden. Season the skin of the pollock with salt and pepper. Put in the skillet, skin-side down, with the garlic and cook 3 to 4 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden brown.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Turn the pollock over and pour in the simmering cream and coconut milk—the liquid needs to be just below the height of the fish so the skin doesn’t soften. Add the garlic cloves and lemongrass to the liquid and simmer 8 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. To check the fish is ready, press lightly on the skin and you will see the flesh at the side of the fillet just start to flake away.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Lift the fish out of the pan, cover and keep it warm. Return the sauté pan to the heat and simmer 5 to 8 minutes until the liquid reduces by at least half and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add any juices from the resting fish and season with salt and pepper to taste, then pass the sauce through a fine strainer, using a ladle to help you. Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve with mashed potatoes.</p>
