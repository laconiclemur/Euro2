<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ragù tropiano</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My mother, a Tropiano, makes a recipe for <span class="txit">ragù</span> that is lighter than the Tucci version. It is served the same way—spooning just the tomato sauce over pasta as a first course, followed by the stewed meat as a second course. She also uses it in lasagna by shredding the tender cooked meat into smaller pieces and ladling it between layers of homemade pasta and ricotta cheese for a traditional lasagna casserole.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Add the pork to the pot and brown evenly on both sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and add to the bowl with the beef.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Stir the garlic and onions into the pot and cook until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and stir to loosen any bits of meat that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Stir in the tomatoes and basil. Return the meat to the pot, along with any juices that have accumulated in the bottom of the bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the tomatoes have sweetened and the meat is very tender, about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours.</p>
