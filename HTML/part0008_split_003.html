			<p class="rec-intro">This is a very lightly set panna cotta that can’t be turned out so make it in pretty glass bowls for serving. The panna cottas are topped with pistachio crumbs made from a shortbread-like mixture and decorated with tuiles and figs. Make all the trimmings to create a really special dessert or just garnish with figs – up to you. It will always be a delight. </p>

			<p class="body">To make the panna cottas, pour the cream into a pan and add the fig leaves, vanilla pods and sugar. Bring this to the boil, then whisk in the gelatine and pour in the buttermilk. Stir, then strain through a sieve into 12 glass bowls and leave in the fridge to set for 8 hours. </p>
			<p class="body">For the tuiles, heat all the ingredients except the bicarbonate in a pan to 140°C or until the mixture starts to turn golden. Stir in the bicarbonate of soda, then pour the mixture into a deep dish lined with a silicone baking mat or non-stick baking parchment. Be very careful as it will spit and splash. Leave this to cool and set.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Blitz the cooled honeycomb to a powder in a food processor, then sprinkle it on to a silicone baking mat or a baking tray lined with non-stick baking parchment and put it in the oven for a couple of minutes until melted. Cut into whatever shapes you like. </p>
			<p class="body">For the pistachio crumbs, mix the flour, ground almonds and sugar together. Using your fingertips, gently work in the butter and pistachios – the mixture should just come together into a paste so don’t overwork it. Wrap it in cling film and chill for an hour.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4. Roll out the pistachio paste to about 0.5–1cm thick and place it on a baking tray. Prick it with a fork and cook for about 25 minutes. Leave to cool, then break up into crumbs. Toss the figs in the oil and pepper, then cut into bite-sized pieces. </p>
			<p class="body">When the panna cottas are set, serve them topped with pistachio crumbs and a couple of tuiles and figs. </p>
