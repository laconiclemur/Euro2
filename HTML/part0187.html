<p class="first_paragraph_ch_ts" id="sab0001324"><a id="pg255" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>My father loves desserts. Whenever our family went out to eat, my dad would always have a classic like <em class="calibre9">crema catalana</em>, <em class="calibre9">cuajada</em> (see <a href="part0194.html#pg262" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) or <em class="calibre9">flan</em> (see <a href="part0204.html#pg275" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) – creamy desserts you eat with a little spoon, that slip down easily.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0001325">I tend to be too full for dessert – I’ll have one bite, two maximum. I’ve always been like this about sweet things, though I do love Nutella … Sometimes when I go to Spain, especially the south, my girlfriend will have a dessert at the end of lunch or dinner and I’ll have a plate of <em class="calibre9">jamón</em> and a glass of wine. A plate of ham for dessert: I love that. So it’s probably not surprising that my favourite desserts aren’t overly sweet.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0001326">One of the best, most simple ways to finish a meal is with fruit. My parents were very good about this: we always had a huge basket full of apples, pears, oranges, bananas, and some more exotic fruits like kiwis and mangoes. This is something that’s stayed with me, and we often made fruit salad for the staff at Barrafina. Of course, there are other ways to eat fruit too – when it’s paired with crisp pastry, even I can be tempted (see cherry tart <a href="part0201.html#pg270" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>, pear tart <a href="part0202.html#pg272" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>, thin apple tart <a href="part0209.html#pg279" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>).</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0001327">Many of these recipes make a good breakfast or go well with a late afternoon cup of coffee or tea: doughnuts and hot chocolate sauce (see <a href="part0206.html#pg276" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) and <em class="calibre9">torrijas</em> (see <a href="part0190.html#pg258" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) are two obvious candidates, but <em class="calibre9">arroz con leche</em> (see <a href="part0188.html#pg256" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) would make a warming, fragrant start to the day too.</p>
