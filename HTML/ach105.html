<p class="noindentb">Serve these beans as a side dish with pork, stewed meat, lamb, or grilled fish. They are also delightful pureed and served on bruschetta for lunch or as an appetizer. The advantage of using great Northern or navy beans is that they do not require any presoaking. If you use other dried beans, such as cannellini, they may be cooked, drained, and set aside several hours before you add them to the sautéed vegetables.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound dried navy or great Northern beans</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 cups water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 large fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Two 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup diced pancetta or bacon (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup diced carrots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup diced celery</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 fresh or canned whole plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Rinse the beans, removing any oddly colored ones or stones. Place the beans in a large flameproof casserole set over low heat. Add the water and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the garlic, 3 of the sage leaves, 1 sprig of rosemary, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Simmer until the beans are tender but not mushy, about 45 minutes. Strain, discarding the garlic and sage, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Add the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil to a sauté pan set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the pancetta or bacon, if using, stirring briskly. Stir in the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring to soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Chop the remaining 3 sage leaves and the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig, and add to the vegetables along with the tomatoes and parsley. Then season with <a id="page_209"/>salt and pepper. Cook to warm the tomatoes, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the beans and reduce the heat to medium. Cook to warm the beans and to flavor them with the tomatoes, about 10 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper if desired, and serve.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Medium red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Thyme or marjoram may be substituted for or added to the sage and rosemary. A terrific way to use any leftover beans is to puree them in a blender or food processor until smooth. Add a small amount of olive oil (or a small quantity of the water the beans cooked in) and process until the beans reach a spreadable consistency. Serve at room temperature on toasted bread or crackers as an appetizer or as a lunch dish. Pureed beans may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen in an airtight container for up to 1 month.</p>
