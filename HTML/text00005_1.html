<p class="pf">From the poetry of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, I recognize a basic truth that “I am a part of all I have met.” From my family to my friends and to the teachers, both formal and in passing, I owe a debt of thanks and acknowledgment. My life is more than what I have inherited through blood and body. I have had the incredible support of extended family and friends, who somehow magically appear just when I need encouragement the most.</p>
<p>This is for you, my family. To my late mother, Esther Honkala Luoma, who taught me to cook on the woodstove, and my late father, Ted, who put ingenuity into my gene pool. To my husband, Dick; kids, Cathy, Greg, Susanna; and my grandkids, who are “grand” indeed: Niko, Tomas, Isabella, Kieran, Celka, Lian, Frans, and Kaisa. My hope is that these stories will shed a bit of light on each of you. Also, for my nine brothers and sisters and countless cousins, there may be something here that explains some mysterious family trait.</p>
<p>To the folks at the University of Minnesota Press, who have been so amazingly supportive—Erik Anderson, Kristian Tvedten, and others: I couldn’t have done it without you!</p>
