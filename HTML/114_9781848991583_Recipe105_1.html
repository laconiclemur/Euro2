<p class="normal"><b>Sadly, cabbage is often overcooked, resulting in a virtually flavorlesss vegetable. I aim to rectify that sad situation with this throughly modern steamed cabbage recipe. I have used Boston butt, moister and tastier than lean cuts like tenderloin, which can be dry.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CREAMY MUSTARD SAUCE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons dry white wine</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespooons Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons light cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tarragon sprig</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Cut off the top one-third of the cabbage, like a lid, and leave to one side. Gently pull out the leaves so you can get to the middle, without breaking them off. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop out most of the inner leaves, leaving an outer casing about ¾ inch thick. (Use the inner leaves for another dish or serve them sautéed with a little butter.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the oil and diced pork and sauté 4 to 5 minutes until it is golden brown, then transfer to a bowl. Add the onion, carrots, garlic and pancetta to the pan and sauté 4 to 5 minutes until the onion is just soft. Add the stock and deglaze the pan by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Cook 5 to 8 minutes until it reduces by two-thirds and is syrupy. Mix with the pork.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> In a separate bowl, put the ground pork, liver, egg, bread crumbs, hazelnuts and parsley, season with salt and pepper and mix well. Mix this into the now slightly cool pork and vegetable mixture.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Put two sheets of plastic wrap, about 20 inches long, on top of each other, then put another two sheets across the middle, giving you a cross shape. Put the hollowed-out cabbage in the middle, then gently open it out and fill it with the pork mixture. Set the lid back on top and then tightly wrap in the plastic wrap. Secure each end with a knot, pushing out any air.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer, with a steamer insert on top. Put the cabbage in the steamer, cover and cook 50 minutes, or until the liquid runs clear when you pierce the pork through the plastic wrap with a knife. Turn off the heat and leave to rest in the pan 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Meanwhile, to make the sauce, melt the butter with the oil a nonstick skillet over medium heat. When it is foaming, add the shallot and cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Add the wine, turn the heat up to high and cook until it reduces by half. Add the stock and continue cooking until it reduces by half again, then turn the heat down to low, bring to a simmer and slowly stir in the cream and mustard. Add the tarragon and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>7</b> Lift out the cabbage, discard the plastic wrap and cut the cabbage into quarters. Serve with the creamy mustard sauce.</p>
