<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In Seville and Córdoba, they eat turkey at Christmas. Sometimes it is simply turkey pieces cooked in sherry or white wine with ground almonds to thicken the sauce. My friend Loli Flores, who has always worked in restaurants in Seville, told me that in their country house they fed brandy to the turkeys and later injected their meat with brandy. Count José María Ybarra (see page 412) told me that his mother had the nuns make the family turkey. They deboned it and injected the meat with brandy. One stuffing was a mix of sausage meat, chestnuts, and brandy; another was dried fruit, pine nuts, and bread soaked in milk.</span> Pavo trufado <span class="italic">was layers of turkey and pork tenderloin slices, with slices of</span> jamón <span class="italic">and black truffles in between. I am telling you this in case you will be inspired to improvise.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Here is a simple way of roasting turkey that keeps it juicy and flavors it with brandy. The traditional Catalan stuffing for turkey is the same as the one for capon on page 367. Put it in a baking dish covered with foil and place it in the oven for the last hour of cooking.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 14</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 turkey (about 14 pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">Olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">1 orange, cut in half</p>
<p class="qun">12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) butter, softened</p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup brandy</p>
<p class="qun1">1½ recipes Stuffing (page 367)</p>
<p class="recsum">Lay two large sheets of foil in a roasting pan, one of them crosswise and the other lengthwise. Brush with oil and lay the turkey breast side up in the middle. Remove any trussing, sprinkle inside with salt, and push the orange into the cavity.</p>
<p class="summary">Blend the butter and brandy. Push it between the breast meat and skin: lift up the skin starting from the neck— gently work your fingers, then your hand, under it—and push in the soft butter and brandy, pressing on the skin to ease it into an even layer over the breasts. Tuck the flap of skin in at the neck to keep it from leaking out.</p>
<p class="summary">Wrap the turkey in the foil so that the parcel is roomy but well sealed. Cook in a preheated 425°F oven for 30 minutes, then lower the heat to 335°F and cook for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="summary">Open the foil parcel, turn up the oven to 400°F, and roast for another 30 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and brown and the juices run clear when you pierce a thigh.</p>
