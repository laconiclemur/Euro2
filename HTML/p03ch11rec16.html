<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Migas,</span> a dish of fried bread crumbs, is the legendary food of shepherds that was adopted by agricultural laborers along the old transhumance routes that crisscrossed Spain. (These were the routes that sheep took seasonally to reach new pastures.) They cooked on little braziers (<span class="italic">braseritos</span>). The dish has recently become very fashionable. I ate it in restaurants around the country and at a glamorous party in Madrid. Supermarkets sell it vacuum-packed, ready to heat through. Depending on the region, the bread crumbs are fried in olive oil or lard, or a mixture of both. In La Mancha, Aragon, and Andalusia, they are cooked in olive oil. Again depending on the region, <span class="italic">migas</span> is eaten with fried bacon and chorizo, or blood sausage, and sometimes also eggs. There are those who eat <span class="italic">migas</span> with bits of <span class="italic">jamón</span>, and those who eat it with grapes and chocolate. In Granada, they eat it with anchovies, melon, and orange slices. Some like <span class="italic">migas</span> with a sprinkling of sugar. In the valley of the Duero River, they eat it like pasta, with a sauce made with fried onion, garlic, a chile pepper, and sweet <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. In Aragon, they make it with bacon, chorizo, and sweet and hot <span class="italic">pimentón</span>; in Navarre, with fried onion, garlic, and <span class="italic">jamón</span>.</p>
<p class="summary">My friend Cuqui Gonzáles de Caldas described how olive pickers in Andalusia made <span class="italic">migas</span> during the harvest. The crumbs were fried in olive oil in a huge shallow communal pan by a “<span class="italic">miguero</span>”—and they all served themselves from the pan and ate them with olives, raw turnips, and fried or grilled sardines. To finish, they had more <span class="italic">migas</span> with oranges. Cuqui’s mother, who came from Osuna in Andalusia, used to make the dish for her family. There is an art of tearing up bread into very small pieces with your fingers, and Cuqui showed me how to do it on our table at the Sol y Sombra Bar in Seville. It reminded me of a man in a Paris restaurant I saw tearing up bread and making piles; I thought he had an obsessive disorder until I saw him later in the park feeding birds.</p>
