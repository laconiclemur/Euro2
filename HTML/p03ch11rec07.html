<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This has an unusual but delicate flavor and looks dramatic. When fishermen in the Costa Brava and along the Mediterranean coast used the ink from their squid and cuttlefish, there was rarely more than enough for a pale gray rice, so they made it darker by caramelizing the onions. Nowadays you can buy squid ink in tiny plastic sachets, and chefs like to produce an intensely black rice. This recipe is from</span> Corpus de la Cuina Catalana <span class="italic">(see page 105). I added white wine, as some people do; you can omit it and increase the quantity of fish stock by a cup. If you cannot make or buy good fish stock (page 126), use good chicken stock (page 125). Serve</span> alioli <span class="italic">(page 141) with it.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 AS A MAIN COURSE; 8 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 medium onions, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">3 tomatoes, grated (see page 129) or chopped</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound cleaned baby squid, bodies cut into rings, tentacles left whole</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio</p>
<p class="qun">4½ cups fish or chicken stock</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">4 to 5 (4-gram) packets of squid ink</p>
<p class="qun">A handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun1">1½ cups <span class="italic">Alioli</span> (page 141)</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onions in the oil in a 16- to 18-inch paella pan over medium heat, stirring often, until soft and golden. Add the tomatoes, season with a little salt and pepper, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and the oil is sizzling.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the squid and cook over medium heat, stirring and turning them, for 5 to 8 minutes. Add the rice and stir so that the grains are well coated with the sauce. (You can prepare the dish in advance up to this stage, up to an hour in advance, and reheat before continuing.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, bring the stock and wine to a boil in a saucepan. Squeeze the contents of the ink packets (I used 4 and liked it that way; 5 give a more intense black color) into a small bowl and stir in a little of the stock to dilute the ink thoroughly, then pour this into the pan and mix very well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the ink-stained stock over the rice, add salt to taste, and stir, spreading the rice evenly in the pan (do not stir again). Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, then lower the heat and cook for 8 to 10 minutes more, or until the rice is tender; move the pan around and rotate it so the rice cooks evenly. If the rice gets too dry and you hear crackly frying noises before it is done, pour in a little boiling water.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve sprinkled with the parsley and accompanied by the <span class="italic">alioli.</span></p>
