</h1>
<p class="pf">In California restaurants abounded, and my job as a food editor at <i>Sunset</i>
 had planted seeds of optimism and curiosity about starting a restaurant of my own. I was excited at the idea of opening a Scandinavian restaurant in Duluth, especially after we had some lively discussions with a group of friends. (Duluth could still use a Scandinavian restaurant!)</p>
<p>One of our group immediately got busy looking for a building or site for our restaurant, which at the time was still nameless. All fired up, he found a building one day at the Mount Royal shopping center that was up for rent. It had been a restaurant called the Royal Inn and wasn’t far from the University of Minnesota Duluth campus.</p>
<p>When I inspected the facility, I found that the kitchen consisted of an open-topped gas-fired broiler and a refrigerator. Nothing else. It was obviously not a candidate for a Scandinavian restaurant, which would have required more space in the kitchen, more cooking stations, and better storage. It wasn’t a good deal, but we signed anyway.</p>
<p>Once the deal was made, I wrote the menu almost overnight. The basic idea was a variety of different burgers served open-faced on slices of homemade bread.</p>
<p>We met one evening shortly afterward at our house. The party consisted of two lawyers and their wives, our partner and his wife, Dick and myself. I had made sourdough bread, shaped one-third-pound hamburgers ready for grilling, and prepared a variety of sauces and toppings for the burgers. We called them “dinnerburgers.”</p>
<p>We started that night with the simple “Cannibalburger”—a smallish patty of raw lean meat, uncooked, with capers, parsley, anchovy strips, topped with a raw egg yolk, a version of the classic French steak tartare. There was the “Saunaburger”: served nude, with nothing on the patty resting on a toasted bun, with a “switch” of parsley, salad, and garnish in just the appropriate places. The “Duluth Blizzardburger” had a “drift” of sour cream on top. I had dubbed a cheese-topped variety the “Berwegerburger”—and later had to ask the cheesemakers, the Berwegers in the nearby village of Meadowlands, for permission to use the name. They declined, saying, “Why don’t you think of your own original name?” That one became the “Cheddarburger.” After that I got creative. We had the “Tyroleanburger,” topped with a sauce flavored with sap sago cheese, which sent the local food vendor we were using scrambling for a source. We later had to scratch that idea because the USDA had condemned sap sago due to the fact it was imported and had unprocessed herbs as its flavoring.</p>
<p>In the discussion that followed as we grilled and tasted our burgers, it emerged that we did not yet have a name for the restaurant. That was a problem. The brick-walled building sat on a hill at one end of a small shopping area and had a low-slung roof, no basement, and lots of big picture windows. One of us remarked that the building looked like somebody’s house.</p>
<p>“That’s it!” was the response. “We’ll call it ‘Somebody’s House’!” At that time, Duluth had the Hilltop House, the Sweden House, and a number of other “houses.”</p>
<p>We had no budget for advertising, yet Somebody’s House quickly became the talk of the town.</p>
<p>People would say, “Let’s go to Somebody’s House for dinner.” The inevitable response would be: “Whose house?”</p>
<p>We hired college students to do the cooking, serving, cleaning, and hosting for our guests. We hired my brother-in-law, Jack LaVoy, to be the manager. Things went along swimmingly. I handled ordering the food; Dick took care of the payroll—a complicated job with some forty-plus people on the payroll. One significant hire that we made was a UMD football star named Gary Doty, who later became the mayor of Duluth.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each school year, we’d notice that the supply of dishes and silverware had diminished. Apparently, we were furnishing dorm rooms with necessities that were “lifted” a piece at a time by some of the employees and guests. There was also the typical pilfering of food items, none of it done maliciously, but with the innocent thought that “just one doesn’t make a difference.”</p>

<p>To standardize the menu items, I wrote out recipes for each of the sauces that were to top the various burgers. One of our “chefs,” Don, loved to put his own personal touch on things—so he began tasting the sauces. That was okay, except for the “Fireburger.” This burger sauce was spiced with Tabasco, and each day, Don added a little more of the hot sauce until customers began complaining about the fire in the fireburger. We were ordering Tabasco sauce by the case every week!</p>
<p>Analyzing the situation, I came to realize that the human taster gets accustomed to the heat of peppers. Eventually Don’s additions to the sauce made it so hot it nearly “blew the tops” off several customers’ heads. To correct the situation, the chefs were ordered to follow the recipes, <i>not</i>
 their tongues!</p>
<p>Many of our burgers became customer favorites: the “Norskburger” was topped with a sauce made with gjetost cheese; the “Beatleburger” was topped with a “wig” of coleslaw; the “Mushroom Burger” was topped with a mushroom sauce; the “Great Dane” was topped with a fried egg, tomatoes, and cucumbers—and so the menu read, with two and a half dozen more “creative” burgers. The prices seem amazing to me today—they ranged from 85 cents to $1.50.</p>
<p>One that intrigued most everyone was the “Dareburger”—and I thought nobody would order it, but only talk about it. The description read: “The hamburger topped with vanilla ice cream, hot chocolate sauce, nuts, and a cherry.” The first to order this weird combo was an elderly banker, a gentleman who later became a regular customer. He asked for more chocolate sauce!</p>
<p>Eventually we decided that it was too much to handle. Our third child, Susanna, was a newborn and our two older children were in junior high. I found it difficult to concentrate on much more than just taking care of family affairs. Dick was teaching full-time at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Our payroll costs were high, so our profit-and-loss statement did not look good. We ended up selling the restaurant to two families for basically what we had put into the operation. They continued to run Somebody’s House for several years and were comfortably happy with their lives.</p>
<p>What follows are recipes for a few of the most popular items on the Somebody’s House menu.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Stroganoff Burger</a>

<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">2 tablespoons butter or canola oil</p>
<p class="rpil">8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms</p>
