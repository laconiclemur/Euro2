      <p>Why do some cultures, some countries, some cities, and some families have great food and
        others do not? The answer resides in the group’s willingness to deem cooking important. When
        you go anywhere in Spain, you realize in the first ten minutes that cooking is very
        important to these people. By the end of the day you realize it is not just important, it is
        sacred. There is a long and well-celebrated culinary history there. The Spaniards have great
        strength of character, which makes them proud and exuberant cooks. Their complex reality
        weaves a story of many cultures with sometimes tumultuously opposing political histories.
        Moors, Basques, Celts, Romans, and French have all contributed to this mosaic. There is
        intense feeling and emotion toward food that is deeply rooted in the Spanish identity. Life
        in Spain can be delicate—like saffron and honey—or fierce—like bold peppers and chorizos.
        History and passion combine to make the cuisine a celebration and extension of this great
        heritage. </p>
      <p>As a chef and a cook, I like to absorb ideas and bits of information from lots of sources
        that will combine to make me a better cook. I have been a chef and student of Spanish
        cooking for many years. There is a deep, fertile spring of inspiration to be found here.
        This book is the result of getting to know the ingredients and trial and error with using
        different flavor combinations. </p>
      <p>So, rather than documenting classic regional dishes, what I offer the reader here is a
        journal of recipes that are a result of my exploring flavors. The style of these recipes
        could be classified as a blend of traditional and modern. I do not try to replicate the
        classics when I cook. Instead I immerse myself in the mind-set of great cooking, which
        should be a balance of knowing the traditional ingredients, techniques, and flavor
        combinations without letting these limit the imagination. </p>
      <p>I discuss specific ingredients, flavors, and recipes in the pages that follow. But there
        are layers of flavors and hidden nuances that are not found in the recipes themselves. There
        is much to learn from this vast culinary landscape that can make us better cooks. I do not
        talk about having expensive knives and copper cookware, the latest food processor or
        watching the chefs on the food channel. None of these things will improve your cooking.
        Simply ask yourself when you are enjoying a great meal, “Why does this taste so good?” Here
        are a few answers my focus on Spanish cooking has revealed. </p>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e103"/>National pride is a flavor </h3>
      <p>The bustling streets of Madrid are alive with exuberance and pride. The cuisine is an
        integral part of life. The tapas bars are a proud display of jamón, chorizo, manchego, and
        olive oil. Madrilenos have a robust appetite for the real thing and enjoy educating visitors
        on their authentic dishes. Chefs at the food markets have strong relationships with growers,
        suppliers, and vendors. These relationships are vital and many were formed over generations.
        Again, cooking is important! Very basic, down-to-earth flavors can yield thrilling and
        sophisticated results when these relationships remain intact. Cooking is done with pride and
        is worn like a badge of honor. </p>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e107"/>Tradition adds flavor </h3>
      <p>A great culture is one that is well defined. To know the traditions and to love them and
        hold them sacred gives tremendous strength and foundation, and only then can you face the
        rest of the world with fearlessness. The biggest fear for someone holding to traditional
        culture in the modern age is that they will go too far, be left out on a limb, become lost
        and unable to find their way back. When the tradition is strong, there is no doubt that it
        will stay intact no matter how far you go. </p>

      </div>
      <p>Spaniards were able to literally go out to all corners of the earth exploring and
        conquering new worlds. They leapt fearlessly into the unknown. My favorite example of this
        is in the city of San Sebastian, where the old-world food traditions are solidly ingrained
        and deliciously evident when you stroll down the street. It does not surprise me, then,
        given my theory explained above, that this was also the birthplace of the greatest
        innovations in modern gastronomy and continues to redefine where the cutting edge is. In
        fact, this pattern is well documented in many areas of Basque life.</p>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e118"/>Exuberance adds flavor </h3>
      <p>“Keep the capacity to be surprised,” as famous Basque chef Juan Mari Arzak says. Passionate
        cooks cannot hide their affection for a perfectly ripe tomato or deny that the aroma of
        fresh bread can be the source of an emotional experience. New dishes will inspire more
        cooking, and the excitement builds in anticipation of what is yet to come in the culinary
        world. This is unfinished business and the surprises will keep flowing. </p>

      </div>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e127"/>History adds flavor </h3>
      <p>The walls of the Parte Vieja, the cultural center and Old Town of San Sebastian, have a
        patina created by generations of aromas, day after day after day. Layers of flavor and
        commitment can be tasted in the small bakeries and <span class="emphasis"><em>pinchos</em></span> bars every day. Also, the older folks are out and about in the
        bars and cafes and not at home in a rocking chair. They seem as if they are keeping a
        watchful eye on the food and making sure it is right. </p>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e134"/>Respect adds flavor </h3>
      <p>Every good cook has great affection and respect for the ingredients. The best cooks are
        open to being inspired and guided by the ingredients and are not trying to control and
        manipulate them. </p>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e138"/>A tablespoon of everyday life </h3>
      <p>Everything you do in the kitchen—even your thoughts, emotions, and presence of mind—will
        affect the flavor of your cooking. The way you think about ingredients, the way you move in
        the kitchen, the people you cook with, and the feeling you have toward the occasion you are
        cooking for all impact the flavor of your dishes. Genuinely wanting to please the recipients
        of your cooking is one of the best flavors! Cooking is tightly connected to the most
        intimate and essential aspects of life: family, tradition, health, happiness, celebration,
        social life, and etc. Our life and culture tells us when to cook, how to cook, when to eat,
        and with whom we should cook and eat. Our relationship to ingredients also enhances our
        relationship to the natural world and our environment. </p>
      <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e142"/>The love you have for the ocean and the
        fish in it adds flavor </h3>
      <p>On a recent trip to Sanlucar de Barremeda, a fishing village in Andalucia in the sherry
        triangle, where fish is caught and consumed in quantities that defy mathematics, a fisherman
        said to me, “The ocean must love us because it gives us a daily feast. Like mother’s milk.” </p>
      <div class="mediaobject" title="Photo of fresh fish.">

      </div>
      <p>“Proverbs are short sentences drawn from long and wise experience,” wrote Miguel Cervantes
        in <span class="emphasis"><em>Don Quixote</em></span> (1605). The same can be said of
        recipes: they are short statements that rely on generations of trial and error and
        experience. Most times when a chef comes up with something new, it is based on a traditional
        flavor combination that was established long before he was born. The cooking tradition
        continues and we can all participate in it. This book shares my thoughts about food and
        cooking and continues this legacy. I will always be inspired by artisanal ingredients,
        energized by cooks and chefs I have met along the way, and forever committed to cooking a
        memorable meal. <span class="emphasis"><em>Buen provecho!</em></span></p>
