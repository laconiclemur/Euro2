<h6 class="h6"><b>Democratic recipes that elevate humble ingredients to starring roles</b></h6>
<p class="normalw"><b>“Egalité” is a lovely word, and it would be great to drift away into all sorts of discussions and explanations—but that’s not for now. In this chapter, I will be talking about ingredients that were originally perceived as peasant fodder, but are now being rediscovered and enjoying new recognition. I’m sure you know what I mean by that—ingredients like rabbit, mushrooms, potatoes and simple herbs.</b></p>
<p class="normalw"><b>Underpin that with beautifully complementary ingredients. I’ve tried to create recipes in which the relationship between two, or sometimes more, ingredients, when combined with one another, make a perfectly balanced pairing—they are just great for each other. So you see, in that brief description, what we have captured in égalité.</b></p>
<p class="normalw"><b>So let me give you an example of some of the ingredients I have used in these recipes. There’s a beautiful Rabbit Terrine with Onion Marmalade (see <a href="062_9781848991583_Recipe54.html#pageid_86">page 86</a>), a great Pomme Farcie with Braised Boston Butt (see <a href="079_9781848991583_Recipe71.html#pageid_117">page 117</a>), Flounder with Celery Root and Pancetta Galette (see <a href="087_9781848991583_Recipe79.html#pageid_130">page 130</a>) and Lamb Sweetbreads and Wild Mushroom Vol-au-Vents (see <a href="082_9781848991583_Recipe74.html#pageid_123">page 123</a>). Egalité of high-quality ingredients!</b></p>
