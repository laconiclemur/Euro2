<h3 class="h3a">essential ingredients</h3>
<p class="para">
<strong>Anchovies</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Preserved in either oil or salt, anchovies are a must in my store cupboard. I use them in many recipes – a couple of fillets gently ‘dissolved’ in olive oil before adding other ingredients enhances the flavour without giving an unpleasant fishy taste. Salted anchovies need washing under cold running water. The ones in olive oil need no preparation.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Chillies</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">I always keep a few fresh red chillies in the fridge, as well as a bunch of dried chillies hanging up in the kitchen. When I run out of fresh chillies I rely on the dried supply. Dried chillies are more concentrated, which means they taste hotter, so use them with caution.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Dried pasta</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">I keep at least one type of short dried pasta, such as penne, fusilli or farfalle, one type of long pasta, such as spaghetti or tagliatelle, and a small pasta shape for soups. This means I can prepare different dishes to suit a particular shape.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Dried porcini mushrooms</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">You can find dried porcini almost everywhere these days. I generally keep a packet in the cupboard to enhance my mushroom dishes, especially out of season, when I crave that ‘wild forest fungi’ taste. Before use, soak the mushrooms in warm water for 30 minutes and then drain.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Vegetables</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">I like to have onions, celery, a few carrots and some leeks in store. They form the basis of so many sauces and other dishes that they are known in Italy as <em>i sapori</em>
 – the flavours. They should be finely chopped and sweated gently in a little olive oil at the start of cooking a dish.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Garlic</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">I couldn’t live without my beloved garlic! Look for bulbs with a pinkish-purple tinge to them, as this means they are very fresh. When garlic is fresh, the smell is strong but the flavour less intense. When it is dry, it tastes more pungent. Store garlic in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>
<p class="para1">When cooking, I like to crush the cloves roughly but leave them whole, sweat them gently in oil to infuse it, then remove them. I also like to slice the cloves very finely lengthways so they add just a subtle flavour to a dish. Be careful not to burn garlic, or it will taste bitter.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Herbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Almost all my recipes include some fresh herbs to enhance the flavour. Supermarkets sell all sorts of herbs in packets but I suggest you buy them in pots and keep them on your windowsill, or grow them in your garden. My favourites are flat-leaf parsley, basil, rosemary, thyme, bay, mint and sage, and I always have at least one pot of each. Besides tasting delicious, they look great in any kitchen and are easy to grow. Oregano is the only herb I keep dried in my store cupboard. Instead of chives, I often use the green part of spring onions.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">For cooking, mozzarella cheese made from cow’s milk (<em>fior di latte</em>
 ) is fine, but be sure to buy an Italian make, packed in water. If you find <em>mozzarella di bufala</em>
 (mozzarella made from buffalo milk), then eat it fresh, simply served with a drizzle of good-quality extra virgin olive oil and some salt and black pepper. This is how they eat it in Campania, the home of this wonderful cheese. Or make a traditional <em>insalata di caprese</em>
 : roughly slice the mozzarella and arrange it on a plate with some sliced ripe tomatoes, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with salt and fresh basil leaves. Made with good ingredients, this is the king of salads and encapsulates the taste of summer and Italy.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Oils</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Apart from Piedmont and Lombardy in the North, everywhere in Italy produces olive oil, so there is a wide variety available. In order for the oil to qualify as extra virgin, the production process has to meet several strict criteria – for example, the olives have to be hand-picked to avoid bruising and then taken to the mill immediately for pressing. Extra virgin olive oil is obtained from the first cold pressing of the olives.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_13"></a>
 I cannot stress the importance of investing in good-quality extra virgin olive oil. There are so many on the market these days that I suggest you spend a little time investigating which ones you prefer. My favourite is from Liguria. It is not too pungent, but light, delicate and easily digestible. I use it to dress salads, drizzle over grilled fish, meat and vegetables, and basically for any dishes in which the oil is to be eaten raw or hardly cooked.</p>
<p class="para1">The process for ordinary olive oil is less complicated, and although there are strict controls they are much fewer than for extra virgin. More abundant quantities are produced, so it is more economical to buy. I use olive oil from Liguria, Tuscany and Sicily. Olive oil is used for nearly all cooking purposes, as well as for marinades, deep-frying and preserving food.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Olives</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Look for whole, firm olives and always buy unpitted ones. It may take a little time to remove the stones but they taste much better as they have been tampered with less. My favourite are Taggiasca olives – small, brownish ones from Liguria. I never buy flavoured olives, preferring to flavour them myself with some garlic, chilli and oregano, or pieces of lemon and orange.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">This is a cow’s milk cheese from Emilia Romagna. I always keep a good hunk of Parmigiano Reggiano (the name for authentic Parmesan cheese) stored in the fridge wrapped in foil or clingfilm and then grate it as necessary for cooking purposes. Parmesan is also delicious to nibble as a snack when you are feeling peckish, or can be served as part of a cheese selection (see <a href="text00013.html#page_203">here</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">I keep three varieties of salt in my store cupboard: fine sea salt for seasoning dishes, coarse sea salt for preserving food, and Maldon salt for topping focaccia.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">When I don’t have time to make my own stock, I use powder, of which I keep at least one vegetable and one meat variety in store. I find the powdered variety more versatile. It also dissolves much quicker in boiling water. I like the Swiss Marigold brand.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Vinegars</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">I use white and red wine vinegar as well as cider and balsamic vinegar. I usually make my own red wine vinegar from leftover bottles of wine. I pour all the leftovers into a large glass container, place a couple of bits of dried pasta in it, which speeds up the process, and leave it opened for about 20 days, shaking it gently each day. After this time, it should turn into vinegar – if not, leave it for longer. I then transfer the vinegar into smaller glass containers or bottles with corks and use it like any other wine vinegar. I find my home-made vinegar much stronger than the bought variety, and delicious on salads.</p>
<p class="para1">Balsamic vinegar is produced in Modena, in the Emilia Romagna region. Made from the must of local Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes, it is cooked at high temperatures until it turns brown and syrupy, then transferred to wooden barrels and left to mature for anything from five to 50 years. This is known as <em>aceto balsamico tradizionale</em>
 and commands very high prices; the older it is, the more expensive it will be. You can buy a cheaper variety of inferior quality, which is matured for only a year and is known as <em>aceto balsamico di Modena</em>
 . This type will do for marinades, when you need a large amount. I suggest investing a little money and going for a five-year-old (or older, if you can afford it) <em>tradizionale</em>
 , to use sparingly in salad dressings, drizzled over boiled meats and poultry, and even over fresh strawberries. You will find that your bottle of balsamic vinegar lasts quite a while, as you need only a few drops at a time.</p>
