			<p class="rec-intro">This almost forgotten French classic is a wonderful layered construction of biscuit and flavoured ganache. It’s perfect for a special occasion as you can make it in advance and keep it in the fridge ready to slice when you want. There are many variations but this recipe, with the retro touch of After Eight mints, was on the menu at Le Gavroche back in the early days and is just as popular when it makes an appearance now. The quantities here make a little more biscuit than you need to allow for trimmings and any mishaps – no hardship to finish them up though.</p>

			<p class="body">First make the biscuit. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with lightly buttered and floured greaseproof paper. Whisk the egg whites until frothy, then add 180g of the sugar and continue to whisk until firm. Fold in the ground almonds, remaining sugar and milk powder. Spread the mixture on to the lined baking tray to a thickness of 5mm and sprinkle with the hazelnuts. Cook in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until just set. Leave to cool, then cut into 3 neat strips measuring 20 x 9cm. </p>
			<p class="body">Melt the chocolate in a bowl over barely simmering water – don’t let it get too hot. Whip the cream to soft peaks. Pour half the melted chocolate on to the cream and mix with a whisk, then gently add the remaining chocolate. Divide this into 3 and flavour one with rum, one with crème de menthe and leave the third plain. Leave until cool and semi-set to the consistency of thick mayonnaise – it needs to be firm enough to build your marquise.</p>
			<p class="body">Cut a piece of card measuring 20 x 12cm and cover it with foil – this will be your base for the marquise. Place a strip of biscuit on the base, spread it with a layer of rum ganache, then sprinkle on the chopped ginger. Add another strip of biscuit, spread with the crème de menthe ganache and arrange the After Eights on top. Add the third biscuit, then spread the plain ganache over the top and sides and smooth with a palette knife. Place the marquise in the fridge to set for at least an hour. </p>
			<p class="body">When you’re ready to serve, dip a knife in hot water and cut the marquise into slices of about 2cm thick. </p>
