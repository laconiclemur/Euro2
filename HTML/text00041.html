</h1>
<p class="pf">The first real “gourmet” food I tasted was food I cooked myself. In this case, it wasn’t my own expertise—it was the quality of the ingredients and the inspiration in the form of menus and recipes from my employer that made the difference.</p>
<p>It was the end of my freshman year at the university, and a notice was posted on the home economics bulletin board. “Cook wanted for summer months, private home, must be a good cook.” The pay? Room and board plus two hundred dollars per month. I applied, and my friend Marilyn applied for a housekeeper position there also. We both landed the summer jobs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitney was a widow with two sons, one enrolled at Stanford, the other working in the family business. She had duplicate copies of two-volume gold-embossed maroon <i>Gourmet Cookbooks,</i>
 as well as <i>Larousse Gastronomique,</i>
 Louis P. De Gouy’s <i>The Gold Cook Book,</i>
 and other expensive volumes. One set of the books occupied her bedside table; the other, the bookshelf in the breakfast nook, where I could read and use them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitney would write out her menus for entertaining as a sort of bedtime reading. The next day she would present them to me as we discussed the day’s plans. If she asked me to prepare something I had never heard of, I didn’t let on. I would first look up key words in the dictionary, then in <i>Larousse,</i>
 and then check the indexes of the other cookbooks on the shelves. I usually found the right ingredients in her well-stocked kitchen. Sometimes I had to call Crystal’s, a specialty food store in downtown Duluth, to have an unusual ingredient delivered.</p>
<p>Simpler menus—of which there were not many—were for when it was just Mrs. Whitney and her boys. But usually there was a party scheduled at the Whitney house. It followed a pattern. The drinks and appetizers were served in the “boathouse” by the lake. It was a grand building with floor-to-ceiling picture windows on the lakeside. The floor was covered with a lovely linen carpet from the now-defunct Klearflax Company in Duluth. Mrs. Whitney herself artistically designed the rug in shades of muted tans and blues so as to blend with the view of the lakeshore and the lake. The furniture and serving dishes were part of the total color scheme and picked up the sandy tan of the beach and the variegated blues of Sunshine Lake, which was visible through the windows.</p>
<p>The inevitable appetizer always included “lovely little vegetables”—tiny carrots, string beans, asparagus, radishes, and whatever else Mrs. Whitney with her prolific green thumb was able to grow in her vegetable garden and greenhouse. I arranged the tender little veggies in a huge cut glass bowl filled with shaved ice. Then I made an herbed cream dip with a hint of horseradish to accompany them.</p>
<p>It was fun making the hot appetizers, ranging from little cream puffs filled with pâté, deviled ham, cheese, fish, or meat mixtures to lobster, crab, chicken, or shrimp salad. The recipes were from the appetizer books of Helen Evans Brown. Sometimes they took the form of stuffing for the puffs, tiny tart shells, or itty-bitty cocktail quiches, all of which I made from scratch. We served smoked oysters on ice paired with hot, crispy pork sausages and cheesy-stuffed croutons served warm from the oven. There was also the ever-present appetizer of the day—“cheese puffs.” Of course, the number of appetizers depended on the number of guests involved, which was usually ten or twelve. Guests typically made their own cocktails from the well-stocked bar—thankfully, seeing as I really didn’t know anything about mixing drinks.</p>
<p>The guest list included regents of the University of Minnesota, local legislators, and other famous businesspeople from the area. This did not intimidate me. I simply followed directions specific to the menu.</p>
<p>After about an hour of cocktails and snacks, the guests entered the dining room. I never got to see them because Marilyn was the waitress and was appropriately dressed with a white frilly apron over a black skirt and blouse.</p>
<p>Usually there would be a first course. It was sometimes mushrooms with garlic butter or oysters with caviar or some other “little” dish. This would be followed by soup and croutons or crisp homemade crackers. Then we served a filet of beef or coq au vin or canard à l’orange, or some other “lovely” main course, and a special vegetable, delicate green salad, or Mrs. Whitney’s favorite molded black cherry salad flavored heavily with port wine and a freshly baked small bread. Dessert was often homemade cookies and burnt sugar ice cream. Every dish, every course, was a learning experience for me. Food, for the first time in my life, took on especially delicate flavors.</p>
<p>Between courses, Mrs. Whitney would buzz us in from the kitchen using a button on the floor under the table. Since she had usually imbibed considerable amounts by then, she often had trouble finding the button. I never saw this, but Marilyn would report the progress of her inebriation.</p>
<p>Afterward, Mrs. Whitney would always report her delight regarding the meal to Marilyn and give her all the praise. I seemed to be nonexistent—except for the fact that I had done all the cooking and baking. But then again, I was happy to “hide” in the kitchen. The most valuable lesson I learned from that summer in the kitchen on the beautiful shore of Sunshine Lake was how food—well prepared with high-quality ingredients—should taste.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Hot Cheese Puffs</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This appetizer was all the rage in the 1950s, and I made dozens of them over the course of the summer. They’re easy to make ahead and bake at the last minute. They can also be made ahead and frozen.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">4 ounces (half of an 8-ounce package) cream cheese, at room temperature</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon grated fresh onion</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup mayonnaise (I usually made it fresh)</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon chopped chives</p>
<p class="rpil">Good dash of cayenne pepper</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="rpill">About 12 slices good-quality white bread</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese with the onion, mayonnaise, chives, pepper, and Parmesan until well blended. Cut the bread into 1½-inch circles and spread each generously with the cheese mixture. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or longer for a crispier puff. Serve hot.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 12 servings</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Burnt Sugar Ice Cream</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">A favorite of the house was this simple, delicious ice cream that was smooth and creamy, flavored with burned sugar. It was a staple in the freezer and we could indulge ourselves whenever we wished. This is a simple-to-make ice cream that can be frozen in a refrigerator tray or in a hand freezer. The secret to the texture of this ice cream is to chill the evaporated milk until icy, and use a hand mixer to whip until fluffy. The basic recipe came from De Gouy’s <i>The Gold Cook Book.</i>
</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">⅓ cup granulated sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup milk, scalded</p>
<p class="rpil">⅛ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 egg yolks, slightly beaten</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
<p class="rpill">1½ cups (or 1 can) undiluted evaporated milk, chilled and whipped</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Sprinkle the sugar into a heavy skillet and place over medium heat, stirring often until the sugar dissolves and turns a caramel brown.</p>
<p class="rp">When sugar is browned, stir in the hot milk. Stir until sugar crystals are completely dissolved, or for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">In a heatproof bowl, combine the salt and egg yolks. Add 2 tablespoons of the hot mixture to temper them, being careful not to actually scramble the yolks.</p>
<p class="rp">Slowly whisk the caramel milk into the egg mixture, mixing constantly. Pour the custard into the skillet. Cook until the mixture coats a spoon, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and chill.</p>
<p class="rp">Fold in the whipped milk and pour the creamy mixture into a freezer tray or hand freezer and freeze until mushy. Remove from the refrigerator tray and beat until very smooth. Return to the freezer and freeze about three hours until firm.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 1½ pints of ice cream or 6 servings</p>
