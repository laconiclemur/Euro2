<p class="author1"><span class="txit">insalata di carote</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When my family was living in Florence my parents would on occasion eat out at local trattorias. They would frequent neighborhood spots that they could easily walk to from the apartment where we were staying. At one restaurant they were greeted by a long table set up near the entrance where an array of colorful salads was on display. “One of the salads was this simple carrot dish,” my mother remembers. “I ordered it and loved its taste and texture so I decided to try it at home.” This recipe has been a part of our family repertoire ever since.</p>
<p class="indentb">Dress this salad just before serving so the flavor and texture stay crisp. I often serve this dish at lunch, and sometimes when I’m serving it for dinner I will add <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup soft, plump raisins.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large carrots, peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Use a vegetable peeler to cut the carrots into long thin strips. There should be about 2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups of carrot strips. Place in a bowl and toss with the olive oil and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
