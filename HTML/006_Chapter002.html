  <p class="h2"><a id="page_20"/><span class="italic">Rutabaga = Candy for the Car Ride!</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="small">WHEN I WAS LITTLE</span>, my grandparents gave me my own little plot of land where I could grow things. I was so incredibly proud of that little plot and started planning right away what I wanted to grow in it come spring. Carrots to the right and red beets to the left, and since I liked dill a lot, I had to have that there too.</p>

  <p class="indent">I can still remember the taste of the first tender carrots that I pulled out of the soil. To be honest, I can’t remember if the carrots were my grandmother’s, my grandfather’s, or mine, but the taste was definitely there. I just brushed off the dirt and took a bite. The idea that a little bit of dirt is good for the stomach applied even back then.</p>

  <p class="indent">My mother’s parents managed a dairy farm. It was in a beautiful location at Åsen in west Karup, with a spectacular view over Båstad. My aunt and my mother still live there today. I remember the smell of the hallways in their house—a little bit of cow and hay. The kitchen was pretty big, and the cabinets, which were once white, were well worn. I loved that kitchen and the white couch with its crocheted blanket that my grandfather always covered himself with to rest after dinner. To this day, it still hangs over our couch.</p>

  <p class="indent">My grandmother’s specialty was her crisp rolls. She would store her crisp rolls in the drawer at the bottom of the oven, where you generally keep your pans, so they would get drier <a id="page_21"/>and drier each day. You had to double dip them in juice in order to make them soft enough to bite into. I especially loved the darker edges.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/20-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Other fond memories are my grandmother’s sago soup and the teat-warm milk that Grandfather would let us sip right there while he milked the cows. Warm and fatty, the milk gently coated the interior of our mouths before the rich drink slid down our throats and into our bellies. The warm, sweet smell of the milk room was always special.</p>

  <p class="indent">My grandparents also grew potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and berries. My grandmother would make tea from blackcurrant leaves and elderberry flowers. For my brother and me, it was mostly fun and games at their house, of course, but the games often included helping out around the farm. Like sowing potatoes, for example. We sat in the back of the tractor with our legs dangling above the ground, watching the seed potatoes drop down the chute and on into the soil. The seed potatoes were dropped in a chute from where we placed it in a partition on its way down into the soil.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_22"/>Another thing I will never forget is the rutabaga my grandmother gave us as a snack for the car ride home to Helsingborg. Today, if I gave my kids rutabaga as a snack, they’d look at me as if I were crazy, which is a shame, because I really liked the simple rutabaga and the sweet gesture from my grandmother.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/21-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Throughout my years as a chef, I’ve always been very fortunate. I’ve worked at restaurants where everyone knew what they were doing, and from them I accumulated a wealth of knowledge about the ingredients I use. You can, for example, peel or mash an artichoke, but when the petals are soft, you can either simply brush them or drag the rim of a spoon around the petals. Or you can easily roast the artichoke in the oven with an unpeeled wedge of garlic. The sweetness of the artichoke becomes more pronounced when it’s roasted and is almost caramelized.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/21-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Right now, we’re not growing any vegetables in our garden because we simply don’t have the time, but we do have wild cherry trees, four different kinds of grapes—two in our green houses and two located toward the southern end of the garden—as well as fig bushes and cherry, <a id="page_23"/>apple, and plum trees. But I can’t take credit for the berries, fruit trees, or grapes, since we moved into the former house of Christel Kvant, who is a great author and gardening expert from Helsingborg.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/22-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">We’ve only cut down one apple tree since we moved in, and it was only because it was blocking a soccer goal. And just in case you’re wondering: no, I don’t preserve the berries and the fruit. We eat all of it right there and then. This year, we didn’t get any apples because the kids stubbornly insisted on eating the unripe apples or using them as substitute golf balls.</p>

  <p class="indent">I do dream of one day being able to weed among the asparagus, knees in the dirt, instead of being my kids’ designated goalkeeper, or being able to grow my own tomatoes instead of buying them from the supermarket. You know, the old-fashioned way: seed, soil, and a little bit of sunshine and water! Somehow I always seem to forget that last part—even though I should be a natural jams and juices kind of girl—I never seem to succeed completely. I’m really good at sowing, but I’m not so good at watering, so the tomatoes usually end <a id="page_24"/>up falling to the ground before I even remember to take care of them. Once the kids start playing inside the green house, the grapes become just a distant memory, and the rhubarb is always overgrown before July is at an end.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/23-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">But I guess there’s no need to make things so complicated. Sowing spices and herbs doesn’t really take that much time, and not much effort is necessary to water them and look after them. And it’s such a joy to watch them grow! While my children are still young, sowing the herbs will probably be the only moments of “clog romance” I’ll get. You know the feeling of putting on your “clogs” and walking out to your vegetable garden. I look for my scissors and walk out with a determined stride to the vegetable jungle to catch me some rosemary, dill, or sage. I love that feeling and I know I want more of that kind of living. But perhaps it’ll take a few more years before I get there.… In the following chapter, you’ll find all my favorite greens!</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/23-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="pagebreak"/>

  <p class="h3a"><a id="page_25"/><span class="bold">THINK LIKE TINA</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">BLANCHING</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">To blanch is to quickly boil a vegetable in unsalted water and then to cool it down in cold or ice water. Green vegetables or leaves can be blanched in club soda, since it naturally contains salt. This allows for the chlorophyll—meaning the green color—to be preserved within the vegetable.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/24-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">BOIL SOME WATER</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Vegetables should be boiled in “low” water (meaning water that just about covers the vegetables). When you <span class="italic">boil</span> vegetables—in comparison to when you <span class="italic">blanch</span> them—the water should contain salt, pepper, sugar, and either butter or a quality oil. You thereby create a nice broth at the same time, which you can store in the freezer and use for stews, soups, risotto, and sauces.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">ROOT VEGETABLES ARE NOT MARINE ANIMALS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you want to prepare a meal by peeling the root vegetables beforehand, don’t soak them in water until you’re ready to cook with them. Instead, place the peeled root vegetables in a plastic bag and put them in the vegetable bin in the fridge. The exception is the Scorzonera, which oxidizes and turns dark very quickly. Put this in water with a few drops of fresh lemon juice to prevent the Scorzonera from changing colors. Potatoes should also be placed in water to prevent them from turning dark.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">TREAT YOUR AVOCADO RIGHT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you have a ripe avocado but you’re not ready to eat it yet, you can place it in the fridge; this stops the ripening process. And if you have an unripe avocado that you want ripened faster, just place it in a bag with an apple or banana. These emit ethylene gas that speeds up the ripening process.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/24-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="imga"><a id="page_26"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/25-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">CHOOSE THE UGLY MUSHROOMS!</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Pick the mushrooms that are a little shriveled. These have more flavor and contain less water, which makes them taste better. At restaurant school, I was taught to wash mushrooms in water and flour. The flour was used to carry the dirt and soil to the bottom of the flour bath. Back then this was absolutely necessary—in those days, horse manure was used as a mushroom substrate!</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">CUT THIN SLICES</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you need to cut your vegetables in really thin slices, use a vegetable slicer. Another word for vegetable slicer is a mandolin slicer.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">KITCHEN FRENCH</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Did you know that sauté is just a fancier way to say fry? And clarified butter is the same as melted butter? The meaning of <span class="italic">blanching</span> can be found on the previous page.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">I BET YOU DIDN’T KNOW THIS!</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you have a hard time telling the difference between the <span class="italic">parsnip</span> and the <span class="italic">parsley root</span>, just remember that the parsnip’s stalk-attachment retracts, whereas the parsley root’s stalk stands up in a tip or peak.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Scorzonera is also called poor man’s asparagus since the flavor of Scorzonera is similar to that of mild asparagus.</p>

  <p class="indent">In England, the rutabaga is called “Swede,” and in the United States, it’s called “rutabaga.” Funnily enough, “rutabaga” is a twist on the Swedish word “rotabagge,” which is what people in the southwest of Sweden call it!</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/25-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">ROASTING FOR MORE FLAVOR</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you roast root vegetables, you concentrate their flavors. A boiled carrot actually has less “carrot flavor” than a roasted one.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_27"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/26-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_28"/>1. Waldorf Salad</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This classic salad always tastes the best at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, where it originates. Other than this variation, that is! The dressing should be thick, not watery, and the ingredients for the salad should be dry. The dressing is meant to “glaze” the salad. A Waldorf salad is best enjoyed on its own, perhaps as an appetizer.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ celery root (celeriac)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 celery stalks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 firm pears</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">sea salt flakes, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DRESSING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) walnuts</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) mayonnaise (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_109">page 109</a>)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel the celery root. Cut it first in slices and then into thin strips. Slice the celery stalks diagonally. Place the celeriac and celery in a pot of boiling water for about 30 seconds. Drain and rinse under cold water. Finish by drying the celeriac and celery on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). Roast the walnuts in the oven. Taste a nut to make sure it has been fully roasted. Chop the walnuts.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the rest of the ingredients for the dressing and stir the walnuts into the salad dressing mixture.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Slice the pears into thin slices with a cheese grater or mandolin. Arrange them flat on four small plates or on one large serving plate. Sprinkle some olive oil, salt and pepper on top of the pear slices—but be careful not to overdo it!</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Add the celery and celeriac to the dressing mixture and pour on top of the pear slices. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="h2a">2. Endive Salad with Pear, Grapefruit, and Hazelnuts</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Use grapefruit during the wintertime when it’s in season and is cheapest. That way, there’s a good reason to make this salad. Why not mix it with a little bit of cooked bulgur, wheat, or couscous to make it meatier? It’s a perfect complement to a cheese platter, so leave out the grapes (and drink them instead!).</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 orange</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 grapefruit</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 pear</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 endives</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 box watercress, garden cress, or fresh spinach</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (150 g) roasted hazelnuts</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CITRUS VINAIGRETTE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅓ cup (75 ml) olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">juice from the sliced citrus fruits above</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ shallot, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Slice the orange, lemon, and grapefruit. Save the juices for the vinaigrette. Slice the pear into thin slices.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the ingredients for the vinaigrette.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Rinse and separate the endive leaves. Place in a bowl with ice water (to remove some of the bitter flavor and make the leaves really crispy). Let dry on paper towels. Mix the leaves with the citrus fruits, pear, and cress, and place on a platter.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Drizzle the dressing on the salad, and top it off with the roasted hazelnuts.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_29"/>3. Caesar Salad</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This recipe originated in Mexico in the 1920s, and as with so many other classics, the salad was the successful result of a hasty burst of inspiration. Caesar Cardini was the man behind the recipe, and the dressing he created is just as good as a sauce to eat with steamed fish or roast beef.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 heads of Romaine lettuce</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CAESAR DRESSING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 garlic cloves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 egg yolks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">7 sardine fillets</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) shredded Parmesan</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, zest and juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CROUTONS:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 slices sourdough bread</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 pinch salt</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the peeled garlic, egg yolks, and sardines until mixture is smooth. Add Parmesan, lemon juice, and zest. Mix for another couple of seconds. Add the oil, a little bit at a time, while stirring constantly. Add more oil if you want a thicker consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Break the bread into large chunks. Drizzle with olive oil and then sprinkle some salt on top. Roast in the oven until golden brown, for about 4–6 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Rinse the lettuce and dry it with paper towels. Mix the lettuce and the dressing, and serve on a serving platter or individual plates. Top it off with the croutons. Serve the salad as is or with chicken, beef, or some delicious ham.</p>

  <p class="h2a">4. Cress Salad with Coconut and Lime</p>

  <p class="noindentl">When I was younger, my mother would buy my brother and me each a coconut from time to time. It always took a long time to break into the coconut and even more time to eat it up—and the coconut would, unfortunately, dry out a little in the end.</p>

  <p class="indentl">Mirin is a sweet rice wine used in Japanese cooking. Consider this salad as an everyday salad. If you can’t find large-leaf cress, just use fresh spinach and some garden cress instead.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 box watercress or baby spinach (approx. 2½ oz [70 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) thinly sliced coconut, fresh (use a potato peeler)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 limes, peeled and thinly sliced</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MIRIN VINAIGRETTE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp mirin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp Japanese soy sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Mix the ingredients for the vinaigrette.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Arrange the cress, coconut, and lime on plates and sprinkle the vinaigrette on top.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Serve with meatballs on any regular Wednesday.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">ROASTED NUTS AND ALMONDS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Nuts and almonds are absolutely delicious when roasted. Roast them on a baking sheet in the oven at 425ºF (220ºC) for about 7–10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="imga"><a id="page_30"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/29-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_31"/>5. Zucchini Salad with Sweet Peas in Lemon Vinaigrette Reduction</p>

  <p class="noindentl">It’s so easy to make a great salad! In this recipe the lemon vinaigrette reduction takes center stage—it’s a super-vinaigrette that pairs well with many things. Compared to other vinaigrettes, it consists of more than just oil and vinegar.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 zucchini</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">approx. 9 oz (250 g) sweet peas</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) fresh parsley</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a pinch of sea salt</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">LEMON VINAIGRETTE REDUCTION:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp honey</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon, zest and juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ shallot, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp canola oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt and freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Cut the zucchini into thin slices with a vegetable mandolin or cheese grater. Slice the sweet peas into thin slivers. Combine the vegetables and parsley in a bowl, and sprinkle with salt. Mix carefully and put to the side.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix water, honey, lemon juice, and shallot in a pot, and let it simmer until the volume is reduced by half. Sprinkle with canola oil, and season with salt and pepper while stirring. Let the vinaigrette cool.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Dress the zucchini salad with the lemon vinaigrette, and pour onto plates.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve the salad as an accompaniment to barbecued pork during the summer.</p>

  <p class="h2a">6. Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella Salad with Caramelized Butter and Basil</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dish is inspired by Copenhagen’s really cool restaurant Paté (perhaps not so much “inspired” as I simply stole the whole recipe…). It uses only a few ingredients, but they’re in perfect harmony, and the caramelized butter is addictive! A great dish to complement the cold cuts at that big party.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3⅓ cups (600 g) tomatoes, preferably a mixed assortment</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 packages buffalo mozzarella cheese (each approx. 18 oz [125 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 tbsp + 1 tsp (75 g) butter, preferably organic</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of basil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Cut the tomatoes into slices or chunks. Chop the cheese into large chunks. Arrange the cheese and tomatoes on a plate.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Melt the butter in a frying pan.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Squeeze the lemon juice onto the butter and spoon the mixture on top of the tomatoes and cheese. Top the dish with fresh basil. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve immediately, either warm or at room temperature.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/30-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">CARAMELIZING BUTTER</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Don’t be afraid to melt the butter at high temperatures. The butter will first melt and then it will bubble up again; it’s not until after it bubbles that the butter will start to caramelize. When it does, the salt will fall to the bottom of the pan and there will be a layer of golden brown butter on top.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_34"/>7. Thai Cabbage and Celery Salad</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I created this salad when I was looking to update our regular Napa cabbage recipe (or Chinese cabbage as it is also known). Napa cabbage has fantastic qualities. It can be fried without getting soggy, and it’s very crispy when eaten raw. This recipe is for all of you who don’t think Napa cabbage belongs in the salad category. Eat this spicy Thai salad with some barbecued meat or fish. It tastes great with everything—even as the main dish.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 celery stalk</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ Napa cabbage</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ red chili</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp sesame oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp fish sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp rice vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp mirin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">chopped cashews (optional)</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Cut the celery and the cabbage into thin slices. Core and shred the chili.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Heat a frying pan until it becomes really hot. Pour the sesame oil into the pan and flash-fry the celery, Napa cabbage, chili, and sesame seeds.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Add fish sauce, rice vinegar, and mirin. If you like, you can top the salad with some chopped cashews.</p>

  <p class="h2a">8. Cream-marinated Red Currant Salad</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This cream dressing is beyond great! The fat from the cream and the acid from the lemon are perfect together. We often served this salad at the restaurant Petri Pumpa in Lund. Notice in the picture how the heads of lettuce should be cut to prevent them from imploding like a wet green lump when you “dress” them. It’s a great side dish at barbecues. Eat it when you’re longing for summer!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">This tomato soup is a great basic recipe that you can change up by just adding different things. The fun thing about eggplant is that although it can often lack flavor, if you roast it in the oven, it can really enhance the sweetness, and the texture turns smooth and silky. You can almost feel it tickle your throat as you take a bite. This is a solid and a somewhat spicy soup, with a bit of extra olive oil in it. The oil is used both for roasting and for enhancing the flavors of the soup.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Peel the eggplant and cut it into long strips. Heat the olive oil in a pan and sauté the eggplant strips until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper, and place them on a baking sheet. Roast them in the oven for about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">During my restaurant years, we used to run the gazpacho through the dough mixer, sometimes for hours. This was to make sure the ingredients got crushed together instead of just mixed. And it turned out so great! This recipe is for us everyday cooks who don’t have giant 20-gallon dough mixers at home. Serve the gazpacho cold, at room temperature, or warm with a dollop of crème fraîche or fatty sour cream. It tastes better when it’s been allowed to rest for a while, so prepare the soup the day before you plan to serve it.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Your stomach will get a little bubbly from eating Jerusalem artichokes. Just so you know. This soup is so irresistible that it causes major problems in many restaurants because people can’t get enough of it! The classic toast Greta—or beef Greta—was created by cook Lovisa Svanberg, who made it for Greta Odén, wife of the owner of City Hotel in Karlstad.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel and cut the artichokes into smaller pieces (if the skin is thin and light in color, you can just scrub them with a brush). Place the Jerusalem artichokes immediately in water, preferably with a little lemon juice so they don’t change color. Peel and slice the onion and garlic.</p>

  <p class="nlist"><a id="page_44"/>2.   Sauté the artichokes with the onion and garlic with a little bit of oil. Pour the cream, milk, water, lemon juice, and salt over the artichokes, and let simmer until they have softened, for about 15–30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the soup until it is smooth; use a hand blender right there in the pot. Season with some pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Peel the potatoes. Cut the potatoes and the beef tenderloin into cubes. Peel and slice the onion. Sauté the potatoes in butter until golden brown. Add the beef and onion and continue sautéing until both potatoes and beef are thoroughly cooked. This all depends on how big you’ve made the cubes. Season with salt and pepper, and then stir in the mustard and parsley.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Toast the bread. Divide the Greta mix onto the slices and serve the toast right away with the hot soup.</p>

  <p class="h2a">14. Mushroom Soup with Goat Cheese and Thyme-infused Cream</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Buy a more inexpensive goat cheese (the kind you can get in a long, prepackaged roll). It’s perfect for this recipe. The cream on top is a little bit ’80s style—but I like it and I’m sure you will too. This is a simple way to enhance a mushroom soup.

  <p class="nlist">4.   Crumble the cheese into the soup. Whisk until the cheese has melted into the soup and then remove the pot from the heat. Season with a little bit of pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Sauté the rest of the mushrooms in butter and the last two garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper. Distribute the sautéed mushrooms across four dishes. Pour the soup over the mushrooms and finish by adding a small dollop of the thyme-infused cream. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">My daughter and I love lentils. The spice mix for this should be a little daring—something more than just salt and pepper. My little girl tells me that the flavor reminds her of tacos, which isn’t entirely wrong since oregano is the only thing missing.… For those of you who consider lentils old and boring—think again!

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the soup right in the pot with a hand mixer. Pour the soup into deep bowls. Top with some small chunks of bread and some “shredded” salami. Serve the soup hot. You can also pour the soup over a piece of fish before placing the delicious concoction in the oven.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">At school I always loved green cabbage soup because that always meant we would get pear ice cream for dessert. But nothing beats my grandmother’s green cabbage soup with her delicious quenelles and egg. Nutmeg adds a nice flavor to the soup.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I made this soup during one of the tapings for my show in Vemdalen. It’s a somewhat unusual soup with fun flavors.

  <p class="noindentl">A great summer meal. Swing by the store to pick up a jar of artichoke hearts and throw some onions on the grill. Most likely you’ll have the rest of these ingredients at home. This tastes great with grilled fish and pairs nicely with sauces, like asparagus and lemon sauce (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_107">page 107</a>) or mayonnaise (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_109">page 109</a>).

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_69"/>30. Apple-infused Beluga Lentils with Mint, Ginger, and Oven-roasted Yellow Tomatoes</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This might not be the prettiest dish in the world, but ignore that because the taste will knock your socks off! Don’t stir too much after you’ve added the tomatoes because if you do, you’ll miss out on the delicious tomatoes bursting in your mouth! Beluga lentils taste great with just a little bit of sour cream, but they also complement fish and meat really well.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 apples, for example, Macoun</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) Beluga lentils</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) apple juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) water</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">OVEN-ROASTED YELLOW TOMATOES:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">approx. 9 oz (250 g) yellow cherry tomatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 garlic cloves</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FOR SERVING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of mint, freshly chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp shredded fresh ginger</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 shallot, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Peel and core the apples and chop them into pieces. Boil the lentils and the apples in apple juice, water, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Let the lentils and the stock reduce until the stock sticks to the lentils. Add the butter and fold the mint, ginger, and shallot into the mixture.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Place the tomatoes on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Peel and crush the garlic cloves and put them on the baking sheet. Roast in the oven for about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Pour the lentils onto a plate. Place the roasted tomatoes on top and garnish with some fresh mint leaves. Serve hot with a tasty bread.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">THE ROLLS ROYCE OF LENTILS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">Beluga lentils are the best quality lentils. They’re firm in texture and have a naturally nutty taste. It’s a great ingredient that can be found in any supermarket. If by any chance, you can’t find Beluga lentils, Puy lentils are a good second choice.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_70"/>31. Asparagus Risotto with Marjoram</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Here you go—a great standard risotto recipe (if you leave out the asparagus and marjoram). Use hot water instead of a cheap stock that contains too much sodium in it anyway. Or use homemade vegetable stock (see <a href="../Text/006_Chapter002.html#page_50">page 50</a>) if you have some already made.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 shallots, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of marjoram</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) Arborio rice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) white wine</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 quart (1 liter) hot water (or homemade vegetable stock)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch green asparagus, cut into small pieces</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (250 ml) freshly shredded Parmesan</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Sauté the onion and marjoram in olive oil until the onions are soft. Add the rice and cook until the kernels become slightly transparent. Add the wine and let it simmer until almost completely absorbed by the rice. Add water a little at a time (the rice absorbs the liquid), and let it simmer for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Add the asparagus and let simmer for another 5 minutes. Fold the Parmesan into the mixture and season with salt and pepper. Serve the risotto right away.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">WINES FOR RISOTTO</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Wine is an important part in the risotto but if you don’t have any available, you can use three parts water and one part lemon juice as a substitute. If you leave out the marjoram and asparagus and add an envelope (or a pinch) of saffron instead, it becomes a perfect side dish for the Ossobuco on <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_198">page 198</a>.</p>

  <p class="h2a">32. Ripasso Risotto with Red Beets</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Risotto and Ripasso sound like they could mix harmoniously, and that’s the case in this recipe. Ripasso is an Amarone wine that’s light in flavor. It is a perfect match for the red beet juice that can be found at any health food store. This is a really luxurious risotto that can only be an expression of love to your guests.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 shallots, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 peeled red beets, cubed</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) Arborio rice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2½ cups (600 ml) Ripasso wine</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cups (500 ml) red beet juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (250 ml) freshly shredded Parmesan</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Sauté onion, garlic, and red beets in olive oil until they turn soft. Add the rice and wait till it turns transparent.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Add half of the wine, and let it simmer until almost all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Add some red beet juice and alternate splashes of the wine and beet juice, as the rice absorbs the liquid. Let simmer for 15–20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Fold the Parmesan into the risotto and season with salt and pepper. Serve the risotto right away, preferably with pan-fried corn-fed chicken.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_73"/>33. Gnudi with Sage-roasted Tomatoes and Caramelized Butter</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Gnudi is pronounced <span class="italic">njudi</span> and is an Italian “quick pasta”—at least, if you consider the small amount of work that goes into it—made from ricotta and durum wheat. There’s no need for pasta machines or rolling pins—just a talent for making round little balls from dough.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) Parmesan, finely shredded</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) ricotta cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a pinch of salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 cups (500 g) durum wheat flour</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 quarts (2 liters) water + 2–3 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">SAGE-ROASTED TOMATOES:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 head of garlic</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter or oil for the pan</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lb (500 g) mixed cherry tomatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a handful of fresh sage leaves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CARAMELIZED BUTTER:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 stick (100 g) butter</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Stir the shredded Parmesan and ricotta together until it reaches a smooth consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Cover the bottom of a pan with half of the durum wheat flour. Roll the cheese mixture into small balls and place them in the pan. Cover everything with the rest of the flour. It’s vital that you cover the balls completely with flour because it’s the flour that will form the shell of the finished gnudis. Let the pan stand in the fridge overnight covered with plastic wrap (for 24 hours would be even better) to let the gnudi dry really well.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Cut the garlic in half. Place tomatoes, garlic, and sage into a baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice. Roast the tomatoes in the oven until they’re soft, for about 15 minutes. Remove the dish and lightly crush the tomatoes with a fork.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   In a large pot, boil the water and salt. Carefully remove the gnudis from the pan and shake off any excess flour. Boil the gnudis for 2–3 minutes and remove them as soon as they float up to the surface.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   In a pan, caramelize the butter. Set the tomatoes on a plate with the freshly cooked gnudis. Spoon the caramelized butter on top of the pasta and sprinkle some Parmesan on top.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">My most popular recipe! It would be impossible for me to write this book without including this recipe. Don’t forget to add enough salt to the dish, because potatoes absorb a lot of salt. The level of saltiness in a perfect au gratin is meant to be felt far back in your palate.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 ⅓ lbs (1½ kg) peeled firm potatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ leek</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 garlic cloves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cups (500 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cups (500 ml) milk</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½–2 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Shave the potatoes into thin slices, using a mandolin or a food processor. Rinse and shred the leek, and peel and crush the garlic.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Sauté the leek and garlic in olive oil until they get some color. Pour in the heavy cream and milk, and let the mixture simmer. Add the potatoes and season heavily with salt and pepper—since the potatoes absorb so much salt, you have to be heavy-handed here. Let the potatoes cook until the starch has been released and the mixture is thick and creamy. Don’t forget that you have to stir the mixture continuously so it doesn’t burn.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Pour the potatoes into a casserole dish. Bake the potatoes au gratin in the oven for 30–40 minutes. Test to see if the potatoes are ready by poking them with a fork. They should be soft.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Serve with beef tenderloin (see <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_176">page 176</a>).</p>

  <p class="h2a">35. Jackson Potatoes</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I made this potato dish during a taping of “Power Meet” in Västerås while a group of local “raggare” (a Swedish rock-n-roll subculture) kept the mood lively with their chants and catcalls as they drove around the set in their classic American cars. It ended up being an awesome party dish that can be prepared the day before any event. Keep it vegetarian by leaving out the bacon.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 large potatoes (baking potatoes)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10 oz (280 g) bacon</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Wash the potatoes and poke them all over with a fork. (If you’re short on time, you can microwave the potatoes for 15 minutes and finish the baking in the oven.) Place the potatoes in a baking dish or baking sheet and bake them until they’re completely soft. Depending on the size of the potatoes, this should take about 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Fry the bacon until crispy. Peel and slice the onion finely.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Remove the potatoes from the oven when they are soft. Split them in halves and carefully scrape the potatoes from their skins. Save the skins.

  <p class="nlist">5.   Divide the potato mixture into the skins and sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top. Bake in the oven until the cheese has turned a lovely golden color.</p>

  <p class="h2a">37. Mashed Root Vegetables with Apples and Oyster Mushrooms</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This purely vegetarian dish is the easiest dish you can make. I’m not a vegetarian, but I still consider this as the main course whenever I serve it and any meat or fish as a side. Don’t forget that the oyster mushrooms should be sautéed at high heat, as it’s best with a crispy surface.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Finally I got a chance to create a covered pie—something I have been longing to do forever! My relationship with pies has not always been the best, and it’s all because of the challenging egg royale. The usual egg and milk mixture is even worse than instant mashed potatoes. In this recipe, the eggs are mixed with cottage cheese and lots of cumin cheese and the results are outstanding. If you’re feeling lazy, you can always leave out the puff pastry lid, but the dish does look a lot more professional with the lid, and it’s not that difficult to make.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">PIE DOUGH:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) flour</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 sheet frozen puff pastry</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 whisked egg</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix all ingredients for the pie dough and knead until smooth.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Roll the dough out on a floured surface and lay it in a loaf pan so the dough hangs over the edges.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Cut the potatoes into large chunks and mix with red onion and chopped dill.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Sauté the black chanterelles in the butter and mix with the potatoes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Mix the cottage cheese, cumin cheese, and egg. Combine the cheese mixture with the potatoes and chanterelles. Pour all of it into the pie form and cover it with the puff pastry lid (if you opt to make one). Glaze the lid with a whisked egg. Bake the pie in the oven for 35–40 minutes. You may need to cover it with aluminum foil after 15–20 minutes if the color is turning too dark.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Serve the pie hot or at a cooler temperature based on preference.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">PERFECT PIE DOUGH</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The simple pie dough used in this recipe works for any kind of pie, no matter what the filling is. You don’t have to refrigerate it before using it, but rather smooth it out in the pan right away. The baking powder makes the dough crispy, and this means you need to use less butter compared to regular pie dough. Best of all—there’s no need to pre-bake the dough. We just don’t have time for such silly things!</span></p>
