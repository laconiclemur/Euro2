<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">My Twelfth Birthday</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">We were a big family. So when it came to holidays and birthdays, there was no need to invite more people to have a party. At least that’s what my mother always said. She would pretend that she didn’t remember it was a birthday. She would secretly bake a cake, behave in a nonchalant way toward the birthday son or daughter, and present the cake as a surprise.</p>
<p>For some reason I especially remember my twelfth birthday. My birthday is in July, always just in the middle of haymaking season. As usual, it was hot and humid, and I worked harder than ever in the hayfield on my birthday. I started the day sitting on the metal seat of the hay mower bumping over the fields, pulled by “the joker” my dad was driving. The long blade of the hay mower whirred down the tall grass.</p>
<p>The joker was a kind of tractor that my dad had made from a four-cylinder Model A, so it had a driver’s seat and steering wheel—everything else was exposed. It was just strong enough to pull a mower, a hay rake, or a hay wagon and used less gas than the big tractor.</p>
<p>My job was to lift the cutting blade so that it would miss rocks or bumps that could possibly cause damage to the blades. We circled the forty acres dozens of times, cutting a five-foot swath at a time that created a kind of continuous spiral until finally, every last blade was down. I loved the sweet smell of freshly cut hay—especially when it was alfalfa or clover.</p>
<p>We stopped for a break in midmorning. Mummy brought fresh cookies and a canning jar of nectar for me and a thermos of hot coffee mixed with sugar and milk for my dad. We sat in the shade of the joker as we enjoyed our refreshments.</p>
<p>I was absolutely certain that she had forgotten all about my birthday.</p>
<p>After the break, I mounted the seat on the hay rake that Isä had unhitched from the mower and attached to the joker. Off we rode to the far field to rake the dried hay that we had cut the day before. This was a bigger job for me because I had to pull the lever to dump the hay into long rows that later we’d rake into piles by hand. Then we would pitch the hay onto the hay wagon and haul it all to the barn to be stored in the hayloft.</p>
<p>It was hot and humid, and the hay felt prickly on my skin. My job now was to set the slings on the wagon and tramp down the hay as Isä and Mummy pitched forkfuls onto the platform. When the hay wagon was loaded I got to ride on top as we slowly drove to the barn.</p>
<p>At the barn we attached the ends of the slings to a hook at the end of the rope that was hanging down from the rounded top of the thirty-five-foot-high barn. It was a complicated system of tracks, ropes, and pulleys that we used to lift a whole load of hay all at once into the hayloft.</p>
<p>When everything was set, Isä connected the tractor to the other end of the rope on the opposite side of the barn. Slowly the load of bundled hay rose up onto the track and finally sailed into the loft. I had to give a really strong tug on the lead rope to trip the locks, drop the hay, and then pull the slings back to the ground so that we could go out for another load.</p>
<p>Dinner (which I now call lunch) had been hurried that day. A series of thunderstorms had been predicted, and the hay had to be in the barn before they hit. Usually, Mummy and Isä would “rest” right after the noon meal in the side bedroom, the door locked tight with a butter knife stuck into the frame of the door. That day was different, however, and we went right back into the hayfield after eating. There was no sign of a birthday cake.</p>
<p>By late afternoon all the hay was finally in the loft, the air grew hotter and heavier, and we were ready for a break. Exhausted and feeling itchy from scratchy dry hay (that had dried thistles in it as well), we headed toward the house.</p>
<p>There, in front of the house, was a big, plaid blanket spread out on the lawn with wrapped gifts, a pitcher of nectar, and a stack of plates. Then Mummy came out with the birthday cake lit with twelve candles. Leonard, Marion, Lillian, Betty Mae, Eugene, and Rudy all yelled “Surprise!”</p>
<p>The orange chiffon cake tasted unusually delicious. The strawberry nectar tasted great, especially because I was so thirsty. But what felt the best of all was that Mummy hadn’t forgotten my birthday. I felt warm and loved.</p>
<p>Isä took a picture of me with the Brownie camera after I opened all my gifts: I got a pair of bloomers from Mummy and Isä, a little vial of Blue Waltz Perfume from Marion, a straw hat from Lillian and Betty Mae, and a dog collar from Leonard that I could put on his dog. Eugene and Rudy were only four and three that year, but they, too, wanted to give me something. I got a weasel tail from Eugene and a dead frog from Rudy. Nancy, who was just four months old, was lying on a baby blanket.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful birthday.</p>
