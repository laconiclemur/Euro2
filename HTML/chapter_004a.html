<p class="recipe-subhead">Chickpeas with <em>chorizo</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">Of all the ingredients we offer at Brindisa, the classic combination of good jarred chickpeas that can be heated and served with sautéd or poached <em>chorizo</em> is something that people love for a quick, satisfying, tasty meal.</p>
<p class="indented">This particular, colourful version is one of Scott Boden’s super-easy recipes, devised to warm up Clerkenwell folk at lunchtime when we had our shop in Exmouth Market. Since we had only a tiny kitchen area, with a single electric ring to cook on, it was a way of showing how to make the ultimate hearty, convenience lunch, using the best Spanish store-cupboard produce.</p>
<p class="indented">We use beautifully creamy Navarrico chickpeas, <em>panceta adobada</em> (cured pork coated with paprika), plus the jarred <em>fritada</em> (tomato and pepper base) which is made especially for us in the Ebro Valley. The point of the dish is really the ease of putting it together, though of course you could cook your own chickpeas (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_384">here</a>) and make your own <em>fritada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p318a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">There is no salt in this recipe, as the idea is to use the brine from the jarred chickpeas, which combined with the <em>chorizo</em> should make the dish salty enough. A little red wine gives it a dash of luxury.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6–8</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g diced <strong><em>panceta adobada</em></strong>, or lardons, dusted with paprika</p>
<p class="ingredients">2–3 <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong> sausages or 1 cooking <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong> hoop, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium red onion, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 x 400g jar of <strong><em>fritada</em></strong> (or homemade, see <a href="chapter_004.html#p318a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml red wine (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 large cloves of garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredients">black pepper, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 x 660g jars of good prepared chickpeas, undrained, as you will use the brine</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the <em>panceta</em>, <em>chorizo</em> and red onion and sauté until they are all beginning to brown.</p>
<p class="method">Add the <em>fritada</em>, then fill the empty jar with water (or measure 400ml) and add it to the pan, together with the red wine, if using. Stir well and bring to a gentle simmer.</p>
<p class="method">Now add the crushed garlic, black pepper, 1½ tablespoons of the oregano and the chickpeas in their brine and stir again. Bring back to a gentle simmer for 5–10 minutes, then serve, scattering the rest of the oregano over the top.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec154"><a id="pg_398"/>Lentejas Asunción</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Ásun’s lentils with pork</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a recipe inspired by Asun Gordo (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>), who uses <em>pardina</em> lentils from her home region of Burgos in Castilla y León, which have a very creamy texture. She uses a wet marinade for the pork, but our head chef, Nico, preferred to make the dish with a drier combination of herbs and spices and Rupert came up with the inspired idea of finishing it with a <em>picada</em> that would echo the same flavours. The potatoes are cut <em>cascada</em>-style (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_292">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Lentil dishes such as this tend to improve if you make them a day in advance, keep in the fridge and then reheat before serving.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 pork ribs (350g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g <strong><em>pardina</em></strong> (or Puy) lentils</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g diced onion, diced as finely as possible</p>
<p class="ingredients">70g leeks, white part only, diced as finely as possible</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cooking <strong><em>chorizos</em></strong> (200g), cut in half lengthways and then crossways into quarters</p>
<p class="ingredients">75g tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (see recipe on <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_318">here</a>, or from a jar)</p>
<p class="ingredients">140g carrot, cut in half lengthways and then again crossways into quarters</p>
<p class="ingredients">10cm of the green part of a leek, very finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 green pepper, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g potatoes, cut into uneven chunks (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_398">here</a>)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the adobo <strong><em>marinade</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">4 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon chilli powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, crushed with the back of a knife, then roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <em>picada</em></p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a clove of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">juice of ½ a lemon</p>
<p class="method">For the <em>adobo</em> marinade, crush the black peppercorns and put into a bowl along with the rest of the ingredients. Mix together, then put the ribs into the bowl and rub them well with the marinade, making sure they are covered all over. Leave in the fridge for 3–4 hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="method">Rinse the lentils well in a sieve under the cold tap.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a casserole pan. Lift the ribs out of their marinade and put them into the pan (discard the marinade). Sizzle the ribs for a minute on each side to brown them, then move them to the outer edges of the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Put the onion, leek, garlic and bay leaf in the centre of the pan and stir to coat them well in the oil and meat juices. Add a pinch of salt, then turn down the heat and let everything cook gently for another 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Turn the heat up again, put in the quartered <em>chorizos</em>, meat side down, and stir for about a minute to brown. Add the <em>sofrito,</em> stir for another minute, then add 1.2 litres of cold water and the carrot, lentils, green leek and the pepper.</p>
<p class="method">Bring slowly to the boil, skimming off any foam that comes to the surface, then turn down the heat to a simmer for 40 minutes, adding the potatoes after 25 minutes, until both lentils and potatoes are tender. Pound the ingredients for the <em>picada</em> together in a pestle and mortar, then take the pan off the heat and stir in a tablespoon of the mixture (or more to taste). Taste and adjust the salt if necessary before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec155"><a id="pg_401"/>Empanada de atún</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Tuna parcel</p>
<p class="flush_left">A slice of this ‘pie’, or parcel, is fast food in Spain. In many cafés you can simply buy a wedge, like tortilla, to eat on the go. I like to use good tinned white <em>bonito del norte</em>, and if you can find <em>migas</em> (small pieces) they are excellent. You can also use this filling to make a variation on the crab <em>empanadillas</em> on <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_251">here</a>.</p>
<p class="indented">Choose the black olives carefully. You are looking for the clear flavour of a genuine black olive (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p97b">here</a>), so I would recommend Empeltre from Aragón or Kalamata black olives in brine only, as you don’t want to introduce random flavours by using olives in a strong marinade.</p>
<p class="indented">If you like, you can add a layer of hard-boiled egg (one per <em>empanada)</em> over the top of the <em>bonito</em> or tuna and pepper mixture before putting the lid on the ‘pie’. You can also make the dough in a food processor or blender.</p>

<p class="makes">Makes 2 <strong><em>empanadas</em></strong> about 20cm x 40cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (from a jar)</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">120ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 egg</p>
<p class="forhead">For the filling</p>
<p class="ingredients">390g <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>), cut into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g <strong><em>bonito del norte</em></strong> or tuna in olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (from a jar)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon fresh thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon fresh oregano</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chilli flakes (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">120g pitted black olives in brine, finely chopped</p>
<p class="method">To make the pastry, first put the 50g of <em>sofrito</em> into a pan and bubble up briefly to reduce it and remove some of the water.</p>
<p class="method">Put the flour in a mixing bowl, add the reduced <em>sofrito</em>, the oil, a pinch of salt and 120ml of water and mix and knead to a homogeneous dough that comes away easily from the sides of the bowl (you may need to add a little more water or flour). Roll into a ball, cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rest for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">For the filling, put the <em>piquillo</em> strips into a bowl. Drain the <em>bonito</em> or tuna, and add, along with the <em>sofrito</em>, herbs, chilli flakes, if using, and a twist of pepper. Mix in the sherry vinegar, taste and add salt if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Line 2 baking trays with baking paper (alternatively, you can bake the <em>empanadas</em> one at a time).</p>
<p class="method">Lightly flour a work surface and roll out half the dough into a square roughly 40cm x 40cm. Cut this in half, so that you have 2 bases, each approximately 20cm x 40cm.</p>
<p class="method">Roll the first sheet of dough around your rolling pin, then unroll on to the baking paper on the baking tray. Repeat with the second sheet.</p>
<p class="method">Roll out the rest of the pastry in the same way to give 2 more sheets of dough 20cm x 40cm. These will form the tops of the <em>empanadas</em>.</p>
<p class="method">Divide the olives between the dough bases, leaving a 2cm border, then sprinkle the <em>bonito</em>/tuna and <em>piquillo</em> mixture on top.</p>
<p class="method">Beat the egg and use some of it to brush the borders of the dough, then cover each base with a dough lid. Fold the edges of each base up over the edges of the lid to form the traditional thick <em>empanada</em> crust, and press down firmly, creating a dimpled rim by pushing down with your finger all around the edge.</p>
<p class="method">Paint the top of each <em>empanada</em> with the rest of the beaten egg, prick with a fork several times and put into the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until the dough is golden brown.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec156"><a id="pg_402"/>Costrada de setas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Wild mushroom pie</p>
<p class="flush_left">Before I encountered Pedro Roca, the famous Galician chef and restaurateur, all I really knew about <em>empanadas</em> was that they originated in Galicia, the pastry was actually more of a dough, and the most popular one you could find in almost every café in Spain was filled with tuna and sold cold, in neat squares (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_401">here</a>). Then one year I attended the Fórum Gastronómico in Santiago de Compostela, a modest trade event for chefs that was founded by Pep Palau (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_84">here</a>). There I joined in an <em>empanada</em> workshop hosted by Pedro, who showed us three of his fantastic, but very different recipes, each done with a particular flour.</p>
<p class="indented">There was an open-style sardine and pepper <em>empanada</em> similar to the Catalan <em>coca</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_142">here</a>), and the two that I have included here, the game pie on <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_405">here</a> and this <em>costrada</em>, a slight variation on the theme. We were given only the recipe outlines but when I came back from Galicia we worked on them many times in our kitchen at home until we got them as we wanted, much to the delight of various neighbours who were called in to help us test them.</p>
<p class="indented">This is a more elaborate variation on <em>empanada</em>, which works fantastically well – layering the mushrooms with pancakes is a brilliant trick that stops the filling from collapsing to the bottom of the ‘pie’. You will need to make your pancakes in a frying pan the same diameter as your tart tin, so that they fit exactly.</p>
<p class="indented">You can use whatever wild mushrooms you like, but the idea is to have three different types in separate layers. Ideally, choose ceps (<em>hongos porcini</em>), oyster mushrooms (<em>champiñones ostras</em>) and <em>trompettes de la mort</em> <em>(trompetas de la muerte</em>).</p>
<p class="indented">As usual, if you prefer, you can make the dough in a food processor or blender.</p>
<p class="indented">I like to serve the <em>costrada</em> with Catalan-style chard. For around six people you need about 600g of chard. Separate the stalks and leaves and blanch the stalks briefly in salted boiling water, then drain and chop both stalks and leaves. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan or wok; add a chopped medium banana shallot, 50g each of pine nuts and raisins and cook until golden. Add the chopped chard and toss with the other ingredients until the leaves just wilt. Season to taste and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 1 x 22cm round pie</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (from a jar)</p>
<p class="ingredients">120ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 egg, beaten, for brushing the pastry</p>
<p class="forhead">For the filling</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 onions, sliced in rings</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 8 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sugar or sea salt, if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g ceps, cleaned and sliced into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g oyster mushrooms, cleaned and torn into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g <strong><em>trompettes de la mort</em></strong> mushrooms, cleaned and sliced into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little cumin (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little <strong><em>pimentón picante</em></strong> (hot paprika, optional)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the pancakes</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g white flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 egg, beaten</p>
<p class="method">Put the flour into a mixing bowl, add the <em>sofrito</em>, oil, a pinch of salt and 120ml of water, and mix and knead to a homogeneous dough that comes away easily from the sides of the bowl (you may need to add a little more water or flour). Roll into a ball, cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rest for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="method">To make the filling, put the onions into a 22cm heavy-based frying pan (which you can use for the pancakes later) and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir the onions to ensure they are well coated. Place the pan, preferably on a diffuser, over a low heat and allow the onions to slowly caramelise for up to <a id="pg_404"/>1 hour, stirring occasionally. After an hour taste the onions and adjust with a pinch of sugar or salt if necessary. Take off the heat, lift out the onions and keep to one side. Wipe out the pan and keep it for cooking the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">For the pancakes, put the flour into a bowl, then gradually whisk in the beaten egg and 100ml of water until you have a smooth mixture. Leave the mixture to rest for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, for the filling, heat 1–2 tablespoons of olive oil in the frying pan, put in the ceps and sauté for 1–2 minutes until just golden, sprinkling with a pinch of cumin and paprika, if using. Lift out and keep to one side. Repeat with the oyster mushrooms and then the <em>trompettes de la mort</em>, keeping each variety separate and seasoning each with another pinch of cumin and paprika, if using. Wipe out the pan and keep for the pancakes.</p>
<p class="method">Have ready a tart tin 22cm in diameter and 5cm deep.</p>
<p class="method">Wipe the frying pan with a thin film of olive oil, then pour in half the pancake mixture and tilt the pan so that it covers the base. Cook very briefly until the underside is set and just golden, then flip over and cook the other side in the same way. Slide on to a plate and repeat with the rest of the mixture.</p>
<p class="method">Lightly flour a work surface. Divide the dough in two – not quite in half, as you will need slightly more to line the tart tin than for the top. Roll out the larger piece into a circle big enough to line the tin and leave an overhang. Roll the dough around your rolling pin and then unroll it into the tin.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon in the caramelised onion and spread it out evenly, follow with the ceps and a sprinkling of salt. Lay one of the pancakes over the top. Put in the oyster mushrooms and season with salt. Lay the second pancake on top, and finish with the <em>trompettes de la mort</em>, again seasoning with salt.</p>
<p class="method">Roll out the remaining pastry into a circle big enough to cover the pie and lift it over the top using your rolling pin, as before. Fold the overhang from the base pastry over the edges of the lid and pinch together to seal.</p>
<p class="method">Brush the top with the beaten egg and prick it a few times with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven for around 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Take out, allow to cool briefly, and serve warm.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec157"><a id="pg_405"/>Empanada de castañas con perdiz</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Partridge pie with chestnut pastry</p>
<p class="flush_left">Reminiscent of an English game pie, this is good with a simple lettuce and tomato salad and a chilled white Verdejo wine from the Rueda region. If you can’t find <em>trompettes de la mort</em>, you could use oyster or shiitake mushrooms.</p>
<p class="indented">Again, if you prefer, you can make the dough in a food processor or blender.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g chestnut flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">15g fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingredients">25g melted butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="forhead">For the filling</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 onions</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sugar or sea salt, if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tomato, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 oven-ready partridges</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g <strong><em>trompettes de la mort</em></strong> mushrooms, cleaned and torn into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 egg, beaten</p>
<p class="method">To make the filling, slice 3 of the onions into rings, put into a heavy-based frying pan and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Stir the onions to ensure they are well coated. Place the pan, preferably on a diffuser, over a low heat and allow the onions to slowly caramelise for up to 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Taste the onions and adjust with a pinch of sugar or salt if necessary. Take off the heat and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put 2 litres of cold water into a large pan. Halve the remaining onion and add to the pan, with the carrot and tomato, thyme and salt. Bring to the boil, then put in the partridges, turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Open up each partridge with a knife to confirm it is cooked through and the meat comes away from the bone. If not, leave to simmer for a few minutes longer. Lift out and cool enough to strip out the meat and shred it into similar-size pieces to the mushrooms. Keep to one side. Discard the vegetables from the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and sauté the mushrooms for around a minute – take off the heat before they release their juices into the pan, as you want these to flavour the filling as the mushrooms finish cooking inside the pastry.</p>
<p class="method">To make the dough, mix the two flours together in a large bowl. Dissolve the yeast in 100ml of warm water and add to the flour along with the melted butter and salt, then mix and knead to a homogeneous dough that comes away easily from the sides of the bowl (you may need to add a little more water or flour). Roll into a ball, cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rest for 90 minutes, until risen a little.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Lightly flour a work surface, turn out the dough and knead it briefly, then divide in half.</p>
<p class="method">Line a 60cm x 30cm baking tray with baking paper. Roll out half of the dough into a rectangle roughly 20cm x 40cm, roll it around your rolling pin, then unroll it on to the baking paper.</p>
<p class="method">Spread the caramelised onions over the pastry, leaving a 3cm border around the edge. Next, add the shredded partridge meat, and finish with the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="method">Roll out the rest of the dough into a rectangle big enough to make a lid, and use the rolling pin to lay it over the filling. Fold the border of the pastry base up over the edges of the lid and pinch to seal. Brush the top with the beaten egg and prick it a few times with a fork. Put into the preheated oven for around 20 minutes, until golden brown, and serve hot.</p>

<p class="panel-title"><a id="pg_406"/>Life and Cooking with Montserrat Fruitos</p>
<p class="flush_left">It was always a joy to be shopping and cooking with Montserrat Fruitos, who gave me so much inspiration for this book. She was a wonderful matriarch, stunningly beautiful and with a glorious smile, even though I met her when she was already in her eighties. She had cooked all her life, launched a pioneering cookery school, and knew exactly what she wanted to buy and where to find it. She passed away before this book was finished, but in her last weeks she read these words, and was happy that I wanted to include this small testament to her life, family and food.</p>
<p class="indented">She lived, during the week, in Barcelona, where her first-floor apartment was a stone’s throw from Plaça Catalunya. It was an amazing place, with one whole corner that was an enormous balcony, the size of a living room, facing the sun and full of pots of plants, succulents and flowers, and just one block away from the famous Mercat de la Concepció, where she did most of her food shopping.</p>
<p class="indented">Montserrat was born in 1930 and grew up living above a dairy in Caldes de Montbui in Catalunya after the civil war. One of her many cousins still owns a curing house there, from where she would get her excellent <em>salchichón de payés</em> (country sausages). Her father was a lawyer who worked as the Town Hall Secretary and helped the poor as much as he could, giving his services free. He was also a great gourmet, and her mother would spend hours preparing endless dishes and titbits for the table. Unusually, she even had three styles of cooker to work with: a wood-burning stove, a sunken burner for long, slow cooking, and separate gas rings. During the post-war years of the 1940s there was immense poverty and it was hard to get food in the city, but people would leave gifts of milk, butter, pulses and bread from the Empordà at the back door to say thank you to Montserrat’s father. And at Christmas they would never have to find a goose, because one would always miraculously and mysteriously arrive on Christmas Eve, though the family never saw who brought it.</p>
<p class="indented">When a little more affluence came back to the city, Montserrat’s father would always be very specific about the things he bought: his cigars came from a special shop, and almonds had always to be bought from Casa Gispert, the famous store which has been in Barcelona since 1851 and still has its own roasting stove for <a id="pg_407"/>hazelnuts. Montserrat remembered that when she was young, she swore she wouldn’t spend so much time in the kitchen as her mother, but she ended up following in her footsteps – and from her father she inherited that particularity about shopping, buying her ingredients only from specific market stalls and shops.</p>
<p class="indented">When she was thirty, and a young married woman, she found she had some free time, so she and two friends decided to go on a cookery course at a Women’s Institute in Barcelona. Twenty years later, when she was widowed with four children all studying, and a pension that didn’t cover their expenses, the trio of friends started up a home-based cookery school called Mi Cocina, with classes for up to 30 people, and three sessions daily, very much inspired by the food culture of Montserrat’s family.</p>
<p class="indented">This was something novel and they were incredibly successful. Often their pupils were young men who had never been taught to cook, or those who had been brought up before the war, when wealthier families employed a cook and maids.</p>
<p class="indented">Soon after the cookery school was set up, a cousin commented on the poor food at a primary school in the city, where she worked. The children went home for lunch at 2.30 p.m. but the teachers, over 25 of them, stayed on and were given a meal while they prepared the work for the next day. Montserrat was invited to take over the lunch preparation and ended up in charge for 18 years: buying all the ingredients, hopping on and off buses with bags of provisions, in between teaching at the cookery school and looking after and cooking for the family.</p>
<p class="indented">Her meticulous food shopping followed the same routine each week. At the Mercat de la Concepció, which was first opened in 1888, she would buy fresh fish, meat and fruit and vegetables, plus cured ham for breakfast and <em>panceta</em> for flavouring stews, from particular trusted stallholders she had known for most of her life. They used to give her special cuts and portions, and offer recipes for soups and special dishes to give her strength if she wasn’t feeling well.</p>
<p class="indented">Another essential on her market trip was to buy prepared white beans, chickpeas and lentils from the ladies who cooked them freshly each day and dispensed them by weight from large bowls.</p>
<p class="indented">Salt cod was another ingredient that she was very particular about. Two or three times a year she would travel to a favourite warehouse, a bus trip away from home, to buy two whole fish (<em>bacalada</em>), cut to her specifications, so she had a mixture of superior loin cuts and lesser ones for certain dishes, as well as some traditional hand-torn cod to make the Catalan salad <em>esqueixada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_328">here</a>). At her apartment she always had a particular cut de-salting in a bowl of water in her fridge, and once she had used it, she began soaking the next batch.</p>
<p class="indented">There was no waste in Montserrat’s kitchen. For every meal she cooked she was thinking about the next one, and how leftovers could be extended.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_408"/>Once she retired, like many a Spanish grandmother she spent much of her time during the week helping her three sons and a daughter, by looking after and cooking for her five grandchildren, with whom she was in touch daily.</p>
<p class="indented">What is lovely is that the youngest generation all love their food and have their favourites among her dishes – her eleven-year-old grandson loved her salads of goji berries, apples and cheese and she would make her <em>crema de verduras</em>, vegetable soup, especially for her granddaughter, using vegetables from local growers. She would chop up the vegetables quite small, and then meticulously sauté them briefly in olive oil, in groups, so as not to overcook them: a couple of cloves of garlic first, in and out of the oil to flavour it, then onions and leeks until they softened and were lifted out. Then she would repeat the process with carrots, green beans and potatoes, then courgettes, and chard. Finally, she put all the vegetables back in the pan, added enough chicken or vegetable stock to cover by two fingers and let the pan bubble for about 10 minutes, until all the vegetables were just tender. Then she blended the soup, seasoned it, and served it with a squeeze of lemon juice, a spoonful of double or soured cream, and a decoration of lamb’s lettuce.</p>
<p class="indented">At weekends, however, and for much of the summer, Montserrat became the <em>grande dame</em> of La Roca, a large isolated house – more of a small hamlet, really – in the woods near the village of Sant Llorenç Savall, north-west of Barcelona, that has been the family hideaway for generations. There are hardly any other villages in the area, with its hillsides covered in aromatic herbs, neighbouring the wild mountains of the Parc Natural de Sant Llorenç de Munt i l’Obac. Montserrat’s mother was born at La Roca and Montserrat spent her childhood summers there. Now sometimes three generations of her family – up to twenty people – carry on the tradition, in a complicated but very happy arrangement of eleven apartments – a <em>conjunto de familia</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Each family has its own living space. Montserrat shared hers, filled with her wall-to-ceiling collection of traditional ceramic pots and <em>botijos</em> (earthenware jars for storing water or oil), with her daughter Nuria and her family. But there are also communal areas in which they all grow fruit and vegetables, or get together to cook and eat generous meals made to family recipes.</p>
<p class="indented">There is a Roman wood oven for roasting whole lambs and suckling pigs, and Ramón, one of Montserrat’s many cousins, does a stunning <em>paella</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">They have neighbours with allotments who share their harvests and some of the uncles hunt, so in June there is a big family celebration of <em>civet de jabalí</em>, a large, slow-cooked, wild boar stew which Montserrat always prepared.</p>
<p class="indented">Every Friday Montserrat packed up and got ready to go to the country, and it was only when I went to visit her there that I really understood what this amazing retreat was all about. On the day I arrived lunch was <em>macarrones</em> (pasta) with a meat sauce, followed <a id="pg_409"/>by <em>pollo a la vinagreta</em> (chicken braised in wine vinegar), which she made with two chickens. It was so good that when I came home we reproduced it on a smaller scale, following her instructions.</p>
<p class="indented">The meal at La Roca was finished off with her daughter Nuria’s apple pastry twists and homemade blackberrry jam mixed into local yogurt, and then – there was still more – Montserrat’s amazing chocolate tart. All washed down in the warm autumn sunshine with <em>cava</em>, red wine and, finally, <em>ratafía</em> liqueur.</p>

<p class="center_head">POLLO A LA VINAGRETA</p>
<p class="flush_left">Cut up a single chicken and then put it in a pot with a couple of chopped carrots and onions, 4 cloves of garlic, a small handful of peppercorns, a few sprigs of thyme and a bay leaf. Add 100ml of white wine and 60ml of Moscatel vinegar, 5 tablespoons of olive oil and enough water to cover the chicken. Put a layer of baking paper over the top, bring everything to the boil, then turn down the heat to a slow simmer for an hour and a half – so simple and so good.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec158"><a id="pg_411"/>Pollo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Chicken</p>
<p class="flush_left">In Spain a good <em>pollo de corral</em> (a large free-range chicken which has tougher and tastier meat than an industrially raised bird) is seen as the passport to several meals. One of the most spectacular examples of these big chickens is the rare breed Rojo Campero, grown very slowly and allowed to forage and eat corn, a diet which gives the birds a startlingly red gamey flesh. Because of their size, such chickens can be as festive as a turkey in Britain.</p>
<p class="indented">In Burgos, Asun Gordo (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>) typically buys two at a time, takes off the breasts and tenderises them by rubbing them with a dry marinade (<em>adobo</em>, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_398">here</a>), before cooking them on the <em>plancha</em> (flat grill) or <em>la carmela</em>, a flat, round, ridged frying pan, like a shallower griddle pan.</p>
<p class="indented">The drumsticks will go into <em>pollo al chilindrón</em>, a homely casserole made with peppers and tomato, then she makes a stock from the carcasses, using leeks, carrots, onions and sometimes celery, even adding a ham bone to give a stronger flavour. Once the stock is made, she strains it for serving as a light soup before the main meal, perhaps with some <em>fideu</em> (thin pasta, see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_366">here</a>) added.</p>
<p class="indented">The vegetables from the stock won’t be wasted either, as she will add them to a rice dish (made with a <em>sofrito</em> and the vegetables simply added at the end).</p>
<p class="indented">Alternatively, she might roast one of the chickens and then the leftover meat will go into <em>croquetas</em> with some mushrooms (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_245">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Since these Spanish free-range chickens are almost gamey in their flavour and texture they need around three hours’ cooking in a casserole-style dish; however, in the recipes that follow I have adapted the times in line with the more tender free-range chickens we are used to in the UK.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec159"><a id="pg_412"/>Pollo en cazuela de barro</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Chicken cooked in an earthenware pot</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a recipe from Juani González of the Pérez Pascuas <em>bodega</em>, who is also the Mayoress of Pedrosa de Duero in Burgos and with whom our family has shared many a meal together with our friends Ambro and Asun. She makes it to celebrate Christmas and uses a <em>pollo de corral</em> which would weigh 3–4 kg; however, I have adapted the recipe to the size of free-range chicken normally found in the UK. The festive green and red of the peppers is in keeping with the Christmas spirit and the sauce, thickened with bread, is quite substantial, designed to combat the bitter cold of a typical Burgales winter.</p>
<p class="indented">If possible, cut the chicken into ten pieces, so that you have the drumsticks, thighs, wings and each breast cut in half.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 x 1.8–2kg chicken (the bigger the better), cut into small pieces, 10 if possible</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 red pepper, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 green pepper, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml Cognac</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <strong><em>picada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g bread, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g blanched almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Start the <em>picada</em> by heating the oil in a heatproof earthenware pot, if you have one, otherwise a casserole, then add the bread, whole garlic cloves and almonds and cook for a few minutes until golden brown. Lift these out with a slotted spoon and keep on one side.</p>
<p class="method">Season the chicken pieces just before they go into the same pot, then colour them well on all sides. Lift out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Lower the heat, put in the onion and peppers and cook gently for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Return the chicken to the pan and add the Cognac. Let it bubble for about 10 minutes and then, once the chicken has taken the flavours of the Cognac and the other ingredients, add about 500ml of water, or enough to cover all the chicken pieces. Season with a generous pinch of salt and leave to simmer over a low heat for about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, finish the <em>picada</em> by pounding the reserved fried bread, garlic and almonds with the parsley, into a paste, using a pestle and mortar or a blender. Add this to the pan 20 minutes into the cooking time and stir well. The bread and almonds will thicken the sauce. Taste and season with salt again if necessary, then serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec160"><a id="pg_413"/>Pollo a la catalana con ciruelas y piñones</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan chicken with prunes and pine nuts</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is an all-time favourite, as I love the combination of poultry and fruit, and the syrupy juices that result from cooking them together. My ultimate experience of this dish was in a rustic restaurant in Pallars Sobirà in the High Pyrenees, where the chicken was cooked in a vast wood-burning oven with oven-baked potatoes (<em>al caliu</em>) and it was just beautiful.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 chicken drumsticks</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 chicken thighs</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large white onion, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 ripe tomatoes, halved horizontally</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic, skin on but separated into cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">20 prunes</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml hot chicken stock</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a large casserole or deep wide pan that will transfer to the oven. Season the chicken pieces, add to the casserole or pan and brown on all sides, then remove and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put the onion, tomatoes and garlic into the casserole or pan and cook gently for 20 minutes, until the onions and garlic cloves have softened and the tomatoes have browned.</p>
<p class="method">Soak the prunes and pine nuts in 200ml of boiling water for 10 minutes, then drain, reserving the liquid.</p>
<p class="method">Return the chicken to the casserole or pan along with the drained prunes and pine nuts. Raise the heat, season to taste, and add the white wine. Bubble up to burn off the alcohol and reduce the liquid slightly.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">Add the hot chicken stock along with the reserved liquid from soaking the prunes and pine nuts. Simmer gently for 20 minutes over a low heat, to reduce the liquid by half and concentrate the flavours.</p>
<p class="method">Transfer to the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</p>


<p class="recipe-head" id="rec161"><a id="pg_414"/>Pollastre amb bolets</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Braised chicken with wild mushrooms</p>
<p class="flush_left">For me this is a very special dish which holds wonderful memories of when I shared a flat with a friend, Núria Mayans Pla, in the village of Roda de Ter. On Sundays her mother María would prepare lunch at the family home nearby, and I would always be invited to join in. Of all the dishes she treated us to, this was my favourite.</p>
<p class="indented">The combination of almond, hazelnut, garlic, rosemary, mushroom and white wine is one of the great traditional tastes of Catalunya. In autumn the forests are carpeted with wild mushrooms, such as <em>rossinyol de pi</em> (yellow chanterelles), which grow out of bright green moss beds under pine trees, large <em>rovellons</em> (saffron milk caps) and <em>llenagues negres</em> (herald of winter) – these black mushrooms are known as <em>mocosos,</em> as their caps are covered with a glutinous layer of slime, unlike their white equivalent, <em>blancas</em>. You might also see small <em>fredolics</em> (grey knights), which are used in the classic <em>sopa de frédolics</em>; <em>cama de perdiu</em> (brown slimecaps or copper spikes), which are brown and turn pink when cooked; the cep-like <em>pinatells</em> (related to the saffron milk caps that grow in pine forests), and <em>llores</em> (charcoal burners), which are a little peppery in flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">For this dish you need quite meaty mushrooms, which won’t release dark juices into the dish, so that the sauce stays clear and golden in colour. And, ideally, stick to one variety, to make cooking easier and more consistent. Chanterelles are a good choice. If you can’t find wild mushrooms, use chestnut mushrooms, or you could even use dried chanterelles. Soak them in water first to rehydrate them, and keep the soaking water to add to the cooking liquid.</p>
<p class="indented">Cut the chicken into eight, so that you have the breasts, drumsticks, thighs and wings, then cut each breast into small pieces (about five per breast) so you end up with around 16 pieces in all.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g wild mushrooms in season (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_414">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 x 1.8–2kg chicken (the bigger the better), cut into about 16 pieces (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_414">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">3–4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1–2 sprigs of rosemary, according to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml Cognac</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons Moscatel vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, unpeeled</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <strong><em>picada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">8 raw almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 raw hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">For the <em>picada</em>, spread out the nuts on a baking tray and roast for 7 minutes (shaking them to turn halfway through) until golden. Using a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic cloves with the salt, then add the nuts and continue to pound, adding the olive oil, until you have a paste.</p>
<p class="method">Clean the mushrooms with kitchen paper (avoid using water), and cut away any decaying parts of the stalks and caps. Slice any very meaty mushrooms, such as chestnut mushrooms or large chanterelles.</p>
<p class="method">Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a lidded sauté pan or large casserole. Put in the chicken pieces and brown on all sides for about 10 minutes. Add the herbs, wine, Cognac, vinegar and 100ml of water and bubble up, uncovered, for 5 minutes, then turn down the heat, cover, and cook slowly for 15 minutes, turning the pieces of chicken from time to time to prevent them drying out on one side.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_415"/>Bash the garlic cloves with the back of a knife, to crack them. Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in a separate pan, put in the garlic and fry for a minute before adding the mushrooms. Cook briefly until coloured, then take off the heat and keep to one side. If you have a mixture of mushrooms, cook the meatiest first, set aside, then cook any more fragile ones separately, being careful to not let their moisture evaporate. You may find you need another tablespoon of olive oil if cooking the mushrooms in batches. The cooking time varies with different types of mushroom but none should take more than 2–5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">When all the mushrooms are cooked, remove the garlic and add the mushrooms to the chicken, then add the <em>picada</em> and stir well.</p>
<p class="method">Taste the sauce and add a pinch of salt if you feel it is necessary.</p>
<p class="method">You may need to add some more water at this stage – perhaps another 100ml – so that there is enough sauce.</p>
<p class="method">Allow to simmer, uncovered, over a low heat for a further 10 minutes while the <em>picada</em> thickens the sauce and the flavours mingle. If on the other hand the sauce is too liquid, take off the lid and let it bubble up and reduce for a few more minutes.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Chicken and lobster Begur style</p>
<p class="flush_left">When, in the nineteenth century, it became possible to separate cocoa butter and powder to make solid chocolate rather than consuming it only in drinks, it became popular, not only in desserts, but in savoury dishes of chicken, game, beef and oxtail. This dish, which features chocolate in the <em>picada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>), is from Pepa Salvador’s colourful repertoire at La Salsita, the restaurant she used to run on the Costa Brava (see <a href="chapter_001.html#pg_9">here</a>). Chicken and lobster is the most classic of <em>mar i muntanya</em> (sea and mountain) combinations.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 prepared lobster, about 1.5–2kg, or 8–10 very large prawns, shell on</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 free-range chicken, cut into 8 pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 leek, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml dry sherry</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml Cognac</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>) or water</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 <strong><em>farcellet</em></strong> or bouquet garni (bay, thyme, parsley, oregano, orange peel, tied together with string)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a handful of chopped herbs of your choice for garnish (optional)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <strong><em>picada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">30g hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">30g almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">30g grated dark chocolate</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 strands of saffron, soaked in 1 tablespoon warm water</p>
<p class="method">Take off the head of the lobster, if using, and put to one side for later. Discard the body, then cut the tail lengthways, remove the meat and cut it into 1cm pieces. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Wrap the claws in a tea towel in case of flying shards, and crack the shells with a hammer or the handle of a heavy knife. Remove the flesh and save it along with the tail meat.</p>
<p class="method">Season the chicken pieces with salt, pepper and cinnamon. Heat a little olive oil in a casserole, put in the lobster head, if using, or the prawns, along with the chicken, and brown all over. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep on one side. Remove the lobster head, if using, and discard. If using prawns, lift these out and keep for later.</p>
<p class="method">In the same pan that you cooked the chicken, fry the onion, leek and carrot, and when they begin to colour add the grated tomatoes and cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated. Put back the chicken and add the sherry and Cognac. Bubble up to reduce the liquid and when it has reduced, cover the chicken with the stock or water, add the <em>farcellet</em> or bouquet garni, and simmer for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, make the <em>picada.</em> Toast the nuts in a dry pan, turning regularly, until golden (take care not to let them burn), then leave to cool and rub off the skins with a clean tea towel. Pound the chocolate, nuts and saffron (with its soaking water) using a pestle and mortar until it forms a smooth paste.</p>
<p class="method">Add the <em>picada</em> to the chicken along with the reserved lobster, if using, and simmer gently for about 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Alternatively, add the reserved sautéd prawns to the pan just for the last couple of minutes until heated through. Serve, garnished, if you like, with herbs.</p>

Pilar’s oenologist daughter, Violeta, has spent time with us in London, bringing over the estate wines, and when I asked her which were the family recipes she most treasured from her childhood, she chose this, along with <em>gazpachos manchegos</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_456">here</a>). For the meatballs Pilar uses a mixture of beef and pork, as, she says, the addition of pork makes them more juicy.</p>
<p class="indented">The dish is delicious with braised greens.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>)</p>

<p class="ingredients">1 <strong><em>ñora</em></strong> pepper (optional), soaked in water for 30 minutes</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of saffron, briefly toasted in a dry pan</p>
<p class="method">First make the meatballs. In a bowl, soak the bread in enough milk to cover, for at least 10 minutes. Squeeze out the milk and discard it.</p>
<p class="method">Have the flour ready on a deep plate. Add the minced meats to the squeezed-out bread, along with the egg, garlic, parsley, pine nuts, nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix well. Form into around 20 balls just smaller than a golf ball (around 40g each) and coat these well in the flour.</p>
<p class="method">Heat some oil in a frying pan and put in the almonds for the <em>picada</em>. Move around until they are golden, then lift out and keep to one side. Put in the meatballs (in batches if necessary) and fry until golden on all sides. Drain on kitchen paper and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>picada</em>, pound the garlic, parsley, almonds and 2 tablespoons of the hot stock into a paste using a pestle and mortar. Keep to one side. If using the <em>ñora</em> pepper, scrape out the flesh and work into the paste along with a little of the soaking water and the saffron.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large, deep, wide pan or casserole. Season the chicken pieces, add them to the pan, and sauté for about 10 minutes over a medium heat until browned all over. Lift out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put the grated tomato and cubed potatoes into the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until the potato takes on some colour. Put back the reserved chicken, then pour in enough stock to cover (if necessary, top up with water) and bring to the boil. Turn down to a medium heat and simmer for 20 minutes, then add the meatballs and stir in the <em>picada</em>. Cook for another 10 minutes or so, until the golden-coloured stock has reduced and thickened a little and the chicken is cooked through. Take out a piece and pierce it to check that the juices run clear.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Duck with pears and butternut squash</p>
<p class="flush_left">Duck is more often associated with France, but in northern Spain and Catalunya, in particular, it is very popular for its cured breast meat and its liver, as well as this classic casserole made with a whole fresh duck.</p>
<p class="indented">In autumn in the forests of Catalunya, alongside the mushroom hunters and chestnut foragers, you can still bump into ladies from the villages looking for the wild pears which grow there and have a quite woody and tough texture that can withstand longer cooking than their more delicate orchard cousins. We have adapted this family recipe, which was given to me by Mari Carmen Ruiz, mother of our Catalan head chef Leo Rivera, to include the more familiar fruit.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 duck, about 1–1.5 kg (cut into wings, breasts and legs, and keep the carcass)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 star anise</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 medium sweet white onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 medium tomatoes, finely chopped</p>

<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 150°C/gas 2.</p>
<p class="method">On the hob, heat a heavy-based deep casserole (one that will transfer to the oven and has a lid). Season the duck pieces, put them into the casserole and brown each piece on all sides. You shouldn’t need any oil, as the duck is fatty enough. Once golden brown, remove and keep to one side, then put in the carcass and brown it all over. Add the cinnamon and star anise and colour briefly, then remove both the carcass and the spices. Discard the spices and keep the carcass to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Leave the residual duck fat in the pan, put in the onions and cook gently until golden, then add the tomatoes and cook gently for about 20 minutes, until the tomatoes have lost most of their water. Add the port and bubble up for 10 minutes to burn off the alcohol.</p>
<p class="method">Return the carcass to the casserole, add the stock and cook for 10 minutes. Take out the carcass and blend the sauce, then pass it through a fine sieve. Return the duck to the pan, pour the sauce over the top, cover and put into the oven for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="method">Towards the end of the cooking time, peel the pears, cut them in half, and cut the squash into 2cm squares. Put the sugar into a frying pan over a low heat and let it melt, then add the pears and squash and keep moving them around until they are nicely caramelised. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">If making the <em>picada</em>, toast the nuts until golden in a dry pan, then crush along with the rest of the ingredients, using a pestle and mortar or a small blender.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the casserole from the oven. Put in the caramelised pears and squash and cook on the hob over a low heat for a further 10 minutes. Add the <em>picada</em>, if using, to the casserole for the last 5 minutes, lightly stirring it in.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec165"><a id="pg_422"/>Conejo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Rabbit</p>
<p class="flush_left">Wild rabbit, along with hare, has long been on the menu in Spanish homes and restaurants, and these days rabbit is also farmed in a big way to satisfy demand. Our family, including the children, have always enjoyed rabbit, as it is very lean and often has more flavour than chicken.</p>
<p class="indented">The cooking times I have given are for farmed rabbit, but if you are using wild rabbit I would recommend adding more liquid and cooking for around double the time.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec166">Conejo al ‘jas’</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Jazzy rabbit with brandy and carrots</p>
<p class="flush_left">This was one of Pepa Salvador’s dishes at La Salsita on the Costa Brava (see <a href="chapter_001.html#pg_9">here</a>) and we make it regularly at home. When rabbit is cooked at a very low temperature over three hours you end up with meltingly tender meat, very sweet carrots, and soft caramelised onions which all meld together in a thick and really delicious sauce. Of course, you could substitute chicken for the rabbit.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rabbit (about 1.6kg), cut into 10–12 pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml Cognac</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 large carrots, cut thickly like chips</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 medium onions, sliced in rings</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 medium tomatoes, diced</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <strong><em>picada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">50g almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Spread the almonds over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 8–10 minutes. Take out and keep to one side. Turn down the oven to 120°C/gas ½.</p>
<p class="method">Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan, season the rabbit, brown on all sides, then flambé with the Cognac. Lift out and put into an ovenproof dish with a lid.</p>
<p class="method">Put another tablespoon of oil into the frying pan, add the carrots and sauté for a few minutes, then lift out and add to the rabbit. Add yet another tablespoon of oil to the pan, sauté the onions for a few minutes, then add to the rabbit and carrots. Put the last tablespoon of oil into the pan, sauté the tomatoes for a few minutes and add to the rabbit.</p>
<p class="method">Make the <em>picada</em> by pounding the almonds and garlic in a mortar, dilute with 250ml water, add to the rabbit, cover with the lid and put into the oven for 3 hours.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec167"><a id="pg_423"/>Conejo al ajillo con patatas a lo pobre</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Rabbit in garlic and wine with ‘Poor Man’s potatoes’</p>
<p class="flush_left">There are many, many versions of rabbit with garlic – originally the rabbit would probably have just been fried in a pan with peppers and potatoes, a quite dry affair – but now every cook or chef has their own interpretation of how the meat should be, from deep-fried and toffee-coloured to slow-cooked. This is our executive chef Josep’s twist on the theme, a variation on the Canarian stew <em>conejo al samorejo</em>, and it is very tasty. You need a litre of oil to cook the potatoes, which might seem wasteful, but it will be beautifully flavoured, so you could strain it through a fine sieve and keep it for sautéing meat and vegetables in other dishes.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 tablespoons olive oil, plus a little extra</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 heads of garlic, trimmed of roots and loose skin</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rabbit (about 1.6kg), cut into 10–12 pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rabbit liver</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml dry white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">400ml <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 <strong><em>farcellet</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_80">here</a>), or 1 bay leaf and 5 sprigs of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">juice of 2 lemons</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley</p>
<p class="forhead">For the potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5kg potatoes, thinly sliced (5mm)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 green pepper, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="method">For the potatoes, pour the olive oil into a deep pan, making sure it comes no higher than a third of the way up. Put it over a medium heat and put in the cloves of garlic. When they begin to sizzle, put in the slices of potato.</p>
<p class="method">Now you need to keep the oil at a gentle simmer for about 40 minutes, so that the potatoes cook slowly and become soft and lightly golden around the edges. Don’t stir the potatoes or they will break up, and don’t worry if the lower level of potatoes becomes more well-browned.</p>
<p class="method">Add the green pepper, gently pushing the slices into the oil and carefully giving the pan a shake to help them settle. Continue frying gently for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Take the pan off the heat, allow to cool slightly, then carefully lift out the potatoes and green pepper with a fish slice, put into a sieve to drain off the oil and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">About halfway through the cooking time for the potatoes, heat the 5 tablespoons of oil in a deep, heavy-based sauté pan or ceramic dish over a medium heat and put in the heads of garlic, tilting the pan so they just sizzle lightly and begin to brown.</p>
<p class="method">Season the rabbit pieces and begin by adding the legs to the pan, letting them sizzle in the oil on a medium heat until browned on all sides, and remove. Next, put in the loin pieces, again brown on each side and remove. Put in the ribs, and repeat. Lastly, drizzle a little more oil over the liver, put it in the pan and again fry until browned, then remove.</p>
<p class="method">Return all the rabbit pieces to the pan, add the white wine and stir until it begins to bubble. Pour in two-thirds of the stock along with the peppercorns and the <em>farcellet</em> or herbs, and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the remaining stock and the lemon juice and cover with a lid for 2 minutes, then take off the lid, stir in half the parsley and cook uncovered for a further 10 minutes, until the sauce has reduced. Sprinkle with the rest of the parsley and serve hot with the potatoes.</p>

<p class="indented">The large European white pig has for many decades been the stuff of everyday eating all over Spain but now the fresh meat from the famous Ibérico pig, better known for its luxurious dried hams, is becoming much better known both in Spain and beyond (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_172">here</a>).</p>


<p class="recipe-head" id="rec169">Solomillo con castañas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Roasted pork tenderloin with chestnuts</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a favourite dish developed at our London Bridge restaurant, and is very easy to make at home. In winter I like it with something green alongside, such as blanched cabbage, other brassicas or long beans, but it is a recipe that suits summer too, with a fresh green salad and some new potatoes. If you can find Ibérico meat, then it will be extra special.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large pork tenderloin (preferably Ibérico), about 800g</p>

<p class="method">Mix the honey and oil together in a small bowl, smear this over the meat, then season.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the chestnuts around the meat and pour the white wine over the top. Put into the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180ºC/gas 4 for another 20 minutes, until the meat is browned on the top and the chestnuts have darkened.</p>
<p class="method">Take out of the oven, leave to rest for a few minutes, then slice the meat and serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Riojan pork, <em>chorizo</em> and potato pot</p>
<p class="flush_left">On one occasion when I visited the Alejandro brothers, suppliers of our Riojan <em>chorizo</em>, they cooked this up outdoors on an open fire in a big pot – and generously gave me their recipe.</p>
<p class="indented">It expands the famous Riojan potato and <em>chorizo</em> dish <em>patatas a la riojana</em> further into a bigger one-pot stew that includes pork chops, peppers, wine and mushrooms – in spring in Rioja, you find <em>perrechicos</em> (St George’s mushrooms), which are excellent. It makes a great weekend lunch with crusty bread and a good Riojan wine.</p>
<p class="indented">This is one of a number of dishes in which the potatoes are traditionally cut <em>cascada</em> style (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_292">here</a>), and it will be even better if you have the time to rub the chops first with a dry <em>adobo</em> marinade (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_398">here</a>).</p>

<p class="quote">‘quite sublime’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Ibérico pork is something quite sublime. Historically, it was always eaten in the south-west of Spain, where small quantities would be left after the butchering of the pigs for hams, sausages and other cured produce. Abattoirs would usually sell this meat to local restaurateurs and butchers. However, as the clamour for Ibérico hams has risen and risen and their production has expanded to satisfy a growing global market, more fresh meat has naturally also become available, and modern packaging and transport allows it to be frozen and to travel efficiently to more distant markets. Especially in tough financial times, it is both an attractive, and often necessary, proposition for a ham producer to also sell fresh meat, which can help keep the cash flowing while he waits three or four years for each vintage of hams to cure.</p>
<p class="indented">Of course, the down side to the expanding market for both hams and pork is that more Ibérico pigs are being farmed intensively, rather than running around the hills and forests, and you won’t necessarily be able to tell, since the labelling of fresh Ibérico meat is less rigorous than for cured products (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_172">here</a>). It isn’t compulsory to declare the upbringing of the animal or the feed on which it has been reared, so provided a pig has 50 per cent Ibérico in its genes the meat can be labelled <em>ibérico</em>, but you won’t necessarily know any more about its life than that. Even if it has been fattened on acorns, there may be no mention of this on the label, however if the <em>de bellota</em> status <em>does</em> appear, the supplier needs to be able to offer full traceability.</p>
<p class="indented">The price is no real indicator either, as it varies little, since the reality is that the gulf between fresh meat from an Ibérico pig that has been fattened on industrial feed and <em>de bellota</em> <em>ibérico</em> meat from an elite animal that has run free, eating acorns, is far smaller than in the case of hams. This is because it is the long curing process for hams that allows the acorns time to fully work their magic, imparting all kinds of silky, complex nuances to the meat.</p>
<p class="indented">That said, <em>de bellota</em> <em>ibérico</em> is the carnivore’s ultimate meat, all the more enticing because it is only available fresh (rather than frozen) from around January to March, when the acorn-fed animals are slaughtered. We celebrate this short season every year in our shops and restaurants, where the chefs put on a <em>‘menu matanza’</em> in January, using different cuts of the fresh meat. The ‘noble’ ones, richly marbled with fat, are usually grilled and can be cooked slightly pink, since to overcook them would blast the delicacy, balance and complexity of flavours.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_429"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg429.jpg"/></div>

<p class="flush_left1"><a id="pg_430"/><strong>Secreto</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">This is the most expensive cut, a fan-shaped muscle located next to the shoulder socket and under the back fat. It has a very silky texture and its thinness makes it suitable for slicing into strips, grilling and serving in salads. In the Brindisa bars and restaurants we serve <em>secreto</em> with <em>papas arrugadas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_296">here</a>) and <em>mojos</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>Pluma</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">The end of the loin, sometimes called feather loin, this attaches to the neck of the animal and is also expensive. We like to sear it in a pan over a high heat until the fat almost caramelises, then serve it with onion confit and oven-baked sliced potatoes, <em>patatas panaderas.</em></p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>Solomillo</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Solomillo</em>, or tenderloin, is the leanest cut, which is more popular in the UK than in Spain, as to the Spanish taste the lack of fat just means it is less juicy. We might serve it with <em>piquillo</em> peppers, pomegranate and a red wine sauce, or with chestnuts (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec169">here</a>).</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>Presa</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">A big and precious muscle, marbled with fat, between the top of the shoulder and the head of the loin. It weighs about 700–800g and is usually around 1–2cm thick. It is very juicy, with a distinctly gamey flavour, and can be roasted – or it is superb barbecued over an open flame. At Brindisa we pan-fry a whole 800g <em>presa</em> – enough for eight people – until slightly pink-medium in a little olive oil in a heavy-based pan. We cook it for 15–20 minutes, turning it every 3 or 4 minutes until it is well coloured all over. Then we leave it to rest in a warm place for 10 minutes before serving, and it is tender, moist and succulent.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>Carrillera</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">This is the cheek, which we often use for long, slow cooking as it becomes very tender over a couple of hours or more. Typically in the Brindisa kitchens the cheeks are cooked with red wine, and are often served with butter beans or mashed potato (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_431">here</a>).</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec171"><a id="pg_431"/>Carrilleras estofadas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Pork cheeks braised in red wine</p>
<p class="flush_left">Pork cheeks need longer cooking than other cuts, but will become rich, dark and juicy in the sauce and the meat will just fall apart when you eat it, especially if you can find Ibérico pork, which is rich in fat and incredibly tender. This is another dish created by our executive chef, Josep, who put it on the menu the moment we were able to bring Ibérico pork to London. It is good with mashed potatoes or with white beans. You could also make it with beef cheeks.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg pork cheeks, preferably Ibérico</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 50g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 carrots, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 leek, white part only, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 stick of celery, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml red wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre warm beef stock</p>
<p class="method">Clean the cheeks with a sharp knife, taking off what you can of the thin layer of fat and network of nerves. The rest will just melt and disappear.</p>
<p class="method">Put the flour into a shallow bowl and season it with salt and pepper. Dust the cheeks with it.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a deep pan and put in the cheeks. Colour on all sides, then lift out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put all the vegetables into the pan, add a pinch of salt and cook gently until golden brown, but take care not to let them burn.</p>
<p class="method">Return the meat to the pan, add the wine and bring to the boil, to burn off the alcohol. Pour in the warm stock and bring back to the boil. Turn down the heat to low, cover and leave to cook gently for at least 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender.</p>
<p class="method">Have the oven on low and put in a serving dish. With a slotted spoon lift out the cheeks and put them into the warm dish in the oven.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the contents of the pan through a fine sieve into a clean pan, pressing the vegetables through, then bubble this up on the hob until reduced to a thick, silky consistency.</p>
<p class="method">Pour this sauce over the cheeks and serve.</p>

<h2 class="box-head" id="box13"><a id="pg_432"/>Wood-fired Meats</h2>
<p class="flush_left">From chops to whole suckling lamb, kid or pig, baked in an <em>asador</em> (wood-burning oven), there is a big tradition of the Sunday roast in the north of Spain, especially in northern Castilla, around Burgos – but not as we would recognise it in the UK. Usually the meat is the hero, presented on its own, with vegetable dishes such as <em>escalivada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_284">here</a>) or grilled artichokes served first.</p>
<p class="indented">The old practice of lighting a fire and roasting suckling animals, especially (lambs and goats may be as young as four or five weeks and a suckling pig usually less than three), makes for meat that is incredibly succulent and delicate in flavour, and the idea that we could roast such meats in London was the inspiration behind the launch of our own Brindisa <em>asador</em>, in Piccadilly. Once I knew that we could bring over lambs from the herds farmed by Félix Vicente Pastor and Isidora Llamas Vicente, whose milk goes into their Zamorano cheese (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p516a">here</a>) along with suckling pigs from Castilla y León, we were up and running.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain the grilling, roasting or baking of the meat is frequently a male thing, when the men of the family take huge pride in preparing the meal and often build or convert some kind of den, or <em>merendero,</em> equipped with a big, serious grill, for cooking copious amounts of delicate chops of milk-fed lamb (<em>lechales de cordero</em>) or sausages, such as <em>botifarras</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p450a">here</a>); and/or a wood-burning oven for roasting vast pieces of meat or whole suckling animals at the weekends and on feast days and holidays.</p>
<p class="indented">Some of our friends have built quite luxurious communal cooking and eating spaces that are like gourmet playrooms for entertaining, attached to their homes or businesses, with shelves of cookery books, slicing machines for hams, and racks of vintage wines. Others are more rustic, lined with hunting trophies.</p>
<p class="indented">Félix and Isidora and their family live in one of three adjoining terraced houses in their village. His two brothers and their families live in the others, and in an ingenious arrangement, a cellar runs beneath all three houses, with staircases leading up to each home. As well as allowing the young cousins to run from house to house without using the front doors, the space has been transformed into a <em>bodega</em>, with a grill, eating area and wine store, for everyone to gather around the table while the men do the barbecuing. And in Burgos our friends Ambro and Asun have a typical <em>merendero</em>, <a id="pg_433"/>transformed from an old storage cave in the hills, where they roast lamb over vine trimmings, to be eaten with the local country bread, <em>pan de hogaza</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Families and friends will also gather together to go out for the big meat meal. There is a medieval town called Lerma, about two hours’ drive from Madrid in Burgos, which is famous for its ancient convents and monasteries. At Easter especially, you see the cars snaking up the mountain to any number of <em>asador</em> restaurants where they roast whole suckling lambs over wood fires. There is no menu, everyone is given the same thing: wonderful milk-fed lamb, salad – maybe some potatoes – good bread, and dark red wine.</p>
<p class="indented">One of the most memorable roasted meat meals I ever had was in Catalunya, with a group of friends from a local theatre group called La Gabia. We went up into the mountains to a vast farmhouse in Pruit, a tiny hamlet next to the famous shaped workshop space used by the troubadour group Els Jogleurs: a hexagonal bubble sitting on the side of a hill by a stream and medieval bridge, which looked completely alien in this quiet wooded corner of Catalunya. The farmhouse had a long, rough wooden table that could sit at least 25 people and the troupe of actors had bought three suckling pigs, which we roasted slowly in three separate ovens.</p>
<p class="indented">After drinks and tapas, and much ad hoc performing of comedy and singing, the pigs were brought to the table on vast plates, and carved – head, ears, tail, everything. A neighbour on one side sucked on trotters and on my other side a chap with a pig’s head on his plate dug away at the cheeks, while I rather demurely tucked into a piece of lovely fillet and delicious crackling.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec172"><a id="pg_434"/>Cordero</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Lamb</p>
<p class="flush_left">In the central regions of Spain, <em>lechal</em> (unweaned or suckling) lamb is a big favourite for roasting in the <em>asador (</em>wood-burning oven). There are five protected production areas: Castilla y León, Extremadura, Navarra, Aragón and La Mancha. The dominant ancient breeds, capable of surviving in harsh conditions, are the Churra (in the north), Manchega in the central region south of Madrid, Merina (known as Merino in the UK) in the south, and the Aragonesa in Aragón, where the herds are raised in the hills and fed on herb-rich pasture which give a certain ‘bouquet’ to the meat.</p>
<p class="indented">Because of my long association with our cheesemaker friend Ambro in Burgos, the Churra, whose milk he used in his cheeses, is the breed that I know best. It is the prettiest of all the Spanish breeds: bright white, with a short coat and black markings on its ears, eyes and hooves. Despite its beauty, however, it is a very hardy animal which adapts very well to the wind, cold, rain, frost and storms that can prevail in its home provinces of Burgos, Palencia and Valladolid in northern Castile – where the rainfall produces very aromatic, fine grass pasture that reshoots over a long season.</p>
<p class="indented">While in Aragón the lambs are typically slaughtered at 70–90 days, after being reared on a mixed diet of milk and grass, in the two Castillas they might be as young as 28–30 days. Many of the towns in Castilla y León, such as Lerma and Aranda de Duero in the province of Burgos, are full of restaurants which specialise in roasting them (as well as kid goats and suckling pigs), whole or quartered, covered with chunks of lard, in ceramic dishes. Then they will be served perfectly plainly, with local Ribera del Duero wine, such as Viña Pedrosa or Carmelo Rodero, to cut through the sweet fat.</p>
<p class="indented">To some, slaughtering a lamb of just 12 kilos as opposed to around 20 kilos, the average weight of a British lamb at slaughter, might seem shocking, brutal even, but the <em>lechal</em> tradition is deeply rooted in the farming and sustenance cycle of the region, where the typical cheeses such as Manchego, Zamorano and Castellano are made with sheep’s milk, and so the flocks are primarily dairy. In order to keep the animals producing milk, they have to continue to breed, and the suckling lambs must be taken away from their mothers so that the milk can go into the cheese-making. The consequence is plenty of young animals for the table, whose meat is so much more delicate in flavour than the lamb we are used to in the UK that it seems wrong to distract from its purity. I once took a jar of mint sauce out to Isidora Llamas Vicente, the wife of shepherd and artisan cheesemaker Félix Pastor in Zamora (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_432">here</a>) for her to try, since young lamb provides their staple diet, but instantly regretted it as it was far too aggressive for the subtle meat, and I suspect it is still sitting in the larder untouched.</p>
<p class="indented">Older lamb or mutton, known colloquially as <em>macanco</em> (though it can also mean an elderly donkey), is rarely seen, though you will occasionally come across <em>la borra</em>: a female sheep that is barren and ‘has to go’: <em>hay que borrarla</em>. In Burgos, the children of our friends Ambro and Ásun (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>) have often managed to save the occasional <em>borra</em> from certain dispatch by giving her a starring role in the village Christmas play, where she would become <em>la religiosa</em> instead.</p>
<p class="indented">There is, however, a big tradition of long, slowly cooked lamb stews such as <em>caldereta</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_435">here</a>), whose origins are in the pots cooked over fires by the shepherds on the <em>transhumance</em>.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec173"><a id="pg_435"/>Caldereta de cordero de la pastora</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Shepherd’s lamb stew</p>
<p class="flush_left">This, historically, is not really a recipe at all: it is just the humble meal that the <em>pastores</em> (shepherds) cooked up in the open countryside, as they travelled the <em>transhumance</em> routes (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_526">here</a>) of Castilla y León on foot.</p>
<p class="indented">They would find some good tree trunks and suspend a rope between them from which to hang a stewpot over an open fire. Then they would slaughter a lamb from their herd and prepare most of it for the stewpot, perhaps keeping thinner pieces for grilling on long forks. Since they were in the wild, little else would be added to the pot, except perhaps a leaf or two of wild bay or thyme, and so the meat would just cook in its own juices.</p>
<p class="indented">These days, however, <em>caldereta</em> has become ‘a dish’ and there are all sorts of recipes which include extra ingredients to embellish the flavour of the lamb. When Ásun Gordo (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>) makes hers, she uses 80 per cent of leg cuts and 20 per cent of neck to give some fattiness – however, the taste of the meat is much milder than its equivalent in Britain, since Spanish lamb is slaughtered much earlier. This also means that the cooking time in Ásun’s kitchen would only be about 40 minutes, but to bring the lamb to the same level of tenderness in my kitchen takes about 3½ hours of slow cooking.</p>
<p class="indented">This is Leo Rivera’s recipe, and as with all stews, the flavours will deepen if you can leave the pan to rest for an hour before you want to eat it, and then heat it through on the hob before serving.</p>
<p class="indented">It is good served simply with chunky bread and a deep red wine such as Rioja, Ribero del Duero or Bierzo.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg lamb leg, cut into cubes of about 3cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g flour, to coat the lamb</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 green pepper, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 <strong><em>guindilla</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>), de-seeded</p>

<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón picante</em></strong> (hot paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a handful of parsley leaves, chopped</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a large pan, season the meat, coat with the flour, put it into the pan and brown it on all sides for about 10 minutes, then lift out and keep to one side. Put the onion, green pepper and whole <em>guindilla</em> peppers into the pan and cook slowly for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Pound the garlic and thyme together with a pestle and mortar and add to the pan, then put back the lamb. Add the wine, Cognac and vinegar and stir in, then add the paprika and cover with 800ml of water.</p>
<p class="method">Cover the pan and cook very slowly for about 3½ hours, or until the lamb is tender, tasting and adjusting the seasoning as necessary. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve hot.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Shoulder of lamb roasted in <em>cava</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">This is our executive chef Josep’s recipe, which works equally well for young and older lamb, as the <em>cava</em> keeps the meat juicy. He uses sweet pink onions from Figueres in the Empordà region of Catalunya, but Roscoff onions also work well.</p>
<p class="indented">Serve it with braised white beans or fresh <em>pochas</em>, if you can find them, fresh minted green peas, or fried potatoes and peppers.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 x 1–1.5kg shoulder of lamb</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 whole medium-sized sweet onions</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a bottle of cava</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Take the meat from the fridge about half an hour before cooking to bring it up to room temperature, and rub it all over with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the oil into a deep baking tray.</p>
<p class="method">Cut the foreleg section of the shoulder from the blade section, and rub each piece all over with more salt and pepper. Place next to each other in the baking tray, along with the whole onions and the garlic, cut side down, and put into the preheated oven. Roast for 10 minutes to brown one side of the meat, then take out and turn it over (if the meat is looking a little dry, sprinkle with a little water). Put back into the oven and brown the other side for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the <em>cava</em> and roast for another 20 minutes, basting and shaking the tray a little to make sure the juices are moving around. The total cooking time should be no longer than 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Rest the meat for about 5 minutes before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Menorcan baked lamb with tomatoes</p>
<p class="flush_left">On our frequent family visits to Menorca, we can’t resist this wonderfully hearty one-pot lamb dish, so one of our Menorcan chef colleagues at Shoreditch restaurant showed us how to make it. <em>Perol</em> is the name of the pan used, which is similar to a <em>paella</em> pan.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.2kg potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</p>

<p class="ingredients">8 young lamb ribs, separated</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 sprigs of rosemary, plus a little extra for garnish</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Oil the surface of a large oven dish or roasting tin with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, then cut one of the garlic cloves in half and rub this, too, over the surface. Put in half the potatoes, making sure they don’t overlap too much, and season. Lay half the tomato slices on top, again making sure they don’t overlap, and season. Place the ribs on top and season again. Slice the rest of the garlic and sprinkle over, along with the thyme leaves. Drizzle with half the remaining oil, then put in the 2 sprigs of rosemary, cover with the rest of the tomato, press the slices down and season again, then layer the remaining potatoes over the top, season again and drizzle with the remaining olive oil.</p>
<p class="method">Cover with foil and put into the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and allow to brown for a further 5 minutes. Serve garnished with a little rosemary.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec176"><a id="pg_438"/>Ternera</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Beef</p>
<p class="method">In the north of Spain there is a great tradition of excellent beef, especially the vast beef steaks of the Basque country. Galicia, Asturias, Navarra, Extremadura, Sierra de Guadarrama, the province of Ávila and the Basque country all have beef production with protected status – for example, the excellent meat that comes from the herds of Raza Avileña (local to Ávila) that are nourished on open lowlands rich in natural pasture and grassland. In most restaurants you will find huge <em>chuletones</em> (chops) of Avileña beef which are supremely good, doused in olive oil, seasoned with chunky sea salt and cooked rare.</p>
<p class="indented">In the south, mainly in Andalucía, are the big open plains where the great beasts for bullfighting roam, and following the fight, the meat and tail from a slain bull <em>(carne de lidia)</em> is often sold to an exclusive network of restaurants which traditionally cook the awesome prime loin steaks on the grill. Other cuts might be marinated overnight in red wine and treated more like game.</p>
<p class="indented">Cooking on an open fire does wonderful things for beef and it is an art which the Spanish have long understood. In the Basque country, thick rib-eye steaks from mature animals of up to 156 months old and weighing over 800kg, are typically cooked over coals in the open air, with their yellow waxy fat softening like butter. In Catalunya, too, where the grills are called <em>parelladas,</em> steaks might be a part of the traditional big meal of mixed grilled meats.</p>
<p class="indented">Our Basque beef supplier and friend in San Sebastian, Imanol Jaca, sources and hangs his beef for 25 days at his San Sebastián warehouse, before selling it to the best Basque restaurants and specialist steak and cider houses. When I first met him many years ago at a festival of food I was amazed at the vast sides of deep red meat on display at his stand – some of the biggest I had ever seen. The meat is from selected farms on which the cattle have been allowed to grow to maturity on grass, enjoying a natural and varied diet, with fresh air and plenty of exercise, and are not slaughtered until they have led a long life, which could be 15 or 20 years. Imanol chooses the farmer before the animal, valuing those who look after their cattle as if they were the family treasure. The beef is comparable to an Ibérico ham, in that the age and lifestyle of the animals determines the quality of the best meat, marbled and enriched with generous, golden buttery fat that gives the cooked steaks the silky texture and sumptuous flavour that the Basque people love.</p>
<p class="indented">The last time I visited Imanol he filled a bag with cuts of his top-of-the-range 18-year-old rump and rib-eye and we headed to his gastronomy club around the corner from his shop, Don Serapio, where, on the <em>plancha</em>, he grilled a massive rib-eye steak of around 700–800g, taken from the upper rib with the full bone on, followed by a 400g piece of topside which he seared for just two minutes on each side. He finished with <em>txogitxu tartare pasado por la plancha</em> (seared Basque steak tartare) – a cross between a steak tartare and a very rare burger – in which the joy of the tender, smooth-flavoured meat from these older cattle really shone through. The only seasoning Imanol used was a little rock salt sprinkled on for serving, as he insisted that when meat is this flavoursome you barely need any.</p>
<p class="indented">Equally, great pieces of meat, simply barbecued or grilled, require little in the way of sauces; however, various regions have their favourites. In Burgos our friend Ambrosio (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>) bastes the meat as it grills with his <em>salsa preve,</em> olive oil heated gently with smoked <em>pimentón.</em> The Catalans will serve a bowl of <em>alioli</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_136">here</a>), with every plate of grilled meats, and the Canarians will often accompany the meat with <em>mojo rojo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_300">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Blue cheese from the Picos mountains can make a rich accompaniment, dotted on a hearty rib-eye steak; and one of the best early combinations we put on the menu at Tapas Brindisa was a fillet of beef on a bed of sweet caramelised onions, topped with melted Torta de Barros sheep’s cheese from Extramadura (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p524c">here</a>).</p>


<p class="recipe-head" id="rec177"><a id="pg_439"/>Rabo de buey a la cordobesa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Cordoban oxtail stew with potatoes</p>
<p class="flush_left">I am including two ways with oxtail – first, this quite light southern recipe which we serve at Tapas Brindisa. What is special and unusual about it is that it is made with sweet Moscatel wine and tomatoes, which results in a sweet-savoury sauce wonderfully enriched with the gelatine from the oxtail. We serve it with very thinly cut sautéd potatoes, but boiled potatoes or slices of chunky bread are just as good.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little plain flour, seasoned with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5kg oxtail, cut into medallions 4cm thick</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium carrots, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml Moscatel wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">600g tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 1.5 litres beef stock (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p469a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Put the seasoned flour into a shallow bowl and dust the oxtail pieces in it, shaking off the excess.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a wide pan (that has a close-fitting lid), put in the onions, carrots and garlic and cook gently until softened but not coloured. Lift out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Turn up the heat, add another 2 tablespoons of oil, put in the pieces of oxtail and brown and seal on all sides, then lift out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">If the pan contains any burnt flour, lift out the oxtail and clean the pan before putting it back on a gentle heat with a little fresh oil.</p>
<p class="method">Return the vegetables to the pan, add the paprika and cook for another minute, then return the oxtail to the pan, add the bay leaves and wine and bubble up to burn off the alcohol. Add the tomatoes, season, and pour in enough stock to cover by 1cm.</p>
<p class="method">Put on the lid, turn the heat down very low and simmer extremely gently – just the occasional bubble disturbing the surface – for 2–2½ hours (if possible use a diffuser underneath the pan). Top up with stock as necessary. The stew is ready when the meat comes readily away from the bone and the sauce is thick and glossy.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec178"><a id="pg_440"/>Rabo de buey al vino tinto con chocolate</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Slow-cooked oxtail in red wine and chocolate</p>
<p class="flush_left">This second recipe for oxtail is inspired by a dish that Ana Barrera makes at her restaurant (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) and has a darker sauce than the Cordoban-style dish on <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_439">here</a>, as it is made with red wine. It does take longer planning, as the oxtail needs to tenderise in the wine for a day before you cook it, and it is at its best if you serve it the day after it is cooked. It is good served, as Ana does, with chunky chips.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5kg oxtail, cut into medallions 4cm thick</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 large onions, cut into chunks, about 3–4cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium carrots, cut into chunks, about 3–4cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 leeks, cut into chunks, about 3–4cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium parsnips, cut into chunks, about 3–4cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre red wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little plain flour, seasoned with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">12 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">8–10 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">5cm cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic, whole but trimmed top and bottom</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g dark chocolate</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons Cognac (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5 litres beef stock (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p469a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Put the oxtail and vegetables into a bowl with the red wine, ensuring that the liquid covers the meat. Leave in the fridge for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="method">Take out the oxtail, reserving the vegetables and marinade. Put the seasoned flour into a shallow bowl and dust the oxtail pieces in it, shaking off the excess.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a large casserole, put in the pieces of oxtail and brown and seal on all sides, then add the reserved vegetables and sauté briefly. Add the reserved wine marinade and bubble up to reduce a little before adding all the rest of the ingredients and enough stock to cover all the ingredients by 1cm.</p>
<p class="method">Allow to simmer extremely gently – just the occasional bubble disturbing the surface – for 2–2½ hours (if you have a diffuser, use this underneath the casserole). Add a little more stock if necessary during cooking and towards the end, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</p>
<p class="method">The stew is ready when the meat will come away from the bone easily, but keep checking that you don’t overcook it, as you want the bone to stay in for serving. Take off the heat, cool and then leave for 12 hours in the fridge to rest.</p>
<p class="method">The next day, turn the oven on to low, and put a serving dish in to warm. Scoop the fat off from the surface of the stew, return the pan to the hob and gently heat through.</p>
<p class="method">Carefully lift out the oxtail, arrange in the warm serving dish and put into the oven while you strain the vegetables and liquid through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Bubble up gently for about 10 minutes, stirring all the time until you have a sauce that is the consistency of a thick syrupy gravy. Pour over the oxtail and serve.</p>

<h2 class="box-head" id="box14"><a id="pg_442"/>Life and Cooking with Ana Barrera</h2>
<p class="flush_left">It is thanks to our friend and buyer/expert in Ibérico hams, Germán Arroyo Duque, that I got to know his friend Ana Barrera and her lovely restaurant in Madrid. Germán has spent many years working in the world of excellence, from tobacco to the finest of <em>de bellota</em> <em>ibérico</em> hams, and the circle of people he knows in the food world have great integrity and dedication to doing things the right way. Ana’s Restaurante Barrera has long been one of his favourite, almost secret places to eat, as there is no obvious sign that directs you to the townhouse on the corner of an ordinary block in central Madrid. Inside, the dining room feels more like being in Ana’s home, with its pictures and well-read books collected over the years. Pale yellow curtains give privacy from the passers-by, and cast a soft light over the handful of tables, carefully laid with beautiful linen.</p>
<p class="indented">When first we went there Ana and her late mother, who taught her to cook, were running the kitchen together. Between them they had built up a loyal and long-standing clientele who appreciate traditional cooking, but done with a light and contemporary hand and perfectionist attention to detail.</p>
<p class="indented">Ana is originally from Ávila, north-west of Madrid, and their first restaurant, near the famous monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial, is still run by her brother Pablo, who also buys wine and distributes it to a small network of restaurants, including Ana’s.</p>
<p class="indented">In the country and in Madrid, the focus of mother and daughter was always on bringing out the ultimate flavour, colour and texture of a relatively small portfolio of excellent and carefully sourced ingredients. There is no regular menu at Restaurante Barrera; the dishes change daily and when something runs out, that is it. Ana has no interest in the cult of the celebrity cook, or even in the idea of <em>guarnición</em>, the dressing up or garnishing of a dish, but she is a stickler for just the right ingredient and has a wonderful appreciation of flavour, so that unusual marriages such as pheasant with pomegranate or strawberries (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_460">here</a>), or mango with an <em>escabeche</em> of <em>bonito</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_324">here</a>), live in the memory and feel comfortable and true, rather than experimental.</p>
<p class="indented">The kitchen of the restaurant is tiny, and Ana needs almost to be a mathematician and magician as well as a cook, in order to divide up the limited work-and-storage area and find space enough to conjure up lunch and dinner every day.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_443"/>She rarely leaves her kitchen, but finally I managed to convince her to come to London for a few days to see Brindisa and cook some dishes for this book at our home, along with our top chefs, Josep and Leo. We scurried from fruit and vegetable market to fish market, searching for the ripest tomatoes, fruits, wild mushrooms, and the best fish, and once we got cooking it was both a joy and challenge to keep up with her, as she would have four recipes on the go, with the three of us peering over her shoulder asking questions at every stage and scribbling notes. Of course, she has never written down a recipe: everything is in her head, and, as she insists, nothing can ever be set in stone, because you are working with ingredients which vary every time you shop and cook with them, so you must always adjust, taste, smell, and work <em>al ojo</em>: to the eye.</p>
<p class="center_head">ROAST BABY GOAT</p>
<p class="flush_left">One of the specialities I order almost every time I go to Ana’s restaurant is <em>cabrito asado</em>, baby goat. It is a simple, wonderful dish that is rarely off the menu. Ana feels that goat meat is much more interesting than beef for roasting. It is full of flavour, healthily low in fat and, since relatively few goats are reared industrially – instead they are brought up on the kind of barren shrubby land that characterises certain parts of Spain, the meat is very natural. She likes to roast quite big pieces of young goat – leg/shoulder or a rack – just coated in olive oil and sea salt, perhaps with some halved garlic cloves tucked into slashes in the skin, and some thyme leaves sprinkled over, until the skin is toffee-coloured and caramelised and the meat very tender and juicy.</p>
<p class="indented">She starts off with a really hot oven, 220°C/gas 7, then puts the meat in a roasting tin with some water – just enough to come halfway up the pieces of meat, and puts it into the oven. Once the water boils, she turns down the heat to 180°C/gas 4, pours a glass of wine over the meat, and then allows it to cook for 2–3 hours. While it roasts, she turns the pieces as they begin to brown, adding more water and wine if necessary. Then before serving she turns up the temperature again, to finish the bronzing of the meat, by which time the juices should have thickened into a sauce.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec179"><a id="pg_444"/>Estofat de buey amb xocolata</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan beef stew with chocolate</p>
<p class="method">This is a favourite recipe from Colman Andrews’s book <em>Catalan Cuisine</em>, which was published by Grub Street back in 1997 and has kept our family nourished and centrally heated through many a winter. What is really satisfying is that when you look into the pan towards the end of cooking time, you think, ‘Mmm, a bit grey and plain looking,’ and then you put in the chocolate and cinnamon, and in front of your eyes it turns into a rich, dark, velvety and aromatic sauce. Sometimes I cook the stew without the potatoes, but serve boiled ones on the side; at other times I serve it with rice, or root vegetables. Colman suggests you can substitute the <em>botifarra</em> with three good English sausages if necessary.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">60g thick bacon, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">750g braising steak, cut into chunks about 4cm</p>

<p class="ingredients">500g new potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 <strong><em>botifarra</em></strong> sausage, cut into 1cm slices (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Sauté the bacon in its own fat in a heavy-based casserole over a low heat until golden brown but still juicy. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put the beef into the pan of bacon fat and lightly brown on all sides, then return the bacon pieces to the casserole.</p>
<p class="method">Pour in the <em>vi ranci</em> or sherry and bubble up, stirring and scraping all the bits from the base of the casserole. Add the onions, garlic, <em>farcellet</em> and parsley and stir in the flour. Then pour in 500ml of water and season.</p>
<p class="method">Bring to a simmer, then cover the casserole and cook gently for around 2½ hours, stirring occasionally. Add the chocolate, cinnamon and potatoes and continue simmering for another 30 minutes or so, until the potatoes are tender, adding more water if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Just towards the end of the cooking time, heat the oil in a frying pan and sauté the slices of <em>botifarra</em> until golden. Lift the bouquet garni from the stew and serve, garnished with the fried <em>botifarra</em> slices on top.</p>

<p class="method">While the sauce is simmering, make the meatballs. Have the flour ready in a shallow bowl. Form the meat mixture into about 20 balls (each should be about 40g, smaller than a golf ball) and pass each one through the flour.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a large pan, making sure it comes no higher than a third of the way up. If you have a thermometer it should be 180°C, otherwise drop in a few breadcrumbs, and if they sizzle gently the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p class="method">Put in the meatballs (in batches if necessary) and fry for 2–3 minutes, until golden on all sides. Lift out and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">Add the meatballs to the pan of sauce. Simmer for 6 more minutes, then add the olives and cook for 3 more minutes. Take off the heat and leave to rest for 15 minutes, then add the chopped chive leaf and serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec181"><a id="pg_446"/>Cocido</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">The big stew</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is central heating in a pot, the big winter dish that you see in various guises all around Spain, definitely not recommended for late in the evening, as at its richest it is a very hearty litany of ingredients: meat, meatballs and sausages, chickpeas and cabbage.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Cocido</em> is similar to the French <em>pot au feu</em> and the Italian <em>bollito misto</em>, in that the rich cooking liquor is often served as a soup (<em>sopa de cocido</em>), with the meats and vegetables eaten separately. In general the soup comes first; however, in the Maragato area of León they prefer to start with the meat, and in Galicia there tends to be a split between those who like the soup first and those who prefer it last. Here, the <em>cocido gallego</em> usually contains beef, chicken, salted pork ribs, <em>chorizo</em>, chunks of local <em>lacón gallego</em> (short-cured ham shoulder), white <em>faba</em> beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_380">here</a>), cabbage or <em>grelos</em> (turnip tops) and potatoes.</p>
<p class="indented">If the soup is eaten first, it normally has some pieces of pasta cooked in it, then the meat, vegetables and beans will follow. If the meat comes first it is usually eaten on its own and then the vegetables and beans are added to the soup, which is known as the <em>caldo de cocido</em>, ‘the broth that follows the stew’. In some cases – though not at a Catalan table – homemade tomato sauce will be on the table to add to the meat or vegetable course.</p>
<p class="indented">Often the meal is split over different days. The big tradition that my Galician colleagues at Brindisa remember was that the mother or grandmother of the family would have a massive pot of <em>cocido</em> cooking while the family went to church. When they returned, the meat and potatoes would be taken out and eaten and the <em>caldo de cocido</em> would be boiled up again in the early part of the week and served with other foods and wedges of <em>pan de millo</em> (heavy cornbread).</p>
<p class="indented">While almost every region has its own variation, the roots of the <em>cocido</em> appear to be in the Jewish community of Murcia in the nineteenth century. Originally it was a simple dish of chickpeas and cabbage, with the extravagant mix of meats being added later when these became more generally affordable. Given the Jewish origins of the <em>cocido</em>, the meat was likely to have been chicken, goat and game, rather than the pork, <em>panceta</em>, <em>chorizo</em> and <em>morcilla</em> that most modern-day <em>cocidos</em> contain.</p>
<p class="indented">The most famous <em>cocidos</em> are the <em>escudella</em>, typical of Catalunya (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_447">here</a>), and the <em>cocido madrileño</em> of Madrid and the two Castilla regions surrounding the city. <em>Chorizo</em> is one of the distinguishing features of the Madrid recipe, and the cabbage is usually taken out of the pot at the end and sautéd in <em>pimentón</em> and olive oil.</p>
<p class="indented">One of Madrid’s smartest restaurants, Lhardy, which first opened in 1839, is famous for its <em>cocido madrileño</em> and its <em>cocido</em> soup stock, which is sold every day in their shop from a vast ornate silver urn, and in times gone by many of the city’s restaurants would have had three different <em>cocido</em> sittings at different prices: 12.30 p.m. for the labourers, 1.30 p.m. for the office workers and 2.30 p.m. for artists and politicians.</p>
<p class="indented">One of the most memorable versions I have eaten was with a table of friends in Madrid at the home of Raul Domingo and Carmen Dalmau on an exceptionally cold but crisp, bright sunny day just before Christmas.</p>
<p class="indented">Though Raul is the main, highly accomplished cook in the household, who rules the shopping and quality of ingredients, <em>cocido</em> is Carmen’s speciality, and the meal was quite splendid. Interestingly, instead of meatballs, she included dumplings made only with parsley, breadcrumbs and egg, and she used a bean net to hold the chickpeas as they cooked, which also allowed her to scoop them out easily to serve separately from the pieces of meat and vegetables.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec182"><a id="pg_447"/>Escudella i carn d’olla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan stock and meat pot</p>
<p class="flush_left">Like all the <em>cocidos</em> across Spain, the <em>escudella</em> of Catalunya is a strong, sustaining dish whose roots are in providing energy for families who earned their living working the land. It is not particularly colourful, since the meats, chickpeas, vegetables and stocks turn dull-ish after long cooking; however, the hearty aromas and flavours make for happy folk around the table. <em>Escudella barrejada</em> (which means ‘all mixed up’) is a quite rustic version, made with whatever vegetables, bones and pieces of meat are to hand. However, it is the much more elaborate <em>escudella i carn d’olla</em> that is more widely known, as this is the big Christmas dish in many Catalan families, carefully prepared in stages and featuring either one big celebratory meatball <em>(pilota</em>) in among the other meats, which is divided up between everyone, or lots of smaller ones. And in a similar way to the big turkey dinner in the UK, it is calculated to last for a few more meals, with the leftovers being used for <em>canelones</em> (cannelloni) and <em>croquetas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_241">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Home cooks put different interpretations on the dish; some prefer to have everything in one pot, while keeping the chickpeas coralled in a bean net; others will cook the vegetables separately. Some will brown the meat first, others won’t. Whatever the preference, the basic principle holds good of starting off with the ingredients that need the longest cooking and then working through the list to the most delicate.</p>
<p class="indented">I had a splendid version at Casa Riera Ordeix, makers of superb cured sausages, when I visited with Rudi von Vollmar, one of my longest-standing colleagues. Rudi is a charismatic, hugely entertaining character who has befriended chefs around Britain and enticed them to buy all sorts of ingredients over the years, so he is always on the lookout for new ideas and eating experiences to introduce to them. After our visit we were invited to stay for supper. The <em>escudella</em> followed small plates of the sausages, tortilla and <em>pà amb tomaquet</em> (Catalan tomato bread) and was rounded off with <em>mató</em> and homemade plum jam for a pudding. Not a meal for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em>escudella</em> I have included here, however, is based on the family recipe given to me by a colleague at Brindisa, Arantxa Monsalve, which she looks forward to enjoying every year when she goes home for Christmas. With two of our head chefs, Leo and Fran, we adapted and reduced down the quantities of the big Monsalve household meal (which requires a fabulous selection of beef bones – a salt beef bone, two beef knee bones and a large shin bone) to a more easily manageable dish for four.</p>
<p class="indented">We excluded the traditional potatoes, so that it is not too filling, and made small meatballs which can be served more delicately in the soup, along with the pasta shells – but there is no reason not to include whole small potatoes, or even chunks of parsnip or celeriac, if you like (add them with the carrots and celery).</p>
<p class="indented">Although the list of ingredients looks long, it isn’t a complicated dish. It just needs some time and planning, but no more so than the traditional British roast, and I think it makes a great alternative winter Sunday lunch.</p>
<p class="indented">A bean net is handy for containing the chickpeas as they cook, as then you can easily retrieve them to serve separately. If you don’t have one, you can lift them out with a slotted spoon and simply serve the vegetables and chickpeas mixed up together.</p>
<p class="makes"><a id="pg_448"/>Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g <strong><em>pedrosillano</em></strong> chickpeas</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of bicarbonate of soda</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 beef marrow bone</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 chicken thighs</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 whole carrot</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small stick of celery</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 leek, white part only</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 whole head of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g whole rump steak (leave whole and slice once you serve)</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g large <strong><em>galets</em></strong> (pasta shells)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a Savoy cabbage, cut into thin strips (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">45g <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, kept in a chunk</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 fresh <strong><em>botifarra</em></strong> sausages (or good pork sausages)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 poached black <strong><em>botifarra</em></strong> sausages (or <strong><em>boudin noir</em></strong>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 poached white <strong><em>botifarra</em></strong> sausages (or <strong><em>boudin blanc</em></strong>)</p>
<p class="ingredients"><strong><em>For the mini pilotas</em></strong> (meatballs)</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 slices of white bread, crusts cut off and soaked in a little milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredients">375g beef mince</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g pork mince</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little plain flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="method">Soak the chickpeas overnight in cold water with a pinch of bicarbonate of soda.</p>
<p class="method">Fill a large stockpot with 3 litres of cold water and put in the beef bone and chicken thighs. Bring to the boil, then pour away half of the water and replace it with fresh cold water. Bring to the boil and repeat this process twice over – this eliminates the usual impurities that rise to the surface in the form of foam, and means that you don’t need to keep skimming this off during cooking.</p>
<p class="method">When you bring the water to the boil for the fourth time, drain the chickpeas and add them to the pot (if you have a bean net, put them inside this first, so that you can easily scoop them out later). Put in the carrot, celery, leek, garlic and the whole steak and simmer gently for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="method">Put the oven on to low and put in a big shallow dish to warm.</p>
<p class="method">Make the meatballs. Squeeze out the excess milk from the bread, put into a bowl with the rest of the ingredients – apart from the flour – and a large pinch of salt and work into a paste with your hands.</p>
<p class="method">To check the seasoning, fry a little of the mixture in a pan until the meat is cooked, then taste and adjust if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Put the flour into a shallow bowl. Form the mixture into 16 small meatballs – they will each be about the size of a cherry tomato – then roll in a little flour, shake off the excess and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Strain off about a litre of stock from your pot into a smaller pan, put in the pasta shells and cook until <em>al dente</em> (about 15 minutes depending on the size of the shells and the particular pasta), adding the meatballs and the cabbage strips, if using, for the last 2 minutes of cooking.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, add the <em>panceta</em> and <em>botifarras</em> to the main pot and cook for 10 minutes, then lift out the <em>botifarras</em> and the rest of the meats, chickpeas and vegetables from the main pot, and arrange them on the warmed serving dish<em>,</em> keeping the meat separate from the vegetables. If you have used a bean net, mound the chickpeas separately, too.</p>
<p class="method">Add the remaining stock to the pot containing the meatballs and pasta and ladle into bowls, for people to eat first, then follow with the dish of meat and vegetables.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec183"><a id="pg_449"/>Cocido montañés</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Mountain meat and chickpea stew</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a slightly simpler <em>cocido</em> recipe from Ismael Playan Paul, who was the chef in charge of our Soho kitchen for many years and has since returned to his home in the amazing Aragonese mountain town of Benasque, where this dish will have originated. It should be eaten with hunks of bread to soak up the juices.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6</p>
<p class="ingredients">350g dried chickpeas, preferably <strong><em>pedrosillano</em></strong> or <strong><em>castellano</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g fresh belly pork or <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, cut into chunky slices, at least 1cm thick</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g hot cooking <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong>, chopped into chunky slices</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g semi-cured <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong>, such as Asturian or Ibérico, chopped into chunky slices</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a head of garlic, peeled and cut in half horizontally</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium white onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a green pepper, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a red pepper, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 medium tomatoes, grated (you need about 250g of grated tomato)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little sugar and/or sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre good chicken stock</p>
<p class="ingredients">250ml ham stock (if you don’t have this, just use more chicken stock)</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ a Savoy cabbage, kept in one piece</p>
<p class="method">Soak the chickpeas in cold water overnight.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a heavy-based deep casserole, add the belly pork or <em>panceta</em> and fry until golden brown, then lift out, keep on one side and discard the excess fat.</p>
<p class="method">Put another tablespoon of oil into the pan and fry the pieces of <em>chorizo</em> and <em>morcilla</em> until they brown a little. Then again lift out, put them to one side with the belly pork or <em>panceta</em> and discard the excess fat from the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the casserole, put in the garlic and fry gently until it begins to brown, then lift out and keep to one side. Add the onions and cook very slowly for at least 30 minutes, but ideally an hour, until completely caramelised. Now add the peppers, return the garlic to the casserole and cook slowly for about 20 minutes. Add the grated tomatoes and continue to cook slowly until the liquid has come out of the tomatoes and has reduced down. Taste and, depending on the flavour and ripeness of the tomatoes, you may need to add a little sugar and/or salt.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the two stocks (if using both) together in another pan. Once boiling, put in the chunk of cabbage and cook for around 5 minutes, taking care not to overcook it. Lift out and keep to one side, leaving the stock in the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Add the chickpeas and all the reserved meats to the casserole and cook gently, stirring for about 5 minutes to meld the flavours. Add enough of the hot stock to cover, keeping some back, so that you can top up the level if and when needed.</p>
<p class="method">Simmer gently for about 1½ hours, adding stock as necessary, according to how much of it the chickpeas absorb. For the last 15 minutes of cooking time, slice and add the cabbage – if you leave the pieces on top of the casserole rather than mixing them in, they will steam and reheat, taking on the aromas of the stew, but keep their fresh colour.</p>
<p class="method">Serve with hunks of good bread.</p>

<p class="quote">‘so many different shapes and styles’</p>
<p class="flush_left">In Spain, the generic name for sausages is <em>embutidos</em>. The verb <em>embutir</em> means to stuff or pack into a tube, and <em>embutidos</em> can refer to sausages of many different shapes and styles. They might be freshly made in a butcher’s shop, or <em>oreado,</em> which means they have been allowed to dry for a few days before being sold. Sometimes they will be pre-cooked, usually poached, especially in northern Spain where the damper climate isn’t conducive to curing meat.</p>
<p class="indented">Trekkers on the pilgrims’ route through Galicia to Santiago de Compostela may come across <em>botillo,</em> as they pass through El Bierzo. The <em>botillo</em> is a large, round sausage weighing about 1kg, made from cuts of pork including ribs and sometimes tongue which are chopped, salted, seasoned with <em>pimentón</em> (paprika) and garlic, stuffed into a pig’s stomach, then smoked over oak and hung up to cure for two days. After this the <em>botillo</em> is boiled for about two hours with potatoes, cabbage, or local pulses, and <em>chorizo</em> added for the last half-hour of cooking, to make an incredibly hearty one-pot meal. It is one of the most overwhelmingly meaty dishes you are likely to eat, designed to keep you going in bitter, biting winter winds in the foothills of the Picos mountains.</p>
<p class="flush_left1" id="p450a"><strong>Botifarra negra y blanca</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">In Catalunya and along the coast southwards you will find these poached sausages, which are similar to the French <em>boudin noir</em> or <em>blanc</em>, made with pork and pork fat, with the addition of blood in the case of the <em>botifarra negra</em>, which can be used in place of <em>morcilla</em>. <em>Botifarra de perol</em> is a heavily spiced version made with various pieces of the pig that are left over after butchering, and there are others made with egg white (<em>clara d’ou</em>), foie gras, rice or truffles, and a very sweet one from the Empordà made with honey to a medieval recipe.</p>
<p class="indented">Another of the <em>botifarra-</em>style cooked sausages that dominate the cold climate regions of northern Spain, especially Catalunya, is <em>bull</em><em>.</em> In food shops across the Catalan Pyrenees, you will see these not-so-beautiful round stomachs stuffed with minced pork and tongue, hanging from the ceiling. They can be <em>blanca</em> (white), or <em>negra</em>, made with pig’s blood, and there are many other variations, such as <em>bull amb rovellons</em>, with wild mushrooms. Cooked or poached <em>botifarra</em> and <em>bull c</em>an be eaten as they are, pan-fried, or added to the end of a dish to warm through. The most popular is the fresh style <em>botifarra fresca</em>, which can be fried or grilled – there is a long, fat one typical of Catalunya which is coiled around itself and will fill a large frying pan: a favourite served with white <em>mongeta</em> beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p381a">here</a>).</p>

<p class="flush_left"><a id="pg_453"/>So much of Spain’s mountainous land is still uncultivated, and hunting is a treasured part of local life, providing much-loved, excellent quality food. Not only that, but in these days when it is less of a necessity and more of a pastime, there is a good income to be made from hunting reserves (<em>cotos de caza)</em> catering for affluent city folk. On the islands, too, hunting is a big deal. The emblems of the Canary Islands are the palm tree and the local hunting dog: <em>perro canario de presa,</em> which is the pride of the countryside.</p>
<p class="indented">I remember going to a rustic restaurant up in the hills in Gran Canaria and seeing five of these dogs caged on a trailer which had been parked outside by their hunter owner, while he had lunch. Afterwards they would be let loose in the hills to bring home shot birds and hunt rabbits and they were clearly raring for action – fearsome-looking creatures, tall and skinny, with massive heads and jaws, and a very strong smell about them. After our lunch, we went into the town of Las Palmas and behind the cathedral there were a number of impressive stone sculptures of these historic dogs, looking down regally on the passers-by. It felt a little spooky looking at them, having just been so close to the live, smelly, ferocious animals in the mountains.</p>
<p class="indented">The hunting season all over Spain is, of course, the autumn and wintertime, from October to January, while the spring, when no hunting is permitted, is the breeding season for small birds, such as pheasant, partridge, quail, pigeon – even doves.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec184">Game birds</p>
<p class="recipe-headg">Faisán</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Pheasant</p>
<p class="method">Since it is one of the larger birds, pheasant is often cooked for celebratory meals, particularly in a casserole for Christmas. At the home of our Madrid friends Raul and Carmen (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_225">here</a>), the traditional job for their son and daughter is to sit at the kitchen table peeling around 2 kilos of the last grapes that have been left on the vine, and sweetened to a Moscato-like flavour, for the festive dish – it is the equivalent of everyone peeling sprouts in the UK, but far more time-consuming and fiddly. Raul cooks a mass of onions very slowly in a casserole, browns the birds and adds them to the onions with the grape mulch, pours over some white wine, tops it up with water and puts it into the oven for about an hour. Then he carves the birds, reduces and purées the sauce, strains it to get rid of the grape pips, and pours it over the meat.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Perdiz</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Partridge</p>
<p class="method">Partridge is often raised in captivity and, although it doesn’t have quite the flavour of the wild bird, is very popular as it is a good size and has quite white meat. The female bird is tastier than the male one, and there are many recipes for it, including the one on <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_463">here</a>, in which Madrid cook Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) uses the sweet flavours of blended onion and carrot with red wine to marinate the birds, which she ultimately serves with soft berries. Chocolate is another great partner to the partridge, as are apples and mushrooms.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head"><a id="pg_454"/>Codorniz</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Quail</p>
<p class="method">This used to be a very common bird around cereal fields and hillsides, feeding mainly on seeds, grains, grass and insects. However, modern methods of farming have changed the use of land and reduced the population, so now some are bred in captivity. As with all game birds, these never quite compare to the taste of the wild ones. Usually you would need two birds per person, as they are very small.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Paloma torcaz</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Wood pigeon</p>
<p class="method">These are greedy birds, and when they are not perched high up in the woodland trees watching the world go by they are constantly eating, so the older the bird the more pungent the meat. There are no special recipes for wood pigeon – they are usually simply plucked, cleaned, cut into four and casseroled with the likes of garlic, chopped carrots, peppercorns, parsley and white wine. Often they will be slowly cooked for around three hours in the oven, then kept in the fridge overnight and cooked again the next day for a further four hours or so until the meat becomes very tender.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Becada</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Woodcock</p>
<p class="method">Very well known around the province of Burgos, woodcock is best hunted in October when it is young and tender and its taste is reminiscent of the autumn forest. It is usually hung for three days and can then be roasted in butter (or wrapped in bacon), or stewed with vegetables and a shot of brandy. If you have an older bird it can be excellent for pâtés and terrines.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec185">Larger game</p>
<p class="recipe-headg">Corzo</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Deer</p>
<p class="method">This is an animal native to Asturias that is about the size of a goat. It eats grasses, wild fruit, mushrooms and leaves, and the venison meat of the young animal is tender, but gets tougher the older the animal gets. Typical dishes include baked fillets with chestnuts, roast leg with hazelnuts and prunes and stewed foreleg with wild mushrooms or chocolate. The legs can also be cured to make <em>cecina</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg177a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Liebre</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Hare</p>
<p class="method">Hare has long been one of the most appreciated foods in Spanish cooking – though it is less popular nowadays when most people don’t have to rely on game for subsistence. Despite its meat being dark, hare is a herbivore and will have eaten lots of wild herbs, such as thyme and lavender, which makes it quite exquisite-tasting – especially when the hares are young (around six months old) and very tender. Older hares of a year or more need marinating, coating with lard and stewing to tenderise them. Ingredients that reflect the hare’s wild habitat bring out its flavours the best, so it is good paired with mushrooms, thyme, bay, walnuts and mint, together with earthy ingredients like lentils, and always, a good slug of wine. See hare with lentils on <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_464">here</a>.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head"><a id="pg_455"/>Jabalí</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Wild boar</p>
<p class="method">The great trophy for any hunter, the ancestor of the pigs we have domesticated, this animal eats everything it finds and loves acorns, potatoes, beetroot and cereals. Its meat is dark and very lean and is usually eaten when the animal is between six months and about a year, and the loins and legs are the most valued pieces: they can be stewed, roasted with apple compote, stuffed with prunes and walnuts and even cured for <em>chorizo</em>. The younger the animal the milder and more tender the meat; however, <em>jabalí</em> is nearly always best in a long, slowly cooked stew, as you cannot be certain of the age or the size of the animals shot in the wild.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Isard</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Mountain goat antelope, or Chamois</p>
<p class="method">This is the Catalan word (similar to the French <em>izard</em>). In Castilian this goat-antelope is known as <em>rebeco.</em> It lives in the Pyrenees, Cantabria and in the Apennines and was almost hunted to extinction for its meat and leather. However, in the Pyrenees they now have a population of around 25,000 animals and in the Catalan mountains I enjoyed <em>izard</em> roasted – full of flavour and extremely lean – as part of a fabulous New Year’s Eve dinner.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec186"><a id="pg_456"/>Gazpachos manchegos Casta Diva</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Game and chicken stew Casta Diva style</p>
<p class="method">There are many versions of this classic dish, which is traditional in inland Valencia, Alicante and particularly southern Castilla, around La Mancha. The first time I came across it, it was a complete revelation because even in Spain most people associate the word <em>gazpacho</em> with cold summer soup, whereas <em>gazpachos</em> in the plural refers to unleavened <em>tortas</em> (thin flour and water biscuits or breads), also known as <em>tortas cenceñas or ácimas)</em> which are traditionally added to, and also accompany, this homely, hearty winter small-game stew. Presumably, the link between the two dishes is the idea of adding the <em>torta</em> in the case of the stew, or bread, in the case of <em>gazpacho</em> soups, to soak up and bulk out the other ingredients.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Gazpachos</em> is originally a shepherd’s dish, made with any small game (wild rabbits, hare, partridges) that could be shot and cooked in water with lots of garlic and herbs in a ceramic pot or a special pan with a long handle and legs that would sit over a campfire in the countryside or hills. The flour and water <em>tortas</em> would be made and baked in the ashes – some would be broken up and added to the pot to bulk out the stew like pieces of pasta which become enriched with the stock, and one big one would be kept to use as a communal plate. Usually there would be more <em>tortas</em> made than were needed, so there would always be some left over to add to the next stew.</p>
<p class="indented">When the meat was cooked it would be stripped from the bones, cooked further with the <em>torta</em> pieces in the stock, and then put out on the communal <em>torta</em> ‘plate’ for the shepherds to scoop up, using yet more <em>tortas</em>. Once the meat was finished, they would spread the ‘plate’ with wild honey, then break it up and share it out for pudding.</p>
<p class="indented">At our Brindisa <em>asador</em> in Piccadilly, as well as focusing on the roasted meat dishes of northern Castilla, we wanted to introduce people to this less famous small game stew from the south of the region. Our chefs make their own dough in the charcoal oven and, to echo the way the shepherds would have eaten the meal, they add small strips of <em>torta</em> to a stew of quail and rabbit and then serve it on a whole <em>torta</em>, along with a small bowl of honey for people to spread over it after the stew has been eaten. The result is a lovely contrast of sweetness and savoury gravy flavours.</p>
<p class="indented">Here, though, I am giving two slightly simpler recipes which combine game and chicken. This first is from Pilar Sapena (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>), and is the recipe that prompted me to ask for a version to be included at the Rupert Street restaurant.</p>
<p class="indented">Pilar makes her own <em>tortas</em> in her bread oven, which when added to the stew give it the luscious consistency of a lasagne, and one of our chefs, Francisco Juan Martínez Lledo, who is also from Alicante, helped us to perfect the recipe.</p>
<p class="indented">Often for this dish the meat is cooked on the bone, but Pilar likes to poach it first, then debone it before cooking in the stock.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 chicken thighs</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 legs and 2 breasts of rabbit</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 legs and 2 breasts of partridge</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="forhead">For the base</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 onions, chopped (about 1cm)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="forhead"><strong><em>For the tortas</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">600g white flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little honey, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little thyme, to garnish (optional)</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_458"/>First make the <em>tortas</em>. Put the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the centre and slowly mix in 250ml of water, kneading well until you have a homogeneous dough that has quite a dry consistency (this can take up to 20 minutes, so you can do it in a mixer with a dough hook, if you prefer). Put into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Lightly flour your work surface and break up the dough into 8 balls. Roll out each ball into a round of about 1mm thick, and of a size to fit the base of a large, heavy-based frying pan.</p>
<p class="method">Put the dry pan over a low heat. When the base is hot, put in your first <em>torta</em> and toast it, turning regularly, until there are no uncooked areas left. Lift out and lay on a rack to avoid condensation as it cools. Repeat with the rest of the <em>tortas</em>.</p>
<p class="method">Put all the meat in a casserole along with the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary and peppercorns. Add 2 litres of water, plus the salt, and bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for at least 1 hour, until the meat comes off the bone easily.</p>
<p class="method">Take the pan from the heat, lift out the meat (reserving the liquid), allow to cool, then strip the meat from the bones, trying to keep the pieces as big as possible, so they don’t break down into an indistinguishable paste during the next stage of cooking. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">To make the base, take the head of garlic, trim off the roots, peel off any loose skin and give it a good bash with the flat of a knife to crack the cloves. Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan, tipping it to create a deep pool, then put in the garlic and fry until it begins to brown.</p>
<p class="method">Add the onion, thyme and bay leaf and cook for about 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and just beginning to brown. Put in the tomatoes and a pinch of salt and simmer steadily until reduced and very aromatic.</p>
<p class="method">Add 1.4 litres of the reserved liquid from cooking the meat and bring back to a simmer, then put in the reserved meat. Resist the temptation to stir too much or the meat will break up. Taste for salt and adjust if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Break up four of the <em>tortas</em> into rough pieces (about 3cm) and add to the casserole. Leave them to soften and absorb the tasty stock for at least 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">To serve, put one remaining <em>torta</em> onto each of 4 plates and ladle the stew on top. Sprinkle with a little thyme, if you like. When the stew has been eaten and each person reaches the gravy-coated <em>torta</em> it will be quite soft, and can be torn or cut into strips and then spread with honey.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Esperanza’s game and chicken stew with <em>tortas</em> (biscuits)</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a simpler version of the stew without the <em>torta</em> base, which I worked on at home with our former chef, Esperanza Añonuevo Heys. In this recipe the bones are left in, but the meat should be very tender at the end of cooking and will fall away from them.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">180g Spanish <strong><em>torta</em></strong> biscuits, matzos or water biscuits, broken up</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a rabbit, cut into 8 small pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a chicken, cut into 6 pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 partridge, cut into 6 pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1–2 <strong><em>guindilla</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>), deseeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 bay leaves</p>

<p class="ingredients">leaves from a sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon each of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a wide, deep sauté pan (with a lid). If you are using matzos or water biscuits, fry them briefly, then lift out and reserve (if using traditional Spanish <em>tortas</em>, there is no need to do this, as they are drier).</p>
<p class="method">Season all the meat and put in the rabbit first. Brown it for 10 minutes, then add the chicken and brown them together for another 10 minutes. Finally, put in the partridge and continue to brown everything for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the garlic and peppers to the pan and fry briefly, then put in the chopped tomatoes and cook over a moderate heat for another 5–10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add 1.5 litres of hot water, along with the bay leaves. Break up the biscuits, add to the pan and cook for 20–25 minutes over a medium heat.</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>picada</em>, heat a little olive oil in another pan and briefly fry the livers on both sides (for about 3 minutes in all), until browned. Transfer the liver to a pestle and mortar, add the rosemary and thyme leaves, and pound together with the garlic and some salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method">Add the <em>picada</em> to the stew and cook for 15 more minutes until all the meat and <em>tortas</em> are tender and the sauce is thick, but not dry.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Slow-cooked pheasant with sweet aubergine and pomegranate</p>
<p class="flush_left">In this recipe from Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>), she uses wild birds, which are marinated over two days in apple, carrot and onion juice and half a bottle of white wine, then casseroled slowly, so they are really tender. For a farmed bird a day’s marinating should be enough.</p>
<p class="indented">Ana loves the bitter-sweet flavours that come from serving meats with fruit, and in this case she cooks aubergines in a long, slow process, with sugar, cinnamon and cloves, to serve alongside the pheasant, then scatters everything with pomegranate seeds. Or, in season, she might use cherries, or even strawberries or raspberries.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 pheasants, oven-ready and legs tied together</p>
<p class="ingredients">plain flour, for coating</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of cumin</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 onions, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 carrots, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a bottle of white wine (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g pomegranate seeds, to serve/garnish</p>
<p class="forhead">For the marinade</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 carrots, chopped, for juicing (or 200ml bought juice)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 apples, chopped, for juicing (or 200ml bought juice)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 onions, chopped (or grated, if you are using bought carrot and apple juice)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a bottle of white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic, skin on, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 leek, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">a sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 6 threads of saffron, infused in a little water</p>
<p class="forhead">For the confit aubergine</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large aubergine, roughly chopped, around 1cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove</p>
<p class="method">Season the pheasants inside and out and put them into a bowl.</p>
<p class="method">Put the carrots, apples and onions for the marinade, if using, into a juicer, or mix together the bought juices and grated onion. Add to the pheasants, along with the wine and the rest of the marinade ingredients, which should be enough <a id="pg_462"/>to completely cover the birds (if not, add a little extra apple juice or wine). Cover with a plate and leave in the fridge for 1–2 days, depending on whether the bird is truly wild, or farmed.</p>
<p class="method">When you are ready to cook, start the confit aubergine first, as this will take about 2 hours. It might seem like a long process, but it concentrates the flavour deliciously into the absorbent texture of the aubergines.</p>
<p class="method">First, just blanch the aubergine in a pan of boiling water for about a minute, making sure you keep pressing it down under the water and turning it over. Drain, and discard the water.</p>
<p class="method">Put the aubergine back into the pan with the sugar, cinnamon, clove and 250ml of water. Bring to the boil, then straight away take the pan off the heat, and leave to get cold (this will take around 30 minutes). Put back on the heat, bring to the boil, then take off and leave until cold again.</p>
<p class="method">Repeat this process about 6 times in all over a period of around 2 hours. The last time, don’t leave to get cold as the confit hardens as it cools. Ana would blend it until smooth and then strain it, but this is optional.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, take the pheasants out of the marinade. Pat them dry a little with kitchen paper, season them again, then coat in flour.</p>
<p class="method">Heat some olive oil in a pan, put in the pheasants and the garlic clove and brown the pheasants very lightly on all sides. Add the marinade liquid, together with the peppercorns, cloves, cumin and bay leaves. Add the chopped onions and carrots and the ½ bottle of wine, if using, or 375ml of water. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and cook gently, covered, for 1–1½ hours (or even a little longer), although this will depend on the size of the pheasants and whether they are male or female (females are more tender).</p>
<p class="method">Lift out the pheasants on to a warm plate, then strain the liquid through a fine sieve back into the pan and bubble up until reduced by two-thirds to make a sauce. Pour this over the pheasants. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and serve with the confit aubergine.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec189"><a id="pg_463"/>Perdiz estofada al estilo Barrera con fresas y frambuesas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Partridge with soft fruits and baby onions</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is another dish based on one that Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) serves at her Madrid restaurant. In summer she serves the dish with berries, and in winter with braised <em>lombardo (</em>red cabbage). She chops up a small red cabbage, blanches it in salted water, then drains it. Then she sautés a chopped shallot and a chopped clove of garlic in olive oil until soft, adds the blanched cabbage to the pan with some toasted pine nuts and a teaspoon of sherry vinegar, and cooks it gently for 2–3 minutes until the cabbage is deep red. At the last minute she adds freshly chopped apple and seasons everything with sea salt.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 partridge or 8 quail</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 100g butter (Ana says that the butter should be about half the weight of the onions)</p>
<p class="ingredients">18 baby onions or shallots, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little plain flour, for coating</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, peeled and crushed lightly with the back of a large knife</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml Cognac</p>

<p class="ingredients">6 strands of saffron, soaked in warm water</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 1½ teaspoons cumin seeds, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">25g good dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids)</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 32 raspberries and 32 strawberries (you want around 8 of each per person)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the marinade</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 carrots, to make 200ml of juice (or equivalent bought juice)</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 onions, chopped (or grated, if you are using bought carrot juice)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a bottle of full-bodied red wine</p>
<p class="method">If using carrots and onions for the marinade, put them into a juicer, or mix the bought carrot juice and grated onion. Put into a bowl with the partridge or quail, the red wine and enough water to cover. Cover with a plate and leave for 24 hours in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method">Melt the butter in a pan, put in the whole baby onions or shallots and cook on a very low heat for 2 hours to soften and sweeten, stirring periodically.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, remove the partridge or quail from the marinade (reserving the liquid for later) and pat them dry with kitchen paper. Season, then coat them in flour.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a pan, put in the birds and the garlic clove and brown very lightly on all sides. Remove the garlic, add the Cognac, and flame. When the flame has died down, add the marinade liquid, together with the chopped vegetables, bay leaves, thyme, saffron, cumin, cinnamon and chocolate and bring to the boil. Be sure that the liquid covers the birds and vegetables. If not, add more water.</p>
<p class="method">Turn down the heat, cover with a lid and cook gently for about an hour, depending on the size of the birds, removing the lid after half an hour to allow the sauce to thicken slightly. The meat is ready when it comes away easily from the bone.</p>
<p class="method">Lift the partridge or quail on to a warm plate, then put the pan back on the heat and bubble up just enough to reduce the liquid further to a sauce consistency. Strain and pour over the partridge or quail, scatter with raspberries and strawberries and serve with the slowly-cooked onions on the side.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec190"><a id="pg_464"/>Liebre con lentejas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Braised hare with lentils</p>
<p class="flush_left">The pairing of hare and lentils is inspired: dark, tender and aromatic meat and juices and earthy flavours – delicious. I was first given a recipe for hare with lentils by Josep Bassal, a friend from my early days living in Catalunya. Known as ‘Popon’, he is a cellist who performs worldwide, and also a great cook whose food always seems to be full of music and drama. I remember dropping by one afternoon and he was preparing a completely ‘orange’ dinner rounded off with saffron ice cream, for his wife, Isabel Ruiz de Villa, a flamenco dancer whose stage name is La Chamela, an affectionate diminutive of Isabel. Despite the lure of his recipe, though, I never quite had the courage to tackle it.</p>
<p class="indented">Then some time later on an Easter visit to our friends Ambro and Asun, a Castilian hunter, Isidro el Bartolo, shared a bowl of braised hare with me and the meat was so incredible that I realised I had to finally go and buy a hare. I decided to amalgamate Popon’s method with Isidro’s dish and the result is this recipe, which was happily devoured in seconds when I served it up to colleagues at the Brindisa warehouse, both English and Spanish.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain a dish like this is usually served on its own, but I think it is good with winter cabbage or kale.</p>
<p class="indented">When you buy your hare, ask for the liver and the blood.</p>

<p class="method"><a id="pg_465"/>Put the lentils into a pan with 850ml of cold water, a teaspoon of salt, the bay leaf, one of the sprigs of thyme, and one of the sprigs of parsley, and cook for 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender but have not broken down. Drain most of the water, leaving about 100ml, and leave the lentils in this. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">For the <em>picada</em>, heat the oil in a small pan and fry the liver. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the cloves, garlic, <em>guindilla</em> pepper, parsley with the fried liver and grated nutmeg until you have a paste. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Season the pieces of hare. Heat the oil in a casserole and put in the shallots and green pepper. Cook until soft but not brown, then add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Put in the hare and sauté for 20 minutes, until golden on all sides, then add the flour and stir.</p>
<p class="method">Add a tablespoon of warm water to the blood, strain it, then add this to the casserole. Add the white wine, Cognac, the rest of the thyme and parsley and the vinegar, and season with salt to taste. Bubble up to evaporate the alcohol, then add enough water to cover the hare, cover with a lid and cook for at least 3½ hours, until the meat is falling off the bone, topping up with a little water as necessary to keep the hare covered. Stir in the <em>picada</em> for the last 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the lentils with their remaining liquid. Bring to the boil for a few minutes, to heat them through, then turn down the heat and simmer for about 5 more minutes to allow them to soften a little and to take on the flavour of the hare juices before serving.</p>

<p class="indented">This is an ideal stock for soups such as <em>potaje de berros</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_222">here</a>) and slow-cooked beef and oxtail dishes (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_438">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">It is traditional in Spain to mix beef stock with dishes containing pork and <em>panceta</em> to make them more hearty and filling.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 1 litre</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg bones, including a calf knee bone</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 leek, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 sticks of celery, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a celeriac, peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 ripe tomato, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a bottle of red wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 190°C/gas 5.</p>
<p class="method">Put all the bones on a baking tray greased with a little of the oil and put in the oven for 20 minutes. Lift out the bones and reserve, drain off the excess fat, put in the vegetables and garlic and return to the oven for another 20 minutes, adding the tomato for the last 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Transfer the roasted bones and vegetables to a large pan and add the red wine and cinnamon. Bring to the boil to allow the alcohol to evaporate, then add around 1.5 litres of cold water (you need enough to cover the bones and vegetables). Bring back to the boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface, then turn down the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour. Take off the heat and strain through a fine sieve.</p>
