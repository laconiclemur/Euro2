<p class="nonindent">Crème catalana is a pudding that’s very similar to crème brûlée, but the custard base is not baked but thickened and set with a little cornstarch. It has a great depth and warmth of flavor from the lemon and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2/3 cup whole milk, plus an extra splash</p>
<p class="hanging">scant 1 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="hanging">zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">3 large free-range egg yolks</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for the topping</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tsp. cornstarch</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a heavy saucepan, mix the milk, cream, cinnamon, and lemon zest. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and leave for 10 minutes to cool and infuse.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks until pale, then whisk in 3/4 cup sugar. Strain the milk and whisk into the egg mixture. Dissolve the cornstarch in the extra splash of milk and then whisk into the milk-egg mixture.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the mixture into a new pan and cook over low heat, stirring briskly, until it begins to thicken to a custard and coat the back of the spoon. Pour the custard into 4 small crème catalana dishes and let cool before covering and refrigerating.</p>
<p class="extract">Before serving, sprinkle the extra sugar on top and caramelize under a hot broiler or by blasting it with a cooking blowtorch.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This Indian-inspired rice pudding is so special you’ll be licking the saucepan.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tsp. butter</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. short-grain rice, soaked in cold water for an hour, drained</p>
<p class="hanging">2–3 cardamom seeds, ground</p>
<p class="hanging">4 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. whole almonds</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup light brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups pomegranate juice</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 tsp. rosewater</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. chopped pistachios</p>
<p class="hanging">crystallized rose petals, for serving</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tbsp. pomegranate seeds, for serving</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the butter in a pan. Add the soaked rice and cook, stirring, for 2–3 minutes. Add the cardamom and milk and cook over a low heat, stirring every now and then, for 1 hour until the rice absorbs the milk. Pulse or process the almonds and sugar in a food processor until they are powdery, or even a bit pasty. Stir the almond paste into the rice and cook for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the pomegranate juice into a small pan, bring to a boil, and reduce by two-thirds until syrupy. Remove from the heat, stir in the rosewater, and let cool. To serve, transfer the rice pudding into small dessert dishes (glass dishes are lovely for this) and top with a drizzle of syrup, some pistachios, rose petals, and pomegranate seeds.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Apricots and almonds. How Spanish is that? This Spanish tart will make too many slices for tapas, but the scraps will get gobbled up in no time. Delicious with whipped cream.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the pastry</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and diced</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">2 free-range eggs</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the filling</p>
<p class="hanging">3 heaping tbsp. apricot jam</p>
<p class="hanging">8 apricots, halved and pitted</p>
<p class="hanging">10 tbsp. (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">3 large free-range eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="hanging">1 free-range egg yolk</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="hanging">zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. vanilla extract</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. slivered almonds</p>
<p class="hanging02">confectioners’ sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the pastry, put the flour, butter, salt, and sugar in a food processor. Process until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add 1 egg and pulse until the dough comes together. If it is too dry, add 1–2 teaspoons of ice-cold water. Flatten the dough into a circle, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8–inch thickness. Line an 8–inch, 1 1/2–inch-deep fluted tart pan. Prick the pastry base with a fork and chill for 20 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F. Line the pastry shell with baking parchment and fill with pie weights. Cook for about 20 minutes until the pastry is a pale golden color. Take out the pie weights, brush the inside of the pastry with a beaten egg, and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove and cool slightly.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Spread the apricot jam in an even layer over the base of the pastry shell. Lay the apricot halves over the top, cut-side down. Mix the butter and sugar. Gradually add the beaten eggs and egg yolk. Fold in the ground almonds, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Spoon the mixture over the jam and spread level. Scatter with the slivered almonds and bake for 25–30 minutes until golden and set. Serve warm or cool with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Natas, the famous Portuguese custard tarts, are one of the tastiest pastries on the planet. You can find them in bakeries and delis, but try making them yourself and wow your loved ones.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2/3 cup whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="hanging">2 large free-range egg yolks</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. light brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch salt</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. cornstarch</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 vanilla bean, seeded</p>
<p class="hanging">1 sheet (1/2 lb.) puff pastry</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a large, heavy saucepan, combine milk, cream, egg yolks, sugar, salt, and cornstarch. Mix well until all the ingredients are smoothly combined, then add the cinnamon stick and vanilla pod and seeds. Turn on the heat to low, and stir continuously with a wooden spoon. Slowly the mixture should become thicker and hold to the back of the spoon. At this point, when it resembles a thin custard, remove it from the heat, cover, and let cool completely. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F. Roll up the puff pastry into a tight roll. Slice into 3/4-inch pieces and then roll each out into a flat round. Quickly, with your thumbs, work the rounds into the cups of a nonstick regular (12–cup) muffin pan and gently press to the sides of each cup. When the pastry shells are ready, fill them two-thirds full with the custard (do not fill to the top) and dust each one with confectioners’ sugar. Place the muffin pan in the oven and bake for 20 minutes until the pastry is golden and the custard is set with a slight wobble. Let the tarts cool in the muffin pan. Serve cold as a tapas dessert and save the rest for a snack with a cup of coffee.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Churros are sausage-shaped donuts that are meant for plunging in the thick chocolate sauce served with them. They’re a tradition all day and are also eaten for breakfast.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2/3 cup water</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more for deep-frying</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup flour</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch of salt</p>
<p class="hanging">2 free-range eggs</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">2 oz. chocolate</p>
<p class="hanging02">2/3 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the water in a saucepan with 4 tablespoons oil and bring to a boil. Mix the flour with the salt and gradually add it to the boiling water. Stir well with a wooden spoon over low heat until the mixture sticks together and leaves the sides of the pan. Remove from the heat and then beat in the eggs.</p>
<p class="extract">Add enough vegetable oil to a large, heavy saucepan to come halfway up the sides, and heat it to 350°F. Spoon the churros mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star-shaped tip. Pipe 3– or 4–inch lengths of dough directly into the hot oil and cook for 3 minutes until crisp and golden. Spoon the churros onto a plate lined with paper towels and sprinkle with the granulated sugar. Repeat until all the churros mixture is used up.</p>
<p class="extract">To make the chocolate dip, gently warm the chocolate and cream together in a small saucepan. When the mixture is smooth, remove it from the heat and transfer to a small bowl. Serve with a pile of the hot churros.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Panna cotta is Italian for “cooked cream,” a simple eggless custard. This version is much lighter, with a yogurty tang. It is set with gelatin and served with piquant roast rhubarb.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 oz. (2 packages) unflavored gelatin</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup cold whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging">zest of 1 orange</p>
<p class="hanging">2 vanilla beans, split</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup light brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="hanging">1 2/3 cups Greek yogurt</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the rhubarb</p>
<p class="hanging">1 lb. fresh rhubarb</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. light brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. grenadine</p>
<p class="hanging02">2 tbsp. ginger syrup</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the gelatin in a small bowl with 6 tablespoons of the cold milk and let stand for 5 minutes. Place the bowl in a pan of almost simmering water, stirring until all the gelatin granules are dissolved. Do not let the gelatin boil.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the orange zest, vanilla beans, and sugar in a pan. Add the remaining milk and cream, then bring to a boil. Turn off the heat. Strain the gelatin mixture into the hot milk mixture, stirring until completely mixed in. Very slowly whisk this into the Greek yogurt (by pouring the thin milk mixture into the thick yogurt, you’ll keep it from becoming lumpy). Pour through a sieve, then pour into 4 molds. Cover each mold with plastic wrap, then chill for about 5 hours.</p>
<p class="extract">While the panna cotta is setting, roast the rhubarb. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Slice the rhubarb into 3/4–inch chunks and scatter in a baking pan. Sprinkle with sugar, then pour the <a id="page267"/>grenadine and ginger syrup over the rhubarb. Cover with foil and bake for 10–12 minutes or until just cooked. Let cool.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Take the panna cotta out of the refrigerator, slide a knife around the edge of each mold, and dip very briefly in hot water to loosen. Tip the panna cotta into the middle of a plate, then arrange the rhubarb pieces around it. Spoon the rhubarb sauce over the top and serve.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The best lava cake recipe you will find. Serve with pistachio ice cream for a bit of Mediterranean flair.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 oz. dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids)</p>
<p class="hanging">4 free-range eggs</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup flour</p>
<p class="hanging">2–3 tbsp. Cognac XO</p>
<p class="hanging02">pistachio ice cream, for serving</p>
<p class="nonindent">Melt the chocolate gently in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. In a separate bowl, with an electric whisk, whisk together the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy and doubled in volume. Stir the melted butter into the chocolate, then fold the chocolate into the egg mixture. Whisk in the flour and add the cognac to taste (about 3 tablespoons). Chill for several hours.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the oven to 400°F. Butter and flour 4 3–inch metal molds or ramekins.</p>
<p class="extract">Spoon the mixture into the molds (there might be a little left over) and bake for 8–10 minutes or until just firm on top. Turn out onto individual plates and serve immediately or you won’t have a sauce in the center. Serve with pistachio ice cream.</p>

<p class="nonindent">An orange and nutmeg tart with sufficient orangey wobble.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 sheet refrigerated pastry</p>
<p class="hanging">1 whole nutmeg, for grating</p>
<p class="hanging">4 large free-range eggs</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup light brown sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">finely grated zest of 1 orange</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups whipping cream</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped out</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Roll out the pastry about 1/2 inch thick, then, using a fine grater, grate a dusting of nutmeg over the pastry. Fold the dough in half, then roll out again, to 1/4–inch thickness and large enough to line an 8–inch loose-bottomed tart pan with some overhang. Press the pastry into the pan (leave the excess draped over the sides), put onto a baking sheet, and chill for 10 minutes. Line the pastry with baking parchment and fill with pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove weights and paper. Bake for another 15 minutes until golden. Remove from the oven and trim the tart’s overhanging edges with a sharp serrated knife. Leave the tart in the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Turn the oven down to 300°F. Whisk together the eggs and sugar in a large bowl. Put a few good gratings of nutmeg, the orange zest, cream, milk, and vanilla bean and seeds into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then pour the hot mixture onto the eggs, whisking continuously. Strain the mixture into a large measuring cup. Put the tart pan onto the pulled-out oven rack, then pour the custard into the tart shell. You may not need every last drop. Grate with a nice generous layer of nutmeg, then slide gently back into the oven and bake for 1 hour. When it’s ready, the tart should be set and pale golden on the top, and have just the merest tremor in the center when you jiggle the pan. Cool, then serve in slices.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Turron is the Spanish version of halva. It sticks to your teeth when you eat it but crumbles when you handle it. More like a candy than a dessert, it’s essential alongside a dark cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 cup orange blossom honey</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/2 cups finely ground almonds</p>
<p class="hanging">2 free-range egg yolks</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="hanging">zest of 1/2 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 egg white, stiffly beaten</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pour the honey into a saucepan and warm over medium-low heat to 275°F. Stir the almonds into the warm honey and remove from heat. Mix the egg yolks, cinnamon, and lemon zest into the almonds. Fold the beaten egg white into the mixture.</p>
<p class="extract">Line an 8-inch dish with parchment paper. Pour the mixture onto the parchment paper and smooth to a 1/2–inch layer. Place a sheet of parchment paper atop the mixture, then place a cutting board over the paper, and place a few items on top of the cutting board to give it some weight.</p>
<p class="extract">Allow the turron to dry for 3 days at room temperature. Cut into 1–inch squares to serve.</p>
