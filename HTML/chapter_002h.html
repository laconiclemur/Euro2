<h2 class="h2b">MOULES GRILLEES AU BASILIC</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Grilled Mussels with Basil</em></h3>
<p class="normal0"><em>If you prefer them with butter don’t deny yourself (I rarely do), but using a good olive oil makes a lovely change. The rich, aromatic cooking juices can be used later for braising potatoes or, to make more of a meal of things, you could make some extra</em> pistou <em>and mix it with the juices for a broth to serve either just before or after the mussels</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 dozen large mussels<br/>
1 bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, blanched for 30 seconds and refreshed<br/>
4 fat garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
50–80ml (2–3fl oz) olive oil, as good as the budget will allow<br/>
2 large tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped<br/>
Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) dried breadcrumbs<br/>
Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your grill to high.</p>
<p class="normala">De-beard and wash your mussels, throwing away any that are cracked or that are open and don’t close when you give them a little tap. Get a big, preferably shallow pan with a tight-fitting lid and put the mussels in. Pour over a little water, put the lid on top and make sure it fits snugly before boiling the mussels over your highest heat, just giving them the odd shake, for a few minutes. You want your mussels only just open as you will be cooking them a second time. Remove and discard any that don’t open at all, and strain the liquid to use in one of the ways I’ve suggested above.</p>
<p class="normala">Let the mussels cool until you can handle them, then prise off the top shells. Lay the bottom shells with the mussels flat on a tray that will fit under your grill.</p>
<p class="normala">Purée the basil and garlic with the olive oil in your food processor to a thick paste, then add the tomatoes, lemon zest and juice, breadcrumbs and some pepper. Smear this over the top of the mussels and grill them until they are sizzling and crispy around the edges.</p>
