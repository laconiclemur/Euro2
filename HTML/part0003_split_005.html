			<p class="rec-intro">Omelettes are an essential in the French kitchen and everyone has a favourite version. During the wild mushroom season a<span class="italic"> poelé</span> of girolles with just a hint of new season garlic and parsley makes the humble omelette into a feast fit for a prince. Then comes the truffle season and a truffle omelette is food for a king. Another of my favourites is with grated goat’s cheese, especially the Pélardon cheese from the Cévennes. It’s so dry that it is impossible to bite into, but when grated into a perfectly <span class="italic">baveuse</span> omelette it’s heavenly.</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">4 free-range eggs (or 6 if greedy)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g girolle mushrooms or any wild mushrooms, such as morels or ceps</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp finely chopped parsley</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Crack the eggs into a bowl, beat them with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Trim and wipe the mushrooms, then fry them in a little oil and add the finely chopped garlic and parsley. Season and set aside. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat a 20cm omelette pan until it’s very hot, then add a drop of oil and the butter. The butter should be golden but don’t let it burn. Pour in the eggs and leave the pan for 20 seconds or so before starting to mix them with a fork or spatula. Once the omelette has formed and is holding but still a little underdone, add the mushrooms in the centre and carefully roll the omelette over them to the edge of the pan. </p>
			<p class="body">Flip the omelette on to a warm plate and cut it in half to serve. It should have a little colour but be light and fluffy – brush with a little butter to give it a lovely shine and gloss.</p>
