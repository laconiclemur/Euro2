</h1>
<p class="pf">Summers on the farm in Floodwood started out with the peeling of “popple,” or poplar trees. Between seasons, income had to be supplemented. For Isä, the opportunity came from the forest. Finns have a lumberjack heritage, and our woods were filled with mature poplar trees, which with the help of hired men Isä cut down in the early spring.</p>
<p>When school was out, my sister Marion, brother Leonard, and I were hired to remove the outer bark from the freshly cut logs. We were paid by the log.</p>
<p>We would tramp into the woods behind the barn and pasture and settle ourselves in the thicket of hazelnut bushes where the pile of eight-foot logs waited for us. Isä and his team of men would cut the trees from farther in the woods, load them onto skids—a sort of sled—and pull loads to us using the Ferguson tractor that had metal wheels with lugs so that it could be driven through a swamp.</p>
<p>The three of us spent many sweaty weeks in June with sharpened pieces of iron, stripping off the juicy exterior skin from the logs. The iron was made from metal that had been part of an old car. It was around thirty inches long and an inch and a half wide. One end was sharpened into a knifelike edge. To peel the logs, we used that sharpened edge. We had to punch the iron into the bark of the log and slowly pull it back, exposing the shiny white wood beneath. The sap from the log would splash onto my face, as the trees were so juicy in the beginning of the summer. Isä got more money at the paper mill in Cloquet for peeled logs, so it paid him to pay us.</p>
<p>Later in the summer the logs would have dried out so much that we couldn’t peel them anymore. June is, of course, the height of the black fly and mosquito season, so we had to wear long-sleeved shirts and long-legged pants to protect ourselves. The temperature and humidity made this a sweaty job. Usually it was Marion and I who worked together as a team and we earned a nice little sum of money, maybe even as much as twenty dollars—a lot of money back then for a kid.</p>
<p>To entertain ourselves while we peeled logs, we told our own made-up stories. The stories were sometimes a continuation of soap operas that we would hear on the radio on rainy days when we didn’t have to go into the woods. <i>Stella Dallas, My Gal Sal,</i>
 and <i>As the World Turns</i>
 were our format. In the 1930s and 1940s, soap operas filled the air and featured standard characters in real-life situations. The operas were sponsored by soap manufacturers, hence the name. We also had an ongoing series that we made up ourselves called “The Mystery of the Black-Haired Woman.” We took turns making up the next episode.</p>
<p>By the end of June it was time to move on to other chores. The little wild strawberries were deliciously ripe by then, and we were paid ten cents a quart for picking them. My mother canned and froze them for our winter enjoyment. Then came the wild raspberries. We picked quarts and quarts of berries destined for canning, freezing, and jam. When there was nothing to pick, we were sent to the garden to pull weeds from the carrots, peas, beets, and all the other vegetables my mother had planted. Again, ten cents a row was the reward.</p>
<p>What did we do with all the money we earned? We bought our school clothes. (Smart thinking on my parents’ part!) I wanted a pair of open-toed canvas pumps that I had lusted for all summer and had spotted in the window display at the Co-op store. They almost had a flavor they were so beautiful. Whenever I had a chance, I’d go into town with Isä and sneak over to the clothing department and smell these lovely red shoes. Mummy didn’t think it was the best use of my dollars. I never realized until I became a parent the wisdom of my own parents.</p>
<div class="recipe">
<p class="rph" id="rcp07">
<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Wild Berry Jam</a>
</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">8 cups washed, hulled strawberries or 12 cups washed blueberries</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ cups sugar</p>
<p class="rpill">Juice of 1 lemon</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">In a large saucepan, mix the berries with sugar and lemon juice. Set aside at room temperature for 3 hours. Then, simmer berries over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon and skimming foam as it rises, until the jam is thick and berries are soft (crush berries with the back of a spoon), about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">Sterilize four 1-pint mason jars by boiling jars, lids, and rims in a pot of boiling water for at least 20 minutes. Ladle the jam into the boiling hot jars and let stand at room temperature until the lids pop and are sealed.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 4 delicious pints</p>
