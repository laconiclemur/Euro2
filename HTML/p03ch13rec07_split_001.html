</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This flan made with egg yolks originated in monasteries in the wine-producing areas of Jerez de la Frontera and Montilla-Moriles, where, in the late nineteenth century, the</span> bodegas <span class="italic">(wineries) used egg whites to clarify their wines and then gave the leftover yolks to the local convents. The name means “heavenly bacon.” It is not as sweet as those you will find in pastry shops in Andalusia, but it is still very sweet, so it should be served in small portions.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8 TO 10</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CARAMEL</span></p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FLAN</span></p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups sugar</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups water</p>
<p class="qun">4 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun1">10 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="recsum">For the caramel, put the sugar and water in a stainless-steel saucepan and heat over medium heat. When the syrup starts to bubble and color, swirl the pan to spread the caramel evenly, and then cook until it turns a deep amber, swirling the pan (watch, as it can turn too dark very quickly, which would result in a bitter taste). Immediately pour the caramel into a mold that holds at least 4½ cups (it can be metal, porcelain, or Pyrex), turning and tilting the mold to coat the bottom and sides. You have to do this quickly, because the caramel hardens very fast. Let it cool.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the flan, make a sugar syrup: put the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool until warm.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Lightly beat the eggs and yolks with a fork or whisk in a large bowl, then gradually beat in the warm sugar syrup until well blended. Pour into the caramel-coated mold.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Place the mold in a large baking pan and pour in boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the mold. Bake in a preheated 325°F oven for 1¼ to 1½ hours, until set. Take the mold out of the pan, let it cool, then chill in the refrigerator overnight, covered with plastic wrap.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Just before you are ready to serve, turn out the <span class="italic">tocino de cielo</span>: run a pointed knife all around the edges of the mold, place a serving dish on top of the mold (there will be a lot of caramel sauce, so the dish should be deep enough to collect it), and quickly turn upside down. Lift off the mold.</p>
