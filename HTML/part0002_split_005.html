			<p class="rec-intro">These little sweet, spicy mutton pies were first introduced to France by Clive of India, who ordered his servants to cook them when he stayed near the village of Pézenas in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. The pies caught on and have become a classic dish. It is essential to get the right balance of sweet, salty and spicy flavours so check the seasoning carefully. The size and shape of a cotton reel, the pies make a lovely starter for a special meal or could be served with salad as a light lunch. </p>

			<p class="for-the">Pastry</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 pinches of salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g cold unsalted butter, diced	</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">250g lamb or mutton shoulder, trimmed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g lamb kidney fat</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch each of cumin and cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">grating of nutmeg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ tsp demerara sugar</p>

			<p class="body">Make the pastry first, as it needs to rest before use. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, then work in the butter with your fingertips. Add the water and bring the pastry into a ball. Wrap it in cling film and leave it in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Check that you’ve removed all the sinew and gristle from the lamb or mutton and chop the meat with the kidney fat to make a coarse mixture. Season with the spices, sugar and salt and pepper and add the lemon zest. Quickly fry a tiny piece of the mixture and taste it to make sure that you have the right balance of flavours. </p>
			<p class="body">Roll out the pastry until it is quite thin and cut out 5 strips measuring 20 x 6cm, then cut 10 discs of 6cm across for the tops and bases. Take a pastry disc, place it on a baking tray and arrange a strip on top, shaping it round like a cotton reel. Use a little beaten egg or water to seal the edge in place. Repeat to make 4 more little pastry cases.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Carefully fill each pastry case with the meat mixture and top with a pastry disc. Use a little beaten egg or water to stick down the edges and then make a little incision on the top. Cook the pies in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes until golden and cooked through. Serve warm with a salad.</p>
