<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Twenty years ago, when I was working on a BBC television series on Mediterranean cookery, I ate a duck with pears at Remei Martinez’s Can Toni restaurant in the port of San Feliu de Guíxols in Catalonia, and I have always remembered it. It is one of the crowning dishes of Catalan cuisine. I have since found other versions, all of them rich and complex, but Remei’s is still my favorite. She said that the recipe was originally for goose, but now it is most often made with duck. Other fruits such as peaches, apples, figs, and cherries are sometimes used instead of pears. Remei used wild ducks, which have little fat, are quite tough, and need to be stewed. The ducklings that are now raised in Spain are very tender and, like the ones we buy, very fatty and best roasted.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 duck (about 5¼ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">12 whole blanched almonds</p>
<p class="qun">4 small unripe pears, such as Pomice or Conference, peeled, cut in half, and cored, or left whole</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 tomatoes, grated or peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups chicken stock (or 1¼ cups water plus 1 bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="qun">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="qun">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun1">3 to 4 tablespoons brandy or pear brandy</p>
<p class="recsum">Place the duck in a roasting pan. Rub it with salt and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and prick the skin in a few places to allow the fat to run out. Turn it breast side down, and roast in a preheated 400°F oven for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="summary">Remove the duck from the roasting pan, pour out the fat, and add ½ cup water, then return the duck to the pan, breast side up. Roast for another hour and 10 minutes, or until the skin is nicely browned and the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and the body with a pointed knife.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, for the sauce, put the almonds on a piece of foil on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 5 to 6 minutes, until lightly browned; set aside.</p>
<p class="summary">Put the pears in a saucepan with the wine and simmer, uncovered, over low heat for 15 to 30 minutes, until tender; the time will depend on the type of pears and their degree of ripeness. Watch that they do not fall apart. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="summary">Sauté the onion in the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a wide casserole, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add the tomatoes, some salt, and the sugar and cook, stirring every so often, over high heat for 8 minutes, or until the sauce is jammy. Add the stock (or water and bouillon cube), thyme, and bay leaf, pour in the wine from the pears, and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">When the duck is cooked, lift it out of the roasting pan and set aside to rest. Ladle off the fat from the cooking juices and add the juices to the sauce.</p>
<p class="summary">Make a <span class="italic">picada:</span> Grind the toasted almonds and garlic cloves into a fine paste with a mortar and pestle or in a food processor, then mix in the brandy. Stir this into the sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">Cut the duck into 4 pieces and put them in the sauce. Add the pears, heat through, and serve.</p>
