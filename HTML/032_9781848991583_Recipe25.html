<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 zucchini, cut lengthwise into long, thin strips</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch fresh edible lavender flowers or rosemary flowers</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">juice of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 purple baby artichokes or bottled artichokes in oil, drained</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 thick slices pancetta, about 1½ ounces total weight, cut into lardons</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small handful arugula leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small handful baby red chard leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ white onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 yellow cherry tomatoes, halved crosswise or quartered</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons ripe olives, pitted and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxta">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ZUCCHINI FLOWER TEMPURA BATTER</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">sunflower oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup cold sparkling or still water</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons cornstarch</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 zucchini flowers with the small zucchini attached</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Mix the zucchini with ½ teaspoon of the olive oil and half the lavender flowers, then season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to marinate in the refrigerator about 30 minutes. Whisk together the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil in a bowl until just combined, then season with a little salt and pepper. Leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, prepare the baby artichokes, if using fresh. Fill a large bowl with water and stir in the lemon juice. Remove and discard the outer leaves from the first artichoke and cut off the top. Trim and peel the stem, then cut the artichoke into quarters lengthwise. Cut out and discard the choke (the “furry” middle) and put the artichoke in the lemon water to stop it discoloring. Repeat with the other artichokes, then drain them and pat them dry.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the artichokes and cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning them over occasionally, until just tender. Transfer them to a plate and leave to one side. Add the remaining olive oil and the lardons to the skillet and fry 3 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Drain the lardons on paper towels and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Heat a ridged griddle pan over high heat until very hot. Add the zucchini slices and griddle 10 seconds on each side, or until just colored in places. Transfer them to a plate and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> To make the tempura batter, pour in enough sunflower oil to fill a deep-fat fryer or deep, wide saucepan by two-thirds. Heat the oil to 325°F, or until a cube of bread browns in 40 seconds. While the oil is heating, prepare the batter. Beat together the eggs and water in a large bowl until foamy. Sift the cornstarch and flour over the top and gently mix with a pair of chopsticks until the batter is just combined. It doesn’t matter if the batter is slightly lumpy, because it’s important not to overwhisk it. Stir in the salt, lemon juice and a handful ice cubes, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave the batter to rest in the refrigerator 5 minutes. Dip the zucchini flowers and zucchini, one at a time, into the batter, then put them straight into the hot oil. Deep-fry 2 minutes, then flip them over and fry 2 minutes longer, or until the batter is crisp, but not colored. Drain the fried flowers on paper towels and season with a pinch salt.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Top the arugula and chard with the artichokes, zucchini, onion, tomatoes and olives. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and add the lardons. Toss to combine, then put the zucchini flowers on top and serve immediately while the batter is still crisp.</p>
