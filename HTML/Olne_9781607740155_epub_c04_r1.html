  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page142"></a>The work may be organized to eliminate all but a few last-minute details: the pike dumpling mixture may be prepared a day or so ahead and the <em>quenelles</em> need only be poached and gratinéed at the last minute; the veal cutlets may be prepared, except for the actual frying, several hours ahead of time; and the artichoke purée merely reheated and buttered at the last minute. The dessert, except for the presentation, is automatically prepared in advance.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE PIKE QUENELLES A LA LYONNAISE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Pike <em>quenelles</em> are often made also from a simple pike mousseline forcemeat, and these are lighter and more elegant in spirit. The hearty, rustic Lyonnaise <em>quenelles</em> have more body and are preferred by many people. Any <em>farce</em> mixture based on pounded raw meat (usually veal) and incorporating suet is known as <em>godiveau</em>. The pike <em>godiveau</em> is a specialty of Lyons and may be accompanied by any simple cream or <em>béchamel</em> sauce or any fish sauce (<em>à l’américaine</em> or <em>velouté</em>, for example, containing a garnish of shrimp tails, mushrooms, mussels, scallops, if one likes) that will not separate through contact with heat. After having been poached, these <em>quenelles</em> should always be baked in a sauce, during which time they continue to swell.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c04-s15"><em><span class="color">Pike Dumplings à la Lyonnaise</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Quenelles de Brochet à la Lyonnaise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Panade for quenelles:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg yolks (whites will be used later)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 heaping tablespoons flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons (1½ ounces) melted butter</em><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound beef suet (dry crumbly fat from around the kidney)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound raw pike (bones and skin removed)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page143"></a><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly grated cheese</em> (<em>half Parmesan, half Gruyère</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE PANADE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Separate the yolks from the egg whites and put the latter aside. Bring the milk to a boil and leave to cool slightly. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl, add salt, freshly ground pepper, a tiny bit of freshly ground nutmeg, and the egg yolks. Begin mixing, working from the center, add the melted butter, then slowly add the milk, stirring constantly until the mixture is completely amalgamated. Whisk it over a medium flame until thick, spread the resulting paste on a plate and chill.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE QUENELLES</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Crumble the suet in your hands, discarding membranous material, and pound it in a mortar, first alone, then with the chilled <em>panade</em>, until they form a well-blended paste. Put this mixture aside. Pound the pike until it is reduced to a purée, then pound the two mixtures together, finally working the pestle in a grinding motion to ensure a total amalgamation. Add salt and pepper, if necessary, then add the egg whites in small quantities at a time, working the paste until each addition of egg white is thoroughly absorbed. Pass the mixture through a fine drum sieve, a tablespoonful at a time, using the plastic disk (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf3_r1.htm#prf3.5">this page</a>). Pack it into a bowl and put to chill in the refrigerator. It may be kept for several days in this state if desired, the surface protected by wax paper or the mixture wrapped in aluminum foil. If it is to be used immediately, pack it in a metal bowl and embed it in cracked ice for an hour before using.</p>

  <p class="indent">To poach the <em>quenelles</em>, use a large receptacle wider than it is deep (an American roasting pan is perfect for this purpose), well filled with boiling, salted water.</p>

  <p class="indent">Form the <em>quenelles</em> on a lightly floured board, using a heaping tablespoonful of mixture for each and rolling them with the palm of the hand into elongated cylinders. Lower the flame so that the water no <a id="page144"></a>longer boils and drop the <em>quenelles</em> in one by one. Leave to poach for a few minutes, covered. If the water threatens to return to a boil, turn off the flame. The <em>quenelles</em> will first sink. When they rise to the surface, they are ready. Gently lift them from the water one at a time with a perforated skimming spoon and put them to drain on a towel or absorbent paper. Arrange them fairly closely in a buttered baking dish, leaving enough space for them to swell during the gratin process. Pour in the cup of cream, distribute the 2 ounces of butter in several thin slices over the surface and sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake in a medium oven (350° F.) for 15 or 20 minutes—or until the cream is in large part absorbed and the surface colored golden.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE VEAL CUTLETS A LA TAPENADE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A <em>tapenade</em> is a Provençal spread or paste, basically a purée of black olives whose flavor is heightened by the addition of various other aromatic elements. Its marriage with the veal cutlet is not classic—the French might describe it as an “amiable fantasy.” Egg noodles tossed with butter and grated cheese are the more usual accompaniment to breaded cutlets, but the fine flavor of the artichoke in juxtaposition to that of the <em>tapenade</em> is a happy innovation and the delicate pale green in combination with the golden cutlet, the rich red tomato and the spot of intense parsley green affords a very pretty service.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c04-s16"><em><span class="color">Veal Cutlets à la Tapenade</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Escalopes de Veau à la Tapenade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 veal cutlets, cut thin but not flattened</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>marinade of lemon, dried oregano flowers, olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>Tapenade</em> (<em>recipe follows</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page145"></a><em>bread crumbs made of firmly textured, stale but not dried-out white bread, grated</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 1 pint of olive oil for frying</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>Stewed Tomatoes</em> (<em>recipe below</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Trim the cutlets, removing any fat or gristle, sprinkle them on both surfaces with lemon juice, oregano and a few drops of olive oil and leave to marinate for an hour or so, turning them from time to time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Season the cutlets on both sides and spread one side of each with the <em>tapenade</em>. Put them to chill for a while. This, although not altogether necessary, renders the <em>tapenade</em> firmer and easier to handle.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beat the eggs as for an omelet. Place each cutlet, <em>tapenade</em> side up, in the dish of beaten egg, and scoop egg over it with a spoon. Then lift each cutlet carefully to the crumbs, sprinkle crumbs generously over the surface, and pat or press gently with the palm of the hand to ensure their adhering. Remove to a chopping board or a piece of wax paper sprinkled with crumbs, and leave cutlets to dry out or “set” slightly before frying.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat the olive oil (you will need either a very large or two medium-sized frying pans) and cook the cutlets until golden on each side, turning the flame down to a low-medium, once the oil is heated. Turn them carefully without piercing the crust. Drain them on a cloth and transfer to a heated serving plate, a stewed tomato topped by a pinch of parsley on each. Serve the artichoke purée separately.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="heading_id_4"><em><span class="color">Tapenade</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Tapenade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 anchovy fillets, preferably not preserved in oil but salted (soaked in water to desalt them and sponged dry with absorbent paper)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping teaspoon capers, rinsed and well drained</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound pitted black olives (niçoises if available)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page146"></a><em>1 teaspoon cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Grind the anchovy fillets and capers together in a mortar until they form a paste, add the olives and pound until the mixture forms a wellunified, coarse purée. Pass it through a fine sieve, using a pestle, and work in the cognac and enough olive oil to form a fairly firm but easily workable paste.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c04-s17"><em><span class="color">Stewed Tomatoes</span></em></h3>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 canned whole peeled tomatoes (Italian canned “plum” tomatoes are good for this purpose) or 4 garden tomatoes if available</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 crushed garlic clove</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">When garden-ripened tomatoes are in season, use them, peeled and seeded. If canned tomatoes are used, press them gently to rid them of extra juice and seeds, retaining their form as nearly as possible. Cook the raw tomatoes, seasoned with salt and pepper, over a tiny flame with the butter and the crushed garlic clove. Do not cook for too long a period or over too high a flame or they will disintegrate. Canned tomatoes need only be heated through with the butter and garlic. The best are, of course, those which you have canned yourself, peeling and seeding them before canning, covered with their own juice, strained, and simply sterilized without any preliminary cooking process.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c04-s18"><em><span class="color">Artichoke Purée</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Purée d’Artichauts</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 large Artichoke Bottoms, precooked (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ¼ pound unsalted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page147"></a>Stew the artichoke bottoms in half the butter over a low flame, using either a stainless steel or an earthenware dish, the latter protected from the direct flame by an asbestos pad, until very tender. Pass them, along with their cooking butter, through a nylon drum sieve (a metal sieve will blacken them), leaving them first to cool somewhat if the plastic disk is to be used (with a mushroom pestle, they may be passed through immediately). Taste for seasoning and reheat the purée rapidly over a fairly high flame, stirring and beating it constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent its sticking or burning. Beat in the remaining butter, half of which has been melted and cooked until brown, and nutty in odor, the other half fresh, cut into small pieces. The nutty flavor of the brown butter enhances the artichokes’ natural flavor. The purée will be fairly thin. For those who prefer more body, a freshly baked, sieved potato may be stirred in and additional butter added.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c04-s19"><em><span class="color">Apple Mousse with Peaches</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Mousse de Pommes aux Pêches</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound apples, cored, peeled and sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of cinnamon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon extract</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Meringue:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>tiny pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup confectioners’ sugar</em><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 home-canned peaches or fresh peaches poached in sugar syrup</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup good port wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups stewed apricots, sugared to taste</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page148"></a>Cook the apples with the tablespoon of water and the cinnamon in a saucepan over a medium heat, stirring from time to time, until tender but not cooked into a complete purée. Pass them through a sieve and put them aside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Boil the milk with the vanilla bean and the sugar. Remove from heat and leave to infuse for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">For the meringue, add the pinch of salt to the 2 egg whites and beat them until stiff. Sift the confectioners’ sugar over them and mix thoroughly but without violence.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the vanilla bean and reheat the milk, regulating the heat to a bare simmer. Drop teaspoonfuls of meringue into the milk, poaching only a few at a time, for they swell and should not be crowded. After a couple of minutes, carefully turn them over in the simmering milk, leave to poach another couple of minutes, and remove them to a nylon drum sieve that has been placed over a mixing bowl to collect the milk that drains from them. Repeat the poaching process until all are done, transferring the meringues to a plate as they are drained.</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine the poaching milk with that collected from draining the meringues. Beat the egg yolks in a saucepan and slowly pour in the milk, whisking the while. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture coats the spoon. Add the gelatin, first softened in a bit of cold water and combined with 2 or 3 tablespoons of egg-milk mixture. Continue stirring the custard over heat for a few seconds to permit the gelatin to dissolve completely, but do not allow the custard to come to a boil. Mix the custard and the apple purée together and chill, keeping an eye on it, and when the mixture begins to jell, whip the cream until fairly firm, but not stiff, and fold it well into the apple mixture.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lightly oil a savarin mold (a round mold with a rounded bottom and a central tube) with sweet almond oil (or lacking that, a tasteless vegetable oil), fill it with the mixture, tap the bottom of the mold 2 or 3 times on a table top to settle the contents, and chill, either in the coldest part of the refrigerator or directly in cracked ice for at least 4 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Put the peaches to macerate in the port wine.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page149"></a>Pass the stewed apricots through a sieve, add the wine in which the peaches have macerated, and taste for sugar. A bit of lemon juice may be a useful addition.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just before serving, dip the mold for 2 or 3 seconds into hot water and unmold the mousse onto a large, round, chilled platter. Pour some of the apricot sauce in a circle around the mousse, distributing the meringues on top of the ribbon of sauce, fill the central cavity of the mousse with the macerated peaches, mask them with a few tablespoonfuls of sauce, and serve the rest of the sauce in a sauceboat.</p>
