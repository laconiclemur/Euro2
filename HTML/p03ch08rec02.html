<p class="summary1">Andalusians are the world’s best at frying fish and seafood. Here are some of their tips and suggestions:</p>
<p class="bl-first">• Fry one type of fish or seafood or a medley that might include small fish such as red mullet, sole, anchovies, whitebait, and baby hake with baby squid, and jumbo shrimp. Large fish can be used, cut into steaks or fillets or into chunks. If you have squid, clean it as described on page 127 and cut the bodies into rings.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Use olive oil to deep-fry—refined olive oil, called simply “olive oil,” not extra virgin oil.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Use a large tall pot so that there is no risk of the oil bubbling over.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• When you are ready to fry, heat the oil until it is hot but not smoking. There must be enough to generously cover the fish. The temperature should remain constant, so adjust the heat as necessary.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Fry fish of about the same size together, since their cooking times will be the same.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Season the fish inside and out with salt and coat completely but lightly with flour; shake off excess flour.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Small fish must be fried very quickly at high heat so that they become crisp and brown but are still moist inside. Larger fish take longer and need a lower temperature so they have time to cook inside before the skin gets burnt.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Fish steaks or fillets are best first dipped in seasoned flour and then in lightly beaten egg for extra protection—or they can be dipped in batter.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• When fish fillets are battered, they are called buñuelos (fritters). The art is to have a batter that fries crisp and dry and not at all greasy. For a good one, see below.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• When frying, turn the fish or seafood only once. Lift out and drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Serve with lemon wedges and one or more of the following sauces: alioli (page 141), mayonesa (page 140), romesco (page 143), mojo verde (page 280), mojo de perejil (page 139), salmorreta (page 138), vinagreta (page 135).</p>
