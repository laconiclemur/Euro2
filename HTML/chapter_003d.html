<h2 class="h2b" id="page77">ROUILLE</h2>
<p class="normalla0"><em>There are as many versions of</em> rouille <em>as there are for most Provençal recipes. Sometimes bread is used as a base, sometimes potato, but the only recurring ingredients are, of course, the olive oil and spice such as chilli or cayenne. You won’t find mustard in any of these traditional recipes, but this just makes the</em> rouille <em>much easier to emulsify</em>.</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">MAKES ENOUGH FOR 1 RECIPE BOUILLABAISSE</span><br/>
½ red pepper, seeded, roasted until soft (<em><a href="chapter_001c.html#page21">see here</a></em>) and puréed<br/>
1tsp tomato concentrate<br/>
2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed<br/>
3 small dried, not too spicy chillies, crumbled, or ¼ tsp cayenne pepper<br/>
1 large egg yolk<br/>
1tsp Dijon mustard<br/>
150ml (5fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
Salt</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Reduce the puréed red pepper gently over heat with the tomato concentrate, crushed garlic and crumbled chilli until it becomes like a thick paste. Let it cool, then whisk it together with the egg yolk and mustard.</p>
<p class="normala">Pour in the olive oil, drip by drip, whisking continuously. When you’ve added about half like this without it separating, you can add the oil more quickly in a steady stream until emulsified. Season to taste.</p>
<p class="normala">If the <em>rouille</em> does separate, just mix another egg yolk with a teaspoon of mustard, then, whisking continuously, add the split mixture to it very slowly until it combines.</p>
