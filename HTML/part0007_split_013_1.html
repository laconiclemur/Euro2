  <p class="chap-para">Vegetable broth or <a id="pg32" class="calibre1"></a>stock is at the base of many traditional Italian dishes – risotto, soups and stews – or it can simply be served as a soup. Ready-made stock can be very good, but nothing beats the fresh flavour of your own homemade broth, made with the freshest of vegetables. It is worth making a double quantity and freezing in batches. Being the lightest of all broths, it is popular for weaning babies or if you are feeling fragile, possibly with the addition of some tortellini or pastina (small pasta shapes). Or you can simply drink it as it is!</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, peeled</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 courgette (zucchini)</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk with leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 leek</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 potato, peeled</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, including stalks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 tsp sea salt</p>

  <p class="para">Put all the ingredients in a large saucepan, add 1.5 litres/2½ pints/1½ quarts water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer gently for 1¼ hours. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove from the heat and strain the broth through a fine sieve, pressing down well on the vegetables with the back of a spoon. Serve hot, or reheat, adding some small pasta shapes to cook in the broth if you like.</p>
