  <p class="h1">Open-Face Sandwiches (Smørbrød)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/15-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Few foods are as adaptable to one’s various moods or time of day as open-face sandwiches. They are nourishing and inviting, and quickly and easily prepared for drop-in guests. They are just as suitable for a luncheon as for a light <a id="page_16"/>supper or an evening snack. The latter is traditionally enjoyed accompanied by a hot cup of coffee, cocoa, a cake, or cookies. You can serve bite-size sandwiches as appetizers, or fruit sandwiches as a special treat, or salad sandwiches and hot scrumptious sandwiches as a whole meal. <span class="italic">Smørbrød</span>, literally translated, means buttered bread. The bread must be of firm consistency and thinly sliced. <span class="italic">Smørbrød</span> are served in Norwegian restaurants in a staggering variety and even the most experienced <span class="italic">smørbrød</span> fan, at times, must take a moment to meditate before making a choice. Daily, families leave for school or work with their lunch boxes packed with their favorite <span class="italic">smørbrød</span>, or with a surprise creation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though, like in America, regrettably, more people are finding “fast foods” becoming a part of their daily routine. When Norwegians <span class="italic">drar på tur</span>, go on picnics to the woods or mountains, or <span class="italic">drar på stranda</span>, go to the beach, a tasty variety of <span class="italic">smørbrød</span>, carefully packed, is usually included.</p>

  <p class="indent">Certain rules must be followed to insure success of this delicacy:</p>

  <p class="blist1"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>   <span class="bold">Organize. This will ensure the enjoyment of the entire project.</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>   <span class="bold">Prepare a working area large enough to accommodate all necessary ingredients that have been assembled in advance.</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>   <span class="bold">Use soft flavored or unflavored butter. Arrange the bread slices in a row on a work area and butter all bread at once, unless you are preparing a tremendous amount.</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>    <span class="bold">Spread butter across the entire surface of each slice to the very edges.</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>   <span class="bold">Keep in mind that the sandwich filling and the tidbits used for decoration should complement each other. Just as important as taste is the chosen color combination. Open-face sandwiches should tempt the eye as well as please the palate.</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>   <span class="bold">When the <span class="italic">smørbrød</span></span> <span class="bold">are completed, arrange them attractively on a large platter, making sure colors blend for maximum eye appeal. Cover immediately with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out or flavor from escaping.</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><img alt="images" src="../Images/heart.jpg"/>   <span class="bold">There are numerous varieties of bread, and choosing the right one is important. Rye and pumpernickel are widely used as they are moist yet firm in texture. Another good choice is hardtack, available in light, dark, or rye. Keep in mind that the flavor of the bread should blend with the sandwich toppings. Bread should be thinly sliced about ⅛-inch (3-mm) thickness. Whichever type of bread is chosen, light or dark, it should be firm.</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Sandwiches with Shellfish (Smørbrød med skalldyr)</span></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Lobster or crab sandwiches may be prepared in the same manner.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent5">A discriminating guest will be pleased when served lobster, crab, or shrimp sandwiches. These sandwiches are more expensive than other types but worth it! Mayonnaise can be blended with the shellfish or added decoratively from a tube after the fish has been arranged on the bread. The use of mayonnaise is optional. Just a dab of mayonnaise topped with a lemon slice or wedge will suffice.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Be generous with the filling. Use 3–4 ounces (85–115 grams) depending on the size of the bread slice. When prepared thoughtfully, these sandwiches will serve as a complete meal. Any firm bread will do, white or whole grain.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Shrimp Salad (Rekesalat)</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">White firm bread</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter</p>

  <p class="ing">3–4 oz. (85–115 g.) shrimp, small</p>

  <p class="ing">Cocktail tomato slices</p>

  <p class="ing">Dill or parsley</p>

  <p class="ing">Asst. lettuce, dark and light greens</p>

  <p class="ingl">Lemon slice and paprika</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place a crisp lettuce leaf on buttered bread. Heap the shrimp, blended with mayonnaise or not, on top of the lettuce. Mayonnaise may be added decoratively using a tube. Slit a thin lemon slice to the center, twist, and place on the sandwich. Place some fresh dill and tomato on the side. Sprinkle with paprika.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_17"/>Italian Salad (Italiensk salat)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/17-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">The origin and name of this salad is a mystery, since cabbage is a staple food and has been served continually for generations. Maybe it was a fancy name to add some excitement to dark, cold winter days. Nonetheless, it is as much a part of Norwegian food fare as sardines. It can be served on sandwiches or as a salad in a bowl.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 cups (7 ½ dl) cabbage, finely</p>

  <p class="ing">shredded and well packed</p>

  <p class="ing">1 small carrot, barely cooked</p>

  <p class="ing">and grated</p>

  <p class="ingl">Pinch of white pepper</p>

  <p class="noindent">Blend all ingredients using two forks. Arrange a lettuce leaf on buttered pumpernickel bread. Place a generous amount of Italian salad on this. Decorate with a tomato wedge, a lemon slice, or a slice of cucumber slit to the center and twisted, plus a sprig of parsley.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Makes 3 ½–4 cups</p>

Slice apples, brush with lemon juice, and arrange in overlapping rows over cottage cheese. Top with onion rings and sardines. Serve with mustard and mayonnaise if desired.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Mustard Mayonnaise:</span></span> Mix ⅔ cup (1 ½ dl) mayonnaise with 1 tsp. Dijon mustard and 1 tbsp. lemon juice.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Makes 6 sandwiches</p>

  <p class="h3">Simple Sardine Sandwich (Enkelt sardinsmørbrød)</p>

  <p class="noindent">There surely is nothing more Norwegian than sardines. By having a few cans of sardines on hand, you always have ready fare when you want a special treat or for unexpected guests. Serve on firm dark or white bread, plain or buttered bread, or with a little mayonnaise, or make up your own creations.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">Sardines in tomato sauce or oil</p>

  <p class="ing">Lemon slice</p>

  <p class="ing">Lettuce</p>

  <p class="ingl">Paprika</p>

  <p class="noindent">Butter a firm slice of bread evenly. If only large slices are available, cut bread into rectangular shapes. Place a crisp lettuce leaf on top. Add two or three sardines, and decorate with a lemon slice cut to the center and twisted. Sprinkle with paprika.</p>

  <p class="ing">Boston lettuce</p>

  <p class="ing">Pickled herring</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 gherkin, chopped</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heavily salted herring should be soaked a minimum of 12 hours. Soaking the herring in a mixture of milk and water assures a firm white flesh.

Mix mustard with sour cream and carefully blend with other ingredients. Refrigerate overnight to develop flavor.

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_19"/>Liver Paté (Leverpostei)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/19-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Egg sandwiches with a variety of accompaniments are ever popular in Norway. Try some with sliced, hard boiled eggs. Or the many combinations used with scrambled eggs such as sardines in tomato sauce, kippers, ham, gravlaks, smoked eel, and many more.</p>

  <p class="noindent5"><span class="bold">Egg and tomato:</span> Add lettuce, tomato, parsley, salt, and pepper.</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Egg and Anchovies or Herring Tidbits <span class="italic">(Gaffelbiter):</span></span> Use Scandinavian anchovies, as those from southern Europe are too salty. Add lettuce, anchovies, or herring tidbits, a sprig of parsley, salt, and pepper.</p>

Pour egg mixture into hot pan, and over low heat, allow to congeal slightly. Then stir carefully making sure the eggs do not brown. But do not stir too much—the eggs should be firm and lumpy, but not dry. Place the eggs on bread and add the crisp bacon. Tuck a lettuce leaf under the eggs in one corner. Sprinkle with more chives if desired, and add tomato wedges.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Smoked Eel (Røket</span> <span class="red">å</span><span class="red">l)</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Smoked eel is another delicacy with such a distinct, pleasing flavor that it is best to keep the sandwiches simple. Leave plain with just a touch of real mayonnaise, a lemon slice, and paprika, or add a spoonful of scrambled eggs.</p>
