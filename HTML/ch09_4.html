Add the onion, carrot, leek and garlic cloves and fry until browned, about 5 minutes. Then add the chopped tomato, brown sugar, bay leaf and thyme and give it a stir.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Add the red wine and boil for about 2 minutes, until reduced by half, and then add the beef stock. Add the trotters, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer over a medium heat for about 2 hours, adding the pan-fried quince pieces to the pan after 1 hour (you don’t want the quince to turn to mush). Serve with plenty of bread to dip into the sauce.</p>
