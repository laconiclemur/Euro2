  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page342"></a>THE WARM ASPARAGUS VINAIGRETTE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Of commercialized asparagus varieties, whether they are cultivated as green or white (generally only the green are available in America; the French tend to prefer the white), the largest and fleshiest specimens are also the tenderest and least fibrous. Wild asparagus is a world apart. Not the kind that abounds in the Midwest, the feathery branches of which so often find their way into bouquets, and which is really cultivated asparagus, degenerated into a wild state—it, too, is very good and, because of its size, perfect for use as “tips” for garnish—but the truly wild variety whose thorny, tortuous tangles of stem cover the Provençal hillsides, and at whose base, during the month of April, dark green, often deep purplish-green shoots push from the earth, some threadlike, none more than a third the size of an ordinary pencil. Their tips, broken at the tender point (1 or 2 inches down), either parboiled for a few minutes and stewed gently in butter, or cooked, raw, directly in butter, and incorporated into an omelet, are marvelous. Eggs are the perfect background for their intense, wild flavor. They exist in Florida and, no doubt, in California and other parts of America with a similar climate.</p>

  <p class="indent">Hollandaise sauce is a good accompaniment to warm or hot asparagus. Maltaise sauce (Hollandaise, finished with the juice of a blood orange), understandably a rarity, is conceived uniquely as an asparagus accompaniment. Vinaigrette (or, simply, olive oil, salt and pepper) is less an accompanying sauce than an essential seasoning that permits a total appreciation of the asparagus, unadorned.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although best hot or warm, asparagus may also be served cold, <em>à la vinaigrette</em>, but should never be rewarmed.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c25-s93"><em><span class="color">Warm Asparagus Vinaigrette</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Asperges Tièdes à la Vinaigrette</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 pounds large asparagus</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, wine vinegar, olive oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page343"></a>Cut off the tough ends of the asparagus, leaving the stalks all approximately the same length (7 to 10 inches, depending on the size of the asparagus), and peel them from the cut end to the point at which the skin becomes tender. Wash them, tie them into bundles of a dozen or so each, and slip them into a large container of salted boiling water (a large oval <em>braisière</em> or an American roasting pan are perfect—lacking a container of this sort, they may be stood on end in a high pot and half immersed in boiling water—with the latter method, the tips are steamed). Cook, covered, at a simmer, until the stems are just tender (the tips should remain absolutely intact). After 10 minutes, test stems by piercing a stalk, with the grain, with the point of a sharp paring knife—the moment it penetrates with no resistance, asparagus is done. Remove stalks carefully with a large wire skimming spoon, leave them to drain for a few minutes, remove the strings and arrange stalks in overlapping rows, so that an the tips are exposed, on a large serving platter on which a folded napkin has been placed; this permits asparagus to continue draining. There are especially designed asparagus platters fitted with perforated porcelain false bottoms that allow one to dispense with the napkin; these are attractive but today are hard to come by.</p>

  <p class="indent">Each guest prepares his own vinaigrette in his plate, first propping the far side of the plate on the arched part of a fork or spoon, and mixing salt and pepper with vinegar before adding the olive oil. Each asparagus, taken in hand, is dipped and rolled repeatedly in the sauce as it is eaten. The addition of coarse white bread, generously spread with unsalted butter, completes a simple perfection.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE CALVES’ BRAINS IN RED WINE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A somewhat richer version of this recipe consists in replacing the water by veal stock or <em>pot-au-feu</em> bouillon, thickening the <em>court-bouillon</em> by reducing it with some thick <em>velouté</em> (<em>roux</em>-thickened stock, simmered and skimmed), and, away from the flame, buttering it lightly. For the housewife who cannot always keep stocks and their derivatives on hand, the method described here is simple and the result very good.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c25-s94"><a id="page344"></a><em><span class="color">Calves’ Brains in Red Wine</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Cervelles de Veau en Matelote</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 calves’ brains (firm and moist in appearance, and as little stained with blood as possible)</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Court-bouillon:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2½ cups red wine (the same as that served at table)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ cups water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium carrots, peeled and thinly sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped stems of the ½ pound of mushrooms to be used as garnish</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ teaspoon thyme or mixed herbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a few branches and roots of parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8–10 whole peppercorns</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Garnish:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 20 <em>peeled whole, small, new white onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 5 ounces butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 slices stale white bread, crusts removed, each slice cut diagonally into 2 triangles (or any other form fancy suggests)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound small, firm, unopened mushrooms, rapidly washed and sponged dry in paper towels (stems added to court-bouillon as directed above)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch Cayenne pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>beurre manié made with 1 tablespoon flour and</em> 2 <em>tablespoons softened butter, mashed together into a paste with a fork</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>finely chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Soak the brains in cold water, carefully peel off the thin surface membranes, and put brains back to “bleach” in cold water for about 1 hour, changing the water a couple of times.</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine the red wine and the water and bring to a boil, add all the other ingredients of the <em>court-bouillon</em>, with the exception of the peppercorns, and simmer, covered, for at least 40 minutes, adding the peppercorns 10 minutes before removing it from the heat. Pass the <a id="page345"></a>liquid through a sieve, pressing the solids to extract all the juices, but without passing them through in a purée. Return liquid to a boil, add brains and poach, covered, at a bare simmer, about 25 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, cook the little onions gently in a heavy saucepan just the size to hold them, placed side by side on the bottom, salted and peppered, in about 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of butter, tossing them from time to time, for about 15 minutes, or until soft and yellowed, but not browned; cook the triangles of bread in a <em>sauteuse</em> or skillet, with about 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) of butter (starting with less and adding more as required), over a very low heat, surveying them carefully, until they are golden—but no darker—and crisp on both sides; cook the mushroom caps in about 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of butter, seasoned, tossing or stirring with a wooden spoon, over a high flame, for 2 or 3 minutes, or until the liquid they exude has evaporated and they are lightly colored.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the brains, one at a time, from their poaching liquid, with a flat wire skimming spoon, slice them, and arrange them in a preheated shallow baking dish or gratin dish; scatter the mushrooms and onions over them and keep them warm while finishing the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Over a high flame, reduce the <em>court-bouillon</em> by about half, remove from the flame, taste for salt, add a tiny pinch of Cayenne, and whisk in the <em>beurre manié</em>. Return the saucepan to the flame, whisking the while, and as soon as a boil is reached, pour the sauce into a sieve held over the brains and their garnish, pass it all through, and put the dish into the oven until the sauce begins to bubble evenly over its surface. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and arrange the croutons around the edge. They may, if one likes, be lightly stroked with a clove of garlic, and a tip of each may also be dipped first into the sauce, then into chopped parsley, for the sake of a more formal presentation. Send the cauliflower loaf to the table at the same time.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE CAULIFLOWER LOAF</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The cauliflower loaf served here with the brains in red wine is also well worth trying as an accompaniment to braised sweetbreads, with or without truffles.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page346"></a>Sauced, a cauliflower loaf may also respectably serve as a course apart. It may be enriched by the addition of such elements as chopped roast almonds, fresh peeled chopped pistachios or <em>duxelles</em>, or very pretty fantasies may be created by filling the mold with thin alternate layers of other vegetable fillings (shredded sorrel stewed in butter, or parboiled puréed spinach, one or the other beaten with an egg, grated carrot stewed in butter, etc.).</p>

  <p class="indent">Similar loaves may be prepared from other vegetables and, for those vegetables richer in starch, the <em>béchamel</em> may be omitted.</p>

  <p class="indent">The parboiled carrot slices and green bean strips are decorative and they relieve an otherwise monotonous whiteness.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c25-s95"><em><span class="color">Cauliflower Loaf</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pain de Choufleur</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a few small, tender green beans</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small carrot</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 3 tablespoons</em> (<em>1½ ounces</em>) <em>butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 good-sized cauliflower</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>stiff béchamel made with 1 mounded, but not heaping, tablespoon flour, 1 tablespooon butter, ½ cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, nutmeg</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut the string beans into approximately 2-inch lengths and split them in half. Peel the carrot either with a serrated vegetable peeler that makes ridges the length of the carrot, and slice it thinly, crosswise, or peel it smoothly, cut it into 2-inch lengths, slice these thinly lengthwise, and cut them into matchlike strips. Parboil the beans and the carrot in rapidly boiling salted water for about 5 minutes, or until they have lost their crispness and are pliable. Drain them and sponge them dry with a paper towel.</p>

  <p class="indent">Generously butter a quart mold (any form), arrange the carrot and bean fragments in a simple design, pressing them well against the buttered surface, and put the mold to chill (not essential, but the decorative elements are less likely to be displaced when the mold is filled).</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page347"></a>Break the cauliflower up into flowerets, cook it in boiling salted water until just tender, not mushy, drain it, “dry it out” for a couple of minutes in 2 tablespoons of butter, tossing and stirring, over a medium flame, and pass it through a fine sieve.</p>

  <p class="indent">Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan, add the flour, cook gently for a minute or so, stirring with a wooden spoon, and, away from the heat, slowly pour in the heated milk, stirring the while. Return to the heat, continue stirring until it has returned to a full boil, and stir it into the cauliflower purée. Beat in the eggs and the egg yolk, seasoned to taste with salt, freshly ground pepper and very little freshly grated nutmeg, pour the mixture into the mold and tap the bottom a couple of times against a wooden surface to settle the contents. Lightly press a buttered round of kitchen paper against the surface and poach in a <em>bain-marie</em>, immersed by two-thirds in hot water, in a medium oven for about ½ hour, or until the center is firm to the touch. Once removed from the <em>bain-marie</em>, leave to settle for a few minutes before unmolding.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_5">THE MOLDED APPLE PUDDING</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Served caramel-coated, as is, the pudding is delicious, but it also may be accompanied by whipped cream, <em>sabayon sauce</em> (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c03_r1.htm#page137">Charlotte with Crêpes</a>) or apricot sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c25-s96"><em><span class="color">Molded Apple Pudding</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pudding Moulé aux Pommes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Caramel:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 heaping tablespoons sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>almond oil or butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ pounds cooking apples (preferably russet)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar (to taste)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pinch cinnamon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page348"></a>For the caramel, combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring it to a boil and adjust the heat to a bubble. Don’t take your eye off it, and remove it the instant it is a rich, deep amber color (once it begins to color, it advances very rapidly and 2 seconds may mean the difference between perfect caramel and burnt sugar). Pour in about 1 tablespoon hot water, stirring until thoroughly blended, and pour the caramel immediately into the mold, turning it in all directions to coat the mold as evenly as possible. When cooled, lightly oil or butter any parts of the inner walls of the mold that have not been coated with caramel.</p>

  <p class="indent">Quarter, peel, core and slice the apples. Cook them with the water, over a high flame, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until just cooked—that is, reduced to a near-purée. Stir in the sugar and the cinnamon, pass through a sieve, and beat in the eggs. Pour the mixture into the mold (an old-fashioned jelly mold affords a pretty presentation), tap it on a wooden surface to settle the contents, and poach in a <em>bain-marie</em> in hot, but not boiling, water, in a moderate oven, for from 45 to 50 minutes. Leave to cool until tepid; then unmold and, once unmolded, leave the dessert covered by the mold and chill. Remove mold just before serving, well chilled.</p>
