<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Although Spaniards use very few spices and very little black pepper,</span> these feature prominently in national lore. The Iberian trade in spices, which began with the Phoenicians and the Romans and expanded hugely with the Arabs, stopped when the sea power of the Ottoman Turks and the North African pirates (most of them of Muslim Spanish descent) made traffic through the Mediterranean difficult. This hiatus provided the Genoese sailor Christopher Columbus with the goal of finding an alternate route to India and the Spice Islands. In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella commissioned Columbus to explore the western seas. He sailed away and discovered the Caribbean Islands and the Americas. He was followed by Spanish conquistadores, who were mainly members of the lower nobility, and by other adventurers, entrepreneurs, and missionaries, who set out to conquer and colonize the New World. Peasants and artisans, mostly from Andalusia, Extremadura, and La Mancha, were sent off with cargoes of grain and breeding stock—chickens, pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, and horses—to settle the new lands. The conquerors brought Christianity and the Castilian language to their new empire. They built churches and palaces and sent home gold and silver.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, the Spanish kingdoms, with Castile at their head, acquired dominions in Europe through royal marriage. On Ferdinand’s death in 1516, the throne of Castile and Aragon passed to his grandson Charles V, archduke of Habsburg. He became Charles I of Spain, and the Spanish realms became partners in his dynastic rights to the Netherlands, Burgundy, the Duchy of Milan, and the Kingdom of Sicily. Charles’s son Philip II inherited parts of France, the Netherlands, southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia, a bit of Greece, and some of North Africa, as well as most of South and Central America, the Philippines, Ceylon, and several islands from Sumatra to the Azores. Then Portugal, with its Far Eastern and African possessions, and Brazil were added to his empire. Spain was thus the supreme imperial power in the world, and Toledo and Madrid became its centers of administration.</p>
<p class="para">But Spain’s glorious period of supremacy was brief. From about 1540 on, the cost of running the enormous empire was crippling, and constant wars to defend it drained its coffers. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, parts of the empire had been lost, Spain was impoverished, and the country was empty of people. Hundreds of thousands had died in wars and sea battles, while thousands more had emigrated to the New World to escape poverty. Plague epidemics and the expulsion of the Moriscos further contributed to the depopulation and falling agricultural production. By the early nineteenth century, almost all of the Latin American empire had been lost.</p>

<p class="para">The discovery of the New World had an enormous influence, not just on the food of Spain. It was to revolutionize the diets of the Old and the New Worlds. The early colonists found the native inhabitants eating foods they had never seen. Among these were corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, beans, and capsicum peppers, which would become staples in the Old World, as well as Jerusalem artichokes, pumpkins, pineapples, papayas, guavas, custard apples, avocados, and peanuts. They saw the locals roasting and grinding corn and making tortillas. They tasted a chocolate drink and discovered the flavor of vanilla. They found turkeys and tobacco. On his return from his first voyage, Columbus made a triumphal show of the goods he had brought back at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella. Among the exhibits were gold and silver jewelry; a variety of animals, fruits, and vegetables; and ten “Indians.” Pietro Martire d’Anghiera, an Italian cleric at the Spanish court, wrote at the time, “Something may be said about the [chile] pepper gathered in the islands and on the continent . . . but it is not pepper, though it has the same strength and flavor, and it is just as much esteemed. . . . When it is used, there is no need of Caucasian pepper.”</p>
<p class="para">Many of the colonists became farmers and used local Indians and Africans shipped from the West African coast as slaves. They planted wheat and other cereal grains, as well as grapevines and sugarcane brought over from Spain. They also grew local plants that were unknown in Europe. Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries were among the biggest landowning farmers. Potatoes, corn, and beans, the mainstays of the native peoples, were found to be the cheapest way to feed the slaves working in mines and fields. When the missionaries began to eat the foods themselves, they wrote that potatoes tasted “like cooked chestnuts when they [were] boiled” (they were probably sweet potatoes) and that sauces were made with peppers and tomatoes. When the priests and other colonists came home, they brought seeds, beans, and tubers to grow in their own gardens. They also brought back wild turkeys they had domesticated.</p>
<p class="para">Turkey became the festive dish of the Spanish aristocracy, replacing the pigeon that had been the celebratory treat of the Muslim and Jewish communities, and turkey became associated with Christmas. The aristocracy and the clergy very quickly adopted chocolate as a drink. Beans were widely used. Spain already had black-eyed beans and fava beans, so the new varieties were easily accepted. Dried white and other types of beans including red and mottled beans became the food of the peasantry and of the urban poor; they were stewed with bits of cured pork or sausage to give them flavor. But other foods, such as potatoes and tomatoes, were slow in penetrating the Spanish diet.</p>
<p class="para">Corn was taken up in the north, where it was used as animal fodder, and the rural poor turned it into flour to make bread, fried pancakes, and a kind of polenta porridge with milk. The peasants in the north also grew potatoes for themselves, but the Church, the nobility, the judiciary, and intellectuals despised them as “poor food,” good only for hospitals, military barracks, and prisons. Records show that potatoes were bought as part of the regular budget by Seville’s Hospital de la Sangre in 1573. Potatoes were not generally adopted in other parts of Spain or by the upper classes until the beginning of the nineteenth century, after the French agronomist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier popularized them in France.</p>
<p class="para">Most Europeans at first thought tomatoes were poisonous. They were cultivated in the early sixteenth century in Seville, where the warm climate allowed them to thrive, but they did not come into general use until the eighteenth century. The first cookbook to mention them, <span class="italic">Lo Scalco alla Moderna</span> by Antonio Latini, was published in Naples in 1692, when the Italian south was part of the Spanish Empire. Less than a handful of recipes in the book contain tomatoes, and all of them are labeled “<span class="italic">alla spagnola.</span>” A “coulis” of tomatoes with finely chopped onions and chile peppers, oil, vinegar, and salt is similar to descriptions of sauces that were found in the Americas at the time and very like dressings and sauces you encounter in Spain today. One complaint today of foreign travelers and also of Spanish restaurant critics about food in Spain is that tomatoes are used in almost everything. <span class="italic">Sofrito,</span> the tomato sauce with fried onions and garlic, is not only ubiquitous in Spain where nowadays it most often includes green peppers, but has become ever present in all Mediterranean cuisines.</p>
<p class="para">Varieties of sweet bell and hot chile peppers spread quickly all over Spain. Chiles were first grown in monasteries, and the seeds were taken to all parts of Spain by traveling monks. Dried and crushed, or pulverized as <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (paprika), peppers and chiles became the favorite and ubiquitous flavorings, together with garlic. Spices and black pepper had been used all over Europe by the upper classes until they became rare when trade was interrupted. <span class="italic">Pimentón</span> eventually replaced them all in the Spaniards’ affections.</p>
<p class="para">The revolution in the Spanish diet caused by the discovery of the New World was slow, but in the end the combination of ingredients from the New and Old Worlds resulted in a rich and particularly colorful cuisine. Before peppers and tomatoes arrived, there had been nothing to eat that was red.</p>
