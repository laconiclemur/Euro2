<h2 class="h2b" id="page176">TERRINE DE CAMPAGNE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Country Pâté</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is the type of hearty, chunky terrine that you get served in most country restaurants in France. The success of a good terrine relies on plenty of fat and plenty of flavour, so don’t be faint-hearted with the seasoning. Also important is the pressing once it is cooked: this makes for a more compact terrine in which the juices are well spread throughout, and also makes it much easier to slice afterwards. Leave this one a good couple of days before serving for the flavours to mature</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6–8</span><br/>
2 large onions, peeled and sliced<br/>
3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced<br/>
2 tbsp groundnut oil<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) Cognac<br/>
300g (10½ oz) belly pork, minced<br/>
150g (5½ oz) pork back fat, minced<br/>
100g (3½ oz) chicken livers, rinsed and roughly chopped<br/>
1 small bunch fresh parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, very coarsely chopped<br/>
4 big sprigs dried thyme or savory, crumbled<br/>
40g (1½ oz) shelled pistachios<br/>
2 eggs<br/>
1 tsp salt<br/>
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper<br/>
<img alt="images" class="imagefix1" height="16px" src="images/frac16.jpg" width="16px"/> tsp ground allspice<br/>
12 thin streaky bacon rashers</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 160°C/325°F/Gas 3.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the onion and garlic for about 10 minutes in the groundnut oil with a little water until soft, then turn up the heat and cook for 5 minutes or so until golden. Add the Cognac and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="normala">Mix the belly pork together with the back fat and the chopped chicken livers, then add the parsley, thyme, pistachios, eggs, salt, pepper and allspice. When the onion, garlic and Cognac mixture has cooled, add that as well. Stir really well to combine and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Line your terrine mould with the streaky bacon, overlapping each slice a little and making sure that you leave enough over the sides of the terrine to eventually seal it. Fill this with the mixture and fold the overlapping bacon over the top. Cover with foil and place into a bain-marie of water that reaches just two-thirds up the sides of the terrine. Bake in the preheated oven for 1¼ –1½ hours until the blade of a small knife comes out of the centre warm.</p>
<p class="normala">While the terrine is cooking, cut a piece of cardboard the size of the terrine and wrap it in foil. Have ready a 500g (1lb 2oz) weight (a couple of tins will do).</p>
<p class="normala">When the terrine is cooked transfer it immediately to a bain-marie of cold water. Press down the foil that covered it during the cooking and put the foil-wrapped cardboard on top of that. Put the weights on this and press down lightly. Leave to cool with the weights on top, then refrigerate, well covered, for a couple of days before eating.</p>
