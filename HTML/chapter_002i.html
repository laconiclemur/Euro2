<h2 class="h2b">MOULES AU SAFRAN</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Mussels with Saffron</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>A big bowl of mussels – spanking fresh, steaming and smacking of the sea – is the quickest way of having a wonderful meal. Every time I get anywhere near a raw one I have a scary trip down memory lane, not to the first time I ate a great bowlful but to my early days in France when working in Burgundy. There I was stuck in the fish-preparation area for days at a time, scraping and scrubbing the shells to remove even the tiniest of barnacles. I would then soak them in salt, rinse them endlessly and pass them to the head fish guy. He would, minutes later, pass them back cooked and my then very raw fingers would remove and throw away the thousands of shells that I had earlier cleaned. At the end of one of these days (and almost my tether), I asked the chef why he bothered wasting time in this way. I received the standard response relating to the ignorance of those born outside of France, and so I had to keep on scraping until relief came (or so I thought) about a month later, in the form of the vegetable section</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2kg (4lb 8oz) mussels<br/>
150ml (5fl oz) dry white wine<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
Large pinch of saffron strands<br/>
1 small dried chilli, finely crumbled<br/>
4 large slices of bread, toasted</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">First of all debeard the mussels by pulling the hairy part towards the fat end of the shells then out. If there are any barnacles, remove them. If there are any open, give them a good tap and if they don’t close of their own accord throw them away. Rinse them well and store beneath a wet tea towel until you need them.</p>
<p class="normala">In a large shallow pan, boil the white wine together with the olive oil, garlic, saffron and chilli for a few minutes until they begin to emulsify. Add the mussels, cover the pan and cook for about 5 minutes over as high a heat as possible, stirring the mussels once or twice so that they open evenly (discard any that don’t). Serve over the top of the toasted bread.</p>
