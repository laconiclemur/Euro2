<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This simple way of serving wild mushrooms makes a sumptuous first course. The traditional wisdom is to clean off any soil with a soft vegetable brush or to wipe them gently with a damp cloth, but washing them under the cold water tap and shaking off the water does not spoil their taste, and absorbing a little water makes them less porous to oil when they are cooking. Trim off the earthy base of their stems, rinse them, and dry them with a kitchen towel; cut large ones in half or into quarters and leave small ones whole. Be ready to eat, with your toast, when you start scrambling the eggs: they should be moist and creamy.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup mild extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">14 ounces mixed wild mushrooms, such as cèpes (porcini), chanterelles, and morels</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="qun">8 large eggs, lightly beaten with a fork</p>
<p class="qun1">4 slices good country bread, lightly toasted</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, over high heat to start with, then over medium heat; season with salt and pepper and stir, turning the mushrooms until they are tender and lightly brown in parts.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick frying pan. Put in the butter, and when it is almost melted, add the eggs and sprinkle with a little salt. Let the eggs set slightly at the bottom before gently turning and stirring them with a wooden spoon or spatula so that the liquid part at the top runs underneath. Turn off the heat when there are still some runny parts—the eggs will continue to cook and will be done by the time you serve.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To serve, spoon some scrambled eggs onto each toast and cover with the sizzling mushrooms.</p>
