They contain a high proportion of carbohydrates and roughage, mineral salts, trace elements and vitamins. In addition, most kinds of vegetables have a low energy content and a high water content (75–95%).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Division</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Tubers and root vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">e.g. potatoes, celeriac, carrots, turnips, black salsify</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Leaf vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. artichokes, chicory, Swiss chard, spinach</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cabbage vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. cauliflower, broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, red cabbage, cabbage, Savoy cabbage</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Onion vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. spring onions, garlic, leek, onions</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Podded fruits</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. beans, peas, lentils, soya beans, chick peas</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Fruit vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. aubergines, beans, cucumbers, pumpkin, peppers, tomatoes</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Stick vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. fennels, rhubarb, asparagus, celery</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Mushrooms</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> e.g. mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, Shiitake mushrooms</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Buying and storage</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">• Many types of vegetables are offered all year round, so the customer can be confident of finding a good supply. Native vegetables that have a particular season are often preferable, since they will be especially full of flavour and inexpensive.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • It is best to buy crisp, fresh vegetables at markets or direct from the growers. Vegetables with wilted stems and leaves are no longer fresh.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • The storage time should be as short as possible, so that the minimum amount of nutritional value and flavour is lost.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Vegetables keep best in the crisper of the refrigerator or in a cool cellar or larder.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Frozen vegetables widen the range available throughout the year. Since vegetables are frozen as quickly as possible after being harvested, the loss of nutrients is relatively low.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • If possible, buy mushrooms loose, since if packed in plastic film they will mature too quickly. Packed mushrooms should be taken out of the packaging and stored in a paper bag in the refrigerator. Mushrooms are fresh if the stalk and cap are firmly connected together.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparation</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">A significant loss of nutrients can occur very quickly if fresh vegetables are improperly treated. They are very sensitive to the effects of air, heat, water and light. The following tips will help preserve nutrients as much as possible.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Clean vegetables at the last possible moment before using them.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Always wash vegetables before chopping them.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Rinse vegetables briefly but thoroughly under cold running water and let drain.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Chopping onions</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Peel the onion and cut in half in the direction of the root. With a knife make vertical cuts close together through the half onion with a knife, but leaving the root completely untouched; then make horizontal cuts up to the root. Finally, chop vertically to make dice. Repeat with the other half.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Preparing peppers by hollowing out with a spoon</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Cut off the top of each pepper, then remove the white walls and seeds with a spoon.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Clean mushrooms by rubing with kitchen paper </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> It is not usually necessary to rinse cultivated mushrooms. Rubbing with kitchen paper is enough.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Peeling asparagus</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Thinly peel white asparagus from head to end with a potato peeler or sharp knife, being careful to remove the peelings without injuring the heads. Cut off the asparagus ends and any woody part of the stems. Peel only the bottom third of green asparagus and trim off the end.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Peeling tomatoes </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Wash the tomatoes, leave to drain, make cross-shaped incisions in the top end, dip briefly in boiling water, then dip in cold water so the skins can be easily peeled off.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparation</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Vegetables should be cooked quickly so that as few nutrients as possible are lost in the course of preparation and the flavours are preserved. Cook vegetables so that they are still crisp to the bite. With a short cooking time, vegetables preserve their minerals and fresh colour. Cook frozen vegetables in a little liquid without defrosting them, or braise them with diced onion.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Braising</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Braising is the process of cooking vegetables in their own juices or in very little liquid. Put vegetables still wet from being rinsed into a saucepan with some seasoning, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook the vegetables over a low heat, adding a little water only if necessary. In being heated, the liquid turns to steam, which condenses on the lid and drips back onto the vegetables. In this process, the vegetables are cooked at less than 100 °C/212 °F. The taste and flavour elements are preserved and the vegetable hardly needs further seasoning.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Steaming </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To steam vegetables (cooking them over steam in a sieve), cover the bottom of the saucepan with water, put the vegetables in a matching sieve and cover with a tight-fitting lid. The vegetables cook in the steam.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Boiling</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Some kinds of vegetables must be boiled. To boil vegetables (boiling them in a lot of liquid), almost cover them in liquid. Some vegetables, such as potatoes, are brought to the boil from cold, while others such as green beans are added to boiling water.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Little glossary</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Artichokes</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Firm green flower heads with tightly packed leaves that are thick and fleshy towards the base. When the heads are cooked, the leaves are pulled off but only the fleshy part is eaten, accompanied by a sauce. Before being eaten the hairy “choke” must be cut out with a knife. There are also violet artichokes, which are eaten whole.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Asparagus</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A spring vegetable available from the beginning of March to the end of June. Underground stem with edible shoots with white, green or violet heads. Green asparagus grows above the ground and has a more intense taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Aubergines (eggplant)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Long, oval-shaped vegetables with a smooth peel, deep purple colour and little flavour of their own. The skin can be eaten.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Beans </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> There are many different types (e.g. princess beans, French or green beans and broad beans). Beans should never be eaten raw since they contain phasin. This substance can cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines but it is destroyed in the course of cooking.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Beetroot</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A root vegetable very rich in minerals and nutrients. It has powerful dyeing properties so rubber gloves should be worn when preparing it.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Black salsify</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Long, dark-brown root vegetable. A winter vegetable rich in minerals and vitamins.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Broccoli</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Green-violet heads with small florets, not quite as tight as cauliflower.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Brussels sprouts </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Thick, powerful stem covered with cabbage-like buds that are the size of walnuts. A winter vegetable very rich in vitamin C.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Carrots </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Sturdy root vegetable with a pointed end. Very rich in vitamin A, which is easily absorbed by the body when combined with a little fat (for instance, by adding butter to the carrots). There are many varieties on the market.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cauliflower </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A solid white to pale yellow head consisting of many small florets. Before cooking, place the cauliflower head downwards in saltwater for about 2 minutes in order to wash out any insects. Romanesco is a green cauliflower.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Celeriac </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Firm, full-flavoured yellowish root. When buying celeriac, make sure it does not sound hollow when you tap it because this would mean that it is woody inside.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Chestnuts </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Also called sweet or Spanish chestnuts, these are available fresh, roasted, in tins or preserved in syrup.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Chicory </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Slightly bitter vegetable that is also used as a salad. The bitter stalk should be cut out.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Chinese cabbage </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Large oblong heads of pale green colour. Tastes good as vegetable or salad.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Courgettes (zucchini)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Dark green or yellow, cucumber-like fruits with firm flesh. The smaller the courgette, the more delicate the taste. The flowers are also edible.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cucumbers </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> There are salad cucumbers and pickled cucumbers or gherkins. Cucumbers grown in the open are often bitter at the stalk end, in which case you should cut off the ends.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Fennel</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> White, fleshy leaf stalks that form a solid bulb at the base. The delicate leaves can also be used. Fennel has a slight taste of aniseed.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Jerusalem artichoke </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The beige-reddish brown roots of this tuberous plant, which is related to the sunflower and artichoke, have a sweet, nutty taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Kale</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The leaves have a frizzy edge and a strong central rib. They should really only be eaten after the first frost because the starch present in the leaves will then have been converted into sugar. In addition, the cold also makes the cabbage more digestible.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Kohlrabi </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Vegetable with a smooth, firm, bright green and blue-violet turnip-like stalk. Kohlrabi is very tender when young but is often quite woody when older. The tender leaves can also be eaten.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Leaf spinach </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Leaf vegetable rich in vitamins and mineral elements. The leaves are cut off above the root and must be washed very thoroughly.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Leeks </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Firm stem consisting of pale to dark green leaves with small roots. Leeks are rich in minerals and have a strong flavour.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Maize</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Because of its high sugar content (varying between 4% and 14%) it is also known as sweetcorn. Corn on the cob can be bought fresh but when removed from the cob, sweetcorn is usually sold canned or frozen.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Mushrooms </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Mushrooms available on the market are mainly cultivated. Mushrooms are white, pink or brown (ceps which have a more intense mushroom taste). Cut off the base of the stalk if there is any compost attached to it.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Okra </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Plant cultivated as a vegetable and mainly used fresh. The pods produce a milky mucilage during the cooking process which is also present when okra is canned.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Onions</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A large family with many varieties that vary considerably in shape, size, colour and taste. Ordinary onions are large with a relatively mild taste. Shallots are often braised whole. In the case of spring onions, the green leaves can also be used.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Parsnip</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A root vegetable with a spicy taste that can be cooked like carrots.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Peas </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> There are sugar peas, petits pois and marrowfat peas. Before preparing, the peas are removed from the pods (shelled).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Sugar peas or mangetout are flat, bright green pods containing very small peas. They are eaten whole. You can buy ready prepared and washed sugar peas but make sure that the ends are not dry. Fresh sugar peas are crisp, not soft.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Peppers </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Peppers are available in several colours (red, green, yellow and orange). They are rich in vitamin C and potassium.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Pointed cabbage </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A cone-shaped cabbage variety with a loose heart, it has a more delicate flavour than white cabbage.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Pulses</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Pulses are the vegetables that are highest in protein while also rich in vitamin B, folic acid, iron and fibre. Pulses can be stored for a very long time if kept in dry conditions in closed containers. Pulses must be washed before use and soaked before cooking, depending on the kind used.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Pumpkin</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Bright yellow to bright orange fruit with a thick skin and numerous seeds and fibres. There are several varieties that vary greatly in size.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Red cabbage </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Very firm head with smooth leaves, slightly curly at the edges. Its blue-red colouring matter turns red with the addition of acid (for instance, vinegar).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Savoy cabbage </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Green curly leaves without much heart.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Stem celery </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Greenish-white, crisp stems that grow from a tuber-like base. The delicate leaves can also be used.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Swede</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Root vegetable with white to yellowish flesh, very rich in vitamins and minerals. Young swedes are very tender.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Swiss chard</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Crisp stalks with narrow leaves with a thick central rib. Very rich in vitamins and minerals, it has a mild, nutty taste. Swiss chard can also be used instead of leaf spinach.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Tomatoes</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Firm red fruits with juicy flesh that vary in size (for instance, beef tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, etc.) and in shape (for instance, plum tomatoes) depending on the variety. When used in cooked dishes they should be peeled. There are also green and yellow tomatoes. Do not store tomatoes with cucumbers because tomatoes give off ethylene, a gas that makes cucumbers turn yellow very quickly.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Turnip leaves</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The leaves and shoots of particular varieties of white turnip. The leaves are very tender and should therefore be used when still very fresh.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">White cabbage</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A yellowish-green, firm, fullhearted cabbage variety. Season with crushed or ground caraway seeds, aniseed or fennel seeds. This gives the cabbage a sweetish taste while also making it more digestible.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_101"></div>
