<p class="tx2"><b>This is one of my favourite recipes in the book. It is an old way of eating ricotta in Tuscany as a breakfast or <i>merenda</i> (an afternoon snack). It is simple and effective as well as light to eat and not too sweet. I like to serve this in shot glasses for breakfast or after dinner.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE, IN SMALL LIQUEUR GLASSES</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>250 g (9 oz/1 cup) ricotta, drained</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons cold espresso</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 teaspoons caster (superfine) sugar, plus more, to taste</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 teaspoons Cognac</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>20 g (¾ oz) dark (bittersweet) chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Whisk the ricotta in a bowl with the coffee, sugar and the Cognac. Taste and adjust the sweetness as necessary, adding more sugar if you wish. Spoon into glasses, taking care not to splash it onto the sides of the glass. Use a sharp knife to shave curls of chocolate and scatter them over the top. Keep them in the fridge for up to 1 day until you are ready to eat them. Serve chilled.</p>
