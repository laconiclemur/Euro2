  <h3 class="h3a">Pork stew</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">A homey stew that is a complete meal in itself. The addition of pancetta or bacon enhances the flavour of the pork. It can be made the day before and reheated when required, adding the peas after you have reheated the stew. Serve with good bread to mop up the sauce.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">650g/1lb 7oz stewing pork, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 carrots, halved lengthways and cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 fresh sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz pancetta slices or streaky bacon, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">75ml/2½fl oz/5 tbsp dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">250ml/9fl oz/1 cup <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz potatoes, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing2">150g/5½oz/generous 1 cup frozen peas</p>

  <p class="para">Season the pork with salt and pepper and dust with flour, shake off any excess flour and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion, celery, carrots, sage and pancetta and sweat on a medium heat. Add the pork and brown well all over.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the wine and allow to evaporate. Add 100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup stock, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the remaining stock. After 15 minutes, add the potatoes and cook for another hour.</p>

  <p class="para">Five minutes before the end of cooking time, add the peas. Remove from the heat and serve.</p>

    <p class="box-head">For a slow cooker</p>

    <p class="box-para">Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan and sweat the vegetables and pancetta as above. Add the floured pork and brown, then add the wine and evaporate. Pour in 250ml/9fl oz/1 cup stock and bring to the boil, stirring. Cut the potatoes into 2.5cm/1 inch chunks (these can take longer to cook than meat so don’t make any bigger) and place in a large slow cooker pot, pour over the hot pork mixture and press the meat and potatoes beneath the liquid. Cover and cook on Low for 8–9 hours. Stir in the frozen peas, with a little extra hot stock, if needed. Cover and cook on Low for 20 minutes.</p>
