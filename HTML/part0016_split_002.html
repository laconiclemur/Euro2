<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">I have to laugh at this excerpt from Hidden in Paris. Not so appetizing... But chicken soup as we all know is so much more than food. It a bone fide cure for various ailments. That, and of course red wine.</em></p><div id="c13s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre44"><b class="calibre4">Potage de Poulet --Chicken Soup</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre44"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for six to eight servings</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1 leftover chicken carcass (with some chicken still on) or small whole chicken</p><p class="calibre6">8 cups water or more to fill the pot</p><p class="calibre6">4 celery stalks</p><p class="calibre6">4 large carrots, peeled</p><p class="calibre6">4 small turnips, peeled. (Preferably spring turnips, as older ones can be bitter)</p><p class="calibre6">1 medium onion</p><p class="calibre6">4 small potatoes, peeled</p><p class="calibre6">1 chicken bouillon cube (this gives the soup some oomph).</p><p class="calibre6">Salt &amp; pepper to taste</p><p class="calibre6">½ tsp dried thyme</p><p class="calibre6">1 small bay leaf</p><p class="calibre6">(optional) Once the soup is made it’s nice to add ½ cup very small pasta of your choice, the kind that cooks in a few minutes; alphabet pasta, vermicelli, stars etc. This is also the ideal soup in which to cook Matzo balls. Make Matzo balls according to the package’s direction and drop into the slowly bubbling soup, cover and cook for 20 minutes extra.</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre44"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- Chop peeled carrots and celery stalks into very thin slices. Cut peeled turnips and potatoes into large chunks. You can also choose not to chop the vegetables. Just peel and cook whole. The later will make for a different look and experience (see picture).</p><p class="calibre6">2- Fill a large pot with water to within 3 inches from the top of the pot. Brandish your chicken carcass as though you’re about to throw it across the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Gleefully dump it and EVERY ingredient in the recipe (but the salt and pepper and pasta/Matzo balls) into the pot. Turn on the stove.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Once the water boils turn the heat down, cover, and simmer for one and a half to two hours.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Remove the chicken carcass. Be carefully because it will fall apart and you must make sure that no bones are left in the pot. A broken tooth does not make a happy guest. Let the carcass cool, then pick every bit of chicken off the carcass and add the bits back into the pot. Discard the carcass.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Bring the soup back to near boiling. Taste. (Be careful not to burn your mouth, blow first! Easier said than done. I’ve been burning my mouth on chicken soup for 20 years). Now is the time to decide how much salt you want in the soup: I usually add a chicken bouillon cube at that point for added flavor but it also replaces salt. If you do, make sure the bouillon cube is fully dissolved before you taste the soup again. Add salt and pepper as desired.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Add pasta if you choose to and boil five more minutes (or you can add Matzo balls in the soup and let them cook, covered, for 20 minutes, then add pasta in the last 5 minutes.)</p><p class="calibre6">8- Serve piping hot in a soup tureen or individual soup bowls. Accompany with toasted bread slices. Throw away your decongestant pills -- you won’t need them any more.</p></div></div></body></html>
