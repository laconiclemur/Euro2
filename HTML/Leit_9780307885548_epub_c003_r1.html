    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Toss the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and zest with the oil on a rimmed baking sheet, then flip all the tomatoes cut side up. Season generously with salt and pepper. Roast until the tomatoes soften and a few stray onions begin to color, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">While the tomatoes are roasting, generously season the cod fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Fit them snugly in one layer into a small baking dish. Add just enough oil to cover completely, then pour off the oil into a small saucepan, add the zest, and warm over low heat for 10 minutes. The bits of lemon will sizzle as the oil infuses, which is a sign the mixture is at the perfect temperature. Remove from the heat and allow to steep for 10 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent"><a id="page85"></a>Remove the tomatoes and onions from the oven, and reduce the oven temperature to 225°F. Opening the oven door will help hasten things; it’s crucial to wait until the proper temperature is reached. Too high a temperature will cause the cod to lose it suppleness. Meanwhile, toss out the strips of lemon zest from the tomatoes and scoop the contents of the baking sheet into a small saucepan. Stir in the vinegar, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cover to keep warm.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">A</span> cataplana, a fixture in the Algarve, is kind of a spiritual cousin to the pressure cooker. Shaped like a giant clam, the copper-hinged pan is clamped together for cooking, locking in the juices of its contents. When Teresa Paiva, whose recipe this is, carried hers to the table and popped it open, the room filled with steam redolent of the sea.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Make a small X in the bottom of each tomato with the tip of a knife. Using a slotted spoon, lower them, one at a time, into the pot for 5 to 10 seconds, depending upon how ripe they are. Fish them out and dunk them into the ice water to cool for about 1 minute. Peel the tomatoes by starting from the X mark on the bottom and pulling back the curled skin. If the recipe calls for seeded tomatoes, slice them through the equator and scoop out the seeds.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Pour the chicken stock, wine, and 2 cups of water into a medium pot. Take a taste, and season with just enough salt to bring out the flavors. Drop in the bay leaves and pepper flakes and bring to a boil over high heat.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, with your fingers, press the area where the head and arms of one octopus meet to check for what feels like a bead. If you feel one, cut the octopus apart just above and below the bead and discard that piece. If not, cut the octopus in half below the head. Repeat with the rest.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Lower the heat under the pot so the liquid barely simmers, and drop in the octopus pieces. Cover and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes. Check often to make sure the water remains at the merest simmer; otherwise, you’ll end up with a pot full of rubbery bits.</p>

    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Using a slotted spoon, lift the octopus pieces out of the pot and drop them into a colander to drain. Add the potatoes to the poaching liquid, turn the heat to medium-high, and cook until just tender, 18 to 20 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, cut the octopus arms in half—4 arms per piece. Slice the heads into ¼-inch rings. Scoop the pieces into a bowl and cover with a plate to keep warm.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Drain the potatoes in the colander. When cool enough to handle, slice them lengthwise into quarters, then add them to the octopus. Toss it all with ⅓ cup of the dressing. Take a nibble and season with salt and pepper if necessary. In another bowl, toss the greens with ⅓ cup of the dressing.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Divide the salad among six plates, crown with the octopus-potato mixture, and sprinkle with the cilantro. Serve immediately, with the remaining dressing on the side for drizzling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">I</span>f you don’t like salt cod, this is the recipe for you. Think of it as bacalhau 1.0. It’s actually similar to the dish I cut my teeth on. I hated salt cod as a kid, but my mother and grandmother were always foisting <em>bacalhau à Gomes de Sá</em> on me (see the Clássico, opposite). I’ve since come to love the dish, but back then the only way I could eat it was by mashing it all up with butter and milk. I thought I was so clever, but I discovered that my Portuguese teacher, Cristina Vasconcelos, makes a similar dish for her son, Bernardo. In fact, it’s a common home dish in Portugal. It has no official name, so I gave it my own.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Position a rack in the center of the oven and crank up the heat to 350°F. The ingredients for this classic differ slightly, as does the preparation, from my version. Tradition has it that the onions should be limp and light golden, but Momma Leite, whose recipe this is, can’t abide that: she likes her onions dark and sweet. In step 1, use 3 pounds onions, sliced into rings. Cook them, along with the bay leaf, covered, stirring often, for 15 minutes, then uncover and cook until deeply golden brown, about 35 minutes more. Adjust the heat as necessary so the onions don’t burn. Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes more. Toss out the bay leaf. In step 2, bring 2 pounds small boiling potatoes in their skins to a boil, and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain, peel, and cut them into ¼-inch slices. Skip steps 3 through 6. Instead, working in batches, heat several tablespoons of olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat and brown the potato slices, 5 to 7 minutes. Wipe the pan and add more oil between batches when needed.</p>

  <p class="indent">To assemble and bake the casserole, line the bottom of an oiled shallow 2-quart baking dish with half the potato slices, cover with half the cooked cod, and top with half the sautéed onions, a sprinkle of the parsley, and a few grinds of white pepper. Repeat layering the rest of the potatoes, cod, and onions, and drizzle with ¼ cup olive oil. Bake until spitting hot and tipped with brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool a bit, then top with 2 sliced hard-boiled eggs, 10 sliced black olives, and the rest of the parsley.</p>

The man has a sense of whimsy matched by few chefs I’ve met. His concept: Portuguese-ize McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish. So he came up with the moniker McSilva—Silva is a common name in Portugal—and swapped out the fried fillet for a savory salt cod patty, a <em>patanisca</em>. He also created a red pepper jam for a condiment. The whole thing was served in a McDonald’s-style container, with the name emblazoned across the top, which Luís happily popped open for each diner.</p>
