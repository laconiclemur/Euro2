<h4><span class="red">vinos de España</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">With food comes, of course, wine, so fundamental to the Spanish table—and, for many, part of the daily table. From unlabeled bottles of <em>vino de la mesa</em> (table wine) from the local cooperative to cellared vintages produced in the celebrated bodegas of La Rioja, Ribera del Duero, or Priorat; from the whites of Penedès, Rueda, and the Galician Rías Baixas to the <em>rosados</em> of Navarra and <em>Costers del Segre</em>, Spain has ancient viticulture traditions, world-class producers, and well over a million hectares of vines. There are around seventy wine regions with <em>Denominación de Origen</em> (D.O., Denomination of Origin) status. Three regions have a more esteemed, stricter status, <em>Denominación de Origen Calificada</em> (D.O.C. Qualified Denomination of Origin): La Rioja, Ribera del Duero, and Priorat.</p>
<p class="running_first">Wine’s importance in Spain cannot be understated. Take La Rioja, where it is king. The region in the northern part of the country is not much bigger than the American state of Delaware, contains only 1 percent of Spain’s total area, and has a population of just 300,000 people (with half of those living in the capital, Logroño). Yet there are, by my count, well over 500 wineries on the registry, producing wine from grapes grown by tens of thousands of producers, including such well-known bodegas as R. López de Heredia, Marqués de Murrieta, Marqués de Legarda, Marqués de Riscal, La Rioja Alta, and Muga. Local legend says that Noah’s grandson Tubal planted the first vines in La Rioja, though it was probably not until (!) the ancient Romans ruled the area. Traditions for making wines here date from the Middle Ages with monastic life.</p>
<p class="running_first">The “modern” industry in Spain (and in La Rioja) was stimulated in the 1850s when the odium and then phylloxera outbreaks ravaged vines in France, sending producers south to Spain to buy and, in some cases, stay. Such French influences as long aging in oak barrels remain hallmarks and give the classic Rioja red its mellow, regal tones. As elsewhere in Spain, most wineries in La Rioja have adopted new technologies while remaining faithful to tradition.</p>
<p class="running_first">A few, though, ardently adhere to the old ways. One of those is R. López de Heredia-Viña Tondonia in Haro. Mercedes López de Heredia, a fourth-generation wine-maker passionate about the traditional craft, acknowledges that little has changed in the process since her great-grandfather founded the legendary bodega in 1877. There are no stainless-steel vats or computers controlling the fermentation process; every step is strictly manual. They use only grapes from their vineyards, eschew chemicals, and ferment with natural yeast. The winery has four full-time barrel-makers and their onsite cooperage uses only American oak from the Appalachian mountains. Before bottling, the wine isn’t filtered, “just allowed to sit longer” as Mercedes put it, and naturally settle. Below the immaculately preserved original buildings (and a stunning, but jarringly modern tasting room and visitor’s “pavilion” designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect Zaha Hadid) are cellars with 13,000 oak barrels and 1.4 million bottles of wine aging under heavy coats of dust.</p>
<p class="running_first">On a recent summer day, sipping a classic, full-bodied Viña Tondonia reserva—gentle, silky, aromatic—Mercedes noticed me struggling to identify the bouquet of flavors I was tasting. She said, “My grandfather used to say, ‘The best wine is the one you can’t describe. The balance is perfect.’ ” And wines like this are about as close to perfect as possible.</p>
