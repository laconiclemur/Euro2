<h2 class="h2b">FLEURS DE COURGETTES FARCIES AUX TOMATES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Stuffed Courgette Flowers with Tomatoes</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>I know they don’t taste of an awful lot, but I can’t resist using courgette flowers, for as far as I’m concerned they do their bit just by looking so glorious. If you have a couple of plants in the garden you are guaranteed to have a fairly bountiful summer harvest wherever you may be, even more so if you have a greenhouse. It also makes life easier if you have your own because if you want them open and easy to stuff, they need to be picked before the sun rises</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>You can serve this recipe as a starter, either hot or at room temperature, as part of a buffet, or as an accompaniment to a rack of lamb or fillet of sea bass</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 courgette flowers, as open as possible<br/>
1 onion, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
4 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
8 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br/>
6 medium tomatoes, about 600g (1lb 5oz)<br/>
30g (1¼oz) dried breadcrumbs<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
20 or so cherry tomatoes, halved<br/>
Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon<br/>
1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">First sweat the onion and garlic in 2 tbsp of the olive oil for 5 minutes until soft but not coloured. Meanwhile core, roughly chop then purée the tomatoes. Add them to the onions and garlic and boil over a high heat until almost all of the liquid has gone. Add the breadcrumbs and 2 more tbsp of the olive oil. Season really well with salt and cayenne and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="normala">For the dressing, mix the halved cherry tomatoes with the zest and juice of the lemon, the basil and remaining olive oil. Season with plenty of salt and cayenne and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Stuff the courgette flowers with the tomato and onion mixture. Don’t worry if they tear: just fill them and turn them upside down. Bake them in the preheated oven on an oiled tray for 5 minutes and serve with the tomato dressing.</p>
