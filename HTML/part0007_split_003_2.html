<p id="sab0003429" class="calibre10"><a id="pg22" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>Delis will offer a range of brands, but Ortiz anchovies are also good quality and an affordable price, and are available from many supermarkets now.</p>
<p id="sab0003430" class="calibre10">When I buy a tin of anchovies, I always keep the oil and use it when making mayonnaise (see <a href="part0217.html#6EUA20-e0619577b1ef4a12818eb9a8830c4ebf" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) to add extra flavour – you could also use it in salad dressings.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003431"><em class="calibre12"><span class="small">JAMÓN IBÉRICO</span></em></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003432"><em class="calibre9">Jamón</em> is so important to Spanish food. In a Spanish kitchen, everyone always has some sliced <em class="calibre9">jamón</em> in their fridge: it’s so easy to put a plate of it on the table, though we also love to use it in baguettes for an amazing sandwich (a <em class="calibre9">bocadillo</em>) and, of course, to cook with it.</p>
<p id="sab0003433" class="calibre10"><em class="calibre9">Jamón ibérico</em> is made from the legs of black Iberian pigs, but the top class is <em class="calibre9">jamón ibérico de bellota</em>, which is made from Iberian pigs that have been fed exclusively on acorns for three months in the autumn, during the acorn-foraging season. It has an amazingly sweet and nutty flavour.</p>
<p id="sab0003434" class="calibre10">There are many different brands of good-quality <em class="calibre9">jamón ibérico de bellota</em> available to buy. I like to use 5J (Cinco Jotas), because I have known the producers for many years, and it’s well known and is stocked by lots of shops and used by many restaurants. But as long as you buy <em class="calibre9">jamón ibérico de bellota</em>, it’s going to be good.</p>
<p id="sab0003435" class="calibre10">We visited a Basque pig producer whose pigs are small, black and white, and weigh maybe 80–90 kilos. These pigs, Euskal Txerria, are a breed facing extinction – in 1980, there were only fifty of them left in the whole country, and nowadays you can find just 130 sows. The pigs we saw are free-range and acorn-fed on a farm near Arruitz, a beautiful place under the care of Bixente Goñi, a farmer with more than forty years of experience.</p>
