<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This is another sweet drink that shows its Moorish influences in the pronounced cinnamon and citrus flavors. Like <em>granizados</em> (slushy granitas) along the Levant, this is a drink once prepared for Sundays or festivals, or sipped around a village café table set out on the plaza in the late afternoon. The tradition of preparing leche merengada, though, has sadly begun to fade somewhat, and its popularity has been replaced by the broad assortment of ever-growing commercial drinks available. Serve very cold, almost slushy. It is filling and delicious.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 QUART/1 L MILK</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/100 G SUGAR</li>
<li>1 SMALL CINNAMON STICK</li>
<li>PEEL OF 1 LEMON, WHITE PITH SCRAPED AWAY</li>
<li>2 EGG WHITES, AT ROOM TEMPERATURE</li>
<li>GROUND CINNAMON FOR DUSTING (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large saucepan, add the milk, sugar, cinnamon stick, and lemon peel and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to keep the milk from scorching. Remove the pan from the heat to let cool and the flavors infuse.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Pour into a wide stainless-steel or glass bowl and place in the freezer until nearly frozen but still slightly runny.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a mixer over medium speed to soft peaks that are opaque and still moist. Fold the egg whites into the milk.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Spoon into glasses and lightly dust with cinnamon, if desired. Serve very cold with tall spoons and straws.</p>
