  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page236"></a>THE TERRINE OF SOLE FILLETS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Possible variations are innumerable: the central roll of fillets may enclose bars of truffles rather than the sorrel stuffing; the forcemeat may be replaced by a classic mousseline forcemeat, and pike, salmon, trout, etc., may replace those fish suggested in the recipe that follows; it may be enriched by the addition of cubes of poached lobster or shrimp, chopped truffles peelings, dried morels (soaked, well rinsed, chopped and stewed in butter).</p>

  <p class="indent">In this particular terrine, the acidity of the sorrel lends a delicious contrast to the fish, and the pretty geometry of the cross-sectional slices, forming a central disk of pale green bound in a ribbon of pure white against the mottled square, would have moved Alberti to admiration.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c14-s53"><em><span class="color">Terrine of Sole Fillets</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Terrine de Filets de Sole</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Fish fumet:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sole carcasses, cleaned and rinsed, the gills discarded, 1 coarsely chopped onion, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, salt, ½ cup white wine, ½ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>large handful of fresh white bread crumbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound fresh (not frozen) fish fillets (whiting, lemon sole, flounder)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg, separated</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, nutmeg, Cayenne</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful raw, shelled pistachio nuts</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 heaping tablespoons <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh6">Duxelles</a> (if made especially, count ¼ pound mushrooms and 1 medium onion)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound sorrel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 soles of approximately 1 pound each, filleted, the carcasses saved (lacking Dover sole, use grey or lemon sole)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page237"></a><span class="small">THE FUMET</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">For the <em>fumet</em>, cut or break the carcasses into small pieces, combine all the elements in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer, covered, for ½ hour. Strain the liquid and rapidly reduce it over a high flame to about ⅓ cup.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pour the <em>fumet</em> over the bread crumbs, mashing with a fork to ensure its being thoroughly imbibed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pound the ½ pound of fillets to a purée in a mortar, work in the white of the egg, small quantities at a time, with the pestle or a wooden spoon, and, when it is completely absorbed, pound in half the soaked bread crumbs, first squeezed if they are too liquid. Season to taste with salt, freshly ground pepper, a tiny bit of nutmeg, and a pinch of Cayenne, remembering that cold preparations support a sharper seasoning than hot dishes. Pass through a fine drum sieve, a tablespoonful at a time, using the plastic disk.</p>

  <p class="indent">Drop the pistachio nuts into boiling water for a minute or so, drain them, rub them in a towel to remove the skins, chop them coarsely, and stir them and the <em>duxelles</em> into the fish purée.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pick over the sorrel, tearing off the stems backward, wash it in several waters, drain well, shred it finely, and stew it gently, lightly salted, in the butter until reduced to a near purée. Mix it thoroughly with the yolk of the egg and the remaining bread crumbs, squeezed dry, if necessary, and pass through a fine sieve. Taste for salt, stir in a bit of freshly ground pepper, and put to chill to make it more easily manageable.</p>

  <p class="indent">Soak the sole fillets in cold water for 15 minutes, spread them on paper towels and pat them dry.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use an earthenware, porcelain, or enameled ironware terrine, long and rectangular in form. Cut a piece of aluminum foil, in width the same as the length of the terrine, and long enough to line the bottom and the two sides and to fold over the top of the filled terrine; this is to facilitate unmolding it, the fragility of fish terrines rendering them difficult to serve directly. Butter the terrine, butter one side of the foil and press it into place, unbuttered side placed against the buttered walls of the terrine. Make an even bed in the bottom of about ⅓ of the fish forcemeat and arrange the sole fillets on top, slightly overlapping, <a id="page238"></a>placed crosswise in a row the entire length of the terrine, the bottom and two long sides, thus, lined with the fillet tips hanging over the edges. Spoon in the sorrel stuffing, even it out, and, beginning with the last fillet to have been placed, pull the ends of the fillets, one after the other, inward, one folded over the other so as to form a “tube” of stuffed fillets through the central length of the terrine. Add the rest of the forcemeat, forcing it gently down each side of the roll of fillets, and covering them. Tap the terrine a couple of times against a wooden surface to settle the contents, fold the buttered foil over the top and press it down. Cook in a 300°–325° F. oven in a <em>bain-marie</em>, the terrine immersed two-thirds of the way up in hot, but not boiling, water, for about 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Leave the terrine to cool under approximately 1 pound of pressure (a board the dimensions of the terrine’s surface with a weight on top), then put to chill for a day. To unmold, loosen the pâté from the ends of the terrine with the blade of a knife, lift the body of it loose by pulling up on the foil flaps that have been folded over the top, then fold them over the outside walls of the terrine, turn the pâté out onto an oval or rectangular platter, and peel off the foil. Surround it with a <em>chiffonade</em> of lettuce or other simple décor, keeping it chilled until the moment of serving.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE BEEF STEW A LA BOURGUIGNONNE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Probably the most widely known of all French preparations, Beef Burgundy certainly deserves its reputation—or would if the few details essential to its success were more often respected. The meat must be a gelatinous cut—oxtail (which is never larded), shank, heel or chuck are all good. The cooking must be slow and even—stringy, dry, cooked-apart meat and an emulsion of indigestible grease in the sauce are the inevitable results of a too-rapid cooking. The sauce must be strained, well skimmed of fat, slowly reduced and purified by skimming. Properly done, the meat will be firm, moist and tender, and the sauce, a deep, warm brown, will have sufficient body to coat all the solid ingredients. There is nothing difficult about its preparation, but there are no shortcuts.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page239"></a>If good lean salt pork is not available, omit it; do not substitute bacon, the smoky flavor of which, even when first parboiled, distorts and “muddies” the otherwise dean, distinct flavor of the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">As a preparation “type,” <em>bourguignon</em> is identical to <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c20_r1.htm#c20.1">Coq au Vin</a></em>, <em>sauté de veau au vin rouge</em> (veal in red wine), <em>matelote d’anguille</em> (eel in red wine), <em>mou de veau en civet</em> (calves’ lungs in red wine), the only difference residing in the various lengths of cooking time and the consequent difference in reducing time for the sauce. <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c17_r1.htm#page260">Poached Eggs <em>en meurette</em> or <em>à la Bourguignonne</em></a> and <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c25_r1.htm#c25-s94">Brains <em>en Matelote</em></a>, because of the fragility of the central element, are treated somewhat differently, but the sauce remains identical in concept. <em>Civet de lièvre</em> (jugged hare), but for the final thickening with the animal’s blood, is the same preparation, and rabbit, either domestic or wild, wild boar and venison, although termed civets, are often prepared exactly like a <em>bourguignon</em>. Evidently, once the principles of one of these preparations is understood, the others not only become automatic knowledge, but a world of new and less traditional possibilities is opened out. Pork, goose, squirrel, and squid are good when subjected to this treatment (game birds, because of the dryness of their flesh, do not lend themselves to it). Muskrat (discreetly labeled “marsh rabbit”) is commonplace in Baltimore markets and, despite the merchants’ claim that the only possible preparation is first to boil it “to get rid of its taste,” and then to “fry it like chicken,” it is delicious when treated <em>à la bourguignonne</em>. A <em>bourguignon</em> does not suffer from being prepared in advance and gently reheated.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c14-s54"><em><span class="color">Beef Stew à la Bourguignonne</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Sauté de Boeuf à la Bourguignonne</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 single 3-pound cross section (bone removed) of heel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 ounces fat fresh or salt pork</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon thyme (or mixed herbs)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page240"></a>2 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bottle good red Burgundy wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound (2 slices) lean salt side pork</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3–4 medium carrots (10–12 ounces)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 large onions (something less than 1 pound)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 level tablespoons flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf and a bouquet of parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 1 cup veal stock, pot-au-feu bouillon, or, lacking either, water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound small, firm, unopened mushrooms</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>30 small white onions (between a hazelnut and a walnut in size)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut the section of heel (the part of the hind leg beneath the round) in 2, crosswise, and divide each piece into 6 pieces, respecting the muscular structure, each piece remaining intact within its membrane (the heel is so constructed that this may easily be done). Cut the fat pork into small strips about 1 inch long and ¼ inch square, roll them in the chopped parsley mixed with a pinch of the thyme (or mixed herbs), pierce each piece of meat once or twice, with the grain, and force a strip of fat pork into the slit, making certain that it is well embedded in the piece of meat. Put the meat to marinate for about 3 hours with 2 tablespoons olive oil, the rest of the thyme, and the bottle of wine, turning the pieces around in their marinade 2 or 3 times during this period.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the 2 slices of lean salt pork crosswise into sections slightly over ½ inch wide, cover them with cold water, bring to a boil, simmer for 2 or 3 minutes and drain. Peel the carrots and cut them crosswise into 1- or 2-inch lengths. Peel the large onions and cut each into 4 or 6 pieces.</p>

  <p class="indent">A large <em>sauteuse</em> may be used for the entire cooking process, but it is usually more practical to carry out the preliminary steps in a smaller <em>sauteuse</em> or skillet, transferring everything to an earthenware or heavy copper or enameled ironware <em>cocotte</em>—the latter, impossible for the browning process, serves well during the braising stage. Beginning the braising process in a different vessel with an absolutely <a id="page241"></a>clean surface reduces the risk of anything’s sticking to the bottom, and the fact of its being smaller but deeper than the <em>sauteuse</em> permits one to arrange the meat in such a way that it may be well covered with a minimum of liquid.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the sections of side pork in the 3 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil over a medium heat, turning each (if they are tossed, some are always overbrowned on some sides and untouched on others) until they are golden and the surfaces lightly crisp. Put them aside and, over a lower flame, cook the cut-up carrots and onions in the same oil, stirring regularly, for from 20 to 30 minutes. The onions should be lightly browned—they burn easily and should be constantly surveyed. Remove the vegetables from the pan with a perforated skimming spoon, draining them as nearly as possible of all the fat, and making certain to leave no fragment of onion behind—it would inevitably burn and leave a bitter taste in the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">While the vegetables are cooking, remove the meat from its marinade, drain it well in a colander or large sieve, collecting the liquid, and sponge the pieces of meat with a paper towel until dry. Turn the flame up and, still in the same oil, brown the meat on all sides, adding a bit more oil, if necessary, and salting only after the pieces have been turned once. (If they are not placed closely enough together, the fat will burn, but if they are packed in, their juices will be drawn out rather than being sealed in and they will boil rather than sear. Use an extra skillet, if necessary, or sear them in relays.) Turn the flame down, drain off any excess oil, sprinkle the flour over, and turn the meat 2 or 3 times over a period of 5 or 6 minutes until the flour is lightly browned (the eventual color and flavor of the sauce depends, in large part, on the onions, meat and flour being browned to just the right point). Return the onions and carrots to the pan, stir everything together, and pour in the cognac and the reserved marinade. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve all frying adherents, transfer the pieces of meat to the <em>cocotte</em> or casserole, pour the liquid and vegetables over, add the parsley and the bay leaf, tied together, the garlic, and enough boiling stock (or water) to cover. Bring the liquid back to a boil and cook, covered, the surface hardly bubbling, preferably in an oven, for from 2½ to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender but still firm. Skim the surface fat <a id="page242"></a>2 or 3 times during this period and gently displace the pieces of meat in their sauce to ensure that nothing sticks to the bottom.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rinse the mushrooms rapidly, drain them, dry them in paper towels and toss them, salted and peppered, in half the butter, over a high flame, for a couple of minutes, or until they are lightly colored and their superficial moisture has evaporated. Peel the small onions and cook them whole, seasoned, in the remaining butter, in a pan just the right size to hold them, over low heat, tossing them or turning them from time to time, until yellowed and tender, but not browned.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the pieces of meat and carrot from the sauce (with a spoon, not a fork), discard the parsley and bay leaf, and pass everything else through a fine sieve. Return the meat and carrots to their cooking utensil, add the pieces of browned side pork, the glazed little onions, and the sautéed mushrooms and keep covered while finishing the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring the sauce to a boil and, keeping the saucepan to the side of the flame, simmer and skim regularly for ½ hour (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page90">Skimming</a>). If at this point the sauce seems too thin, reduce it for a couple of minutes over a high flame, stirring constantly. Pour it over the meat and its garnish, slowly reheat, and simmer gently for about 20 minutes. Serve in its cooking vessel, accompanied by freshly steamed potatoes in a separate dish.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">FLOATING ISLAND (OEUFS A LA NEIGE)</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The name of this dessert creates a great deal of confusion. Its literal translation is “Snow Eggs” but in English it is most often called Floating Island. However, other custard sauces (<em>crème anglaise</em>) and meringue desserts also claim a right to that title and, in French, <em>île flottante</em> is totally different—an island of alternate layers of alcohol-soaked dessert biscuits and jam, around which a custard or fruit sauce is poured.</p>

  <p class="indent">One may, for variation, dissolve caramelized sugar into the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Readers who do not care for baked (or, in the case of certain American pies, half-baked) meringues may be pleasantly surprised at the firm, moist, consistent texture of this poached version.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c14-s55"><a id="page243"></a><em><span class="color">Floating Island</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Oeufs à la Neige</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>The sauce:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 vanilla bean (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>10 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>The meringue:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ cups sifted confectioners’ sugar</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the milk, sugar and vanilla to a boil in a large <em>sauteuse</em> or other low, wide pan, remove it from the flame and leave the vanilla bean to infuse while preparing the meringue.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites, beat them until they stand stiffly in peaks, and sift the confectioners’ sugar over, folding it in delicately but thoroughly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the vanilla bean from the milk, bring milk again to a boil, and regulate the heat so that a bare simmer is maintained. Gently drop heaping teaspoonfuls of the raw meringue into the simmering milk, poaching no more than 5 or 6 at a time, for the meringues swell and should not be crowded. After a couple of minutes, cautiously turn them over and leave to poach a couple of minutes longer. Lift them out with a tablespoon or perforated skimming spoon and slip them onto a nylon drum sieve placed over a mixing bowl. Remove them, once drained, to a large, deep serving platter to make room for the following batches.</p>

  <p class="indent">When all the “eggs” have been poached and drained, pass the poaching milk through the drum sieve to join that which has been drained from the meringues. Beat the egg yolks and slowly pour in the milk, whisking at the same time. Pour the mixture into a heavy saucepan and, over a low to medium flame, stir constantly with a wooden spoon, scraping the sides of the saucepan repeatedly, until the “cream” is sufficiently thick to coat the spoon. It must not approach the boiling <a id="page244"></a>point. Remove the saucepan from the heat immediately, pass the sauce through the drum sieve into another container and pour it carefully into the serving platter, around, but not over, the meringues. Serve well chilled.</p>
