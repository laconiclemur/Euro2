<p class="author1"><span class="txit">linguine con vongole</span></p>
<p class="noindent">According to my father, this was one of Nonno Tucci’s favorite sauces to make. “He preferred to open the clams himself,” recalls Stan. “He would remove the clam meat, making certain to collect all the juice. In the summer when we had large outdoor parties, we often served a bushel of raw clams on ice. Any remaining clams were prepared following my father’s methods and frozen. They defrost quickly, providing a meal in the time it takes to cook the pasta.”</p>
<p class="indentb">If your fish market will open the clams and reserve the juice, it will save a lot of preparation time. If not, wash the clamshells thoroughly. Open the clams over a large bowl to catch the juices. Remove clams, discarding the dark sac, and set aside. Strain the juice through a fine-mesh sieve to remove sand and shells. Add the clams to the strained juice. Begin to prepare the sauce when the pasta is halfway cooked.</p>

Cook until the broth froths to a level of 1 to 2 inches. Remove from the heat. Stir in the parsley.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_160"/><span class="red">3.</span> Drain the pasta and toss in a serving bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Distribute evenly among six dinner plates. Top with equal portions of the sauce, and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> The same dish may be prepared without removing the clams from their shells, making for a less formal, hands-on meal. Warm the olive oil in a pot large enough to hold the clams in a single layer. Add the garlic and cook until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and allow to simmer and sweeten, about 2 minutes. Add the clams and parsley, and cover the pot. Cook until the clams open, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and spoon over cooked pasta. Be sure to discard any unopened clams.</p>
