<h2 class="h2b">PETITE FRITURE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Deep-fried Whitebait</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>There are two types of fish in particular which you will always have to get up early for to beat off competition at any Provençal fish market. One is the spiny, multi-coloured mixture for bouillabaisse; the other the shining, silvery little fish sold sometimes as</em> petite friture <em>and occasionally as</em> mange tout <em>(for, just like the sweet peas of the same name, you devour the lot). When they are fresh and crisp with simply a fine coating of golden flour, they are delicious served as a starter or just laid out in generous platefuls for everyone to share alongside bottles of chilled rosé. Serve the</em> petite friture <em>with good lemons and, if you like (I really do), bowls of aïoli. Always fry more than you think you’ll need. You’ll be surprised how many disappear while you’re cooking them</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4 AS A STARTER, 8 AS AN <em>AMUSE-BOUCHE</em></span><br/>
600g (1lb 5oz) whitebait<br/>
Vegetable oil for deep-frying<br/>
200g (7oz) plain flour<br/>
1 tsp cayenne pepper<br/>
1 tsp salt plus extra for dusting</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO SERVE</span><br/>
2 lemons<br/>
1 recipe <em>Aïoli</em> (<em><a href="chapter_003k.html#page92">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 160°C/325°F/Gas 3.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat your deep-fryer. If you don’t have an electric one, use a deep pot. Never fill the latter more than a third full, monitor the temperature carefully and keep all children and animals away: there are few things more dangerous in a kitchen. The oil should be heated to 190°C/375°F. Prepare an oven tray with plenty of kitchen paper and put it in the preheated oven.</p>
<p class="normala">Spread the fish flat on a tray. Mix the flour with the cayenne and salt, then toss it over the fish and coat them well. Put them into a sieve and shake well to remove any excess flour. Fry in three batches for about 2 minutes each until golden brown, draining them on the kitchen paper on the oven tray in the oven, and salting them. Let the oil come back to temperature between each batch.</p>
<p class="normala">Serve as soon as they are done with the lemon and aïoli.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON DEEP-FRYING</span></p>
<p class="normal3">To have a crispy, fresh-tasting result, you need to use very clean oil and only use it once. The flour disperses through the oil and if you reheat it again, it burns and has a rancid, stale taste.</p>
<p class="normala">Having the oven on and only cooking in small batches is vital, as the oven not only keeps the fish warm, but also dries out any oil that may be left on the fish. Make sure that the oil gets back to temperature between each batch, or the fish will soak it up and become greasy rather than crisp.</p>
