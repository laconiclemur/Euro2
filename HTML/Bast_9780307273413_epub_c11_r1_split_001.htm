Inland, the terrain is rugged, with mountains that stretch like tense fingers to the shore.</p>

  <p class="indent">The cuisine of Calabria is not an expansive cuisine; it is, in the true sense of the word, a simple cuisine, reflecting the place. The basic ingredients are olive oil, onions, peperoncini, tomatoes, pork, fish, caciocavallo cheese, durum-wheat pasta, and bread.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some of the unique regional products that flavor this cuisine are: the onion from Tropea, a purple torpedo-looking sweet onion that is much used in Calabria and sought after in the world—so much so that the Queen of England has her regular allocation delivered to the castle kitchen. And then there are little red hornlike Aspic peppers that in late summer hang, tied like cordons of coral, off balconies, walls, and cantinas. They are left to dry anywhere with direct sunlight and some ventilation, then used in cooking the rest of the year. They can be eaten whole, fried until crisp, crushed, powdered, or made into paste with olive oil. Every household seems to have one or more of these Ferrari-red garlands hanging somewhere.</p>

  <p class="indent">So much is the peperoncino valued that there is a yearly <em class="calibre4">sagra</em>, or festival, in honor of it. There is as well the Accademia del Peperoncino, which has its office in Diamante. On my last visit, looking for information, I came to the <em class="calibre4">accademia</em> to find a busy team of officeworkers scurrying around, because that night the <em class="calibre4">sagra</em> was taking place, and four thousand people were expected—Mario and I among them.</p>

  <p class="indent">I love peperoncino and use it a lot in my cooking, but being on location helped me realize how much of a tradition and a way of life this little pepper represents to the people of Calabria and their cuisine. Brought here by the Spaniards after they discovered the New World, chili peppers found their ideal habitat in Calabria. In the past century, over a million people left Calabria to seek a better life in other parts of Italy as well as abroad, especially in the United States. Ironically, they took with them their favorite food, crushed peperoncino, now found on every pizzeria counter across America.</p>

  <p class="indent">I first discovered Calabria in 2006, when Mario and I decided to drive around the whole perimeter of the region, across its central mountains, and over one of its highest peaks, the Aspromonte.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page322"></a>Calabria is a place in a precarious position. It is a dead end, unless you are heading to Sicily. But in order to reach Sicily, you have to get to Reggio Calabria, the capital city, and then take a ferry over the Strait of Messina. Thus it’s much easier to fly from Rome to Palermo and bypass Calabria altogether. Before this recent trip, the closest I got to Calabria was in 1995. I went to Sicily with a group of friends, hoping to stop off in Calabria en route. We sailed the <em class="calibre4">Sea Cloud</em>, a magnificent three-masted sailboat built in 1931 for E. F. Hutton and his wife, Marjorie Merriweather Post. From southern Sicily we headed up toward the Strait of Messina. There is a strong current in these waters most of the time, but on that faraway day the seas seemed to be angry. And although the sailing was exhilarating, we never did dock in Reggio Calabria as we had planned. This, I reminded myself, is the strait about which Ulysses had been warned. The two monsters Scylla and Charybdis awaited, one on each side: Scylla, the monster with six heads on the Calabrian coast, and Charybdis, across the gulf, on the Sicilian coast, swallowing up any ship coming close to the whirlpools of the changing tides. Am I grateful we got away!</p>

  <p class="indent">But this time, with Mario, I made it to Calabria. We went by land, leaving the <em class="calibre4">autostrada</em> from Naples to take a side road down to the Tyrrhenian Sea. There we reached Maratea, a beautiful seaside city where we had a great lunch in a small trattoria, consisting of fried olives, Calabrese Salad—<em class="calibre4">Insalata alla Calabrese</em>, and Spicy Calamari—<em class="calibre4">Calamari Piccanti</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">The intensity of the flavors was evident in every bite, reminding me a lot of Sicilian food but somehow more naïve and rustic, and certainly more fiery. The evening we spent down the coast in Diamante, where the Sagra del Peperoncino was alive with music. The tents were festooned with wreaths of peperoncino, and tables were full of pyramids of piled-up glass jars filled with the red peperoncino in oil, in vinegar, a paste, dry powder—every way one can imagine. The grounds looked like Christmas, even though it was midsummer. Smells of sausages, lamb, baked pasta wafted through the air, and we made sure we had some of each. I particularly remember the Stuffed Baked Pasta—<em class="calibre4">Schiaffettoni</em>, Shepherd’s Rigatoni—<em class="calibre4">Rigatoni alla Pastora</em>, and Steamed Swordfish Bagnara-Style—<em class="calibre4">Pesce Spada all’Uso di Bagnara</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Next stop was Tropea, where I went looking for La Rosa di Tropea, the famous red onion from Tropea. But I also found a stupendous turquoise beach, which, I later discovered, was rated in the Sunday <em class="calibre4">New York Times</em> in January 2007 as one of the world’s best beaches. The city itself is perched on a high promontory, with a skyline of Renaissance churches, and sandstone palazzos. The sanctuary of Santa Maria dell’Isola stands at the highest point on an isolated rock, with only a thread of sandy beach connecting it to the mainland, as if guarding Tropea.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page323"></a>The red torpedo onions have been growing in this region since the Greeks occupied it. The sandy soil and hot climate in “La Costa degli Dei”—the “Coast of the Gods,” as this strip of land is called—is ideal for growing these onions. The Tropea onion is synonymous with the Calabrian cuisine from this area. It is sweet and quite digestible, thanks to such sugars as glucose, fructose, and saccharose. It is claimed to have antiseptic properties as well, but most of all it tastes great, whether raw, fried, stuffed, or in pastas and soups such as Onion Soup—<em class="calibre4">Zuppa di Cipolla</em>. It also features in Eggplant, Onions, and Potatoes—<em class="calibre4">Patate, Cipolle e Melanzane</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Tropea we met up with my friend Raffaele La Gamba, who lives in Brooklyn but hails from this part of Calabria. Every holiday when we meet in New York, on his table there must be flavorful <em class="calibre4">’nduja</em>, the spiciest dip-spread-sauce I ever tasted, and I mean ever.</p>

  <p class="indent">So I wanted to know where and how this spreadable fiery salami is made. We headed out to Spilinga, a small town that was the <em class="calibre4">’nduja</em> epicenter, and went to visit Luigi Caccamo, the <em class="calibre4">’nduja</em> artisan. <em class="calibre4">’Nduja</em> is made from the head trimmings of the pig, as well as some fatback, skin, belly fat, and other organ trimmings. It is all minced and then tossed with almost an equal amount of fiery peperoncino. After resting for a few days, the mixture is stuffed into the large intestines of the pig. It is tied up like salami and hung in a controlled-temperature setting to mature. We tasted it as a spread, and slightly warmed as a dip on crusty bread, but we also had a firecracker pasta with <em class="calibre4">’nduja</em> in the tomato sauce. I bade Raffaele a fiery goodbye, to enjoy the rest of his vacation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Next, we visited the town of Bagnara, between Tropea and Scilla, nestled in a sickle-shaped bay. Down a high promontory, the winding road led us to this fishermen’s town of little houses that seemed to be clinging to the rocks. Here they have fished swordfish since the days of the Greeks, and they still do it the same way today, harpooning the fish by hand.</p>

  <p class="indent">But swordfish is not the only good thing in Bagnara. Italians travel from afar to enjoy the notorious ice cream and torrone of Bagnara. And there are other surprise flavors and sensations to be found in this rugged land. One unique flavor that I adore, especially in ice cream, is bergamot—a fruit of the citrus family, pear-shaped, yellow in color, and intense in aroma. Bergamots are cultivated only in a narrow strip of the Calabrian coast extending for about sixty miles between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The perfumed lemony essence of this fruit is used in candy and desserts, as well as in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.</p>

  <p class="indent">Ever on the lookout for recipes I could bring home, we stopped at Bovalino Marina, where a friend of Mario treated us to an excellent meal. On their terrace, above orchards of olive trees overlooking the Ionian Sea, we enjoyed Orecchiette with Favas and Cherry Tomatoes—<em class="calibre4">Orecchiette <a class="calibre8" id="page324"></a>con Fave e Pomodorini</em>, Pork Chops Shepherd-Style—<em class="calibre4">Maiale all’Uso dei Pastori</em>, and finished with some Almond Biscottini—<em class="calibre4">Biscottini alle Mandorle</em>, and Stuffed Figs Sibari-Style—<em class="calibre4">Fichi Ripieni alla Sibarita</em></p>

  <p class="indent">We continued our search, zigzagging past Catanzaro, up the Silagian Mountains, where we had, in the most simple setting, some of the most intense and flavorful foods for lunch. Baked Cavatappi in Tomato Sauce—<em class="calibre4">Cavatappi al Forno</em>, Chicken Catanzaro-Style—<em class="calibre4">Pollo alla Catanzarese</em>, and Sesame Candy—<em class="calibre4">Dolcetto di Sesamo</em> were on the menu, and we washed it all down with Cirò, claimed to be one of the best as well as the oldest wine in Calabria.</p>

  <p class="extract">Peppers play a central role in this Calabrian version of potato salad. Fresh green peppers are fried as a main salad ingredient; and peperoncino, dried crushed red-pepper flakes, serves as an essential seasoning.</p>

  <p class="indent">The peppers you want for this are the slender, long ones with sweet, tender flesh, which I have always just called “Italian frying peppers.” These days, with the greater popularity of peppers and chilis here in America, markets sell a number of varieties that are suitable for frying, such as banana peppers, wax peppers, Hungarian peppers, and Cubanelle peppers.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to this delicious salad with potatoes, you’ll find many wonderful uses for fresh peppers, fried Italian-style. Season them with olive oil and slices of garlic, let them marinate, and enjoy them as part of an antipasto or layered in a sandwich. Or sprinkle a little wine vinegar on the peppers (with the olive oil and garlic) for a condiment-like salad that is just perfect with grilled fish or chicken.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the potatoes in a pot with water to cover them by about 2 inches, and heat to a steady boil. Cook just until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork or sharp knife blade (don’t let them get mushy), then drain and cool them. Peel off the skins, cut the potatoes crosswise into round slices about ⅓ inch thick, and put them in the salad bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour ¼ cup of the olive oil into the big skillet, and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put the whole peppers in it and cook for a couple of minutes, until they’re sizzling and starting to color on one side, then turn them and brown the other side. Keep turning and moving the peppers around so they cook and color evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page326"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After 5 minutes, when the peppers have been turned a couple of times and are sizzling nicely, scatter the garlic cloves in between them. Now lay another, smaller skillet or a heavy pot cover on top of the peppers, and press down for more thorough browning. Cook for another 5 minutes or more, rotating the peppers a couple of times, until they are browned and blistered on all surfaces. Remove from the heat, and let the peppers cool for a few minutes, with the weight still in place.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the peppers can be handled, cut off the stems, peel off the skin, slice them open, and scrape out the seeds. Slice them lengthwise in strips about 1 inch wide; if the peppers were very long, cut the strips crosswise into nice lengths for eating, 3 inches or so.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Assemble and dress the salad while the pepper strips are still warm (though it is also good at room temperature). Put the pepper pieces and the onion slices in the bowl with the potatoes, and sprinkle the salt and peperoncino over them. Drizzle the remaining ¼ cup olive oil and the vinegar on the vegetables, and toss well. Serve right away.</p>

  <p class="extract">In the introduction to this chapter, I tell about the extraordinary red onion from Tropea. Its healing qualities have been promoted since Roman times. And though not widely publicized, the wine-red onion is particularly valued by the men of the coast for its capacity to enhance a certain romantic vigor—a legend now confirmed by recent scientific research, we were told, that found <em class="calibre4">la cipolla rossa di Tropea</em> naturally rich with the same compound as delivered by the drug Viagra!</p>

  <p class="indent">I can’t comment on that, but I can tell you with certainty that one can only love any dish featuring the Tropea onion, whether raw or cooked. This wonderful soup, with lots of onions and good San Marzano tomatoes, is the one that we sampled in Calabria and that I have since re-created at home. Made with American-grown sweet onions, it is almost as good as the original version. It can be a meal in itself, or a very special opening course.</p>

Let the garlic sizzle for a minute, then fill the pan with the onion slices, and sprinkle the salt over them. Stir the onions so they’re all coated with oil.

Stir in with the onions, cover the pan, bring to a boil, then adjust the heat to keep the soup simmering gently. Cook covered for 45 minutes (the onions should be very tender).

  <p class="extract">When summer is in full swing and there are mounds of beautiful purple eggplants available, here’s a wonderfully refreshing salad you can make. Since the eggplant is poached rather than fried, it is a light and healthful dish.

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Trim the ends from the eggplants, and shave off some lengthwise strips of the skin with a vegetable peeler, leaving some strips on, creating a striped appearance. Slice the eggplants lengthwise into 6 or more long wedges, about 1 inch thick. Peel the red onions, and slice them lengthwise into quarter-round wedges, <em class="calibre4">not</em> cutting at the root; you want the wedges attached.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To poach the eggplants and onions: Put 1½ cups of the vinegar and 2 quarts cold water in the shallow saucepan, and heat to a boil. Drop in the eggplant wedges and the split-open onions, cover the pan, and return to a boil. Set the cover ajar, and adjust the heat to maintain a steady gentle boil. Cook about 30 minutes, occasionally tumbling the vegetables over to poach evenly, until quite soft and tender.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, put the potatoes in another pot, with water to cover them by about 2 inches, and cook just until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork (don’t let them get mushy). Drain the potatoes, and let them cool briefly. Peel off the skins, and cut them in half lengthwise, then crosswise into ½-inch-thick half-rounds. Put the potato pieces in the salad bowl, and cover to keep them warm.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the eggplant and onions are fully cooked, gently lift them out of the poaching liquid with a spider or strainer, and lay them out on a tray or baking sheet in one layer. While the eggplant is still warm, scoop out the central clumps of seeds from the wedges, then cut them crosswise into 2-inch chunks. Separate the onion wedges, and then the layers. Put all the vegetable pieces—they should still be warm to the touch—in the bowl with the potatoes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To dress the salad: Drizzle the olive oil and remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar over the salad, sprinkle the salt on it, scatter in the shredded mint, and crumble the dried oregano over all.

  <p class="extract">A technique I have always liked, when preparing vegetables for a pasta dish, is to toss them in the pot with the pasta as it boils. Depending on which takes longer, I put the vegetable in first and then add the pasta, or vice versa. Either way, I believe this maximizes the flavor and nutritional value of the vegetables, and I know the pasta absorbs some of the vegetable flavor as they cook in the same water.</p>

  <p class="indent">I was glad to see this technique used frequently in preparing pasta dishes in Calabria, like this one, where orecchiette and arugula are cooked in the pot together before they are tossed with the other dressing vegetables, favas, and cherry tomatoes. Great to make in spring when fresh favas are in the market.</p>

  <p class="extract">As the name of this traditional dish suggests, it is made from the few ingredients available to a shepherd in remote pastures. Yet, in my experience, some of the best pasta sauces in Italy come from such a limited larder of ingredients. A fine example is this dressing for rigatoni, created with a bit of sausage, dried grating cheese, fresh ricotta, peperoncino, and fresh basil.

  <p class="extract">I love baked pastas of all kinds (as you probably know), as long as the <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em>, the cheese topping, is properly applied with a light touch, and baked sufficiently, so the cheese is deeply colored, melted, and perfectly crisp at the same time. This Calabrian baked cavatappi has two touches I particularly appreciate: a layer of sliced hard-cooked eggs inside (lending more taste and more protein), and an extra dimension of crunch from bread crumbs on top. You can enhance many other baked pasta recipes this way.</p>

  <p class="extract">In Calabria, as in other regions of southern Italy, there’s a general preference for dried pasta, even for baked stuffed pastas. Usually, stuffed pastas like canneloni or manicotti are formed from flat pieces of fresh pasta, topped with filling, and then rolled up to make the familiar tube shape. But with this recipe, you stuff pasta for baking as they do it in Calabria, using the dried tubular pasta called <em class="calibre4">paccheri;</em> first cook them just to soften, then spoon in a savory sausage-and-ricotta filling. Fill a big pan with the stuffed <em class="calibre4">paccheri</em>, drape them with tomato sauce and grated cheese, and bake.</p>

  <p class="indent">As with other baked pasta casseroles, you can multiply this recipe many times and make enough <em class="calibre4">schiaffettoni</em> to feed any size crowd. The individual <em class="calibre4">paccheri</em> can be stuffed and the big pan (or pans) fully assembled in advance; bake at the last minute, while your guests are being seated. And best of all, you know everyone will love it.</p>

  <p class="extract">It always pleases me when such a simple recipe can be so good. But every ingredient and every step must be perfect—the calamari, fresh; the olive oil, the best; and the pan must be hot for the quick cooking.</p>

  <p class="indent">I always prefer to buy whole calamari and clean them myself (you can see how easy it is to do in my book <em class="calibre4">Lidia’s Italian-American Kitchen</em>). I also like to leave the skin on the bodies, because it takes on a lovely color when cooked. However, now that squid are frequently sold already cleaned, which is a convenience, the body skin is usually peeled off as well. So, if you like the skin, as I do, ask the fishmonger at your market to leave it on. If that’s not possible, don’t worry: the dish tastes marvelous either way. (And if you are not a fan of squid, you could also prepare scallops, swordfish, or even a fillet of cod using this recipe.)</p>

Sear the calamari, turning several times, until the edges of the bodies and the tentacles are caramelized and crispy, about 2 minutes per batch.

  <p class="extract">As I wrote in this chapter’s introduction, the fishermen of Bagnara, a beautiful port on the Calabrian coast just north of the Strait of Messina, are renowned for their skill in catching the magnificent swordfish that migrate to this corner of the Tyrrhenian Sea every year. During our recent visit, I was not surprised to learn that the cooks of Bagnara are equally skilled when it comes to cooking <em class="calibre4">pesce spada</em> as well. The recipe I share with you here is among the simplest and best I have ever tasted, anywhere. Of course, as always in seafood cookery, the freshness of the fish is the key to success, so be sure to get swordfish at its absolute best.</p>

  <p class="extract">In these days when the choice of chicken dishes seems limited to variations of grilled chicken breast, this recipe is a refreshing departure. You butterfly (split open) a whole chicken, fill it with a savory stuffing, close the bird up again, and pan-roast it in a cast-iron skillet, creating a wonderful sauce at the same time. It is beautiful and bursting with flavor. And though the chicken is plump, the dish is light and fresh-tasting.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> Toothpicks; a 12-inch cast-iron pan with a domed cover; a wide spatula for flipping the chicken</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the giblets and any excess fat from the cavity of the chicken. Do not trim away extra skin, because you will need it to close up the stuffed chicken later. With the chicken breast up, slice along the neck cavity with the tip of a boning knife to find and expose the wishbone (or collarbone); loosen it and pull out. Turn the chicken over and, with a chef’s knife, cut forcefully from neck to tail along both sides of the backbone, freeing it from the body (and saving it, plus the other bones and giblets, to make stock, of course). Now, with the bird still on its breast, pull apart the split sides and fold them open like a book. With the boning knife, cut under and detach the ribs from the inside flaps of the torso; cut out the breastbone from the meat on both sides of the breast. Turn the chicken over, so the skin side is up, and press down on the now boneless breast to flatten the bird.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the stuffing: Put the the bread crumbs in a small bowl and stir in the chopped parsley, anchovies, lemon zest, nutmeg, cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of capers. Drizzle over it 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and toss all with a fork until the crumbs are evenly seasoned and moistened with oil.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Season the chicken all over with the salt. Lay it skin side down, spread open the body flaps (the legs and wings will be underneath them), spoon about two-thirds of the crumb stuffing into the center, and press it flat. Fold the flaps of torso closed, and bring them together in a tight seam, closing the gap where the backbone had been. This will bring the wings and legs together, too. To keep this package closed, draw loose skin from one side over the other side, at the neck and tail end of the seam, and pin them in place with toothpicks (wings will now be on top, and the stuffing will be enclosed).</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page339"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Next, carefully turn the chicken over, breast-skin side up. Starting at the neck, work your fingers under the skin, loosening it from the meat without tearing the skin or pulling it off the breast. Push the remaining crumb stuffing into this pocket, then rub the outside of the skin to spread and smooth the stuffing over the breast meat (under the skin). With toothpicks, pin the skin closed at the neck end and anyplace where the skin has come loose and the stuffing can leak out.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for a minute or two. When it’s hot, pour in the remaining olive oil, and carefully lay in the chicken breast side up. Cover the pan, and let the chicken cook and brown on the seam side, about 5 minutes. With a wide spatula and tongs, carefully lift and flip the chicken to cook breast side down. Replace the cover, and let it brown on that side for 5 minutes more.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the chicken over again (breast side up), and scatter the onions all around the bird, turning them on the pan bottom to coat them in oil. Put the cover back on, lower the heat, and cook slowly for about 40 minutes, until the onions are tender and the chicken has released all its fats and juices. Tilt the skillet, spoon off excess fat, and carefully flip the chicken once more—it should be breast down now. Raise the heat a bit, scatter in the remaining capers, and cook uncovered about 4 minutes, to brown the breast again.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the chicken for the last time, so it is breast up, pour in the lemon juice and vinegar, swirl them in the pan, and bring to a simmer. Put on the cover, lower the heat to maintain the simmer, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the chicken is very tender, the onions are soft and caramelized, and the juices have concentrated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Carefully lift out the chicken and slide it onto a cutting board. Let the bird rest for 5 to 10 minutes, remove the toothpicks, and cut it into serving pieces. Spoon onions and pan sauce from the warm skillet over each portion of chicken, and serve.</p>

  <p class="extract">Juicy pork chops, smothered with slowly cooked onions and topped with melted cheese, are certain to make mouths water. You can prepare these in advance—browning the chops and cooking the onions—then complete the skillet cooking and baking as your guests are seated.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, pour the olive oil in the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Shake excess flour from the chops, and lay them all in the skillet in one layer (depending on the size of your pan, you may have to snuggle them in). Gently brown the pork on the first side, about 4 minutes; turn the chops over, and brown the second side, another 4 minutes. Remove the chops to a plate and keep warm.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scatter the onions and garlic in the skillet, stir them around the pan, season with the remaining salt, and cover.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, if you’ll be finishing the dish right away, set a rack in the middle of the oven and heat it to 400°. Slice the provola in 6 or more thick slices about the size of the pork chops.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After the onions have cooked for 15 minutes or so, and are quite tender and colored with the pan scrapings, uncover, and push them all to one side of the skillet. Lay the pork chops back in, one at a time, spooning a layer of soft onions on the top of each chop. When they’re all in the pan, lay the provola slices over the onions.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Raise the heat, and when the meat is sizzling again, pour the wine into the skillet (in the spaces between the chops, not over them). Swirl the pan so the wine flows all through it, and bring to a boil. Sprinkle about a tablespoon of pecorino on each chop, then carefully move the skillet from the stove to the oven.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bake the chops for 10 minutes or so, until the cheese toppings are bubbly and crusty. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven, and let the chops rest in it for a few minutes. To serve, lift out each chop with a spatula, keeping the cheese topping intact, set it on a dinner plate, and spoon some of the skillet juices and onions around it.</p>

  <p class="extract">Throughout southern Italy, almond-stuffed figs are a traditional holiday treat, made in every household to offer visiting family and friends. Makes sense for a region that historically had little wealth, and where figs and almonds were abundant and always stored for winter use. Figs and almonds are also a naturally delicious pairing, in my opinion. Though it is not fancy, a dried fig with a single toasted almond tucked into it is transformed into a delicious sweet.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Calabria, though, the preparation of stuffed figs, <em class="calibre4">fichi ripieni</em>, is not always so simple. The region’s figs are prized for their excellence, both fresh and dried. And especially in the northern province of Calabria—in the area of Sibari, where figs grow best—they’re stuffed in all sorts of ways, with different nuts, spices, sweetenings, cocoa, or candied fruits. All of these flavorful ingredients are mixed together to make the stuffing for <em class="calibre4">fichi ripieni alla Sibarita</em>, figs stuffed Sibari-style, considered one of Calabria’s signature dishes. There are many versions of this classic. In most, the figs are baked after stuffing, usually with <em class="calibre4">saba</em> (cooked grape must) or other syrup. Sometimes the figs are then packed in some preserving medium for long storage and more flavor, such as <em class="calibre4">saba</em>, spiced sugar, or sweetened liquor. My version is really a dessert, best served right away. The stuffed figs are baked in a pool of pomegranate and lemon juice, which concentrates in the oven into a luscious thick syrup that I drizzle over the warm figs. It’s a great dessert anytime of year, but particularly during the holidays it has the spirit of an old Italian custom.</p>

Pour the pomegranate juice, lemon juice, and ½ cup sugar into the baking dish, and whisk together until the sugar dissolves.

Fold open each fig like a book, exposing the cut surfaces, and top each half with a spoonful of the nut stuffing. Press the stuffing into the fruit interior, so it sticks and stays, then place the open fig in the baking dish, with the stuffing on top, resting in the juice on the bottom. Stuff all the figs this way, and arrange them in the dish.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Tent the baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil, arching it so it doesn’t touch the stuffing, and pressing it against the sides. Bake the figs for 20 minutes, until the juice is bubbling and the figs are softened, then remove the foil, and bake another 35 to 40 minutes, basting the figs two or three times with the juice, until the figs are caramelized and tender and the juice has reduced to a syrup. Let the figs cool in the baking dish for at least 5 minutes before serving warm, or leave them to serve later at room temperature. Put three or four figs for each serving on a dessert plate or in a bowl, and drizzle some of the pan syrup over them.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the cookie dough: Sift or stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Crack the eggs into the mixer bowl, and add the sugar. Start the mixer on low speed, and beat until blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, increase to medium speed, and beat for a couple of minutes, until the sugar and eggs are pale yellow and fluffy; beat in the lemon zest and vanilla.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and dump in the flour mixture all at once. Mix on low speed to form a crumbly dough. Increase to medium speed, drizzle in the olive oil in a slow, steady stream, and beat until the dough forms a ball. Stop the machine, spill in the sliced almonds, and mix on low for just a few seconds, to incorporate the nuts.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough into two pieces. Roll each piece into a log about 2 inches thick and 12 inches long. Arrange the logs on the parchment-lined baking sheet, and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile (or later, when you’re ready to bake the cookies), arrange a rack in the center of the oven, and heat to 350°. Bake the sheet of chilled logs for about 40 minutes, until the dough is lightly colored and set, rotating the sheet front to back during baking to ensure even cooking. With a long metal spatula, transfer the logs to wire racks, and let them cool for about 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the second baking, have the oven at 350°. Slice the dough logs on a cutting board with the serrated knife, cutting diagonally to form oval biscotti about ⅓ inch thick. Lay the cookies flat in rows on the baking sheet (lined with the same parchment paper), and set it in the oven.</p>

Return the sheet to the oven (rotated back to front), and bake another 7 minutes or so, until the cookies are crisp, crunchy, and golden. Transfer them to wire racks, and let them cool completely before serving. Store biscotti in an airtight container lined with wax paper; they will keep 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

  <p class="extract">Here’s another sweet that, like figs stuffed with almonds, is usually made around the holidays. It is simply a caramel syrup with sesame seeds stirred in, poured onto a counter to cool in a thin layer, and cut into bite-sized candies. A smooth, nonporous surface like marble, granite, or stainless steel is best for the cooling; avoid porous wooden surfaces or Formica.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A rimmed baking sheet; a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan; pastry brush and sturdy metal spatula; parchment or wax paper</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Preheat oven to 350°. Spread the sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet, and place it in the oven. Toast the seeds until light golden, shaking them on the baking sheet occasionally, about 8 minutes. Let the seeds cool on the sheet.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the sugar, honey, butter, and 2 teaspoons water in the saucepan, and set it over medium-low heat. Stir with a wooden spoon frequently as the butter melts and the sugar dissolves and the syrup comes to a boil. Simmer until the syrup is a deep-caramel color, about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, brush a nonporous work surface (such as granite or stainless steel) with olive oil; coat the metal spatula with olive oil as well. When the caramel is done, turn off the heat, and stir in the sesame seeds, almonds, citrus zests, and cinnamon. Pour (and scrape) the molten candy from the pan onto the work surface, and quickly spread it into an even rectangular layer, about ½ inch thick. Allow it to cool and firm up for a minute or two, to firm up but not harden.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With a serrated knife and a straight edge, slice the sheet of candy into 1-inch strips. Then cut diagonal slices 1 inch apart. Divide the strips into diamond-shaped pieces. With a metal spatula separate the pieces, and arrange them in a single layer, not touching, on trays lined with parchment or wax paper, and let them harden completely. Store them in an airtight container with parchment or wax paper between the layers.</p>
