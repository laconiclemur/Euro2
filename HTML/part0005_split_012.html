			<p class="rec-intro">Challans ducks are from the Vendée area of France and are well known for their wonderful flavour and tender flesh, but you can use any good-quality duck. This is a much-loved dish at Le Gavroche and an adaptation of the richer version that was on the menu in the seventies and eighties (opposite). The new recipe, with the meat served with delicate vegetables and a light consommé, has echoes of Asian cookery and is light and fragrant.</p>

			<p class="body">Peel the turnips and carrots, then trim and turn them into large barrel shapes (see <a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes">here</a>). Wash the leeks and trim the white parts into 4 pieces the same size as the turnips. Set the prepared vegetables aside for later and keep all the trimmings.</p>
			<p class="body">Remove the wishbone and winglets from the duck and season the cavity. Wrap the duck up tightly in a tea towel or muslin cloth, then tie it tightly with string – like a parcel. </p>
			<p class="body">Place the duck in a deep pot with all the vegetable trimmings, the celery, herbs, garlic and spices, then add the stock and just enough water to cover by 5cm. Season with salt and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to barely a tremble. It’s very important to keep the liquid at simmering point because the stock will then remain clear. If you allow the stock to boil it will become murky. Turn the duck 2 or 3 times, skim the surface well and leave to cook for 1 hour and 45 minutes. When the cooking time is up, leave the duck to cool in the liquid until hand hot – this should take about 45 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Carefully remove the duck. The stock should be clear and should not need clarifying – just pass it gently through a fine sieve. Ladle some of the stock into a clean pan, bring it to a simmer and add the turnips, carrots and leeks that you prepared earlier. </p>
			<p class="body">Carve the duck which should be so tender you can spoon it off the bones. Serve the meat, white and dark, in deep bowls with the vegetables and stuffed cabbage (see overleaf), then ladle in some stock, sprinkled with a little tarragon and chervil. I also serve this with sauce Albert and pear chutney (see overleaf) on the side.</p>

			<p class="body">Blanch the cabbage leaves in salted, boiling water, then drain them and refresh them in cold water. Blitz the chicken breast and egg white together in a food processor, then press the mixture through a fine sieve. Tip the mixture into a bowl set over ice, beat in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Fold in the diced foie gras and herbs. </p>
			<p class="body">Divide the mixture between the 4 blanched cabbage leaves and wrap them in cling film, trimming off any excess leaf. Steam the stuffed leaves over a pan of simmering water for 8–10 minutes until cooked through, then remove the cling film before serving.</p>
			<p class="alt-head"><a id="sauce-albert" class="calibre4"></a>sauce albert</p>
			<p class="body">Put the horseradish and stock in a saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the cream and cook for a further 5 minutes. If you prefer a smooth sauce, pass it through a fine sieve. Add the crumbs and seasoning, simmer for 5 minutes until dissolved and creamy in consistency. Mix the egg yolk with the mustard and then whisk this into the sauce.</p>
			<p class="alt-head"><a id="pear-chutney" class="calibre4"></a>pear chutney</p>
			<p class="body">Put the sugar in a large, thick-based, non-aluminium saucepan and add the apple, onion, orange rind, juice, salt, ginger, spices and vinegar. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until thick and syrupy. </p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, peel, core and roughly chop the pears. Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 15 seconds, then refresh them in ice-cold water. Peel the tomatoes, cut them in half and remove the seeds, then chop the tomato flesh. Add the pears, tomatoes and sultanas to the saucepan and simmer until the pears are tender. </p>
			<p class="body">Pour the chutney into sterilised glass jars and seal while hot. Store in a cool, dark place or in the fridge for up to 6 months. If you are planning to make the duck dish it’s best to prepare the chutney at least a few days ahead if you can. It’s a great chutney to have in your kitchen and it goes well with all kinds of boiled meats. </p>
