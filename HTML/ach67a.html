<p class="noindentb">Believe it or not, the Tucci family would actually cook pasta at picnics! My father remembers setting out early in the morning, having loaded my grandfather’s truck with food, beer, wine, bocce balls, and musical instruments. “Once we had secured our favorite spot we would build a fire,” recalls Stan. “A large cauldron would be filled with water and placed on the fire. Once it came to a boil we would cook the pasta—enough for up to thirty people.” But you don’t need to go camping to make this flavorful sauce.</p>
