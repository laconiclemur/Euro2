<p class="author1"><span class="txit">grissini</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Using a pasta machine to make these bread sticks guarantees they will be of uniform width and will make them easy to roll out. Of course they may also be made by rolling sections of the dough on a floured surface and then cutting them into long, thin strips. Bread sticks that are twisted into shapes or that are more than <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch wide will take slightly longer to bake.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cups warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup semolina flour, plus extra for dusting</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons grappa or vodka</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Stir the yeast and sugar in a 2-cup measuring cup. Stir in the warm water and set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl or on a clean work surface, mix the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, salt, and rosemary. Mound the mixture, and make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture, olive oil, and grappa to the well. Using a fork at first and then your hands, gradually blend the flour mixture into the wet ingredients. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until it is smooth and not sticky. Place in a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a clean dish towel. Set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F. Dust several baking sheets with semolina flour and set them aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_85"/><span class="red">4.</span> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into six equal pieces. Flatten one piece to the width of the pasta machine opening. Lightly flour the dough and pass it through the widest opening of the machine to produce a flat 12-inch-long piece of dough. Lightly flour the dough again and pass it through the wide noodle setting to create individual strands of dough. Arrange them <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch apart on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat this procedure with the remaining pieces of dough. Bake until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn and continue baking until evenly brown, about 5 minutes more. Allow to cool on wire racks before serving or storing in an airtight container.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> If you’d like to serve an assortment of flavored bread sticks, divide the risen dough into quarters, setting one quarter aside to be baked as in the basic recipe. To one of the remaining quarters add <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup finely grated Parmesan or cheddar cheese. To another quarter add 1 teaspoon chopped fresh herbs such as sage, thyme, oregano, or marjoram. To the last quarter add 1 teaspoon olive paste. Knead each quarter well to incorporate these ingredients. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before passing through the pasta machine.</p>
