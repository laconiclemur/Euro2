They are kept in a refrigerator and cooked just before consumption. If you study the official list of Polish sausages you will notice that there is only one fresh sausage called “White Sausage.” In the USA most sausages are of fresh variety as they will be either fried for breakfast or grilled outside. In Poland sausages were invariably smoked and processed in such a way that they will last long time at room temperature.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Fresh sausages are the easiest to make and you can make any sausage presented in the book (except head cheeses, liver and blood sausages) by stuffing ground meat into casings and storing it in a refrigerator. Then cook the sausage before consumption. Of course the sausage will have a useful life of just a few days. If you look at the recipe for White Sausage you will find out that Polish Smoked Sausage and White Sausage are composed of the same meats and spices and what separates them is a different manufacturing process. </span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00035.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 9.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> White sausage.</span></p><p class="calibre_14" id="filepos682137"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_66">White Sausage </span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_66">(Kiełbasa biała surowa) </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_67"><a href="part0007.html#filepos323581"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_68"><span class="underline">Back to Recipe Index</span></span></span></a></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">During Easter Holiday White Sausage can be found on every dining table and is traditionally served with soup called “zurek”.
