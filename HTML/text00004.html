 The Elements of a <em>Supra</em>
</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Before you start cooking any of the recipes from this book, it is important to understand the ethos and intention behind a traditional Georgian</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 . <strong>One thing that I have struggled with when writing these recipes is dictating how many people each recipe will serve. This is because traditionally each of these dishes is just a small part of a never-ending conveyor belt of delicious dishes that are served at a groaning table during a meal that lasts many hours. If you have prepared a couple of starters(appetizers), a main course and a side dish, then you should have more than enough food to serve 4–6 people. If you’ve decided to go the whole hog and invite all of your friends and family, then you need to fill the table with small dishes that people can graze on over the course of the evening, refilling empty dishes as you go. This may sound like a lot of work (and it is), but many traditional Georgian dishes, especially the cold salads, use walnut paste as a base, so making up a big batch is a great starting point. The salads can also be made ahead and left in the fridge until an hour or so before you want to serve them, taking the pressure off the host when it comes to getting the meal on the table. Preparing ahead not only relieves some of the pressure on the cook, but also allows the flavours of the fragrant spices (coriander, marigold and fenugreek) that are synonymous with Georgian cuisine time to meld and develop.</strong>

<strong>Georgian hospitality is legendary the world over and</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 <strong>is at the centre of this generosity of spirit. When hosting a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 , <strong>you are sharing everything you have — your home, your food, your wine, but also conversation.</strong>
 <em>Supra</em>
 <strong>is a coming together over food, but also a meeting of minds and ideas, and central to this is the</strong>
 <em>tamada</em>
 .</p>

 The <em>Tamada</em>
</h3>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Every</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 <strong>is led by a</strong>
 <em>tamada</em>
 <strong>or toastmaster. This is not necessarily the host but someone chosen by the group who is known for their gregarious nature, quick wit and intelligence. It is the job of the</strong>
 <em>tamada</em>
 <strong>to lead both the toasts and conversation at a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 . <strong>The toasts at a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 <strong>will always start with a toast to Georgia itself, with the toastmaster thanking the land for its bounty and the food at the table. Other speeches will focus on the guests at the table and family and friends now deceased. Only the</strong>
 <em>tamada</em>
 <strong>can propose a toast, but other guests are encouraged to respond with their own toasts which can take the form of traditional speeches, jokes, songs or poems. Guests are encouraged to drain their wine glasses with each speech (although this is by no means compulsory), which can lead to good-natured ribbing of the</strong>
 <em>tamada</em>
 <strong>as the evening develops.</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>When I was a child, I have to admit that I found the speeches boring. While the toastmaster was speaking we had to be quiet, which is a struggle for a small child with a lot to say, and I did not always understand what was being discussed. However, as I grew up I came to love and appreciate these speeches and believe that the thoughts and ideas shared within them helped to shape who I am. It is rare in this day and age that the young take the time to listen to the wisdom of their elders, and I cherish these memories and what they gave me.</strong>
</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Procession of Dishes</h3>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Simple salads are the first thing at the table, often laid out before your guests sit down. As well as these, the table will have plates of radishes, tomatoes, salty cheeses and plain bread for people to eat. These salads are never cleared and are refilled as the meal progresses, but successive waves of food are then added to the table. Smaller hot dishes follow cold ones, and then</strong>
 <em>Khachapuri</em>
 <strong>(breads, see <a href="text00008.html#page_78">here</a>
 ) are served. These breads are very filling, so it is best to warn those who are unfamiliar with this style of eating that there is more food to come! Meat and vegetable dishes follow and there are always bowls of</strong>
 <em>Tkemali</em>
 <strong>(Plum Sauce, see <a href="text00005.html#page_22">here</a>
 ) and</strong>
 <em>Ajika</em>
 <strong>(chilli pastes, see <a href="text00005.html#page_28">here</a>
 ) at every table so that people can spice their food themselves. Dessert tends to be simpler, but a cake or</strong>
 <em>Pelamushi</em>
 <strong>(Grape Jellies, see <a href="text00013.html#page_200">here</a>
 ) is often served to close the meal.</strong>

 Wine</h3>
<p class="para1">
<strong>It is a matter of pride for a Georgian host that none of their guests has a glass that is more than half empty. Wine is central to a traditional Georgian feast and it is easy to see why — the history of Georgia and the history of wine are intertwined. Georgia is said to be the first place in the world that grapes where cultivated to make wine. Centuries of experience have refined the processes, but traditional wine in Georgia is made in much the same way as it always has been. If you are attending a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 <strong>in the countryside, the chances are that your hosts make their own wine which will be a source of great pride to them. Homemade wine is stored in large clay vessels called</strong>
 <em>qvevri</em>
 <strong>and if the wine at the table never seems to run out, the chances are that it is being drawn from one of these throughout the evening. Georgian wine is gaining popularity the world over and can easily be sourced from a good wine shop or online if you want to serve something really authentic at your feast.</strong>
</p>
<h3 class="h3">Music</h3>
<p class="para">
<strong>Georgian music and songs are central to a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 <strong>and, like the toasts, songs to God, peace, the motherland, long life, love, friendship and other topics are proposed. The whole table will join in with the singing and renditions often get louder and more boisterous as more wine is consumed. Often dancing and the playing of instruments accompanies the singing and guests will bring their instruments to dinner for this purpose. At Little Georgia, we often play music by these artists and you can easily find their songs to listen to at home: Hamlet Gonashvili, Debi Ishxnelebi, Inola Gurgulia, the Tsisperi Trio, Kelaptari and Quintet Urmuli</strong>
