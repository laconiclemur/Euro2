<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE TOPPING</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 large Spanish onions (about 2 pounds), cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">12 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="qun">About 12 black olives, such as Kalamata, pitted or not</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE DOUGH</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup water</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="qun">About 3⅓ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun1">½ egg white, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="recsum">Cook the onions in the oil in a wide skillet, covered, over low heat for 40 minutes, until very soft and beginning to color, stirring and turning them often. Uncover 10 minutes before the end, and add a little salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, for the dough, beat the eggs vigorously with a fork in a large bowl. Gradually beat in the oil and water, then the salt and baking soda. Add the flour a little at a time, mixing it in first with the fork and then with your hands, adding only just enough to make a soft, smooth dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Roll the dough out into a large thin rectangle, and line a lightly greased 12-by-16-inch baking sheet with it. Pinch and lift the dough slightly around the edges and brush the top with the egg white. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 10 minutes to seal the crust and prevent it from getting soggy.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Spread the topping all over the dough, and arrange the anchovies and olives on top. Bake for another 30 minutes, or until the pastry around the edges is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">To make this with store-bought puff pastry, use a 17¼-ounce package (2 sheets) of pastry. Roll each piece out as thin as you can on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, and transfer to an oiled 16-by-12-inch baking sheet. Brush the tops with the egg white and bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden. (The pastry will flatten when you spread the topping on it.) Spread the onions evenly over the pastry, and arrange the anchovy fillets and olives on top.</p>
