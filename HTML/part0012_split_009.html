  <h3 class="h3a">Roast pork loin with honey and walnuts</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Pork loin is a popular cut for roasting. You can buy it on the bone, with the loin ribs attached, or boneless and tied with string to keep it together. In this recipe I have wrapped pancetta over a boneless joint to keep the pork moist during cooking; the addition of onion, walnuts and honey gives this dish its delicious flavour.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">850g/1lb 14oz boneless pork loin joint</p>

  <p class="ing1">extra virgin olive oil, to grease</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 slices of pancetta or streaky bacon</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz walnuts</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp runny honey</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing2">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup hot <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/gas mark 2.</p>

  <p class="para">Grease a roasting tin with a little olive oil and add the pork. Rub the pork all over with salt and pepper and arrange slices of pancetta over the meat side of the joint. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the onion and walnuts to the roasting tin and brush the honey over the meat. Continue to cook for another 1½ hours, basting with the juices from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven, put the meat on a board and set aside. Put the roasting tin on a medium heat, add the wine and stir with a wooden spoon until the wine has evaporated. Stir in the hot stock and reduce by half, until the sauce has thickened slightly. Slice the meat and arrange on a serving dish, pour over the sauce and serve.</p>
