<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">B</span></span><span class="italic">read and fire are inseparable. Bologna folklorist Piero Camporesi speaks of fire being at the heart of all food traditions. In peasant houses it rarely went out. Fire was too precious. The light beat back dark, and with it the evil associated with darkness. Darkness brought fear. Darkness was winter, when little grew, and winter meant cold. Fire was the warmth that kept life and nourished it. The hearth was the heart of the house, with its tall chimney linking the house and those who lived within it to the sky and to heaven</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Even embers were important. They gave nourishment. Chestnuts, beets, onions, potatoes, and field corn all cooked in the dying fire. Covered pots of food were buried to bake in the hot coals. Embers heated tiles for <span class="underline">Tigelle</span> bread, pans for <span class="underline">Borlengo,</span> and griddles for <span class="underline">Piadina.</span> Old people read fortunes in the embers and cinders. And people speak of the old peasant women who heard messages from heaven as winds moaned through the chimney</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">For peasants the oven was a magical place, because it was here that food went from raw to cooked. They believed the same spirits that made bread rise so mysteriously also coagulated milk and fermented wine. Camporesi says those elfin spirits are part of Emilia-Romagna’s Celtic heritage, buried deep in her civilization from long before the invasion of the ancient Romans</span>.</p>
<a id="page358"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">What mystery bread must have been. In a pretechnological world, the rising of round loaves was associated with the sun rising in the sky, Christ rising to heaven, a woman’s belly growing with child, with the oven becoming the womb. Going into the oven was passage. Bread dough passed through the entrance into the oven and changed forever</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Today the oven is still set apart, singled out. In the towns and villages of Emilia-Romagna, the sign marking bread shops reads <span class="underline">“forno”</span> (“oven”). There is no sign announcing “bakery.” And while pastry and pasta makers take their titles from what they produce, often the man who bakes bread is not called a baker. He is <span class="underline">il forno,</span> “the oven.” It is almost as though he is a part of the bread instead of its master</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The oven was the center of village life. Until the 1950s, many homes lacked ovens. The village baker made many people’s bread, and they used his oven for their lasagne, savory pies, and sweet tarts</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although most of Emilia-Romagna’s breads are baked in ovens, some of her most unusual ones come from home hearths. In Romagna the crisp flatbread, <span class="underline">Piadina,</span> is still baked on griddles over hot coals</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Modena’s hills have <span class="underline">Borlengo</span>—brittle and semi-transparent, cooked in shallow sauté pans over embers. Little round <span class="underline">Tigelle</span> bake between hot terra-cotta discs set on hearthstones. Twenty miles away these breads are unknown</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The region’s different breads are usually highly localized. Bread itself, or merely its name, changes from place to place. Throughout Emilia bread doughs are fried into fritters. In the mountains chestnut flour becomes part of the fritter dough, while on the plain sometimes ricotta is added</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">During the Renaissance Ferrara’s ducal court produced the region’s most intricately sculpted bread, the Couple, or <span class="underline">Coppia.</span> Baked in an oven, it was made of expensive white flour, enriched with oil or lard and rolled into fanciful shapes. Throughout the region shapes change and the dough alters, but today this former bread of nobility is eaten by everyone</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In old documents, bread was either constantly praised or damned. Laws regulated its production, writers judged it, and peasants rioted for it. For rich and poor, it was the single most important food. Lauded for its purity, Parma’s white bread of the 16th century was saluted with a saying considered old even then, “A good meal has the bread of Parma and the wine of Correggio.”</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Camporesi talks of how shapes were symbols of the forces of nature. Crescent-shaped breads were eaten at funerals, symbolizing the moon and rebirth. Round breads like <span class="underline">Spianata</span> and so many others originated as pre-Christian sun symbols, rising again to bring warmth and growth</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Seeds, nuts and fruits in breads signify potency and fruitfulness. The long <span class="underline">Penza</span> breads of Bologna swell with diced candied fruits like a penis swells with seed. There is the maleness of the long baguette, a shape common to so many places. The bread grows before entering the oven. Raisins in breads that rise were seen as seeds in the mother’s swelling belly. How female is the bread oven itself, with its small opening and domed interior. It is the place of warmth, where bread is transformed before emerging as a completed being, like a child. Bread not only supported life; it was life</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When the elderly Guatelli brothers in Parma’s farm country make their weekly bread, they continue the ritual of every baker in the area. They bless the flour by tracing into it a cross enclosed in a circle. Historian Guglielmo Capacchi explains that the making of the symbol may be Christian today, but it originated as old magic and a pagan rite long before Christ</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In Modena, food historian Renato Bergonzini remembers how his grandmother saved a piece of dough from one day’s baking for leavening the next. As she put the dough in a bowl, she cut a cross into it and <a id="page360"/>blessed herself. Renato was forbidden to touch it. But of course he did. He was fascinated by the living thing, and would lift the towel to take a peek. He said it was fantastical to a little boy, because the cross grew into a flower</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The Guatelli still mix, knead, and raise bread in their family’s bread cupboard, or <span class="underline">madia.</span> Throughout the region, even the poorest of homes had this chest of drawers or cupboard topped with a covered trough. Here the bread was mixed, left to rise, and after baking, was stored</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Bergonzini recalls the time when his mother first added yeast to the bread. Before that the only leavening was dough saved from the last baking. After the advent of commercial yeast, the bread was never the same again. This sentiment is echoed by many home and professional bakers today. And many still use the old method</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The dough taken from one loaf to raise another keeps bread alive, continuously joining new loaves to those that came before. Flour, of course, is another constant. Since before the time of Christ, white flour, sifted free of bran and coarse fiber, has been highly prized. Sophocles praised Italy’s wheat: “Favored Italy grows white with hoary wheat.” Pliny, writing 2,000 years ago, called Italian wheat among the best in the world, the whitest and the heaviest in weight</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">White flour was potent with meaning. Whiteness was God, pure, genuine—and expensive. Ferrara’s white flour gained fame for its silky texture and purity of color. But poor crops and famine often made white flour an elusive commodity. In 15th-century Ferrara, even when harvests were plentiful, only the wealthy used white flour. The populace’s bread was made from one third ground fava beans and two thirds coarse-ground wheat. Or they baked a blend of barley, rye, millet, spelt, and sorghum. And when famine struck, the aristocracy usurped the bread of the people as their own, leaving the populace to loaves made from ground acorns and even tree bark</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">For the people of the plain, dark bread was for the less affluent. In the mountains, where little wheat grew, dark bread was even more prevalent. As little as a generation ago, mountain people made bread with home-ground flour, still flecked with bran and germ. For many today, those dark and fragrant breads are fond memories far more nurturing to both body and spirit than the elegant white loaves now available to all</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The recipes in this chapter express the range and variety of Emilia-Romagna’s breads. Although not every one of the region’s loaves is included, each type is represented: hearth cakes, pan breads, fritters and flatbreads, the elegant Couple bread, and a dark wheaten loaf created from the childhood memories of women who grew up in Modena’s mountains. Most of these breads are best eaten with other foods. Ferrara’s Couple bread could accompany any savory dish in this book. It is typical of the crusty, neutral-flavored white breads served throughout the region with antipasti, first dishes, and second courses. Its blandness is purposeful. Many in Emilia-Romagna believe that a bread of big or assertive flavors fights with the complex and often robust tastes of their savory dishes</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic"><span class="underline">Tigelle, Spianata</span>, and <span class="underline">Piadina</span>, on the other hand, are snack breads, usually eaten with toppings or fillings. Although <span class="underline">Tigelle</span> and Sp<span class="underline">ianata</span> often appear also as antipasti, I always think of these three, along with the unusual <span class="underline">Borlengo</span>, as Emilia-Romagna’s Sunday-night breads. These are the snacks that become suppers for family and friends after a day of visiting and feasting on a big afternoon meal</span>.</p>
<a id="page362"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In this country, we might serve them at informal gatherings. Invite everyone into the kitchen, where they can scoop up the breads hot from baking, then help themselves to fillings and toppings. Each recipe offers menu suggestions and specific recommendations for accompaniments. Those suggestions also guide the cook in serving Emilia’s favorite street food, her fritters of batter or bread dough</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">These snack breads can become the heart and soul of a meal. Bring out a few vegetables, slices of salami, or a little cheese—and know that served exactly this way, these breads often sustained and nourished much of Emilia-Romagna</span>.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Making Bread: Some Guidelines</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Feeling bread come alive under our hands is such pleasure. It relaxes and comforts, while linking us to those basic forces that have touched bread bakers for centuries. Bread is the most forgiving of foods. As long as the yeast is alive, the bread will survive. Use these guidelines to ensure success every time:</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Build bread around your life, not your life around your bread. Slow risings fit easily into busy schedules and are the key to breads with full, mellow flavor.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I often make the sponge in the evening. (Usually a blend of all the yeast, liquid, and a part of the flour, the sponge ripens before being kneaded into the final bread dough.) The next morning I knead the sponge together with the rest of the ingredients and then leave it to rise for the rest of the day.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Even if a recipe instructs to “let rise 2 hours, or until doubled,” leaving the dough for a few extra hours only deepens the bread’s flavor. In the evening I shape the loaf, let it rise again, and bake it. The last rise is crucial. If the loaf overrises, the bread will be heavy. Deal with overrising by simply punching down the dough and letting it rise again, until it does not spring back when poked with a finger.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Always check the date on the yeast package to make sure it is active. I prefer granulated yeast from the health food store, and I always store it in the freezer. Do not expose yeast to temperatures over about 110°F. And do not use fast-rising yeasts in these recipes. They may offer speed, but they sacrifice the mature flavor vital to most of these breads.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Do use organic stone-ground flours. Their vitality adds much to breads. Store them in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Weighing ingredients gives the easiest and most accurate measure. Just pour the flour onto a scale, and there you are. One measuring cup of flour can vary from 3 to 6 ounces, depending upon how the cup is filled. My 4-ounce cup, called for in <a id="page363"/>all these recipes, comes from spooning flour into a measuring cup and leveling it, without tamping or tapping. But even this method is not foolproof. If your flour is packed down in the sack, if the weather is humid, or if you spoon down deeper than I do, the measurement might be off. Weighing is the surest method. When working in very damp conditions, weigh out an additional ounce for every 8 ounces of flour.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> The sponge is traditional for most yeast breads. Sponges deepen flavors and come from the days when dough from the previous baking was the leavening agent. If you bake regularly, you might want to try the yeastless baking of long ago:</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Take about 1½ cups of the dough from a yeast bread, such as <span class="italic">Spianata</span> or Modena Mountain Bread. Blend in ½ cup water, cover the bowl, and store it in a cool place or in the refrigerator. Within a week, use a cup as the sponge for your next loaf, saving a piece of that finished dough for leavening the next baking. Beat the piece of dough into the leftover chilled dough and keep cool. Do not use this technique with doughs high in butter, eggs, or sugar.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">N<span class="italic">o other Ferrara food is as striking as her famous Couple bread. These single-serving breads are fashioned as long, leggy crosses, their four twirled “legs” resembling slender unicorn horns. Baking turns the Couple golden and creates a white bread of almost all crust. You break off pieces and eat them as you would a breadstick, with dishes from antipasto through the second course. The bread’s flavor is neutral, some even say bland, making it the ideal partner for Ferrara’s savory dishes. Translating as “the Couple” (<span class="underline">ciupeta</span> in Ferrara dialect; <span class="underline">coppia</span> in Italian), the bread and its unique shape spread to Modena and Bologna. Breads almost identical in flavor but shaped differently are eaten throughout Emilia-Romagna</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">This recipe combines one from Ferrarese Luisa Picchietti and one from the Perdonati bakery in Ferrara.

<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/365.jpg"/></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Sponge:</span> Start the sponge 18 to 24 hours before baking the bread. In a mixing bowl or food processor bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of the flour, the yeast, and the 3½ tablespoons warm water. Allow 5 minutes for the yeast to bubble. Next, blend in the ¼ cup water (cold water if you are using a food processor, at 110°F if you are using an electric mixer or hand beating), olive oil, salt, and the rest of the ¾ cup of flour. Process or beat 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the moist dough is very elastic. Turn into a large bowl, and seal the top with plastic wrap. Set aside at room temperature 18 to 24 hours. It will rise, looking blistered and bubbly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Mixing the Dough:</span> Put a spoonful of the flour in a bowl large enough for mixing the dough. Blend in the yeast and ¼ cup of the warm water. Let the mixture stand 5 minutes, or until the yeast is bubbly. Meanwhile, mix the flours and salt together in another bowl. Stir in the sponge, the rest of the water, the oil, lard or butter, and half the flour/salt mixture. Blend, using a heavy-duty electric mixer (about 3 minutes) or a food processor (about 30 seconds), until the dough is very elastic.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Work in the remaining flour mixture, switching to the dough hook if you are using an electric mixer. The dough should be lumpy and somewhat sticky. Knead the dough 5 minutes. If the dough is still sticky, work in another 1 to 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour. Resume kneading another 5 minutes. The dough will smooth out, lose some of its stickiness, and become elastic.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">First Rising:</span> Place the dough in an oiled bowl and seal the top with plastic wrap. Let it rise 4 hours, or until doubled in bulk, at room temperature.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Shaping:</span> Divide the dough into six balls. Roll each one out to form a thin 8-inch square. Cut each square diagonally, forming two triangles. Use a rolling pin to elongate the top of each triangle. Then thin and extend the two side points. Starting at the wide base of each triangle, roll it up tightly, leaving about 2½ inches of the tip unrolled. They will look like long, thin, tightly twirled crescent rolls.</p>
<a id="page366"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Make the Couple shape by turning the crescents so the two long flaps are facing away from each other, and the crescents arch away from each other starting at their centers. Pinch the unrolled tips together at their bases, along the line where they join the crescents. Then fold the tips away from each other, tucking their ends under to make two side-by-side hollow cylinders between the joined crescents. Push two fingers down into the center where the two cylinders meet. Pinch the cylinders together so they resemble two number 8’s sitting side by side.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Second Rising:</span> Grease two large or three standard baking sheets with the 2 tablespoons of butter, and arrange the breads on them. Cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest at room temperature 50 minutes. The breads will not rise perceptibly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking and Serving:</span> Preheat the oven to 325°F. Bake 10 minutes. Raise the heat to 350°F, and bake 30 minutes. Raise the temperature again to 375°F, and bake 5 to 10 minutes, or until light golden brown and very crisp. Cool the breads on a rack. The Couple is always served at room temperature.</p>
<div class="bibliography"><p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span></span> <span class="bold">Menu:</span> This bread, in this or simpler forms, is traditionally served with all the region’s savory dishes. Ferrara specialties are Domed Maccheroni Pie, Spaghetti with Anchovies and Melting Onions, Cappellacci with Sweet Squash, Rice of the Princes, Riccardo Rimondi’s Chicken Cacciatora, and Rabbit Roasted with Sweet Fennel.</p>

<div class="box"><hr/>
<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Bread of Life</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">It is impossible to resist speculating how the Couple came to have this singular shape. Some say it is the cross of Christianity. For others, the form is both male and female, depicting the anatomy of both sexes. Few in Ferrara can pinpoint its beginnings. Until the 13th century, breads there were either long or round. A document from 1287 mentions a decorative loaf, but gives no details of its shape. In the mid-1500s Christaforo di Messisbugo described each place setting at the banquets he arranged for the Cardinal d’Este in Ferrara as having a <span class="italic">pane intorto</span>, or twisted or bent bread. This sounds closer to the Couple’s present-day shape. Perhaps no single baker invented the Couple. It may be a combination of symbols, some pre-Christian, and possibly coming from sources far from Ferrara. Many cultures depict bread as part of elemental life forces. Yeast comes to life; dough rises, falls, and rises again. The oven’s nurturing warmth transforms the dough into food. It is easy to imagine the link with male/female, pregnancy, birth, and life. The Couple’s strong visual statement is unmistakable.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A “Joke” of a Bread</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Three hilltowns, Zocca, Vignola, and Guiglia, vie for the honor of being the true home of <span class="italic">Borlengo</span>. But it is perhaps Guiglia that has the strongest claim. The story of <span class="italic">Borlengo</span>’s beginnings goes back to a time long ago, when mountain lords clashed with great regularity. The old castle at Guiglia was ruled by Ugolino, a lord famous for his table. When his enemies laid siege, cutting off all food supplies, no one could imagine how Ugolino could continue to do battle. Fortunately the castle did have a large supply of flour. Bread and pasta doughs were continuously watered down. Finally thinned to batter, the transparent sheets were baked over fires to keep the troops fed. <span class="italic">Borlengo</span>, from the root <span class="italic">burla</span>, meaning “joke” in local dialect, was truly a joke of a bread, but the joke was on Ugolino’s attackers. Another theory claims that <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> was born as the food of the poor. The oldest recipes call for only flour and water, with no expensive egg. Almost everyone had a fire, water, and a little flour. When all else failed, <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> could feed the family. Today the bread is a favorite Sunday-night snack after a day of dining in the country. Often only men make <span class="italic">Borlengo</span>, perhaps because they feel linked to Ugolino’s soldiers, legendary for their courage and fortitude.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Stalking the Wild <span class="italic">Borlengo</span></span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The bread sounded like no other that my friend Cara De Silva and I had ever heard of: a bread you can almost see through, as big as a cart wheel, dotted with cheese, garlic, and rosemary. Supposedly <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> was made in the hilltowns above Modena. Yet in Modena city and on the plain, few people had heard of it. Even in the hills <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> constantly eluded us. It was made in the winter; we were seeking it in the spring. Day after day, in town after town, we were told it was probably down the road or in the next village. The only constant was Rodiano. All agreed it was made in Rodiano. Of course, Rodiano was a mere pin speck on the map and finding it proved impossible. Every time we set out for Rodiano we lost our way on country roads no bigger than cow paths. Finally, we gave up the search and wandered the hills for pleasure. A blinding rainstorm brought us to a halt. Suddenly, the rain and mist cleared, and we were staring at a sign: “Welcome to Rodiano.” Like Brigadoon, it appeared out of the mist.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">We had been told that Rodiano had two <span class="italic">trattorie</span>, and that the one on the left made <span class="italic">Borlengo</span>. Of the four buildings making up Rodiano, sure enough, there side-by-side were two <span class="italic">trattorie</span>. We leapt gleefully out of the car, only to discover the sign on the left-hand trattoria: “Closed for vacation.” Once again, <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> was not to be. We turned to the adjoining Trattoria Leonelli, crestfallen. Little did we know we were about to stumble upon yet another intriguing bread of the Modenese mountains. In the tiny back dining room, baskets holding small rounds of hot bread were served with platters of cured meats and pickled vegetables. With them came bowls of minced salt pork flavored with garlic and fresh rosemary. Our shy waitress called the breads <span class="italic">Tigelle</span>. We were shown how to split open the hot breads and spread them with the pork mixture, then eat the meats and vegetables as accompaniments. Instead of being heavy and overrich, the spread was sweet and clean-tasting. (Italian salt pork, <span class="italic">lardo</span>, is more delicately flavored than ours, and is cured to be safely eaten raw.)</p>
<a id="page381"/>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;"><span class="italic">Tigelle</span> are not baked in ovens. In fact, they are not baked like any bread I know. They cook between hot terra-cotta discs or tiles. At Trattoria Leonelli the tiles, about 4 inches in diameter, are heated in a freestanding fireplace in the back garden. The hot discs are then hauled into the kitchen with its own open fire and piled on the heated hearthstone. Small rounds of risen bread dough are sandwiched between them. The bread bakes from the heat of the tiles, taking on the pattern of their sunburst embossing. It also takes its name from them: <span class="italic">Tigelle</span> is both the tile and the bread. When the Leonellis cater local weddings, 200 <span class="italic">Tigelle</span> are stacked on the hearth at a time. The bread is so old and so much a part of Modena mountain traditions that no one knows where or when it began.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The next day we had to move on to Bologna. But still resisting leaving the countryside, we decided to stop for coffee. Driving into the hilltop village of Guiglia, we almost went off the road. “Fifteenth Annual <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> Festival,” proclaimed the banner strung over the street. We exploded with laughter. We were among the first to arrive. Chickens were still strutting across the town square. Under a yellow tent, the local men who make <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> were setting up. They worked with big round pans of hammered copper over gas-fired braziers.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Guiglia’s oldest <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> maker demonstrated his technique. First he rubbed the hot pan with a chunk of home-cured pancetta. Then he ladled the milky batter into the pan, making a sheer film. It cooked to speckled gold on one side, then was turned and cooked on the other. More than two feet across, the <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> was crisp, parchmentlike. He dipped a brush into a pot of clear liquid flecked with green and white—homemade lard melted with garlic and rosemary. After dabbing the <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> with the brush, he showered it with a handful of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. We folded the <span class="italic">Borlengo</span> in quarters and ate it from a big napkin. We left the festival hours later—happy, full, and feeling like Stanley after he finally found Livingstone.</p>

Sprinkle the water over the dough. Use the on/off pulse to blend in the water until the dough looks like large crumbs or clumps. Do not blend until it forms a ball.

Bake the <span class="italic">Piadina</span> one at a time. It should take 30 to 45 seconds for the bottom to be speckled with deep golden brown. The uncooked side will look grainy and mottled. If this takes longer, raise the heat slightly. If the speckles are dark brown, the cooking surface is too hot. Lower the heat slightly.

Attempts at approximating the cheese in the United States met with frustration. No matter what kinds of culture, milk, or temperature were used, the results were disappointing. One day, in total exasperation, I blended the elements that squaquerone reminded me of: yogurt, <a id="page387"/>buttermilk, sour cream, and cream cheese. The result was the closest I had come to the cheese as it is in Italy. This simple formula needs only a bowl, a spoon, and 10 minutes of effort</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Sponge:</span> Start the sponge 16 to 22 hours before baking the bread. In a medium-size bowl, stir together the flour, yeast, and ¼ cup water. Let the mixture stand 5 minutes, or until the yeast is bubbly. Beat in the remaining 2 cups flour and 1 cup warm water. If you are working with an electric mixer, beat 1 minute at medium speed. By hand, beat vigorously about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides <a id="page389"/>of the bowl.

Save 10 tablespoons of the potato cooking water, and purée it with the potato. Cool to room temperature. Cook the wheat berries in fiercely boiling water to cover 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain and cool. Use a blender, food processor, or mortar and pestle to lightly crush the berries. Set aside at room temperature.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough in a Heavy-Duty Mixer:</span> In the mixer bowl, combine the sponge, potato purée, wheat berries, whole-wheat flour, salt, and half the all-purpose flour. Beat with the paddle attachment at medium speed about 2 minutes. Beat in another 1 cup flour and switch to the dough hook. Gradually add more flour until you have a sticky dough. The dough will be soft but holding its shape around the dough hook while it cleans the bottom and sides of the bowl. If it puddles at the bottom, blend in another few tablespoons of flour. It will be very elastic, soft, and a little sticky. Knead 10 minutes in the mixer.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough by Hand:</span> In a large bowl, beat together the sponge, whole-wheat flour, potato purée, wheat berries, salt, and half the all-purpose flour. Beat 5 minutes, and then work in enough flour to make a soft, slightly sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead 10 minutes. It will be very elastic, soft, and a little sticky. If necessary, knead in another few spoonfuls of flour.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">First Rising:</span> Lightly oil a large bowl. Add the dough, and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Set aside to rise at room temperature 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough is two-and-one-half to three times its original size. It will look blistered and soft. No harm will come to the bread if you let the dough sit as long as 8 hours.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing to Bake:</span> Although a greased baking sheet can be used, I prefer to bake the bread on a baking stone or unglazed terra-cotta tiles. If you are using tiles or a stone, set them in the oven before preheating it. You will need a flat wooden peel, cookie sheet, or piece of heavy cardboard. (Once the dough is shaped, half the cornmeal is spread on the peel, cookie sheet, or cardboard to keep the dough from sticking, and the dough is set on the cornmeal to rise. Then you slip the bread from the peel, sheet, or cardboard onto the baking surface that has been covered with the rest of the cornmeal.) If you are using a cookie sheet, lightly oil it with a little olive oil. Whichever method you use, place a shallow pan, such as a jelly roll pan, on the floor of a gas oven or on the lowest rack of an electric one. This will hold the water that steams and is vital to the crust’s dense texture.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Shaping and Second Rising:</span> Punch down the dough, and knead it about 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball by stretching it down and under, tucking it under itself until you have a taut sphere. Spread half the cornmeal over the peel and <a id="page390"/>set the dough on it, or set the dough on the oiled cookie sheet. Sprinkle it with the 1 tablespoon flour. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise at room temperature 1½ hours, or until doubled in bulk. The bread is ready for baking when you poke it with a finger and it does not spring back.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking:</span> Preheat the oven to 400°F. Make sure the rack is in the center of the oven. If you are using tiles or a stone, spread it with the rest of the cornmeal, and slip the bread onto it. If you are using a cookie sheet, merely slip it into the oven. Stand back as you pour the 3 cups water into the shallow pan at the bottom of the oven. Trap the burst of steam in the oven by closing the door immediately. Bake 1 hour. Then turn the bread upside down and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Put the loaf on a rack to cool. Although it is so tempting when it’s hot, do let the bread cool 1½ to 2 hours before cutting it. It will be at its very best then.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">This is a bread of memory for the women of Highwood, Illinois, who emigrated to America from the Modena mountains. They remember breads of their childhood. Maria Picchietti and Giovanna Lamberti recall that wheat was sparse in the mountains. Families grew their own and ground it into flour, often leaving specks of the whole grain. The mothers of Sue Bernardi and Anna Mardini added potatoes to moisten the loaf. Instead of leavening with yeast, they carried on a tradition as old as bread itself by saving some dough from the last loaf to begin the next. In Modena, too, my elderly friends spoke of the same breads. Each family remembered the bread with slight differences, but its essence remained the same.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">For the millennia before gas and electric stoves were dreamt of, brick and stone ovens heated with wood fires were the magical places where bread was cooked. Many artisan bakers still use these ovens, knowing that they impart a special flavor and vitality to bread. The scent of burning wood subtly impregnates the loaf, and somehow the life of the fire brings more vigor to the bread. You can approximate the old ovens by using soaked wood chips and a baking stone or tiles. Soak 3 cups of applewood, oak, walnut, or maple chips in water to cover for 1 hour. (Although I have not worked with them, grape vines and other fruit woods should work well here.) Drain, saving 1½ cups of the water. Return it to the chips. Set a large shallow pan on the lowest rack of the oven. Place a second rack, holding a baking stone or tiles, in the center of the oven. Then preheat the oven to the required temperature. When the dough is ready for baking, place it on the center rack. Pull out the lower rack holding the shallow pan. Stand back as you pour the wood and its liquid down the length of the pan. Immediately close the oven door. If the wood begins to smoke while the bread is baking, pour another ½ cup water over the chips and quickly close the oven door. Ideally, there will be a fragrant wood aroma but no smoke. Once the bread has baked, let the wood pan cool completely before removing it from the oven. The chips can be reused for flavoring foods on an outdoor grill.</p>
