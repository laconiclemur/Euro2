<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">While small game birds—especially red-legged partridge and quail <a href="232-chapter170.html#page_330"><span class="red">(see page 330)</span></a>—and sardines <a href="234-chapter171.html#page_332"><span class="red">(see page 332)</span></a> are lovely preserved in an herby, garlic-filled marinade, so are asparagus. But these slender green vegetables quickly absorb the marinade’s flavors and are meant to be eaten within hours as opposed to days. I first encountered this around Priego de Córdoba, and quickly adapted it into the pantheon of favorite vinegary dishes in my kitchen.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Snap off the hard bottom part of each asparagus stalk at the natural break point and discard.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Fill a large bowl with ice water. In a large pot, bring an abundant amount of water to a rolling boil, add a generous 2 pinches of salt, and blanch the asparagus by boiling them for 2 minutes and then immediately transferring with a slotted spoon to the ice water to stop any further cooking. Once cooled, remove with the slotted spoon and drain. Spread out on paper towels to dry.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a saucepan, add the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, bay leaf, lemon peel, and peppercorns and bring to a boil. Gently boil uncovered for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly before stirring in the pimentón (so that it doesn’t scorch and become bitter).</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a rectangular earthenware, ceramic, or glass dish, arrange the asparagus stalks snugly side by side.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Swirl the marinade in the pan to blend and then pour the oil and herbs over the asparagus. The stalks should be covered. If not, add more oil as needed.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Let cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled. Serve chilled with a spoonful of the marinade over top, a pinch of salt flakes, and a fresh grinding of pepper.</p>
