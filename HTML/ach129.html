<p class="noindentb">Nonna Tucci cooked steak this simple, quick, flavorful way. We don’t serve meat “American style”—with a vegetable and potato on the side. Instead we begin with pasta, followed by meat accompanied by a simply cooked vegetable. We finish with a green salad followed by nuts and fresh fruit. This has long been the tradition in my family, one that I continue to maintain today as I find that pacing the meal this way leaves me feeling less full.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 top round beef steak (2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> to 3 pounds)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry red wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon dried oregano</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> The steak should be <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inch thick. If necessary, pound it between two sheets of waxed paper to achieve this thickness.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the butter and olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming rapidly, add the steak and fry to brown on one side, about 3 minutes. (If the steak is larger than your sauté pan, cut it in half.) Turn, and season with salt and pepper. Brown the other side, about 3 minutes. Remove from the pan to a warm platter and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Add the wine and oregano to the pan, scraping up any meat that may have stuck to the bottom. Simmer to sweeten the wine, about 1 minute. Meanwhile, cut the meat into six equal portions. When the wine sauce is ready, pour it over the meat and serve immediately.</p>
