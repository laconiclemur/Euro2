  <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span> I <span class="small1">FIRST SET FOOT ON SARDEGNA, THE SECOND-LARGEST ISLAND IN</span> the Mediterranean, in 1978, when my son, Joseph, was ten, and Tanya six. We went there as part of our regular three-week vacation in Italy, and also to do some research in what was then unknown territory. The wines of Sardegna were just beginning to come to the American shores; I had read about <em class="calibre4">bottarga</em>, the salted dry mullet roe, and about <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em>, the local semolina gnocchi, and I was curious and eager to experience them all.</p>

  <p class="indent">We landed in Olbia and rented a car; our first stop was Porto Cervo. There we rested for a few days, to enjoy the sea and the local maritime cuisine, especially the spiny lobster. You’ll find my Roast Lobster with Bread Crumb Topping—<em class="calibre4">Aragosta Arrosta</em>, based on that delectable dish. In the Porto Cervo restaurant, where we sat facing the dock with its azure waters and glistening yachts, another new taste experience was saffron <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em> with a sausage sauce. I’ve had it many times since that trip, and each time I am reminded of that first unforgettable taste.</p>

  <p class="indent">But to truly know Sardinia, one needs to travel inland as well. So we soon moved on and drove to Nuoro, in the heart of the mountains, where the culture I had read about came alive. Sardinian cooking is mostly the rustic fare of the hills and mountains. It is hearth-and-spit cooking—roasted meats, skewered suckling pig, sausages, whole lambs and goats roasted on poles surrounded with aromatic olives, rosemary, juniper, and myrtle branches for flavoring. Inland Sardinia is a land of shepherds; the earliest evidence of sheep-rearing dates back to the pre-nuragic era, 1800 <span class="small1">B.C.</span> And it is still thriving today, more than in any other region of Italy. The impressive <em class="calibre4">nuraghi</em>, stone-built structures from that period, can still be found in the landscape today. It is said that the shepherds of that time used these structures to watch over their flocks in the distance.</p>

  <p class="indent">It follows that there is an abundance of cheese in Sardegna. Sweet sheep’s-milk cheeses, Fior Sardo and Pecorino Sardo, are eaten either fresh or aged and used in cooking, as are caciocavallo and provolone. One of my favorite preparations is their Provolone Turnovers—<em class="calibre4">Pardulas</em>. Good milk produces great cream, and several years later, when I returned to Sardegna with Mario, I had this stupendously simple dessert of semolina cooked in cream with myrtle sauce (see Semolina Pudding with Blueberry Sauce—<em class="calibre4">Mazzafrissa</em>. Even <a class="calibre8" id="page350"></a>simpler and just as delightful was a slice of fresh sheep’s ricotta with some bittersweet <em class="calibre4">miele di corbezzolo</em>, honey from the strawberry-tree flower.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Oliena, near Nuoro, we stayed at a most charming country inn, Su Cologone, set in the valley of Supramonte, amid olive trees and grapevines. The restaurant of the same name offers lots of local products and a traditional cuisine. Here I had for the first time Flatbread Lasagna, an unusual cauliflower dish, and a bread-and-cabbage casserole with a soup variation using similar ingredients. All of these inexpensive country dishes I have brought back with me and translated for you, so you can enjoy making them for friends and family in your own kitchen.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was summertime, and eggplants were everywhere. I’ve always associated Sicily with eggplants, but Sardegna seems to be a close second. At one meal we had Baked Eggplant in Tomato Sauce, and the next evening we had Baked Eggplant with Onions and Fresh Tomatoes. I have returned several times now to Su Cologone to taste and retaste the local specialties and flavors. On one subsequent visit with Mario, I had my first encounter with <em class="calibre4">fregola</em>, a homemade pasta that is shaped into small balls reminiscent of peppercorns. The dish I particularly liked and took notes on so I could share it with you was Baked <em class="calibre4">Fregola</em> Casserole.</p>

  <p class="indent">On my most recent trip to Sardegna, in June 2008, Mario had made all the arrangements with his Sardinian friend and associate Franco Azzara. Franco met us at the Olbia airport, and our first stop was his house, between Olbia and Santa Teresa di Gallura, to meet the family and have an espresso with a side of <em class="calibre4">liquore di mirto</em>, myrtle liquor made by his wife. We then all proceeded to Alghero, on the western shore, to enjoy a lobster <em class="calibre4">alla Catalana.</em></p>

  <p class="indent">There is a very Spanish feel and flavor to Alghero, since it was a Catalan colony for many years. And in this refreshing spiny-lobster salad with tomatoes and celery, dressed with boiled eggs, the name and the flavor are a blend of Catalan and Sardinian. But I must give credit where it is due, and the recipe I give you blends the traditional dish with Franco’s rendition. As to the delicious Spaghetti with Cold Tomato-Mint Sauce—<em class="calibre4">Spaghetti al Sugo Freddo</em>, it was Franco who let me in on the secrets of this old family recipe.</p>

  <p class="indent">The coast south of Alghero, Costa Verde, is less well known than the Costa Smeralda, north of Olbia, where the rich and famous have their summer residences, but it is just as beautiful. It is lined with magnificent high sand dunes, some of them covered with the local flowers and fauna, which lead into the emerald-green waters. Franco took us west of Guspini to the Hotel Le Dune in the location called Piscinas not far from Oristano. There, in a solitary setting, stands a building dating back to the eighth century, which is now a national monument and has twenty-six rooms <a class="calibre8" id="page351"></a><a class="calibre8" id="page352"></a>open to guests. Completely submerged in nature, the setting is of peace, and the cuisine of the sea. I must add that the journey over the rough roads is not easy, but it is worth the trip.</p>

  <p class="figure"><em class="calibre4">Above left: provolone cheese drying; above right and below: local workers at the Pintapane bakery in Oliena making</em> pane carasau</p>

  <p class="indent">On the way back from Oristano we headed toward Oliena, where I wanted to see how the <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em> and its thinner version, called <em class="calibre4">carta di musica</em>, were made. There we met with the gallant, ever-so-Sardinian Anna Rosa Fancello, who took us to see her sister-in-law, who makes the <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em> by hand. This typical unleavened crispy thin disk, used by shepherds on their long trips to pasture, is the quintessential Sardinian bread, eaten with cheese and cold cuts as well as used in soups. I was amazed at the dexterity of the whirling hands as Anna Rosa’s sister shaped the <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em>, and it was fascinating to hear from both sisters about the local traditions and the culture of this bread. Today, the bread is mostly made in small, somewhat automated family shops, as we found in the Pintapane bakery, run by Piero of the Corrias family in Oliena.</p>

  <p class="indent">Being isolated in the middle of the Mediterranean has made Sardinia the most idiosyncratic of Italian regions. The island’s history has been shaped as much by foreigners, Spaniards in particular, as by other Italians.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just as the food culture is unique in Sardegna, influenced by the different occupations through the ages, so is the wine culture. The varietals unique to Sardegna are the Girò, Cannonau, Nuragus, Monica, and the Vernaccia di Oristano. There are also various clones of the typical Mediterranean Moscato and Malvasia grapes, and there is a definite Mediterranean character and taste to the wine of Sardinia. Sella &amp; Mosca is one of the first producers to capitalize on these Sardinian varieties and to bring them to America and the rest of the world. With new technology, Sardinia is now producing delicious world-class wines.</p>

  <p class="indent">On that trip back to Olbia from Oliena, having eaten <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em>, we needed some wine to wash it all down, and we went to visit the unique winery Pedra Majore, run by the Isoni di Monti brothers and their families. The winery was situated on the most amazing granite formations on top of a hill. One thing that is so spectacular about traveling through Sardinia is that enormous granite rock formations will appear when you least expect them, especially around the coast, and they look like majestic sculptures—as if they had been arranged by a curator for your pleasure. The massive stones, weathered through time, take on the appearances of animals, people, and other figures.</p>

  <p class="indent">Here in this winery, one primary rock looked like a sitting dog, surrounded by a cluster of beveled rocks that formed an enclosed space. That space, we soon realized, was a welcoming kitchen where kid, <em class="calibre4">capretto</em>, was being roasted on a spit, and Carabineros, giant red shrimp, were on a hot griddle alongside. Soon we were happily eating and sipping their delicious white, I Graniti, Vermentino di Gallura.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Pardulas <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about a dozen</p>

  <p class="extract">If you are traveling in Sardinia, this is the dish to have. And if you want a taste of Sardinia at home, this is the dish to make. Pardulas resemble large ravioli, stuffed with sliced provolone. They’re not cooked like pasta, though, but fried until crisp and oozing melted cheese. They’re like grilled cheese sandwiches—kids love them. In fact, everybody does.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pardulas make a great appetizer flanked by some tossed salad or sliced tomatoes. For a more elaborate and substantial turnover, add some blanched asparagus or broccoli, or prosciutto or ham, to the stuffing; just cut down a bit on the cheese to make room. And if you make them half-sized, they’re a terrific hors d’oeuvre to pass at a cocktail party. They are traditionally served drizzled with honey but are delicious just fried and plain.</p>

  <p class="indent">For convenience, make and fill <em class="calibre4">pardulas</em> in advance and fry them when your guests arrive. If necessary, you can fry them up to 30 minutes ahead of time and keep them warm in the oven.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A food processor; a 3½-inch round cookie cutter; a heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the flour, salt, olive oil, and butter chunks in the food-processor bowl. Process until the fat has been incorporated and the mixture has a sandy texture. With the processor running, pour 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons water through the feed tube, and process just until a dough forms and gathers on the blade and cleans the sides of the bowl. If the dough is too sticky, add another tablespoon or two of flour; if too dry, add 2 tablespoons water. Process briefly, until the dough comes together, turn it out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand a few times, until it’s smooth and soft. Press the dough into a disk, wrap it well in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for at least ½ hour.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the <em class="calibre4">pardulas:</em> Cut the rested dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece out to a rectangular sheet about 12 by 16 inches—the dough should be about ¼ inch thick. To mark twelve circles, press the cookie cutter lightly on the sheet of dough but do not cut through it. Break each provolone slice into three or four pieces, and arrange them, overlapping, to fit inside one of the traced circles, leaving space around the edges. (If the cheese slices are large or thick, or weigh an ounce or more, don’t try to fit them all inside the dough circle. Each <em class="calibre4">pardula</em> should have about ¾ ounce cheese.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page354"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roll the other half of the dough to roughly the same size as the first. Pick it up and drape it over the bottom dough, covering all the rounds of sliced cheese. Gently press the top sheet around the cheese layers so the edges are distinct. Dip the cookie cutter in flour, center it over one portion of cheese, and cut through both layers of dough, to the work surface, cutting out one <em class="calibre4">pardula.</em> Cut all of them the same way, then pull away the excess dough between them. Pinch the edges of each <em class="calibre4">pardula</em>, sealing the cheese inside.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour vegetable oil into the big skillet to a depth of ½ inch, and set it over medium heat. Let the oil heat gradually until a piece of dough starts to sizzle when dipped in (without darkening immediately). Carefully slide as many of the <em class="calibre4">pardulas</em> into the pan as fit comfortably, with some space between them. Fry until crisp and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. If the cheese begins to leak out during frying, flip the <em class="calibre4">pardulas</em> to their other side. Drain the <em class="calibre4">pardulas</em> on paper towels, and keep them warm in a low oven.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve as soon as possible, while the <em class="calibre4">pardulas</em> are crispy and hot and the cheese is molten (with honey drizzled on top, if you like).</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c12s01.02">F<span class="small1">LATBREAD</span> L<span class="small1">ASAGNA</span></h2>

  <p class="nonindent1">Pane Frattau <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 4</p>

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Pane frattau</em> is a traditional dish of Sardinian shepherds, made from <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em>, the thin, long-keeping flatbreads that were a staple food during the shepherds’ extended sojourns in mountain pastures. Some clever shepherd discovered long ago, I imagine, that he could turn the dry bread into a fast, warm meal by soaking and layering it with hot tomato sauce and cheese, lasagna-style.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now considered a classic of Sardinian cooking, <em class="calibre4">pane frattau</em> is a dish that I love to make at home. No baking is required, and everything can be heated on the stovetop (quicker than a shepherd’s campfire, I am sure) and quickly assembled. With a perfectly poached or fried egg as the crowning touch, it makes a beautiful brunch or supper dish, belying its peasant origins.</p>

  <p class="indent">Regard this recipe as a guideline. Though the listed ingredient amounts serve four, you can multiply them to serve a crowd or divide them to make <em class="calibre4">pane frattau</em> for two—or just for yourself. I recommend my Tomato Sauce, but any basic tomato sauce of your choice would be fine, too. And though I prefer poached eggs to top the <em class="calibre4">pane frattau</em>, a fried egg, sunny side up, would be just as authentic and satisfying. Either way, just be sure to cook the eggs at the last minute and serve the dish right away. I also suggest that you try layering <em class="calibre4">pane frattau</em> as is rather than water-soaked <em class="calibre4">pane carasau.</em> It is great that way, too!<a class="calibre8" id="page355"></a></p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A tray or baking sheet lined with paper towels; a wide skillet, sauté pan, or shallow saucepan for poaching the eggs; four gratin dishes or shallow bowls for individual servings</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Break each sheet of <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em> into three or four pieces—just small enough to fit in the individual serving dishes. Fill a large bowl with hot water, and drop in a batch of broken bread pieces. Let them soak for a few seconds, so all are moistened, then remove and spread them on the paper-towel-lined tray. The pieces should still be somewhat firm; don’t let them get soggy. Moisten the rest of the <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em> the same way.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the tomato sauce to a gentle simmer in a small saucepan, and keep it hot.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Get ready for poaching the eggs: Pour water in the skillet to a depth of 2 inches, and add the vinegar (1 tablespoon per quart of water). Gradually heat to a simmer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Assemble the individual dishes of <em class="calibre4">pane frattau</em> just before cooking the eggs: Spread 3 to 4 tablespoons of sauce in the bottom of each dish or bowl, and sprinkle over each a tablespoon of grated cheese. Cover the sauce and cheese with a layer of moist <em class="calibre4">pane carasau</em> pieces (keep in mind that you’ll need three such layers in each dish, or twelve portions of bread). Spoon another 3 to 4 tablespoons sauce on top of the flatbread, and sprinkle over it another spoonful of cheese. Now repeat this layering twice more—bread, sauce, cheese; bread, sauce, cheese—using more or less of each to taste.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Poach the eggs at the last minute: One at a time, break them into a small ramekin or cup, and gently slide each one into the simmering water. Cook the eggs 2 to 3 minutes for a firm white and still-runny yolk (or longer if you like). Lift each egg out with a slotted spoon, drain for a moment on paper towels, and lay it atop a dish of <em class="calibre4">pane frattau.</em> Give each egg a final dusting with cheese, and serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="extract">I love cauliflower, but I know not everyone shares my passion for this nutritious but sometimes bland vegetable. This recipe shows that the right cooking method and complementary ingredients can make a cauliflower dish that can steal the show.</p>

  <p class="indent">As is my way with most vegetables, I skillet-cook the cauliflower—slowly sautéing it with little or no added moisture. That way, more of the essential vegetable flavor is retained and intensified, adding layers of caramelization. Here, too, the companion vegetables enhance the cauliflower, with olives lending earthy complexity, and cherry tomatoes giving acidity and freshness. This can be made in advance and reheated. And if you happen to have some left over, it can be the base for a great risotto, or for dressing a plate of pasta for two.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Tear off the tough outer leaves at the base of the cauliflower, and cut out the tough core. Cut the branches into small florets (about 1 inch), and cut any small tender leaves into pieces. Peel the onion and, without trimming away the root end, slice it into eight thin wedges. The onion layers should still be attached at the root end, so each wedge remains intact.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the skillet, set it over medium heat, and toss in the garlic cloves. When they start to sizzle, strew the cauliflower over the pan bottom, and drop in the onion pieces here and there. Season with the salt and peperoncino, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover the pan. Let the vegetables cook without stirring for 20 minutes or so, softening in their own juices, until the florets and wedges begin to take on color on the bottom. If the pieces are soft but not caramelizing, uncover the pan, raise the heat a bit, and cook a few minutes longer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the vegetable pieces are caramelized on one side, gently tumble them over. Scatter the cherry tomatoes and olives in the pan, stir gently to distribute them, then cover and cook until the tomatoes release their juices, about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract">Gallura is the traditional name for the northeastern corner of Sardinia, across from Corsica, and the region’s distinctive dialect and delicious dishes are termed Gallurese. Here is a most unusual rendition of <em class="calibre4">zuppa Gallurese.</em> Surprisingly, it comes in the form of a casserole, with layers of bread, Savoy cabbage, provolone, and pecorino, drenched in chicken stock and baked. The end result is an amazing dish that has the comforting character of a soup and the cheesy lusciousness of a lasagna or <em class="calibre4">pasticciata.</em> I know you will find it delightful.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, and heat it to 400°. Trim the crusts from the bread slices, lay them flat on the baking sheet, and put the sheet in the oven as it heats. Toast the slices, turning them over once, until lightly browned on the edges. Remove and let cool, leaving the oven on.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, bring 4 or 5 quarts lightly salted water to the boil in the big pot. Slice the cabbage head in half, and cut out the core completely, so the leaves can separate. Discard all tough and torn outer leaves, lay the cabbage halves cut side down, and slice crosswise into 1-inch strips. Drop the cabbage strips into the water, return to the boil, and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the strips in a colander, rinse under cool water, and let drain. Put them in a bowl, sprinkle them with the salt and olive oil, and toss well.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Slice the chunk of provolone into slabs, about ⅓ inch thick. Butter the sides and bottom of the baking dish.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To assemble the casserole: Cover the bottom of the baking dish with a layer of bread slices, trimming the pieces as needed to fit snugly and fill any gaps. Spread half of the seasoned cabbage strips in a layer over the bread. Lay all of the provolone slabs on top of the cabbage, evenly distributed in a single layer. Sprinkle on half of the grated cheese. Next, spread the remaining cabbage out in an even layer, and top that with the remaining bread in another snugly fitted layer.</p>

Slowly pour the stock all over the bread and down the insides of the pan, so everything is moistened. Sprinkle the rest of the grated cheese over the top.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Carefully tent the dish with a sheet of heavy aluminum foil, arching it so it doesn’t touch the food surface, and pressing it against the sides. Set the dish on the baking sheet, and place in the oven. Bake the casserole for about 45 minutes, until the juices are bubbling actively, and remove the foil. Continue baking for 20 minutes or more, until the top of the casserole is golden brown all over.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve the soup steaming hot.

  <p class="nonindent">I know from years as a restaurateur that just about everyone, even the meat-and-potato type, loves eggplant <em class="calibre4">parmigiana</em>, hot from the oven, stuffed with molten cheese. I love that Italian-American classic, too, but there are many more great eggplant dishes I’ve encountered in my travels through Italy, which I want to share with you.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Sardinia, I was delighted to find a tradition of baked eggplant dishes, with ingredients, tastes, and textures that I knew would appeal to Americans. Here are two—I couldn’t choose between them, so I decided to give you both. They have tomato: fresh tomatoes in one, savory tomato sauce in the other. They have cheese: grated pecorino topping on one, a vein of young pecorino (or mozzarella) chunks in the other. Best of all, they have thick layers of tender yet meaty eggplant. And in these preparations, the eggplant slices don’t need frying (as in most eggplant <em class="calibre4">parmigiana</em> recipes), which saturates them with more olive oil than necessary. No frying and great flavor—I love these and am sure you will, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">These are practical dishes as well. Best served hot, they are both also excellent at room temperature. And you can prepare either in advance, baking it three-quarters of the way to start, then finishing it when your guests arrive. Leftovers, if you have any, are a treat. A baked-eggplant sandwich is one of my favorites!</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em class="calibre4">Malloreddus</em> is a traditional Sardinian pasta or gnocco (dumpling) made from semolina dough imbued with saffron. Like potato gnocchi, <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em> are shaped by quickly rolling small bits of dough against a hard, patterned surface (a fork for potato gnocchi and a perforated grater for <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em>). This flicking motion creates a short oval shell with a hollow inside and a textured outer surface, perfect for picking up a dressing or sauce. And the hard wheat dough gives each piece a wonderful chewy texture. In short, <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em> is a little pasta with a big mouth-feel.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A food processor fitted with the metal blade; a grater with fine holes, with a large bottom opening; floured trays or baking sheets</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drop the saffron threads into ½ cup of hot water in a spouted measuring cup, and let steep 5 minutes or longer. Pour in ¾ cup cold water (so you have 1¼ cups total).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the flour in the bowl of the food processor, and start the processor running. Pour in <em class="calibre4">almost</em> all of the saffron water through the feed tube (the threads can go in, too), reserving a couple of tablespoons. Process for 30 to 40 seconds, until a dough forms and gathers on the blade and cleans the sides of the bowl. If the dough is too sticky, add another tablespoon or two of flour. If it is too dry, add the remaining water. Process another 10 to 20 seconds.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for a minute, until it’s smooth, soft, and stretchy. Press it into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for at least ½ hour. (Refrigerate the dough for up to a day, or freeze for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cut the dough into eight pieces; work with one at a time, and keep the others covered with a towel or plastic wrap. Roll the dough under your hands on a clean work surface, first forming a smooth log and gradually stretching it into a long rope ½ inch thick. With a dough scraper or knife, chop the rope into ⅓-inch-long segments, like tiny cylinders; separate and lightly dust them with flour.</p>

  <p class="center"><a class="calibre8" id="page364"></a><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_117_r1.jpg" /></p>

(If you are using a box grater, you want the inside of the finest grating-shredding face; you’ll need to reach it through the bottom of the box.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pick up one small piece of dough, and place it on the grater face. Press into it with your lightly floured thumb, and quickly push down and away—rolling it against the holes and flicking it off the grater in one movement. It’s just like rolling gnocchi against the tines of a fork (and similar to plucking a guitar string). Roll all the cut segments into <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em>, dust them with flour, and scatter them on a lightly floured tray, not touching.</p>

  <p class="extract">This is a great sauce, almost a universal pasta dressing, but particularly suitable for <em class="calibre4">malloreddus.</em> Because it is so good and useful, I make it in large batches and pack it in small portions for freezing.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the sausage casings, and crumble the meat into a large bowl. Pour over it ½ cup of the wine, and mix this in with your fingers, breaking up any big meat clumps, so the sausage is evenly moistened.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big skillet, and set it over medium heat. Stir in the onions, and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes; scatter the sliced garlic in the pan, and season with the salt and peperincino. When everything is sizzling, crumble in the sausage, and stir with the onions. Pour in the remaining ½ cup wine, raise the heat a bit, and cook, stirring, as the wine cooks away and the sausage becomes all browned, about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour in the tomatoes and a cup of water (which you’ve used to slosh and rinse the tomato cans and bowl). Submerge the basil branch in the liquid, cover the skillet, and bring to a boil. Set the cover ajar, adjust the heat to keep the sauce bubbling steadily, and cook for an hour or more, until the sauce has developed good flavor and reduced to the consistency you like for dressing pasta. Remove and discard basil branch. You can use some of the sauce right away—you’ll need half of it to dress a batch of <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em>—or let it cool, then refrigerate or freeze for later use.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For cooking and dressing the pasta: Bring a large pot of well-salted water (at least 7 quarts water with 1½ tablespoons kosher salt) to a rolling boil. Heat half the sausage-tomato sauce, about 4 cups, to a bare simmer in a wide skillet or sauté pan (if you’ve just made the sauce, use the same pan). If the sauce has cooled and thickened, loosen it with some of the pasta water.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Shake the <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em> in a colander or strainer to remove excess flour, and drop all of it into the pot, stirring to keep the pieces from clumping together. Cover the pot, and rapidly return the water to a rolling boil, stirring once or twice, then cook the <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em>, partly covered, until barely <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift out the pasta in big bunches with a spider, drain for a moment, and spill them into the simmering sauce. Over low heat, toss the <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em> and sauce together for a minute or two, until all are coated and perfectly <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> (Thin the sauce, if necessary, with hot pasta water, or thicken it quickly over higher heat.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, and sprinkle the grated cheese over the <em class="calibre4">malloreddus</em> and toss well.

  <p class="nonindent">This little jewel of a pasta is made entirely by hand, no machines needed. As the recipe teaches you, the process is simple—all you do is shake, shake, shake—and if you have kids, they will take to it naturally. They (and you) will delight in the accomplishment, especially when you enjoy your <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> in all sorts of dishes. My method will give you a small amount of <em class="calibre4">very</em> tiny pasta balls, which are a wonderful treat in a bowl of soup. The main batch of slightly larger <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> can be cooked, then sauced, like any other pasta, or served plain as an accompaniment to braised meats or stews, to soak up the sauce. Or use them in the delicious Baked <em class="calibre4">Fregola</em> Casserole recipe that follows.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em class="calibre4">Fregola</em> keep well either in the cupboard, sealed in a jar or ziplock bag, or frozen. So make plenty in advance, and keep them on hand as a versatile homemade pantry staple.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> 3 large, rimmed baking sheets; parchment paper; a fine-mesh wire strainer or sieve, about 8 inches wide; a large medium-mesh wire strainer or sieve, about 8 inches wide; a small wire-mesh skimmer, or a large spoon</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread the semolina flour in an even layer on one of the baking sheets, and line the other two with parchment paper.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour ¼ cup of water in a cup or bowl; dip your fingers into the water, and rapidly shake them all over the semolina, moistening the flour with small droplets of water. Keep dipping and shaking until you’ve used up half the water in the bowl (2 tablespoons), then shake the sheet pan, congealing the wettest flour into small bits and balls of dough, or <em class="calibre4">fregola.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now dip into and shake out the rest of the water in the bowl, directing it over the dry flour on the tray. Shake the baking sheet again to form more <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> (there will still be a good deal of dry flour remaining as well).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Place the medium-mesh strainer on top of the fine-mesh strainer, and hold them with one hand over the semolina tray. With the small wire skimmer (or a spoon) in your other hand, scoop up the <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> that have formed, shaking off excess flour, and spill them into the nested strainers. Shake to separate and sift the <em class="calibre4">fregola:</em> the large <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> will remain in the medium strainer; the smaller <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> will fall into the fine strainer; and excess flour will land back on the tray.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now put another ½ cup of water into the bowl, and repeat the procedure of dipping, dripping, and shaking water over the semolina. Periodically, shake the sheet to form more <em class="calibre4">fregola</em>, lift them out, then sift and separate them. Continue until almost all of the flour has been transformed into <em class="calibre4">fregola.</em> You will have used ¾ to 1 cup water in all.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, arrange two racks in the center part of the oven, and heat it to 325°. When all the <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> are formed, and spread on pans according to size, place the pans in the oven. Toast the pasta, shaking the pans once or twice, until the <em class="calibre4">fregola</em> harden, about 10 minutes for the small ones and about 20 minutes for the larger. Let them cool on the sheet pans; pack into jars or plastic bags, and store in the cupboard or freezer.</p>

  <p class="extract">Throughout history, Sardinia has been a territorial prize for the great powers of the Mediterranean Basin, and every period of dominion has left its mark on the island. One of the most distinctive influences—both cultural and culinary—was the 400-year rule of imperial Spain, from the early 1300s to the early 1700s. Today, in Alghero, on the west coast of Sardinia, residents still speak a form of the Catalan language. And the spiny lobster that abounds in the waters off Alghero is prepared <em class="calibre4">alla Catalana</em>—cooked, chopped into large pieces, and tossed into a salad.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Sardinia, it is expected that you will grab a chunk of lobster from the salad with your fingers and dig into the shells with gusto. Here at home, I do the same thing with our great Atlantic lobsters, which are certainly as good as if not better than their Mediterranean cousins.

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A large pot, 8-quart capacity or larger, for cooking the lobster; a sharp, heavy chef’s knife; moist napkins and bowls for the lobster shells, on the table</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fill the pot with 6 quarts water, add 6 tablespoons salt, and bring to a rolling boil. When the water is at a rolling boil, drop in the lobsters and start timing: cook them, uncovered, for 10 minutes total, after the water returns to the boiling point (and then keep it boiling). At the end of 10 minutes (or a couple of minutes longer if the lobsters are larger than 1¼ pounds), lift the lobsters from the pot, rinse with cold water, drain, and let them cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Core the tomatoes, and cut them into wedges, about 1 inch thick; if you have cherry tomatoes, cut them in half. Chop the celery stalks crosswise into 1-inch pieces, and chop the leaves roughly. Toss tomatoes and celery together in a large bowl with ½ teaspoon of the salt.</p>

  <p class="center"><a class="calibre8" id="page372"></a><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_119_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page373"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the lobsters are cool enough to handle, twist and pull off the claws and knuckle segments where the knuckles attach to the front of the body. Lay the clawless lobsters flat on a cutting board, and split them in half lengthwise, from head to tail, with the heavy chef’s knife. Separate the meaty tail piece from the carcass (or body) of the four split halves.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now cut the lobster into pieces of whatever size you like; put the pieces in a large mixing bowl as you work. Separate the knuckles from the claws, and crack open the shells of both knuckles and hard claw pincers with the thick edge of the knife blade, or kitchen shears, exposing the meat. Chop the knuckles into pieces at the joints.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cut the tail pieces crosswise into chunks, or leave them whole, which I prefer. Cut the carcass pieces crosswise in two, with the legs still attached (though you can cut the legs off). I like to leave the tomalley and roe in the body pieces, as a special treat while eating the salad. Alternatively, remove tomalley and roe and whisk them into the dressing (or remove them and discard, if not to your liking).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the dressing: Whisk together the lemon juice, chopped eggs, peperoncino, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Pour in the olive oil in a slow stream, whisking steadily to incorporate it into a smooth dressing.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve: Add the tomatoes and celery to the bowl of lobster pieces. Pour in the dressing, and tumble everything together until evenly coated. Scatter the parsley on top, tumbling to distribute. Arrange the salad on a large platter, or compose individual servings on salad plates.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Aragosta Arrosta <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 6</p>

  <p class="extract">This terrific lobster preparation reminds me of a dish that was popular on the menus of Italian-American restaurants when I first came to the United States. Lobster oreganata, as the dish was called, was a split lobster topped with bread crumbs, seasoned with dry oregano, and baked. On recent visits to the Sardinian coast, I’ve often had its prized spiny lobsters prepared in quite similar fashion. So, though I am pleased to bring you this recipe for authentic Sardinian <em class="calibre4">aragosta arrosta</em> (roast lobster), I am quite sure that Italian-American restaurants and immigrants had the same idea many years ago.</p>

  <p class="indent">As with the preceding <em class="calibre4">Aragosta alla Catalana</em>, I like this dinner to be a hands-on, fully absorbing experience. After my guests have salad or a vegetable appetizer, I give everyone a half-lobster without the distraction of side dishes, furnishing guests with plenty of wet towels and bowls for empty shells. Then we all just concentrate on getting every morsel of meat out of these amazing crustaceans.<a class="calibre8" id="page374"></a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> About ½ hour before you plan to cut up the lobsters, put them in the freezer. They will become inactive as their temperature drops (but don’t let them freeze).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven, and heat it to 400°.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Split the lobsters in half lengthwise, one at a time. Hold each lobster flat on a cutting board, and place the point of a heavy chef’s knife through the shell just behind the head, with the blade lined up between the eyes. Bring the blade down firmly, splitting the head in two. Turn the lobster so you can align the knife blade from behind the head along the tail, and cut down through the entire body and tail in one stroke.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When all the lobsters are split, remove and discard the sac and nerve tissue in the head cavity, and the thin intestinal tract that runs along the back between the shell and tail meat. Arrange the six lobster halves on the baking sheet, cut sides up, claws extended to keep the lobsters in place without rolling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Toss together the bread crumbs, chopped parsley, and ¼ teaspoon of the salt in a bowl; drizzle in ¼ cup of olive oil, and toss well, until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Sprinkle the crumbs over the cut surfaces of the lobster halves, covering all the meaty parts; lightly press crumbs into the cavities, too. Pour the wine and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil into the pan around the lobsters (not on the crumbs); sprinkle the remaining salt into the wine and oil, and stir.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Tent the pan of lobsters loosely with a sheet of heavy aluminum foil (don’t let it touch the topping), and carefully set the pan in the oven. Roast for 10 minutes, remove the foil, and roast another 20 to 25 minutes, until the lobsters are cooked through and the crumbs are crisp and golden.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve the lobsters immediately, placing a half on each dinner plate, or all the halves on a big platter to share family-style. Spoon any juices in the pan over the lobsters; place lemon wedges on the plates or platters. Make sure the napkins and bowls for the shells are handy, and dig in.</p>

  <p class="extract">Semolina cooked in cream becomes a thick, delicious porridge, with an almost puddinglike consistency, that can be enjoyed many ways. In Sardinia I have had it as an appetizer with honey drizzled on top, and as a dessert with a sauce of <em class="calibre4">mirto</em>, or myrtle. I loved both! And I’ve made it as a warm breakfast treat, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">Here I give you <em class="calibre4">mazzafrissa</em> as a dessert, with a lovely blueberry sauce (strawberries or cherries or other seasonal berries would be good, too). Scoop the warm cereal into serving bowls and top with the blueberry sauce, or serve the sauce on the side and let your guests help themselves.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the blueberry sauce: Stir together the blueberries, honey, and orange juice in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then adjust the heat to keep the sauce simmering gently. Cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until the berries break down and the juices reduce to a syrupy sauce. Keep the sauce warm while you make the pudding.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the semolina: Pour the cream into a medium saucepan, add the salt, and set over medium heat. When the cream comes to a boil, whisk in the semolina, pouring it into the pan gradually, in a thin, steady stream. Continue whisking until all the flour is incorporated. Cook and whisk until the mixture thickens and begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, 10 minutes or so.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the strainer over a bowl, and scrape in the cooked semolina. Let the fat drain into the bowl for at least 5 minutes (or longer, if you wish). The amount of excess fat will vary with the heavy cream; discard any that collects in the bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve the pudding warm or at room temperature, topped with the blueberry sauce.</p>
