<h2 class="h2-a">The Hunt, the Harvest and Winter</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">THE EVENINGS SHORTEN</span> and it becomes cold at night. The leaves on the vines turn shades of red and gold, and a side of Provence that is less celebrated outside its boundaries begins. You can move around the markets more easily and wander into restaurants without booking. Cooking has different nuances: the excitement of the mushroom season starting and the game becoming available (officially). Fresh walnuts and chestnuts abound to crack and roast, and it all begins around the time of the grape harvest.</p>
<p class="normala">The harvest is a climax, finding out if another year’s work – caring, pruning and worrying – is going to produce a wine worth drinking. Nervous talk is all of degrees of alcohol, tonnage and the weather. The weather is always of great concern in Provence and dominates conversations not in the polite, let’s-pass-the-time way of the Anglo-Saxon, but in the passionate soothsayer’s, always-right fashion of the Provençaux. It is only before and during the harvest when the grapes are at stake that I have heard anyone (quietly) doubt themselves.</p>
<p class="normala">There is a romantic vision that, for the uninitiated, accompanies the <em>vendange</em>. A blissful wander through the vines, secateurs in hand, sun on your face and the satisfying plop of heavy bunches of grapes falling into your basket. The air is sweet with the scent of the sun-gorged grapes bursting to become wine, and there is nowhere you would rather be. This sounds great but the reality of the pick is back-breaking, hard, sticky work during which any loss of concentration could quickly be accompanied by that of a finger.</p>
<p class="normala">Aches and blisters aside, the <em>vendange</em> is a time of great splendour with a multitude of festivals and feasts. Lunch, as always in France, is respected. A few hours are taken in the middle of the day to fill the belly and blood with enough energy to survive the afternoon and evening. When all is well in the vines and baskets are full, the alcohol is abundant and dinner is a happy event. Screams of laughter accompany boasts from those claiming to have picked the most.</p>
<p class="normala">Chosen dishes are the sort to be shared and grabbed at greedily from around the table. <em>Gigots</em> of slowly cooked lamb are served with garlicky beans – creamy cocos, both white and speckled, abundant, plump and soft. Fat ducks are smeared with thick dark honey and lemon and roasted with the first of the chestnuts. Great gratins of potatoes, chard, onions and aubergines are sliced and spooned gleefully on to plates. Soft cheeses will be baked with wine and garlic and eaten like fondues. The essence of the harvest is really captured in the desserts: tiny violet figs roasted with brown sugar, or simmered in sweet red wine; tarts and <em>clafoutis</em> made with deep purple autumn peaches known as <em>pêche de vigne</em>. After feasts like these and a day in the vines, sleep comes quickly and the anticipation of the end of the harvest hangs tantalizingly in the air.</p>
<p class="normala">Not long after the grape harvest comes a crop of another sort, the hunt for which is something of a national pastime all over France, and some of the richest pickings are to be had in Provence. In the main mushroom season, when rain is followed by sun, you’ll come across cars parked in the most unusual places. These are usually far away from the spots where the mushrooms are actually found as these, once known, are jealously guarded. I’ve been left holding the basket and trying not to laugh during an impatient conversation between two, under other circumstances, good friends who stumbled across each other. It was hilarious. My friend gave vague directions which I knew were vague lies. He then started on the outright lies before grabbing me, my basket and the ceps, and leading me off in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="normala">The variety of mushrooms to be found in the woods nearby is astonishing: hearty ceps, destined for sautés and grills, or to accompany roasted or grilled meats or fowl; the delicate girolles which I love to use in cream sauces, either for chicken or rabbit, but most lusciously over toasted, generously buttered brioche, or in omelettes; the <em>sanguine</em> which, when cut, bleeds bright orange and holds up perfectly to the Provençal treatment of garlic and parsley. If you are very lucky and you know someone who is in the know, you may come across what Sylvain, who as well as tending Peter’s vines is a real man of the woods, calls the ‘caviar of mushrooms’: the exotic-looking and delicious Caesar mushroom (<em>oronge</em> in French, or <em>amanites des Césars</em>). You also need to be with someone who is in the know because Caesar’s sister is a poisonous toadstool (as are many in the Amanita family). The Caesar looks a little like an orange cep coming out of an egg and has a delicate flavour that needs either elegant or almost no accompaniment. I have sliced them raw into a salad with Parmesan and rocket. For simple perfection, I just grill them over a fierce heat and anoint them with fruity olive oil, salt and black pepper.</p>
<p class="normala">It’s when the mushroom season overlaps with the hunt that the problems begin. Sylvain took the whole hunter-gatherer thing to a new level when he was shot in the backside while elatedly cutting the stalk of a fat cep. He was told that he was mistaken for a wild boar, an excuse which he accepted. However, I have my doubts. I think he rumbled someone’s patch and this was just a warning. We take our fungi very seriously in Provence. The seasons are short and the rewards delightful.</p>
<p class="normala">The hunting season is less clearly defined. One can’t help but notice that the chirping of late summer crickets is occasionally punctuated by gunshot. If we have guests, we try to sneeze or cough to cover the sound, and start to salivate at the prospect of another round of rich daubes, roasts and terrines. When embraced by Frenchmen, hunting really is an all-consuming passion. This passion was illustrated perfectly when a friend of ours, doing a spot of night hunting, fell asleep then fell out of the tree he was hiding in. Annoyed mainly because he might have frightened off an approaching <em>sanglier</em> or boar, he went straight back to his branch and stayed there until dawn. The next day he found out he’d broken three ribs but, undeterred, that night he was back in his tree.</p>
<p class="normala">There are some rare delights at this time of year. Fat partridges, hung for a week after shooting, then roasted with sweetly caramelised onions and served with creamy lentils and bacon. The now rare and wonderful woodcock is trussed with its beak, and roasted whole to be served on huge toasts spread with a hot pâté made with its livers and foie gras, then glazed with the pan juices enriched with Cognac. The most popular offering is the wild boar, the different cuts of which have their own use, making wonderful <em>terrines de campagne</em>, roasts and the celebrated daube. A daube of wild boar is a wonderful dish, gamey but not too much so. The delicate exchange of flavours during a cooking process of braising without drying out leaves you with meat soft enough to eat with a spoon but still moist, succulent and enshrouded in a deep rich sauce. The secret is all in the slow careful cooking (I know, I do go on about this, but it is so, so important) which, while rendering a tough piece of meat tender, still keeps it moist.</p>
<p class="normala">Many vegetables that you wouldn’t usually associate with Provence appear in autumn and winter: watercress from Toulon, Jerusalem artichokes, endives, celeriac and huge shallots which are roasted gently until soft and sweet. The rich wonderful winter cuisine of Provence takes hold. Big pieces of beef are grilled or roasted, and butter is often used instead of the more usual olive oil. Chicken <em>pot au feu</em> is thickened with aïoli to make a warming stew and broth, pigeons are roasted with ceps. Winter is a release from the heat and bustle of the visitors that crowd the place at the height of the season. The clear crisp days of autumn when we look across a different landscape, and the chill winter evenings in front of an open fire, are just as welcome as the return of the summer will be.</p>
