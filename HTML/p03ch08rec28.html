<p class="summary">When I asked people in Spain what their favorite dish was, they often described one made with <span class="italic">bacalao</span>, salt cod. In this once fervently Catholic country, until the mid-twentieth century, before refrigeration, when transport into the interior from the sea was by mule, <span class="italic">bacalao</span> was the traditional choice for penitential dishes, replacing the meat during Lent and on days of abstinence (including every Friday and Wednesday). Spaniards became addicted to its very particular flavor and texture, and it is a much-loved delicacy even in coastal areas. The “pig of the sea,” which replaced the ubiquitous ham and chorizo in so many dishes, is the food that evokes memories for everyone.</p>
<p class="summary">Cod is not a fish of Spanish waters. During the tenth century, Basque fishermen found a secret source in the high seas off Norway. Eventually they went as far west as Newfoundland to get it. To preserve it for the voyage home, they filleted the fish, stacked the fillets between layers of salt to extract their moisture, and dried them. <span class="italic">Bacalao</span> was carried to all parts of the Spanish hinterland by mules and in barges along rivers. Every region has its own special ways of cooking it.</p>
<p class="summary">Salt cod can be found in many ethnic fish markets and in grocery stores. It needs to be soaked in plenty of cold water for 12 hours to 2 days, depending on the strength of the cure, and the water must be changed four or five times to remove all the salt. You have to taste a bit to see if most of the salt is gone—there should still be a slight taste of salt remaining. In Spain, <span class="italic">bacalao</span> is often sold soaked and desalted, ready to be cooked.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">To produce something of the flavor and texture of salt cod with fresh cod:</span> Put thick cod fillets on a plate and sprinkle very generously with coarse sea salt or kosher salt. Leave them for at least 1 hour, turning them every 15 minutes or so and sprinkling them with more salt. The crystals will draw out the moisture from the flesh and some will be absorbed (do not use fine sea salt, or too much salt will be absorbed). Wipe off the salt and rinse the fillets under cold running water. Then soak in plenty of cold water for 30 to 45 minutes, changing the water three times. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
