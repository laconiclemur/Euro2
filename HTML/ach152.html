<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pesce al sale aromatizzato</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">If you want to impress your guests, this is the dish to prepare. It’s perfect for large parties, makes an unforgettable centerpiece for a buffet, and is always tender and moist. I would use red snapper, striped bass, or sea bass. Garnish it with lemon slices and sprinkle with olive oil. Simple vegetables, such as roasted potatoes and sautéed spinach, make good side dishes.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 pounds sea salt or kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large egg whites</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 4-pound fish, cleaned and scaled, fins removed (head and tail left on)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons chopped fresh fennel leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, cut into 6 wedges</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Eight 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 bay leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley stems</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cloves garlic, crushed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, combine the salt, egg whites, and water. The salt should be moist but not wet. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Line a large roasting or baking pan with two layers of aluminum foil. Fold up the edges of the foil to make a boat shape. Spread one quarter of the salt mixture on top of the foil. Place the whole fish on top of the salt. Season the cavity of the fish with salt and pepper. Place 2 tablespoons of the fennel leaves, the lemon wedges, 4 of the rosemary sprigs, and the bay leaves, parsley stems, and garlic in the cavity. Place the remaining 4 rosemary sprigs, the chopped sage, and the remaining 2 tablespoons fennel leaves on top of the fish. Arrange the lemon slices down the center of the fish.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_305"/><span class="red">4.</span> Cover the fish with the remaining salt mixture, patting it into place to completely enclose the fish. (If the head and tail protrude from the baking dish, wrap them in aluminum foil.) Bake until the fish reaches an internal temperature of 145° F (use an instant-read thermometer to check this), about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> When ready to serve, crack the salt shell with a hammer. (If you want to impress your family and friends, do this at the table.) Lift the solid salt away from the dish. Discard the lemon and herbs and gently separate the skin of the dish from the meat. Transfer portions of the fish to each dinner plate, and serve immediately.</p>
