</div>
<p class="summary1">Salmorejo<span class="italic">, a thick, dense, creamy version of gazpacho made with more bread, is a Córdoban specialty. It is served at all flamenco</span> cantes <span class="italic">(festivals) and at other festive occasions, together with a glass of wine. You find it in every bar and tavern in Córdoba, topped with chopped hard-boiled eggs and bits of</span> jamón serrano. <span class="italic">Some recipes have as much bread as tomatoes. In Antequera and the area south of Córdoba, they call it</span> porra <span class="italic">and add bits of canned tuna with the garnish. In Córdoba, I had a discussion about peeling the tomatoes with a group of people on a bus. Most said you have to peel them, but a couple who had food processors admitted they did not. I do not peel them.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 to 7 ounces (6 to 7 slices) crustless white bread, preferably day-old</p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds tomatoes</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 4 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1½ to 2 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun">½ to ¾ teaspoon superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE GARNISH</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ pound sliced <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> or prosciutto, chopped</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the bread in a food processor and process it into fine crumbs. Pour into a serving bowl.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cut the tomatoes into quarters and remove the hard white bits at the stem ends. Blend in the food processor until the peel shows only as tiny specks of red in the pink cream. Add the rest of the ingredients except the bread crumbs, tasting to decide how much garlic and vinegar you want, and blend well. Add the bread crumbs and mix well. Refrigerate until chilled.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve in bowls, garnished with a sprinkling of the olive oil and the chopped eggs and ham.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">For a <span class="italic">porra</span> that was once the mainstay of the peasantry of Antequera, blend 1 pound bread, soaked in water, with 1 pound tomatoes, quartered; 1 green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 4 pieces; 4 to 5 crushed garlic cloves; ¾ cup extra virgin olive oil; and salt and red or white wine vinegar to taste. Garnish with chopped eggs and <span class="italic">jamón</span> and flaked canned tuna.</p>
