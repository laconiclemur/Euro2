<p class="chapterTitle1"><a href="contents.html#p03ch13rec_04" shape="rect" class="calibre9">crème brûlée with a spanish flavor</a></p>
</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Some Spanish chefs now make</span> crema catalana <span class="italic">like crème brûlée, flavored with lemon or orange peel and sometimes cinnamon instead of vanilla. I have to include it, as I just adore the contrast of the light cream (it is silkier than the traditional cream with cornstarch), with its slight orange flavor, and the crisp layer of caramel on the top. To make a good caramel topping, you will need a mini blowtorch. Putting the crème under the broiler to caramelize does not work well.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups heavy cream</p>
<p class="qun">Grated zest of 1 orange</p>
<p class="qun">6 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun1">⅓ cup superfine sugar, plus about 6 tablespoons for the topping</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the cream with the orange zest in a saucepan over low heat until almost boiling.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the ⅓ cup sugar in a bowl until pale and creamy. Very gradually pour in the hot cream, starting with half a ladleful, so that the eggs do not curdle, whisking constantly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Ladle into 6 small ramekins so that they are not quite full to the brim. Place them in a large baking pan and pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the ramekins (this water bath is called a bain-marie). Bake in a preheated 300°F oven for about 25 minutes, or until the custards are set but still slightly wobbly in the middle. Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, covered with plastic wrap.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To serve, sprinkle about 1½ teaspoons of sugar over the top of each chilled crème and very gently shake the ramekin to spread it evenly. Caramelize with a mini blowtorch until a thin layer of amber caramel is formed. Then sprinkle another 1½ teaspoons sugar over the caramel, gently shake the ramekins, and caramelize again to form a thick, crunchy, dark amber caramel. Do not let it get too dark, or the caramel will taste bitter.</p>
