<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pere al vino rosso con zabaglione al moscato</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Few children I know grow up routinely eating such delicacies as poached pears for dessert. But for Gianni’s aunt Angela, making this warm, colorful dish was just the trick to keep him and his siblings occupied, especially on dark winter evenings while their parents were working at the family trattoria. “Aunt Angela would poach pears or apples on the wood-burning stove,” recalls Gianni. “Some nights, for a special treat, she would whip up a <span class="txit">zabaglione</span> because she knew we loved this sweet sauce almost more than the fruit.”</p>
<p class="indent">These pears may be poached one day in advance. Cool, cover, and refrigerate in their poaching liquid. Return the pears to room temperature and reduce the sauce just before serving. I find using a vegetable peeler the easiest way to peel the pears and avoid gouging into the flesh of the fruit.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PEARS</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 firm ripe Bosc pears, peeled, stems left intact</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups fruity red wine, such as Beaujolais, Merlot, or Dolcetto d’Alba</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 2-inch cinnamon stick</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon loosely packed long thin strips lemon zest (from about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> lemon)</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ZABAGLIONE</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large egg yolks</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup muscat wine or other sparkling wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons Marsala wine</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Trim the base of the pears so they will stand upright on a plate. Place the pears in a small saucepan; they should fit snugly. Sprinkle the sugar over the pears, then pour the wine over to cover (water may be added if necessary). Add the cloves, cinnamon stick, <a id="page_347"/>and lemon zest. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cook until the pears are still firm but tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the pears to cool in the wine mixture.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pears to a plate and set aside, reserving the wine in the saucepan. Over high heat, boil the wine, reducing the liquid to a thick syrup measuring about <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh sieve and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Fill the bottom of a double boiler with water to a depth just below but not touching the bottom of the insert. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. In the top of the double boiler, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, muscat, and Marsala. Reduce the heat to medium to simmer the water. Fit the top of the double boiler into the bottom of the pot and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it thickens and becomes frothy and light, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat immediately.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Distribute the zabaglione equally among four dessert plates or shallow bowls. Brush each pear with some of the syrup and place in the center of the zabaglione. Extra syrup may be drizzled on the rims of the plates or bowls. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> This zabaglione may be served as a dessert on its own, garnished with fresh berries, or topped with sweet chocolate shavings. Prepare the zabaglione sauce as described in the recipe. Remove from the heat and cool by placing the pan in a large bowl filled with ice water. With an electric mixer, whip 1 cup heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the chilled zabaglione. Pour into individual glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving, or prepare one day in advance.</p>
