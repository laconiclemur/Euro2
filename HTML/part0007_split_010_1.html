  <h3 class="h3a">Borlotti bean and vegetable soup served on bread</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Poor families traditionally served bean soup on bread to add bulk to the family meal. Sometimes the soup was poured into the empty cavity of bread rolls – the scooped-out bread being used for breadcrumbs or in other dishes. This is a nutritious recipe packed with vegetables, and the red onion added at the end gives the soup crunch. If you don’t have borlotti beans, you can use cannellini.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/1¼ cups dried borlotti beans, soaked in water overnight</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 carrots, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 celery stalks, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">140g/5oz chicory, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 small leeks, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz savoy cabbage, shredded</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">1.2 litres/2 pints/5 cups hot water</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 slices of country bread, toasted</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 small red onion, thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="para">Drain the beans, rinse and put them in a large saucepan. Add the sage, garlic and enough water to cover the beans. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 1 hour, or until the beans are tender and cooked (check the packet instructions). Drain the beans and discard the garlic. Mash a quarter of the beans and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat, add the carrots, celery and tomatoes and sweat for a couple of minutes. Add the chicory, leeks and cabbage, season, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes. Add the hot water and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes. Add the whole beans, mashed beans and parsley and continue to cook gently for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the heat and taste for seasoning. Put a slice of toasted bread in each of four bowls and pour over the bean soup. Top with a few slices of red onion, drizzle with olive oil and serve.</p>
