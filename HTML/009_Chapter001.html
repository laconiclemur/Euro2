  <p class="noindent">Appetizers, when shared with friends or family, bring relaxation and enjoyment. They afford people an opportunity to unwind before the main meal, and show a caring host or hostess. In lives crowded with responsibilities appetizers enhance the dinner hour and the time allocated for enjoyment. They do not require an immense effort of time, or means, only a little creativity.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are numerous foods you can attach to toothpicks by themselves or in combinations and position into fruits or vegetables. You can use a combination of ingredients, for example Jarlsberg cheese and radishes, cocktail sausages broiled with a piece of bacon, or olives and cheese. Or thread separately, fresh small mushrooms, green or black olives, small pickles, berries, or bits of fruit on to the toothpick. Attach all of one kind into a fruit or intermingle them so as to form a colorful pattern.</p>

  <p class="h3">Walnuts and Cheese (Valnøtter og ost)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Walnuts taste excellent with cheese. Normanna or Roquefort have a piquant taste, try mixing them with a little cream or butter. Or use cream cheese mixed with crushed, well-drained pineapple.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">Walnut halves</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter or light cream</p>

  <p class="ing">Normanna cheese (Norwegian Roquefort)</p>

  <p class="ingl">Green grapes</p>

  <p class="noindent">Rub cheese through a sieve, or mash with a fork, and blend with a little butter (room temperature) or cream. Place a small amount of cheese on whole walnut halves, press a grape into the cheese on one half, and top with the other half. Attach a toothpick into the center and place into desired fruit. To give added color, place fruit on a bed of curly endive.</p>

  <p class="h3">Meatball Snacks (Kjøttkakepinnemat)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Make bite-size Norwegian meatballs. Attach to a toothpick. Add a small piece of marinaded, well-drained cucumber or a small piece of Boston lettuce (for marinade see Cucumber salad <a href="../Text/011_Chapter003.html#page_30">p. 30</a>). Place into desired vegetable.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/13-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Cheese Trays (Ostebretter)</p>

  <p class="vsleftpara"><span class="italic">Make some great cheese platters with fruit for an evening snack, a light supper, or desserts after a light buffet or dinner.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serve cheese with <span class="italic">kjeks</span>, a dry cookie-like cracker, hardtack, or any kind of bread that does not clash with the cheese flavors. Vegetables such as celery, radishes, tomatoes, or cucumbers taste delicious with cheese. Or add fruit such as sliced apples, oranges or tangerine wedges, kiwi fruit, pears, or grapes. If you <a id="page_14"/>use apple slices or bananas, use a little lemon juice to prevent the fruit from darkening.</p>

  <p class="indent">You need a minimum of two to three different kinds of cheese for just two people or for several people you might want up to five or six different kinds of cheese (for example, Ridder, Brie, Jarlsberg, Norzola, and a typical dessert cheese like Ridder). And among Norwegian-Americans, no matter what the occasion, there will be someone on the lookout for brown, sweet goat cheese. Choose cheese with different flavors and textures, something for everyone to enjoy.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some soft cheeses come in their own little containers and look best in these. Place them directly on the cheese tray. The hard cheese may be left in a whole piece or partly pre-sliced. Cut into logs and stack crisscross, or cube some of the cheeses and place in small clear glass bowls with toothpicks nearby.</p>

  <p class="indent">When arranging a tray, take color and flavor into consideration. Strategically place the fruit or vegetables to be used in between the cheeses. Depending on the size of your platter you may add crackers, hardtack, or bread sticks directly to the platter. If you have several types place them on a separate platter or in a breadbasket with a colorful doily.</p>

  <p class="h3">Marinated Edam Cheese (Marinért edamerost)</p>

  <p class="vsleftpara1"><span class="italic">I shall always be appreciative to Anna-Karin Lindstad of Tine for sharing this recipe with me. It is a marvelous delicacy to give as a gift at Christmas, serve guests, or when you yearn for a little godbit for yourself. Serve with crackers or dark bread.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">11 oz. (300 g.) scant Edam cheese</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. oregano</p>

  <p class="ing">1 red paprika, cut in strips</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. thyme</p>

  <p class="ing">1¼ cups (3 dl) olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">2 garlic cloves</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. green peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing">⅞ cup (2 dl) white vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. red pepper, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/14-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Dice cheese the size of sugar cubes. Prick with a fork to allow the marinade to be absorbed. Mix all ingredients for marinade in a heavy-bottomed casserole and bring to a boil. Cool. Layer cheese and paprika in a jar and pour marinade over all. Cover and chill. Keeps 2–3 weeks in the refrigerator. Let the cheese come to room temperature before serving, allowing it to come into full flavor.</p>

  <p class="h3">Ridder Appetizer (Ridder appetittvekker)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/14-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">A beautiful, tasty, nutritious, and simple appetizer made with Ridder ost, the distinctive dessert cheese.</p>

  <p class="ing1"><a id="page_15"/>Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">Ridder cheese</p>

  <p class="ing">Lemon juice</p>

  <p class="ing">Mint leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">Honeydew melon, ripe</p>

  <p class="ingl">Strawberries</p>

  <p class="noindent">Cut a long strip of Ridder cheese with a cheese slicer while cheese is still chilled. Fold it up like a rose. Slice 5 small wedges of honeydew melon, about 1-inch (2 ½-cm) thick, and cut in half. Sprinkle with lemon juice and place like a pin wheel on a clear glass plate. Place your cheese flower in the center and garnish with mint leaves and strawberries.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Open-Face Sandwich Tidbits (Appetittbiter)</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">A tray of bite-size sandwiches will get any meal off to a good start. They should be made just before your guests arrive so they will be fresh, crisp, and tasty. Use firm bread and cut out desired shapes, rectangles, rounds, diamonds, and so on. Because they are small, use toothpicks to hold the toppings in place. Any of the sandwich fillings printed in this book can be used, but in bite-size portions. Decorate with cocktail onions, small olives, slices of cucumbers, cocktail tomato wedges, chopped green onions, chives, parsley, and dill sprigs. Whichever combination you choose, make it colorful. And always top bread with a small piece of crisp lettuce before adding sandwich ingredients. Display your appetizers on a serving platter covered with an attractive doily. Figure on 3 to 4 cocktail sandwiches per person. Here are a few samples:</p>

  <p class="noindent5"><span class="bold">Brie (<span class="italic">Brie</span>):</span> Add a small pie-shaped piece with grapes or walnut half.</p>

  <p class="noindent5"><span class="bold">Sardines in tomato sauce:</span> Need nothing additional but a piece of Boston lettuce tucked under one corner.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Sardine Spread (Sardinp</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">legg)</span></p>
