<p class="yield">SERVES 4 TO 6</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This lovely, vibrant dish, with its sweet tones and vinegary tang, comes from Alicante, a region south of Valencia with abundant fields of beets. Beet season is at its best during summer through fall, a time when beets are especially nice as a salad, tapa, or alongside a simple roasted chicken.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     The beets can be boiled (about 45 minutes), but I prefer roasting them, which draws out a deeper, more nuanced sweetness. Note that roasting time varies from 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the beets. Begin checking for doneness after half an hour.</span></strong></p>

</div>
<ul>
<li>3 FRESH MEDIUM BEETS, BETWEEN 5 AND 7 OUNCES/140 TO 200 G EACH</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML RED OR WHITE WINE VINEGAR</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS MINCED FRESH FLAT-LEAF PARSLEY</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Wash but do not peel the beets. Leave the root ends and at least 1 inch/ 2.5 cm of stems on them.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a baking dish or deep, ovenproof pan, arrange the beets and pour 1½&gt; cups/360 ml water around them. Cover with aluminum foil. Roast until tender, about 45 minutes. A knife tip poked into the center should enter with little resistance. Remove from the oven and let cool.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Trim the ends and slip off the skins. Halve the beets lengthwise and then cut them crosswise into slices slightly less than ¼ inch/½&gt; cm thick. Place them in a wide bowl, cover with the vinegar, and season with salt and pepper. Let marinate for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Transfer the beets to a colander to drain for 10 minutes. (Do not rinse.) Arrange them on a platter or in a wide salad bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil, scatter over the parsley, and toss before serving.</p>
