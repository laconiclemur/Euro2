  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page260"></a>THE POACHED EGGS A LA BOURGUIGNONNE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">In a professional kitchen the sauce would be prepared in advance, with a <em>roux</em> base to thicken it, simmered for at least ½ hour to rid it of its “floury” taste, a spoonful of meat glaze added for extra body and succulence, and lightly buttered at the last moment. Another red wine <em>court-bouillon</em> would then be kept on hand for use as poaching liquid. A <em>beurre manié</em> is less satisfactory as a thickening agent, but more practical in a home kitchen. The unpleasant floury taste that many people fear in all flour-thickened sauces is present only in a sauce in which the flour has cooked too short a time, but not, mysteriously, in a <em>beurre manié</em>-thickened sauce, in which it is subjected to no cooking.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Oeufs en Meurette</em>, also Burgundian and more authentically regional, are similar, but simpler of presentation: A <em>roux</em>-thickened red wine sauce is simmered for ½ hour or so with little glazed onions and bacon or lean salt-pork <em>lardons</em>, first parboiled and cooked in butter, and the eggs are poached, with sauce and garnish, in individual casseroles or ramekins, in the oven. Croutons may be sprinkled over the surface just before serving.</p>

  <p class="center3">Oeufs Pochés à la Bourguignonne</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Mirepoix</em> (<em>see</em> <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page75">this page</a> <em>for method</em>)<em>:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large onion</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium carrots</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large pinch mixed herbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ crumbled bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>parsley</em> (<em>leaves, stems, roots</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 slice (about 1½ ounces) prosciutto or Bayonne-type ham, finely chopped (not the heavily smoked, sweet-flavored variety)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page261"></a>1 bottle red wine (preferably the same as served at table)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 thick slices firm, close-textured white bread, crusts removed andcorners rounded</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 6 tablespoons</em> (<em>3 ounces</em>) <em>butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic, peeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 very fresh eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Beurre manié:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter and 1 heaping tablespoon flour, mashed with a fork into a uniform paste</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Simmer the <em>mirepoix</em> and wine together, uncovered, for a good ½ hour, or until reduced by half, taste for salt, and pass the reduction through a fine sieve, pressing the debris well to extract all flavor.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the bread slices in butter in heavy-bottomed skillets or <em>sauteuses</em> over a low flame until golden and crisp on both surfaces, adding more butter at the moment of turning, if necessary. Rub 1 surface of each with a clove of garlic and arrange them on a preheated serving platter, garlic sides up.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring the liquid back to a simmer and carefully break in the eggs, opening each cracked egg just over the liquid’s surface so that it slips gently in (or break them, one at a time, onto a saucer before slipping each into the hot liquid—this permits one to remove any fragment of shell that may remain, or to put aside for other purposes any eggs the yolks of which may have broken). Cover tightly, turn off the flame (or turn it as low as possible—it is a question of how effectively the receptacle retains heat), and leave to poach for a couple of minutes, or until the white is softly coagulated, but the yolk still liquid. (For this quantity of eggs, it may be more practical to poach 4 at a time.) Remove them carefully with a perforated skimming spoon, trim the edge of each, if necessary (very fresh eggs hold their form well—if not absolutely fresh, they tend to spread out, but will hold better if chilled when broken), place one on each crouton and sprinkle with pepper. Bring the liquid back to a simmer, whisk in the <em>beurre</em> <em>manié</em>, adding it bits at a time until the sauce is lightly thickened, and pass the sauce through a fine sieve over the eggs. Sprinkle with parsley.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page262"></a>THE BEEF TRIPE A LA LYONNAISE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Gras-double à la lyonnaise</em> is made with a combination of different stomach and intestine parts. Honeycomb tripe is indicated here because the other parts are rarely available in America. Usually onions and tripe are both sautéed in lard rather than in butter and olive oil, and finished with vinegar instead of lemon. The substitutions here represent personal taste.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beef tripe is sold precooked. If raw, it should be well scrubbed and rinsed in vinegar-water and simmered for about 6 hours in a <em>blanc</em> (water ever so slightly thickened with flour—about 1 tablespoon for a large pot of water—onion, thyme, bay leaf, salt and a dash of vinegar or lemon juice).</p>

  <p class="indent">Chitterlings, or calves’ intestines (<em>fraise de veau</em>), may be prepared in the same way. The last-minute addition of sautéed onions is characteristic of many sautéed preparations <em>à la lyonnaise</em>. It is essential that the onions be neither chopped nor too thinly sliced and that they be added at the last moment in order that their sweetness remain in clean juxtaposition to the flavor of the principle element.</p>

  <p class="indent">If an accompaniment is desired, a <em>Paillasson</em> (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c28_r1.htm#c28-s109">Potato Straw Cake</a>) is perfect, in which case a simple green salad would be more suitable than the composed salad.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c17-s63"><em><span class="color">Beef Tripe à la Lyonnaise</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gras-double à la Lyonnaise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ¾ pound sweet onions, halved and sliced—if only strong onions are available, they should be sliced, parboiled for a few minute and drained</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page263"></a><em>1½ pounds precooked honeycomb tripe</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of ½ lemon</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cook the onions, salted, in butter, over a low flame, stirring and tossing regularly, until soft and yellowed—about 15 minutes. Just before removing them from the heat, turn the flame up and toss them until lightly browned. Put them aside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the tripe into bands 2½–3 inches wide, cut each band crosswise into approximately ¼-inch strips, and sponge them dry in paper towels. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy <em>sauteuse</em> or skillet (not enamelware) until it gives of its distinctive perfume, add the tripe, season with salt and pepper, and cook over a high flame, frequently tossing and stirring and scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon, for from 8 to 10 minutes, or until some of the strips show signs of browning and crisping at the edges. (To be sautéed to the point of being dry and lightly browned, the quantity of tripe must be small in relation to the size of the <em>sauteuse</em>, but it is a question of opinion whether this result is essential to the quality of the dish.) Add the onions, toss everything together for another minute or so, and turn it out onto a heated serving platter. Squeeze the lemon juice into the hot pan; swirl it around and sprinkle it over the tripe.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE COMPOSED SALAD</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Artichokes, if young and tender, the chokes still undeveloped, are best raw, simply “turned,” sliced, and soaked in lemon water, in a salad of this sort. Parboiled fresh, young green beans, precooked salsify (oyster plant) and avocados are other possible ingredients. This salad may either accompany or follow an ungarnished main course.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c17-s64"><a id="page264"></a><em><span class="color">Composed Salad</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Salade Composée</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium-sized potatoes of a firm, nonmealy variety</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ⅓ cup dry white wine (enough to cover potato slices)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">Artichoke Bottoms</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 celery heart</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon fines herbes (equal parts of whatever is available: chervil, parsley, chives, tarragon)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>Vinaigrette</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small head lettuce (not iceberg)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Boil the potatoes in their skins, peel them the moment they are drained, slice them into a bowl, cover with the white wine and leave to cool. Slice the artichoke bottoms, slice the celery heart crosswise, and put them, along with the drained potatoes (the white wine may be put aside for other cooking purposes) and half the <em>fines herbes</em>, to marinate in the vinaigrette. Loosely place the lettuce leaves, washed and gently sponged dry in a towel, on top, sprinkle with the remaining <em>fines herbes</em>, and toss only at the moment of serving.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c17-s65"><em><span class="color">Pineapple Ice</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Granité à l’Ananas</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large ripe pineapple</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ¾ cup of sugar (or to taste)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 3 oranges, strained</em> (<em>about 1 cup</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the top of the pineapple, cutting in at an angle all around, so as to form a lid, and pare the inside of its flesh. Remove all the pulp <a id="page265"></a>from the inside of the pineapple. To do this, cut around and about halfway down, close to the skin, but being careful not to pierce it, with a long, sharp, pointed knife; then cut all around the core and make spokelike incisions between the two circular cuts. Remove the wedges with the help of a tablespoon and continue scraping around the core until all the pulp has been removed and the shell is empty, except for the upright core. Cut into the base of the core with the point of the knife and break it off as cleanly as possible.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mash the pulp with a pestle and work it well in a sieve until all the juice possible has been extracted. Mix about 1 cup of the juice with the sugar and boil to form a syrup. When it is cool, mix it with the rest of the pineapple juice and the orange juice, pour the mixture into 2 ice-cube trays and put them to freeze, along with the pineapple shell and lid (lacking a sufficiently large freezing compartment, chill the pineapple separately as well as possible). After an hour or so, stir the mixture, scraping all sol id parts from the sides and bottoms of the trays and mashing it together with the liquid. Repeat this process a couple of times over the course of approximately 3 hours or until, when mixed together, a semifirm but still mushy consistency is achieved; then spoon it into the pineapple shell. It may then be left in the freezing compartment for another hour or so and allowed to become slightly firmer—but if served frozen solid, it loses all its quality.</p>
