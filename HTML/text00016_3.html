 SMOKED PAPRIKA CORNED BEEF &amp; BAKED BEAN WRAP</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0001791">
<em>Although I had heard of corned beef while I was growing up, I never really came across it until about 10 years ago. Out of curiosity, I bought a tin. It then sat in my cupboard for 5 years before I even considered doing anything with it. It’s certainly an acquired taste. I knew my old neighbour Norman lived on the stuff, but when I told him I was about to spice it up he was unimpressed and said it should only ever be eaten fried in slices and served with mashed potatoes and a fried egg. Of course, I did what I do best and ignored every word he said, and changed it anyway. This is my simple way of spicing up corned beef for a quick and easy meal.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Place a medium frying pan on a medium heat and add the oil. Once it has just warmed up, add the garlic, stir for a few seconds, then add the chopped onion. Season to taste and cook for about 5 minutes, until the onion has softened.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001805">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Stir in the smoked paprika and cook for 2 minutes. If the mixture begins to stick, just add a tablespoon of water and let it loosen.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001806">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Stir in the corned beef – it will start to break up a little.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001807">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Add the baked beans and cook gently for 5 minutes, making sure you keep an eye on it. The mixture is quite thick, so it will have a tendency to stick.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001808">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Take off the heat and stir in the chopped coriander.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001809">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the tortilla wraps into the microwave for 30 seconds, to warm them up and make them a little more flexible.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001810">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Place a quarter of the corned beef mixture in the centre of a warmed tortilla wrap. Fold over the two edges. Take the closest part of the wrap to you and fold over. Tuck the wrap in and roll. Cut in half at an angle.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001811">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Serve each wrap with a wedge of lime and a spoonful of Greek yoghurt.</p>
