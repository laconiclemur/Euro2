(The traditional recipe calls for French <em class="calibre7">lardons</em> but here in the U.S. I substitute with Pancetta, which you can find already cut at Trader Joe’s or cut to order at good grocery stores and butchers)</p><p class="calibre6">1 large peeled shallot, finely chopped</p><p class="calibre6">2 incredibly fresh egg (<span class="underline">yolks only)</span></p><p class="calibre6">½ cup heavy cream</p><p class="calibre6">½ cup Parmesan cheese (preferably shaved)</p><p class="calibre6">⅓ cup finely chopped fresh chives or parsley (optional)</p><p class="calibre6">Salt and black pepper</p><p class="calibre6">Freshly made or store bought pasta such as linguini or spaghetti</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre39"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- Place the diced pancetta in a pan and cook on medium heat until golden.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Lower the heat and add the chopped shallot. Stir and cook until the shallot bits are translucent, not golden.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Add cream and black pepper; stir well. Taste the cream. Usually the pancetta contains enough salt for this dish but you can add salt to taste. Because the pasta cooks in salted water and you will be adding Parmesan cheese, the sauce can become overly salty, so keep a light touch.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Keep sauce warm on extremely low heat (so that the cream does not separate) until ready to serve.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Cook your favorite pasta (or better yet, make fresh pasta from scratch... but that’s my next book) in a large pot of salted water until al dente according to the package’s direction. Drain.</p><p class="calibre6">6- At the table, pour the Carbonara sauce on the pasta. Right before stirring add the two egg yolks, drizzle with the herbs. Stir and serve. Let everyone add Parmesan to taste.</p><p class="calibre6">7- A crisp green salad with a light vinaigrette and a glass of chardonnay will accompany your <em class="calibre7">pâtes à la carbonara</em> very well.</p></div></div></body></html>
