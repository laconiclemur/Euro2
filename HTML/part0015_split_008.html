  <h3 class="h3a">Lemon marmalade</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">I grew up with lemons – the best type, too, from Amalfi. We used them in a lot of our cooking, for medicinal purposes or just sliced and eaten on their own. Strangely, though, lemon marmalade was not made; it was not until I came to England that I discovered the delights of marmalade. In more recent years, oranges and lemons, which grow in abundance in southern Italy, have begun to appear in the form of jams and preserves. This lemon marmalade is really simple to make; the secret is to buy the best lemons you can find. It is not only good on toast, but is also delicious served with cheese. This recipe is very natural and a must for lemon lovers – if you prefer a less bitter taste, I suggest you boil the lemon peel another couple of times in addition to the one mentioned in this recipe.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes about 500ml/18fl oz/2 cups</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz unwaxed organic lemons</p>

  <p class="ing2">500g/1lb 2oz/2½ cups granulated sugar</p>

  <p class="para">Wash and dry the lemons well, then peel and set the peel aside. Remove and discard the pith. Slice the lemons very finely, discarding any pips. Place in a nonmetallic container. Add the sugar and mix well together, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to macerate for 12 hours.</p>

  <p class="para"><a href="part0015_split_002.html#pg172a" class="calibre1">Sterilize jars</a> with a total volume of 500ml/18fl oz/2 cups.</p>

  <p class="para">Finely chop the peel and place in a pan with water to cover, bring to the boil, then boil for 1 minute. Drain well.</p>

  <p class="para1">Put the peel and sugary lemons in a saucepan and cook on a low heat for about 1 hour, until the marmalade begins to thicken. Remove from the heat, pour into sterilized jars, cover with lids, turn upside down and leave until cold. Label and store in your cupboard. Once opened, store in the fridge.</p>
