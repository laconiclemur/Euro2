			<p class="rec-intro">This was originally eaten as a savoury at the end of a meal, but I like to serve it as a starter or lunch dish or even as a light main course. Traditionally this recipe was served in puff pastry vol-au-vents, but I prefer the toasted brioche, which adds a little richness and texture to this extravagant, luxurious delight.</p>

			<p class="body">Prepare the woodcock for roasting and remove the guts – or ask your butcher to do this for you. Set the upper intestines, heart and liver aside for later, but discard the gizzard which will be full of gravel. Season the woodcock and push the beak through the legs to hold it in place. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Heat the oil in a roasting pan on top of the stove, add the woodcock and brown them briefly. Add a tablespoon of the butter and heat until it is foaming but not burnt, then put the pan of woodcock in the hot oven for no more than 8 minutes – the meat should still be very pink. Leave to rest in a warm place. </p>
			<p class="body">Drain the fat from the roasting pan and discard, then add another tablespoon of butter to the pan and heat it on the hob. When the butter is hot, add the chopped shallot and garlic, cook for 30 seconds, then add the woodcock entrails and chicken livers. Season well and cook over a high heat for 2 minutes until cooked pink, then add the brandy and flambé. Press the mixture through a fine sieve, then spread it over the toasted brioche and keep warm. Remove the breasts from the woodcock and split each head in half along the beak.</p>
			<p class="body">Grease a heavy-based pan with the remaining butter, then add the eggs and cook over a medium heat while stirring with a spatula. When the eggs are almost completely cooked, season and add the double cream. Keep them nice and creamy – don’t overcook them. Serve the eggs with the brioche, a woodcock breast and half a head. Add a little game jus, if you like. </p>
