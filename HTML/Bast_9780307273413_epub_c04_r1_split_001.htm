  <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span>I<span class="small1">T WAS IN THE HOME OF MY COUSINS LIDIA AND GIOVANNI BOSAZZI</span> that I tasted Ligurian food for the first time. They had left Istria soon after it became a part of Yugoslavia, and by the time my parents decided to escape Istria ten years later, Lidia and Giovanni were already well established in Genova, the historic capital city of Liguria. I will never forget our first trip to visit them, approaching the coast by train from Trieste, passing in and out of tunnels, the train whistling as we entered and the sound dissipating as we came out; the shimmering sea playing hide-and-seek as we zoomed past clusters of houses—bright pinks, mustardy yellows, blues of all shades—that converged into a village at the sea’s edge.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although my parents were apprehensive on that trip, having so recently escaped the communist bloc, for us children the trip was filled with discovery. New cousins, new places. But most of all I remember the first meal that my cousin Lidia cooked for us. She was a schoolteacher, yet she had time to make a lovely meal for us—a crostata stuffed with shredded zucchini, rice, and cheese. My first bite into that warm crust, redolent of sweet, buttery Ligurian olive oil, still lingers in my taste memory.</p>

  <p class="indent">After that came a steaming vegetable soup. Surely, it is not often that a child has an epiphany when eating vegetable soup. So why do I recall Cousin Lidia’s <em class="calibre4">zuppa di verdure</em> so vividly, many years later? It was the garlic: Liguria is known for its aromatic garlic, and that soup was full of it. So was the <em class="calibre4">aggiadda</em>, a sauce Lidia served that day, a pungent, creamy emulsion of olive oil, vinegar-soaked bread, and lots of Ligurian garlic. I indulged that day in a garlicky feast that has guided my palate for more than half a century.</p>

  <p class="indent">As you can see in the map, Liguria is a thin strip of land where northwestern Italy hugs the Mediterranean Sea—or Mar Ligure, as it is called locally. Sheltered from the cold north by the mountains, and basking in the sun’s warm rays reflected by the shimmering Mar Ligure, the whole of Liguria enjoys an ideal microclimate; it is a true paradise. Indeed, my dear friend Fred Plotkin, an extraordinary musical historian and cookbook writer, named his Ligurian cookbook <em class="calibre4">Recipes from Paradise.</em></p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page90"></a>Giovanni and Lidia are well into their eighties now, and I go to Genova to see them as often as I can. And on every trip, it seems, I discover another corner of this paradise called Liguria. Recently, in late summer, my friend Mario joined me in Genova for a culinary adventure. Before we even left the city, we stopped for lunch in the <em class="calibre4">zona del Porto</em>, the old port section, at a little trattoria, Antica Osteria di Vico Palla, a family-run establishment where I knew we would find superb local fare.</p>

  <p class="indent">As soon as we sat down, a basket of deliciously resilient focaccia was put on the table along with a bowl of oil-cured <em class="calibre4">taggiasca</em> olives. These small oval olives, fruity and delicate in flavor, are the preeminent variety pressed for delicious Ligurian olive oil. And when cured—whether in brine or oil—the <em class="calibre4">taggiasca</em> is one of my favorite olives for cooking or simply in an antipasto. Then we had <em class="calibre4">farinata</em>, a flavorful treat made from a batter of <em class="calibre4">ceci</em> (chickpea) flour, water, olive oil, and salt that’s baked in the oven. With its delicious nutty taste and velvety mouth-feel, it’s a favorite snack of Genovese, sold at bakeries and by street vendors all over the city.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mario had <em class="calibre4">sbirra</em>—a traditional dish of tripe with potatoes and tomatoes—and though I forked some tripe from his bowl now and then, for me Liguria is the place to indulge my love for vegetables. So I ordered <em class="calibre4">Zuppa di Verdure all’Agliata</em>, the delicious vegetable soup redolent of garlic. And of course we had to sample the Osteria’s rendition of <em class="calibre4">Trenette con Pesto alla Genovese</em>, the region’s signature pasta dish. This one had all the classic elements—diced potato and green beans cooked with the long <em class="calibre4">trenette</em>, all dressed with a brilliant green basil pesto and final flourishes of superb Ligurian olive oil and grated cheeses.</p>

  <p class="indent">Two more vegetables <em class="calibre4">alla Genovese</em> followed: one, a plate of braised spinach with pignoli nuts and raisins and delightful anchovies, and the other, sautéed green beans with anchovies and glints of lemon as well. The highlight of that meal, though, was the stuffed baked vegetables—peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, and ripe tomato—with the lightest of fillings, intense with the aroma of the vegetables, all baked to a crispy top.</p>

  <p class="indent">As we headed out of town, winding up and down and around the coast road, I observed (not for the first time) that there is something very green about Ligurian cuisine, which reflects the landscape. All the houses have terraces full of blossoming flowers and gardens bursting with vegetables and herbs—especially basil, a Ligurian variety with small leaves no bigger than the end of <a class="calibre8" id="page91"></a>a Q-tip. It has an intense flavor and a pleasant scent without a trace of the mint found in the large-leaf basil Americans are familiar with.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_039_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="figure1"><em class="calibre4">Stuffed Vegetables</em>—Ripieni all’Antica</p>

  <p class="indent">Since it is blessed with such marvelous fresh herbs and greens, it’s no wonder that Ligurian cooking is filled with many fresh, uncooked pestos—not just the basil-and-pignoli variety. Fred Plotkin explains that Genova’s historical role as a seafaring city led directly to the creation of pesto. For centuries, Genovese mariners and traders were regarded (along with the Venetians) <a class="calibre8" id="page92"></a>as the best. After all, Cristoforo Colombo was born in Genova. At sea for weeks and months, these sailors surely yearned for the fresh flavors and herbs of their verdant Liguria. According to Fred, they returned home determined not only to feast but to find a way to bring the fresh foods with them on their next voyage. What better way than pounding and grinding them into a convenient, portable condiment? And so <em class="calibre4">pesto alla Genovese</em> was born.</p>

  <p class="indent">With Genova behind us, our late-summer journey took Mario and me southeast, toward the breathtaking stretch of Ligurian coast known as Cinque Terre—the Five Lands. Here, steep-sloped promontories stick out into the sea like extended fingers. And in between (where the fingers meet the hand), a town nestles in each fjordlike cove, its narrow streets and steep stairways winding from the rocky seaside upward to rows of houses, stacked against the cliffs and clinging to the hillsides. Visitors from around the world hike the footpaths of the Cinque Terre, from one end to another, marveling at the natural beauty and stopping in each of the picturesque towns—Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore—to rest, take pictures, and, of course, eat.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Riomaggiore we had a most memorable meal with the winemaker Paolo Fellegara, discussing the topography of this marvelous terrain. I discovered a new love—a pesto called <em class="calibre4">preboggion</em> that includes borage, chervil, chicory, and other wild herbs all ground with olive oil and garlic with pestle and mortar. The sauce dressed <em class="calibre4">trofie</em>, a twisted dry pasta typical of Liguria, topped with grated Pecorino Sardo. We sipped a 2005 Cinque Terre white Bonnani Fellegara—Paolo’s pride—and admired the shimmering sea, the source of our next course, fried sardines. The Mar Ligure is known for its small bluefish—a modest catch but great eating.</p>

  <p class="indent">As always, I yearned for fresh vegetables, and accompanying my crispy sardines came a bowl of <em class="calibre4">Condiggion</em>, a Ligurian bread salad. It was made of crunchy cucumbers, thinly sliced peppers, basil, garlic, ripe tomatoes, chicory, and chunks of day-old bread steeped in a dressing of red-wine vinegar and Ligurian olive oil, which squirted goodness with every bite I took. As I dug in deeper, I discovered slivers of <em class="calibre4">bottarga</em>, the salted, pressed, and dried roe of tuna. Known as “poor man’s caviar” and widely used in the coastal regions and in Sicily and Sardinia, where it is produced, <em class="calibre4">bottarga</em> turned that seemingly simple salad into a powerhouse of flavor and textures.</p>

  <p class="indent">Walter de Batté, the renowned Ligurian winemaker, joined us for coffee, and we finished with a glass of his Sciacchetrà, a late-harvest wine, with aromas of almonds and apricots. Available in very limited quantities, it is a wine that was much prized through the ages, then fell out of fashion; Walter is credited with its revival. Thank you, Walter, and thank you, Liguria.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c04s01.01"><a class="calibre8" id="page93"></a>R<span class="small1">ICE</span> &amp; Z<span class="small1">UCCHINI</span> C<span class="small1">ROSTATA</span></h2>

  <p class="nonindent1">Torta di Riso e Zucchine <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes 15 or more appetizer slices or several dozen hors d’oeuvres</p>

  <p class="extract">This is a generously proportioned version of the delicious rice-and-zucchini crostata, or tart, that my cousin Lidia prepared when our family first visited Genova, nearly fifty years ago. She made hers in a small baking pan, and mine is the same, only bigger! I use a half-sheet baking pan (a jelly-roll pan will work, too) lined with the olive-oil-based dough that has no leavening, is easy to make, and fantastic to roll.</p>

  <p class="indent">The large size of this crostata is necessary, I find, because the crostata disappears right away. Whether I put it on a buffet in bite-sized party pieces, bring it to a picnic, or serve it as a plated appetizer or main course with salad, everyone loves it—and has to have another piece. And in the unlikely event you do have leftovers, they can be frozen and reheated—just as good as when freshly baked.</p>

  <p class="indent">The procedure is straightforward and quick, though there’s one important (and interesting) step you must leave time for: steeping the uncooked rice with the shredded zucchini. Since squash is a watery vegetable and rice is dry and starchy, this steeping allows the rice to extract most of the vegetal water from the zucchini. In this way, the grain is softened enough to cook during the baking time, and without absorbing all the liquid from the ricotta and milk. The result is a moist, creamy, and flavorful filling.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A food processor; a baking stone, if you have one; a 12-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet (a half-sheet pan)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the dough: Put the 2 cups flour and the salt in the food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse a few seconds to aerate. Mix the oil and water together in a spouted measuring cup. With the processor running, pour the liquid through the feed tube and process about 30 seconds, until a soft dough forms and gathers on the blade. If it doesn’t, it is probably too dry. Add more water, in small amounts, until you have a smooth, very soft dough.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page94"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for a minute, until it’s smooth and soft. Pat into a rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for ½ hour. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to a day, or frozen for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the filling: Shred the zucchini on the coarse holes of a box grater into a large bowl. Toss the rice and shredded zucchini together, and let sit for 30 minutes to an hour, so the grains absorb the vegetable liquid. Fold in the ricotta (breaking up any lumps), then the grated cheese, scallions, beaten eggs, milk, and salt, stirring until thoroughly mixed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you’re ready to bake the <em class="calibre4">torta</em>, set a rack in the bottom half of the oven—with a baking stone on it, if you have one—and heat the oven to 375°. Spread the butter on the bottom and sides of the pan.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to a rectangle that’s at least 4 inches longer and wider than the baking sheet. Transfer the dough to the pan, either by folding it in quarters and lifting it onto the sheet, or by rolling it up around the floured rolling pin and then unfurling it over the baking sheet. When the dough is centered over the pan, then gently press it flat against the bottom and rim of the pan, leaving even flaps of overhanging dough on all sides. (If the dough tears as you are moving it, patch it with a bit of dough from the edges.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour and scrape the rice-zucchini filling into the dough-lined pan, and spread it to fill the crust in an even layer. Fold the dough flaps over the top of the filling, pleating the corners, to form a top crust border that looks like a picture frame, with the filling exposed in the middle.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the pan in the oven (on the heated stone), and bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is set, 45 minutes to an hour. About halfway through the baking time, turn the pan in the oven, back to front, for even color and cooking.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cool the <em class="calibre4">torta</em> on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes to set the filling before slicing. The <em class="calibre4">torta</em> can be served warm or at room temperature, cut into appetizer or bite-sized pieces in any shape you like—squares, rectangles, triangles, or diamonds.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Ripieni all’Antica <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 3 dozen vegetable morsels</p>

  <p class="extract">A platter of baked stuffed vegetables is one of the everyday delights of the Genovese table, and I always sample a seasonal assortment when I visit the city. The array is never exactly the same, and this recipe is a guideline that you can (and should) vary according to your tastes and what’s available.</p>

  <p class="indent">I give you one delicious and easy bread stuffing, along with procedures for preparing and baking a few of the most typical vegetables used in Genova—bell peppers, mushrooms, sweet onions, tomatoes, and zucchini. Many others can be substituted and will be delicious with this stuffing, including beets, fennel, squash, and even carrots. Of course, you don’t have to have every one of the vegetables I recommend. Stuff just a couple of different veggies, or just pick one, such as stuffed and baked big mushrooms, if that’s what you like.</p>

  <p class="indent">Like other Ligurian vegetable dishes, <em class="calibre4">ripieni all’Antica</em> can be served piping hot, warm, or at room temperature; presented on individual plates, or family-style on large platters. They make a great appetizer, a side dish for grilled steak, lamb, or chicken, or a vegetarian main course. And when I have a few leftover vegetables, I heat them up in the morning and top them with a fried or poached egg, for a special breakfast.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the stuffing: Put the bread cubes in a mixing bowl, and pour the milk over them; toss the cubes, and let them sit for a couple of minutes to absorb the liquid. When softened, gather and press the cubes together, squeezing out any excess milk (discard, or save it for your cat!), and return the moistened bread to the bowl, tearing it into shreds.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page96"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift the rehydrated porcini pieces from the soaking liquid, squeeze firmly (saving all the liquid), and chop them into fine bits. Scatter the chopped porcini, scallions, basil, grated cheese, and salt on top of the torn bread; toss and mix together with your hands. Pour in the beaten eggs, and stir with a wooden spoon or mix with your hands to form a well-blended, fairly dense stuffing.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To prepare zucchini for stuffing: Trim off the ends, and slice the squashes in half lengthwise.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To prepare bell peppers for stuffing: slice them lengthwise in half, starting at the stem, or in thirds if very large; trim away the stem and all seeds and fibers, forming cuplike pieces.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pull out the stems of white mushrooms, leaving the hollow caps for stuffing.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Peel the onions, and cut them crosswise into ¾-inch-thick slices.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When all the vegetables are prepped and all but the onions are hollowed, put the pieces (except the onion slices) in a large bowl. Toss with the olive oil and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Brush some of the oil on the onion slices, keeping them whole.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To stuff and bake the vegetables: Butter the baking dishes, arrange a rack (or two, if necessary) in the oven, and heat to 425°. Fill each vegetable piece with a tablespoon of stuffing, more or less. For zucchini, peppers, tomatoes, and mushrooms, fill the cavities with stuffing and arrange all the pieces in a baking dish, with a bit of space between the pieces. Lay flat onion slices right in the dish, and mound a spoonful of stuffing on top of each slice.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the dishes are filled (but not crowded), sprinkle all the vegetable pieces evenly with the grated cheese and remaining teaspoon salt. Scrape any olive oil left in the vegetable bowl over the stuffed pieces, and pour half of the reserved porcini-soaking liquid (leaving behind any gritty residue) into the bottom of each baking dish. Cover each dish with a tent of foil, pressing it against the dish sides and making sure it doesn’t touch the stuffing or tops of the vegetables.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bake 30 minutes, until the vegetables have started to soften and release juices, then remove the foil tents and bake until stuffing is crisped and brown, another 30 minutes or so. Switch the position of the dishes in the oven once or twice so all the pieces cook and color evenly. Serve hot from the oven, or let the vegetables cool and serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

  <p class="extract">The traditional Ligurian bread salad <em class="calibre4">condiggion</em> was the highlight of the meal we had in the Cinque Terre a few years ago (as I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter). With many textures from crunchy vegetables, vinegar-soaked bread, and tangy greens, and layers of flavor in the basil and olive-oil dressing—and a shower of dried tuna roe, <em class="calibre4">bottarga</em>, providing a touch of salt and sea—this has become one of my favorite summer salads. It is exceptionally flavorful and refreshing, and a great accompaniment to the grilled meat and fish that I prepare in summer.</p>

  <p class="indent">This salad is also open to variation, so use your favorite greens, vegetables, and even bread. I find that curly chicory, green and bitter, makes the best salad, but you can play with other seasonal greens you find in the market. And if you have some day-old whole-wheat or multigrain bread, that could be delicious here, too. Just make sure it is dry enough to be revitalized by the vinegar and dressing (if too fresh, it will crumble into mush at the bottom of the bowl).</p>

  <p class="indent">In Liguria, where <em class="calibre4">bottarga</em> is a common flavoring element, it is essential to the salad. If you have some, by all means use it (and keep it wrapped well and frozen for long storage). Otherwise, chopped anchovies are a good final addition to the salad, if you yearn for that salty fish flavor, as I do.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">In Liguria, basil grows luxuriously in every garden and naturally plays an enormous role in the region’s cuisine, as I discussed in the introduction. For this bread salad, where basil dressing is a major element, and for many other dishes in this chapter, I encourage you to find and use the freshest, most flavorful basil that you can. Though we don’t have the good fortune of Ligurian cooks, most of whom can pluck sprigs of intensely flavored, small-leaved basil right from a window box or patio planter, we Americans now have more fresh basil available to us than ever before. Fine food and farmers’ markets (in season) may have “sweet” basil for cooking in different varieties, colors, and even nuances of flavor. For these Ligurian dishes, look for a classic pesto variety like small-to-medium-leaf Genovese basil. But other types will be fine, too. Try giant-leaved basil (it’s great for wrapping around fish fillets and stuffing), or purple basil. Basils with distinctive aromas like lemon, mint, and anise are great to cook with; so is spicy Thai or Vietnamese basil.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">Even better, grow your own fresh basil, perhaps just a small pot on the windowsill. It will provide you with great flavor for many dishes, especially if you snip back the new shoots when they have four or five bright leaves. Just keep the plant from flowering and it will last for months. Garden centers and specialty seed companies sell more varieties of Italian basil than even I knew existed. But an ordinary sweet-basil plant like the ones I see in the supermarket will grow well with a bit of attention.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">And whether you grow your own or buy it, I recommend highly that in late summer and fall, or whenever fine fresh basil is abundant in your area, you should make a big batch of basil pesto in the food processor—just fresh herb leaves and extra-virgin olive oil, nothing else—and freeze it in ice-cube trays. Once it is frozen, pop the cubes out and wrap them in a bit of plastic, then seal the batch in giant ziplock bags. Protected from freezer burn, your basil-pesto cubes will provide bursts of fresh flavor in soups, tomato sauces, and vegetable pasta sauces all year long!</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Zuppa di Verdure all’Agliata <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes 4 quarts, serving 12 or more</p>

  <p class="extract">This soup exemplifies the Ligurian love of vegetables, which is one of the things <em class="calibre4">I</em> love most about that cuisine. It demonstrates that with vegetables alone—there’s no meat or meat stock in it—you can cook immensely flavorful and satisfying dishes. This is my re-creation of the heavenly vegetable soup served by my cousin Lidia Bosazzi when my parents took my brother Franco and me to Genova before we immigrated to America. With more kinds of vegetables than I could count—and that aroma of pungent garlic, which I have never forgotten—this is one of the most satisfying soups I know.</p>

  <p class="indent">More than most dishes, soups accommodate variation and improvisation, and, as usual, I encourage you to experiment with this recipe. You don’t need every vegetable in the exact amount listed for the <em class="calibre4">zuppa</em>—use what you have or like. And even the all-important garlic can be reduced (or increased) according to your family’s taste. A substitution or addition that I recommend, in fact, is to use all the aromatic onion-family members that come in springtime—fresh spring onions and spring garlic with green shoots, scallions, baby leeks. They make every soup better.</p>

  <p class="indent">At home I make this in large quantities, and that is how I share it with you. With all the work of washing and chopping vegetables, I like to have plenty of soup to enjoy right away and a couple of quarts in the freezer for a future meal. You can cut the recipe in half if you like, but I believe you go through your days feeling better when there’s a delicious soup stored at home, ready to be enjoyed and to sustain you.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">The name “pesto” comes from the verb <em class="calibre4">pestare</em>, which means “to pound” or “to crush.” As Italian cooks have long known, there are infinite possibilities when fresh herbs, spices, vegetables, nuts, fruits, and cheeses are pounded in a mortar—or, with today’s kitchen technology, processed at high speed—into a smooth, savory sauce. So, as you read the recipe for classic <em class="calibre4">pesto alla Genovese</em>, let your imagination go; think of all of your favorite flavors and how you can make your own pesto.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">The cardinal rule for all pestos is to use the freshest herbs, the best extra-virgin olive oil, the perfect cheese. And, to experience the freshness and intensity of the herbs, don’t alter their qualities by cooking them. So, when dressing pasta with an aromatic pesto, follow the basic procedures in the recipe for <em class="calibre4">Trenette</em> with Pesto Genova-Style. Quickly drain the pasta and toss it in a warm bowl or pan with the pesto (thinned with a bit of hot water from the pasta cooking pot if necessary) until all of the pasta is coated. Finish with a drizzle of oil and a sprinkle of grated cheese.</p>

  <p class="extract">This tangy, textured potato salad is much appreciated in Liguria, and it has become a favorite of mine. I like it best served warm—when the freshly cooked potatoes have just been tossed in the hot bacon-and-mustard dressing—though it is also delicious at room temperature, on a buffet or picnic table.</p>

  <p class="indent">As the name implies (and the slightly Nordic ingredients also suggest), this salad came to Liguria from somewhere else. Though I don’t <em class="calibre4">know</em> the precise origins, the Riviera Ligure has for centuries lured writers, composers, poets, and artists from other parts of Europe. Perhaps one of these creative types made this salad during a Ligurian sojourn. Certainly I have no objection that such a tasty dish, even if introduced by an outsider, took root in Liguria and became part of the regional cuisine.</p>

  <p class="extract">Vegetables prepared <em class="calibre4">alla Genovese</em> are among my favorite Ligurian dishes, made with the freshest produce and brilliantly flavored. I particularly love this sauté of spinach with anchovies, raisins, and pine nuts (and I’ve read that spinach prepared in this manner was one of Michelangelo’s favorite dishes, too).</p>

  <p class="indent">Each of the components makes a distinct contribution: The anchovies lend complexity and saltiness. The raisins bring sweetness and counterbalance the anchovies. (I give you the amounts of each that I like, but find your own balance of flavors by increasing or decreasing either.) Finally, pine nuts add a mellow, pleasing textural contrast.</p>

  <p class="indent">You can apply this trio of tastes to other vegetables; escarole, broccoli, cauliflower, and Swiss chard will all be delicious in such a preparation.</p>

Toss the spinach leaves over and over with tongs, distributing the raisins and seasonings, then cover the pan and cook for a couple of minutes, until all the spinach has wilted and released its liquid.</p>

  <p class="extract">When I say the word “pesto” to people in America (or anywhere outside Italy), I know they are thinking of <em class="calibre4">pesto alla Genovese</em>, with its lush green color and intense perfume of fresh basil leaves. Indeed, though there are countless fresh sauces that are also termed “pesto” in Italian cuisine, it seems that pasta with basil-and-pine-nut pesto is so well known that it might as well be the national Italian dish!</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page104"></a>Traditionally, long, flat <em class="calibre4">trenette</em> or shorter twisted <em class="calibre4">trofie</em> is the pasta used here, though even spaghetti is great with the pesto. For the most authentic flavor, use a sweet, small-leaved Genovese basil for the pesto—perhaps you can find it at a farmers’ market in summer, or grow it yourself. Large basil will be delicious, too. Of course, use the best extra-virgin olive oil available, in the pesto and on the pasta, preferably pressed from the marvelous <em class="calibre4">taggiasca</em> olives of Liguria.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the pesto: Put all of the basil, the garlic cloves, salt, and olive oil in the food-processor bowl. Process 10 to 15 seconds—stopping once to scrape down the sides of the bowl—to form a coarse paste.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Dump in the pine nuts, and process another 10 seconds or more (scraping down the bowl once or twice), creating a uniformly smooth bright-green paste. Add the grated cheeses to the bowl, and pulse a few times just to blend in. The pesto should be thick yet flowing; if it’s too firm, blend in olive oil, a spoonful at a time, to loosen it.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scrape the pesto into a small bowl or container, and pour a thin film of olive oil over the top surface to prevent it from discoloring. It can stay at room temperature for a couple of hours before being used. For longer keeping, lay plastic wrap on the surface of the pesto, seal the container, and refrigerate or freeze. Let the pesto return to room temperature before using.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the pasta: Bring salted water to a boil in the large pot (at least 6 quarts, with 1 tablespoon kosher salt). Drop in the potato chunks, stir, and cook them for 10 minutes, then add the green beans. Cook the beans and potatoes for another 10 minutes and then add the pasta to the pot and cook 5 minutes, until the <em class="calibre4">trenette</em> is <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em></p>

Scrape the pesto into the pan or bowl, and loosen it with a bit of the pasta boiling water (don’t cook the pesto, just warm it).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the vegetables are tender and the pasta is <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>, lift everything from the pot with a spider and tongs, drain briefly, and drop into the skillet or bowl. (If you prefer, drain the pasta and vegetables into a colander, being sure to reserve a cup or so of pasta cooking water before you pour it out.) Toss pasta, vegetables, and pesto together well—moisten with more pasta water if needed—then sprinkle the grated cheeses over, and toss again. Serve immediately in warm bowls.</p>

  <p class="extract">Thick tuna steaks are not just for grilling. The stovetop technique here is quick and convenient. You use one big skillet for browning the fish steaks, make a simple (yet complex-tasting) sauce, and put the two together for a final brief braise that marries the flavors perfectly. This is the true <em class="calibre4">alla Genovese</em> method.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you prefer grilling to pan-cooking, however, you can certainly omit the first step of flouring and frying the steaks, and make the sauce separately. Use a smaller saucepan in this case, preparing the sauce as in the recipe, starting with the sauté of garlic, anchovies, and porcini in 2 tablespoons olive oil. (Use the other 3 tablespoons olive oil, and ½ teaspoon salt, to season the fish before grilling.)</p>

  <p class="indent">One advantage of a separate sauce is that it can be finished ahead of time, so when your guests arrive you only have to fire up the stove and cook the fish. And you’ll find it delicious with bass, codfish, or salmon as well as tuna. In fact, this sauce is so good, I suggest you have a good slab of focaccia to mop up the pan.</p>

Dredge each steak in the flour, coating both sides, and shake off the excess. Pour 4 tablespoons of the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, lay all the tuna in the pan, and sauté on the first side for about 1 minute, just until browned. Flip the steaks over, and brown the second side, another minute or so, then take the pan off the heat. Transfer the tuna to a platter, and keep in a warm place while you make the sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift the rehydrated porcini pieces from the soaking water (reserve it), and chop them fine. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil into the skillet, set it over medium-high heat, toss in the garlic cloves, then stir in the chopped anchovy and porcini. Cook and stir until everything is sizzling nicely, then pour in the white wine, lemon juice, and porcini water (leaving behind any sediment). Add the thyme sprigs, and season with the remaining salt. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced by about half.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the sauce has thickened to a consistency you like, arrange the tuna steaks in the skillet again, and pour in any juices from the platter. Heat for a minute in the bubbling sauce, then turn the steaks over and cook briefly on the second side. The tuna should still be rare at this point; if you prefer your steaks better done, simply let them cook in the sauce longer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Just before serving, drop the 2 tablespoons butter (or extra-virgin olive oil, if you prefer) into the pan, between the steaks, and stir it into the sauce as a final enrichment. Turn off the heat, and stir in the parsley. Serve the steaks on dinner plates, spooning sauce over them, or arrange them on a serving platter, with the sauce on top.</p>

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Sugo</em> is a word that means “sauce,” or sometimes “juice,” but here it tells only part of the story. <em class="calibre4">Sugo alla Genovese</em> is a traditional braised-meat dish that gives you a big pot filled with both a tender, succulent beef roast and a rich, meaty tomato sauce. Like others of my favorite braises (such as Braised Leg of Lamb in the Abruzzo chapter), it yields a bounty of sauce, enough to dress pasta as a first course and to serve as gravy on the sliced meat for a main course.</p>

  <p class="indent">What makes this <em class="calibre4">sugo</em> distinctively <em class="calibre4">alla Genovese</em> is an unusual step in the procedure. After you have caramelized the aromatic vegetables and herbs and browned the meat, you begin building the sauce with red wine. Then you set the meat aside and purée the seasonings with pine nuts to create a complex thickened base for the sauce, reminiscent of <em class="calibre4">pesto alla Genovese.</em> This then goes back in the pan, and everything cooks together slowly for hours, resulting in a <em class="calibre4">sugo</em> that is absolutely delicious and certainly unique.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scrape the base back into the saucepan; slosh out the food-processor bowl with some of the hot stock, and stir that in, along with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Heat the pan over medium heat, stir in the tomatoes, slosh out the tomato containers with the rest of the hot stock, and stir that in, too.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the liquids are well mixed, lay the meat back in the pan, along with any meat juices. If necessary, add more stock so that the roast is nearly totally submerged in sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Still over moderate heat, bring the sauce to a slow boil, then cover the pan tightly and lower the heat, checking after a few minutes to see that the sauce is just at a slow, gently bubbling simmer. Cook the beef, fully covered, for 2½ to 3 hours, occasionally stirring the sauce to make sure that the pine nuts are not collecting on the bottom of the pan, and that the level of the sauce is barely reducing. Rotate the roast once or twice in the liquid, so all surfaces cook covered by sauce for some of the time.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the meat is tender enough that a kitchen fork pierces it easily and pulls out with no resistance, turn off the heat. With sturdy tongs or spatulas, lift the beef from the pan and set it on a platter in a warm place. Skim the fat from the surface of the sauce, then bring it back to a boil and cook until reduced by about half, stirring occasionally. You should have 3 to 4 cups of fairly thick sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve the beef: Slice it crosswise into ⅓-inch-thick slices, and arrange them, fanned out or overlapping, on a warm platter. Moisten the slices with spoonfuls of hot sauce, and pass more sauce at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you have cooked the beef several hours or the day before serving, you can let the meat cool in the pan, in the full amount of braising sauce. Shortly before serving, remove the meat, then skim and reduce the sauce. Slice the beef while it is cool (it is easier this way), and reheat the slices slowly in a wide skillet with some of the hot, thickened sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve a <em class="calibre4">primo</em> with <em class="calibre4">sugo alla Genovese:</em> Put 2 cups of sauce (for a pound of pasta) into a big skillet, and heat to a simmer while the pasta cooks. Drop the drained <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> pasta into the sauce, and toss until coated, then shut off the heat, and toss with grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano. Serve immediately in warm bowls.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The next recipe is for a wonderful stuffed breast of veal, but if If you can’t find a suitable cut of veal, you can make a lovely and tasty facsimile of my <em class="calibre4">cima alla Genovese</em> using boneless turkey breast and following the basic procedures in the recipe for veal. The main difference is that a turkey breast of 5 pounds or more will need to be split into its two halves, each of which you will butterfly and pound with a mallet to a flat sheet; then you will put these together, slightly overlapping, to make a single slab big enough to wrap around the frittata stuffing. (Turkey breasts are sometimes separated into boneless halves before being packaged and sold; you will need two 2-to-3-pound breast pieces in that case.) Depending on how big the flattened turkey sheet is, you may need more or less frittata and hard-cooked eggs than given here.</p>

  <p class="indent">I also recommend that you spread out the cheesecloth first and form and fill the meat slab on top of the cloth. Wrap the stuffing in the turkey, forming a loaf shape, then roll this up tightly inside the cloth, to secure the meat around the stuffing. Tie the ends and the middle of the cloth-covered roll with twine, and poach it just as you would a veal roll—but only for 1 hour, because the turkey will cook much faster. Drain and cool the stuffed turkey under weights; slice and serve as detailed in the recipe.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Cima alla Genovese con Salsa Verde <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 6 to 8</p>

  <p class="extract">Stuffed veal breast can be found in many regions, but the Genovese preparation, <em class="calibre4">cima alla Genovese</em>, is one of the most distinctive and delicious. It is one of my favorite Ligurian dishes, and whenever I am in Genova I seek it out at the local restaurants. Traditionally, it is a specialty of late spring and summer, because in the natural cycle, calves are mostly birthed in early spring, and the veal will be most tender within the next few months. Appropriately for a summer dish, <em class="calibre4">cima alla Genovese</em> is served at room temperature, accompanied by fresh <em class="calibre4">salsa verde.</em></p>

  <p class="indent">Here, though, I give you my home version of <em class="calibre4">cima</em>, one that I prepare all year around, whenever I want something special (and convenient) to delight lots of people. Because veal breast of appropriate size can be hard to find, I use veal shoulder and sometimes turkey breast, butterflied and flattened. I wrap the meat around a colorful filling: a big frittata with a medley of vegetables and a row of hard-cooked eggs. Poached in a log shape, the <em class="calibre4">cima</em> cools before it is sliced for serving. It is still always exciting for me (and will be for you) as each slice is revealed, the filling ingredients forming a unique mosaic within a frame of moist, tender meat.</p>

  <p class="indent">The convenience of <em class="calibre4">cima</em> I also love. I can assemble the stuffed veal the night before, cook it early in the morning, and let it rest. Uncut, the roll keeps well (even for several days) and can be served whenever needed, without further cooking. In summer, it makes a fine <em class="calibre4">al fresco</em> lunch or dinner, or a picnic centerpiece. At holiday times, nothing is more beautiful on a buffet. And when there are guests in the house, I serve it at dinner and leave the rest as an elegant anytime snack.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A sharp, long-bladed knife for butterflying the meat; a meat mallet; a heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter; kitchen twine; cheesecloth sheet, 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, double thickness; a wide, heavy saucepan, preferably an oval-shaped cast-iron French oven, 5-to-7-quart capacity, with a cover</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To prepare the veal: Cut the strings or netting if the roast is tied (as it usually is), and lay out the meat in a slab. Trim off excess fat on both sides and any membranes or silver skin that cover the muscles. Turn the slab so the inside (where bones have been removed) faces up—it will be a rough rectangle of uneven thickness. The next step, butterflying, will enlarge and even out the slab to a nearly square sheet of meat of even thinness.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With a long, sharp knife, slice into the thickest part of the meat, cutting from the middle of the slab toward the edge <em class="calibre4">almost all the way through</em>—then open up the flap you’ve created, like opening a book. Pound the butterflied section of meat to even it out. In the same way, butterfly portions of meat on other parts of the slab to spread and thin the veal, pounding each section after you slice and unfold it. Butterfly small mounds of thick muscle where necessary to thin it, or—if a hole opens in the sheet—butterfly an adjacent portion of meat and use the flap to cover the hole. Continue the gradual butterflying until the veal is about 16 inches on the long sides and about 12 inches on the short edges—roughly square and about ½ inch thick. Cover the veal with plastic wrap while you prepare the stuffing frittata.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set over medium-high heat. Toss in the sliced onions and carrot matchsticks; stir and cook for a couple of minutes, until sizzling, then toss in the zucchini and red-pepper strips. Sprinkle on ½ teaspoon of salt and several grinds of black pepper, and cook, stirring and tossing, for <a class="calibre8" id="page112"></a>5 minutes, until the vegetables are lightly caramelized but still <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> Scatter in the peas and the spinach leaves, turning them over with the other vegetables until they start to wilt and release their liquid. Continue to cook the vegetables, stirring frequently, until the excess water in the pan has evaporated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, beat the raw eggs with ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, then whisk in the grated cheese and milk. When the spinach is cooked and dry, pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook, turning and scrambling the eggs with the vegetables, until the curds are set but still a bit wet and glistening. Remove the pan from the heat, and let cool briefly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Uncover the flattened veal sheet, and season the top with the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Spread the vegetable frittata in an even mound the length of the veal, leaving several inches of the meat uncovered on both long sides, and an inch or so on the ends, to form flaps. Arrange the frittata so the vegetable sticks are distributed evenly and somewhat aligned lengthwise to give a mosaic effect when you slice the cooked roll. Set the hard-boiled eggs in a line nestled in the vegetable frittata. Again, for the prettiest cross-section, align the eggs end to end. (If you can’t fit in all the hard-cooked eggs, enjoy any extras in another dish!)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fold one long flap of the veal over the filling, then the other, enclosing the eggs in a long oval. Starting at one end, tie the veal closed with loops of twine, spaced about 3 inches apart: use one long piece of twine to form a connected series of loops, or make several tight loops, to secure the roll all along its length. Tuck the open ends of the veal against the roll, and tie another length of twine lengthwise around it, so it is completely closed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread out the cheesecloth, set the meat on one of the short edges, and roll it up tightly in the cloth. Twist the cloth on each end of the roll—like a candy wrapper, tightening it up against the meat—and secure the twisted ends with twine. (If there’s lots of excess cheesecloth on the ends, cut it off.) Finally, tie three or four tight loops around the cloth-wrapped roll along its length, further compacting and securing it.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To poach the veal: Drop the chunks of onion, carrot, and celery, the bay leaves, and the ⅓ cup salt in the big saucepan, and set the tied roll on top. Pour in enough cold water to submerge the meat completely, cover the pot, and heat the poaching liquid to a gentle boil. Adjust the heat to maintain a steady, gentle bubbling, and let the veal cook, tightly covered, for 2 hours. The meat should remain completely covered while it cooks gently. Rotate the roll carefully in the pot once or twice, add water if necessary, and adjust the heat as needed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page113"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat after 2 hours, and lift the roll out of the poaching liquid (use tongs to grasp the twisted ends). Let the water drain off, then set the veal on a wide sheet pan or cutting board on an even surface. Place another sheet pan on top of the meat, and weight it down with your big saucepan (you can discard the poaching liquid first) or heavy cans or other objects. Center the weights atop the veal roll so it is evenly compacted.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page114"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Keep the veal pressed for an hour or longer, until it cools to room temperature. Remove the weights, and pour off any liquid that has collected in the pan. Cut off the outer twine, and carefully unwrap the cheesecloth from around the meat; snip the inner loops of twine and remove it all. Transfer the veal to a cutting board, taking care to keep it intact.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you’re ready to serve, slice the veal crosswise with a sharp knife, first cutting off one of the meaty end pieces (tomorrow’s treat!), until you expose the colorful mosaic of stuffing. Slice as many pieces of <em class="calibre4">cima</em> as you’ll serve—I like them about ⅔ inch thick—and arrange them overlapping on a platter. Or present individual portions, a slice or two on each plate, with spoonfuls of <em class="calibre4">Salsa Verde</em> alongside. Have bowls or goblets of <em class="calibre4">Salsa Verde</em> at the table, too.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">In Liguria, nuts are used in all kinds of dishes: pestos, condiments, vegetable dishes, braises, and stews. Certainly desserts are no exception, as exemplified by these two wonderful baked treats—a buttery chocolate-chip cake, and a large jam-filled tart—that get great taste and texture from almonds. Indeed, almonds are incorporated in two forms: sliced almonds provide crunch to each mouthful, and almond flour lends flavor and pleasing texture to the sweet cake and tart dough.</p>

  <p class="indent">Almond flour (or almond meal) may not be readily available, so buy or order it ahead of time from a specialty-food vendor. If you like, you can make your almond flour from blanched, skinless whole almonds in a food processor (or use unblanched whole almonds to make almond meal, which is slightly coarser and darker). Process the almonds until they become a flour.</p>

  <p class="indent">These are both versatile sweets, and can be enjoyed plain or fancy. Dust them with confectioners’ sugar, cut them in small pieces, and pile them (neatly) on a platter for a buffet or to bring to a picnic, potluck, or bake sale. For more formal occasions, either dessert will be fabulous sliced in wedges and flanked with whipped cream, ice cream, or <em class="calibre4">zabaglione.</em> (These both keep well for several days, or can be frozen successfully. When company comes unexpectedly, just pop the cake or tart in a hot oven and it comes back as if just baked.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> In the mixer, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> On low speed, mix in half of the sifted flour mixture, beating just until it is incorporated; beat in half the almond flour.

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: An electric mixer with paddle attachment; a 10-by-15-inch jelly-roll pan; cookie cutters or a pastry wheel</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the tart dough: Cream the butter and sugar in the mixer bowl on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Add the flours and salt to the bowl, and beat on low speed just until the dry ingredients are incorporated and a cohesive dough forms.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a work surface, and knead a few times, until it comes together in a ball. Divide into two pieces—a larger piece of two-thirds of the dough, and a small piece of a third of the dough. Press both pieces into flat rectangles, and wrap them well in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours (or for a day) before rolling; freeze for longer keeping.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you are ready to bake the tart, arrange a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350°. Butter the bottom and sides of the baking pan. In a small bowl, cover the dried cherries with warm water (or rum or liqueur); let them soak and soften.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Place the larger piece of dough between two sheets of parchment, and roll it out to a rectangle a bit larger than the jelly-roll pan. Peel off the top layer of parchment, and invert the dough so it lies centered in the pan, then peel off the second parchment sheet. Gently press and push the dough into the pan to form a smooth, intact crust, even on the bottom and slightly thicker against the sides of the pan. Scrape off excess dough so the crust is flush with the pan sides, and save all the scraps. (If the crust tears or is too thin in spots, patch with the extra dough.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the tart filling, scrape all the cherry preserves into a bowl; drain the rehydrated cherries and stir them into the preserves. Spread all the filling in the crust, covering the bottom evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page117"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roll the smaller piece of dough between the parchment sheets to a round or oblong sheet (about as thick as you rolled the larger piece of dough). Peel off the top layer of parchment; to make a decorative top crust you can cut out circles or other shapes with floured cookie cutters or use a pastry wheel to cut diamonds or lattice strips. If you are short on top crust dough gather and reroll all the dough scraps to make more shapes, and lay them all over the tart, in any pattern you like, with the cherry filling peeking through. Sprinkle the sliced almonds evenly over the top of the tart.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the tart in the oven, and bake about 50 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, or until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the tart cool completely on a wire rack. Cut in pieces of any size, and serve on individual dessert plates, or arrange the pieces on a serving platter for a buffet or picnic. Dust them with confectioners’ sugar, or accompany with whipped cream, ice cream, or <em class="calibre4">zabaglione.</em></p>
