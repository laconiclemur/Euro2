  <p class="nonindent">M<span class="small">IMI</span> S<span class="small">HERATON</span> traveled throughout Germany over a two-year period to gather authentic material for this book, which has become the classic in its field, and she has since been back many times to keep it up-to-date. She is, arguably, our foremost restaurant critic, and, because of her candor, the most controversial and respected. Longstanding food critic for <em>The New York Times, Time</em>, and <em>Condé Nast Traveler</em>, she has traveled all over the world gathering information on food, crafts, and interior design for publications such as <em>Vanity Fair, Esquire, Vogue, Mademoiselle</em>, and <em>Town &amp; Country</em>. She is now a contributing editor to <em>New Woman</em>. She won a JCPenney-University of Missouri prize for journalism for articles in <em>New York</em> magazine and a Front Page Award for work in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Born in Brooklyn and a graduate of New York University, where she received a degree in journalism and marketing, Ms. Sheraton studied interior decorating at the New York School of Interior Design, and cooking in various places, including Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and with private teachers in Bangkok, Istanbul, and Beirut. For many years she was on the staff of <em>Seventeen, Good Housekeeping</em>, and <em>House Beautiful</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Ms. Sheraton loves to photograph foreign food markets, and collects exotic cookware and junk antiques. She and her husband live in a Greenwich Village town house. In addition to four New York City restaurant guidebooks, she wrote <em>The Seducer’s Cookbook, Visions of Sugarplums, From My Mother’s Kitchen</em>, and <em>City Portraits</em>, a travel guide to sixty of the world’s great cities. She also served as the historical foods consultant on <em>The Horizon Cookbook</em>. Her latest cookbook, <em>The Whole World Loves Chicken Soup</em>, received both the James Beard Foundation Award and the Julia Child/IACP Award.</p>
