<h2 class="h2b">LOUP ROTI AU FENOUIL</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Roast Sea Bass with Fennel</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Sea bass and fennel make an adoring couple; you’ll find them together on almost every menu across Provence. I have softened the combination here, blanching the fennel before roasting it with the sea bass. The semi-dried tomatoes add a little sweetener, and the blanched garlic a blissful finishing touch. The orange peel flavours the oil, which in turn flavours the sea bass as you baste it. If you are worried about filleting the fish once it is cooked you can make this using prepared fillets and halve the cooking time</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1 medium sea bass, 1kg (2lb 4oz) or over, scaled and gutted<br/>
2 large fennel bulbs<br/>
A few dried fennel herb branches (optional)<br/>
250g (9oz) recipe <em>Confit de Tomates</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006b.html#page166">see here</a></em>)<br/>
16 large fresh garlic cloves, blanched in 3 changes of water<br/>
12 strips Dried Orange Zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>)<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) olive oil<br/>
<em>Fleur de Sel</em> or sea salt flakes and coarsely ground black pepper<br/>
1 lemon, cut into wedges</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Trim off any fronds remaining on the fennel bulbs and keep them to add to the branches. Remove any darkened bits from the outside of the bulbs and cut each one in six lengthways. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and blanch the fennel for around 10 minutes until you can pierce it easily with the blade of a small knife. Strain the fennel, dry it well and scatter it evenly across the base of a roasting pan with the fennel branches, tomatoes, garlic and orange zest.</p>
<p class="normala">Place the sea bass on top of the fennel and pour the olive oil over it and the vegetables. Sprinkle liberally with sea salt and pepper. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, basting it occasionally with the olive oil until the point of a knife comes out hot from the thickest part of the fish, near the head. Take the sea bass out of the oven and leave it in a warm place for 10 minutes to let it finish cooking.</p>
<p class="normala">Fillet the bass and remove as many of the little bones as possible. Serve it with the vegetables and cooking juices from the pan, the lemon wedges and either an olive oil-dressed green salad, or a ratatouille (<em><a href="chapter_003l.html#page94">see here</a></em>).</p>
