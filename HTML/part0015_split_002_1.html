  <p class="ing">Makes 1 x 500ml/18fl oz/2¼ cup jar</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz courgettes (zucchini), sliced into long, chunky matchsticks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp dried oregano</p>

  <p class="ing1">1½ tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ red chilli, finely sliced (optional) about 300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing2">sunflower oil, to cover</p>

  <p class="para"><a id="pg172" class="calibre1"></a>Sterilize a 500ml/18fl oz/2¼ cup jar (see below).</p>

  <p class="para">Put the courgette matchsticks in a bowl with the garlic, oregano, salt, chilli (if using) and vinegar, making sure the vinegar completely covers the courgettes. Cover with a lid or greaseproof (waxed) paper, put a weight on top and leave to marinate for about 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Drain off the liquid, reserving the garlic and chilli, and gently squeeze out the excess liquid from the courgettes. Place the courgettes together with the garlic and chilli in the sterilized jar and pour in the oil, making sure you completely cover the courgettes with oil. Secure with a lid, label and store in a cool, dark, dry place for at least 2 weeks before using. Once opened, store in the fridge.</p>

    <p class="box-head">Preserving basics</p>

    <p class="box-para">• Always use very fresh, good-quality vegetables and fruit.</p>

    <p class="box-para"><a id="pg172a" class="calibre1"></a>• To sterilize jars, wash and thoroughly clean all the jars and lids you are going to use, then rinse the jars with a little white wine vinegar. Leave to drain, then dry well. Place the jars and lids in a large pan of boiling water and boil for a couple of minutes. Remove, drain and dry well.</p>

    <p class="box-para"><a id="pg172b" class="calibre1"></a>• To pasteurize: once you have placed the preserves in jars, seal well, preferably using hermetically sealed lids. Wrap each jar in old kitchen cloths: this prevents it from breaking during boiling. Line a large pan with kitchen cloth. Place the wrapped jars in the pan and add enough cold water to cover them by 3cm/1 inch. Bring the water to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and boil for the time stated in the recipe. Turn off the heat, but leave the jars in the water until it is cold. Remove the jars and unwrap, then dry with a clean tea towel, label and store in a cool, dark, dry cupboard.</p>

    <p class="box-para">• Before you store your preserves, remember to label them with their name and the date you made them.</p>
