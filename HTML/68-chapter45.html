<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">There are few better ways to appreciate the earthen, forest flavors of wild mushrooms than just quickly sautéing them in olive oil and seasoning with only salt and maybe some garlic and fresh parsley. But as with numerous traditional Spanish preparations, from artichokes to trout, adding some jamón, with its bold salty and savory flavors, pushes the dish up a notch. I’ve come across wonderful versions of this in La Rioja, in northern Navarra, and, most memorably, in the oak-covered hills of northern Andalucía around Aracena. The bar prepared it with some of the region’s celebrated gurumelo mushrooms (firm and intensely aromatic, with muggy hints of the humid forest) and <em>jamón ibérico de bellota</em>—from acorn-fed Iberian black-footed pigs—from the nearby town of Jabugo.

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Keeping the varieties separate, clean the mushrooms following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>. Quarter or slice them depending on their shape.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large sauté pan or skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and cook each type of mushroom separately (to ensure even cooking), stirring frequently to help evaporate any moisture that they throw, until golden brown at the edges, 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the variety. Transfer the mushrooms to a serving bowl as they are cooked. Re-oil the pan between varieties as needed.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat, add the garlic, and cook until golden and fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the jamón.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Add the jamón mixture to the mushrooms and toss to blend well. Scatter the parsley over the mushrooms and serve immediately.</p>
