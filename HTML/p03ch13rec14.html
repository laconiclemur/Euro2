<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">The</span> leche frita, <span class="italic">literally “fried milk,” sold in pastry shops and in supermarkets is made with cornstarch, but I prefer the texture of this homey version that uses flour as the thickener. These creamy pastries can be eaten hot or cold—and can be reheated. When they are straight out of the oil, they are crunchy outside and very creamy inside.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES 16 PASTRIES</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">3 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Grated zest of 1 lemon or 1 orange</p>
<p class="qun">2 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun">Fine bread crumbs or matzo meal</p>
<p class="qun">1 large egg</p>
<p class="qun">Sunflower oil for frying</p>
<p class="qun">About 4 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar for sprinkling</p>
<p class="qun1">1 teaspoon cinnamon for sprinkling</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the flour in a bowl and gradually add 1 cup of the milk, beating with an electric mixer to prevent lumps.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bring the remaining 2 cups milk, the sugar, and the grated zest to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the flour-and-milk mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until you have a thick cream. (If lumps form, you can get rid of them by beating with a hand mixer right in the pan.) Continue to cook over low heat, stirring often, for 10 minutes. Add the egg yolks and stir vigorously for a few seconds more; do not let the mixture boil, or the yolks will curdle. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Grease a square or rectangular dish with oil. Pour in the milk mixture; it should be about ¾ to 1 inch thick. Let cool, then chill, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 2 hours, until set. The cream should be very firm.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cover a plate with a layer of bread crumbs or matzo meal. Beat the egg lightly in a soup plate. Turn the cream out onto a large flat oiled platter or work surface, and cut it into 16 squares or rectangles. Lift each piece very carefully and turn it gently in the egg and then in the bread crumbs or matzo meal, so that it is well covered. Heat about 1 inch of oil in a large deep skillet until a piece of bread sizzles when it is dropped in but does not brown too quickly. Deep-fry the pastries in batches until golden brown, turning once. Lift the pastries out and drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve hot or chilled, dusted with confectioners’ sugar and cinnamon.</p>
