<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">My “Toast in the Morning Man”</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">By the end of my time at the university, Dick and I were engaged to be married. For our wedding date, we chose Sunday, June 10, 1956, after I graduated on Friday with my B.S. degree in home economics. I really wanted to graduate with my maiden name of Luoma. I was the first person in our family to go to college and earn a degree. Dick had spent the year in England at Upper Heyford near Oxford as a second lieutenant. He rented an apartment and bought a little tan Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was nearing graduation, having recently completed a stint in the “Home Management House” that was part of the requirements. I hadn’t been allowed to test out of it—no one was, regardless of experience—even though I had spent a year working for my room and board at a home as a cook and household assistant to an elderly couple who lived near the campus. Plus, as the oldest of ten kids at home, I was already well versed in planning meals, cleaning the house, balancing a budget, and handling the usual tasks of running a household. Yet for all that, I still had to complete the course.</p>
<p>The Home Management House was situated in a large brick mansion that had been donated to the university by a wealthy family. It had beautiful sweeping staircases, several fireplaces, and spacious rooms. The large kitchen had a butler’s pantry, and the dining room was formal. There were six students in each session, and we all had our private bedrooms, as did the teacher—who was no other than Dr. Ruth. When she was not in the house, we goofed around, posing at the mantel, sliding down the staircase, and dancing on the dining room table.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing about the house, though, was that we had to take turns planning meals. Breakfast, especially, was total fun. “Esoteric” breakfast breads like scones and muffins were something we rarely made at home except on a Sunday afternoon—when, of course, it wasn’t breakfast time, but good for afternoon coffee, especially if company were coming. The table at Home Management House was always formally set—for all three meals!</p>
<p>While at the house, I surreptitiously sewed my wedding dress and the formals for all of my wedding attendants—my sisters. I had found a wedding dress at Oreck’s Bridal Shop in downtown Duluth and went back to the shop multiple times to “try” it on. Each time, I took more notes on the design and the fabric that made up the dress. It was white satin with a fitted bodice, fitted long sleeves, and thirty-six covered buttons marching up the back.</p>

<p class="figcap">Our wedding day, June 10, 1956. I made my own dress on the sly in Home Management class, as well as three bridesmaid dresses for my sisters.</p>
</div>
<p>In my spare time, I made a pattern for the dress and then a mock garment of muslin. In the final rendition, I covered the little round buttons with satin and made the satin loop fasteners. I did all this without Dr. Ruth knowing anything about it. Of course, my fellow classmates knew all along and encouraged me.</p>
<p>I graduated on a Friday evening in Duluth, and Dick and I were married two days later in Floodwood. The church was filled with the aroma of buckets of lilacs that we cut from the bushes around the house on our farm. We packed the sanctuary with family and UMD friends. It was about ninety degrees and just as humid.</p>
<p>The reception afterward was held in the basement of the church. The ladies had prepared sandwiches, bars, and cookies, and they served Kool-Aid and coffee.</p>
<p>The following Thursday we flew to Oxford, England, where Dick had rented an apartment up from City Centre on Banbury Road. This was after a brief sort of “honeymoon” trip—basically just to get away from relatives—into western Wisconsin, where Dick, ever the enthusiastic geologist, wanted to show me tiny stalactites in a minuscule cave. I’ve never forgotten that first geology lesson: stalactites drop from the ceiling of the cave while stalagmites grow up from the floor of the cave.</p>
<p>Our apartment in Oxford had an eighteen-inch electric stove in the kitchen with solid metal burners that took forever to heat up. The oven was narrow but just wide enough for a twelve-inch cookie sheet. The kitchen was the size of an average closet.</p>
<p>Even in my limited space, I enjoyed preparing meals—especially breakfast. I applied the skills I learned at university to my newly minted life, and that was great fun. I planned to make scones of different flavors, muffins in all possible varieties, biscuits, and fruit and nut pancakes for breakfast every morning.</p>
<p>I shopped in the nearby greengrocer’s, the dairy, and the fishmonger. Mostly I enjoyed shopping in the outdoor market on weekends. I would ride the red double-decker bus to Banbury on Saturday mornings. It didn’t take long to learn that merchants never offered bags in which to put your purchases—people brought their own shopping bags and baskets. One day, I found beautiful brussels sprouts and bought a pound of them. Dismayed that I had nothing to put them in, I found a solid antique copper kettle in the next stall, at what I thought was a bargain price. It had a lid and a sturdy handle, so I filled it with the sprouts. That kettle sits next to our wood-burning stove today in our living room, a prized possession.</p>
<p>Over the door of our apartment on Banbury Road was an attractive, heavy, brass-and-copper plate with Cyrillic script all over it. We thought it was artistic, but later found that it had been left there by Iraqi students who lived in the apartment before us. We traded several small items we knew we wouldn’t need anymore, like electrical adapters and plugs, to the landlords for that piece. The plate still hangs in our house today.</p>

<p>Dick would invite local English geologists, all students at Oxford, for dinner—and I truly enjoyed cooking for them. The meals were simple: I used recipes from a Betty Crocker Junior cookbook, baked yeast bread, and for dessert usually made American-style apple pies.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks of my “creative” breakfast breads, almond scones, fruit-filled muffins, flaky biscuits, and the like, Dick broke his news to me: “I’m a toast in the morning man!” That ended my first foray into creative quick breads.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Almond Cardamom Scones</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">I often whip up these scones, perfumed with cardamom and crunchy with almonds, to serve a large group of people for a breakfast meeting or an afternoon gathering. They go well with hot spiced cider or spiced tea.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">3 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon baking powder</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup chopped almonds</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, frozen</p>
<p class="rpil">3 large eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">½ to ⅔ cup plain yogurt or buttermilk</p>
<p class="rpill">1 tablespoon sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a large cookie sheet or cover with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="rp">Combine flour, baking powder, cardamom, sugar, and almonds in a large bowl.</p>
<p class="rp">Grate the frozen butter onto the flour mixture.</p>
<p class="rp">Mix the eggs and ½ cup of the yogurt or buttermilk in a small bowl. Add to the dry ingredients and blend quickly, just until a dough forms. (Add a bit more yogurt or buttermilk if needed.)</p>
<p class="rp">Using an ice-cream scoop, place mounds of dough on the cookie sheet, about 3 inches apart. Sprinkle tops with the sugar.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake 8 to 10 minutes until light brown. Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.</p>
