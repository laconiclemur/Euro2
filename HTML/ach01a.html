<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_3"/>bruschetta with tomato</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">bruschetta con pomodoro</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are endless ways of making bruschetta, but this is our favorite. You can leave the skins on the tomatoes or peel them. To make peeling easier, blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for a couple of minutes, then cool them in cold water to loosen the skins. The only rule with bruschetta is to use the best olive oil you can find, preferably a cold-pressed variety.</p>
<p class="indentb">Bruschetta is a terrific hors d’oeuvre, but it doesn’t lend itself to advance preparation—nothing is worse than soggy bruschetta. So the best way to prepare and serve it is to mix the tomatoes, garlic, and parsley in a small serving bowl, then toast the bread, rub it with garlic, and place it on a platter with the bowl of tomatoes. If you set this out along with other hors d’oeuvres—olives, soppressata, a hunk of Parmesan cheese—guests can serve themselves while you pour the wine.</p>
