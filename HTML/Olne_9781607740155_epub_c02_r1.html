  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page122"></a>On the whole, care has been taken to present menus which, despite being in certain instances fairly elaborate, require a minimum of nervous last-minute preparation. This menu involves no particularly complicated preparation, but for the servantless housewife there is a serious snag: the <em>salmis</em> must be prepared at the last minute and the final steps require a devoted half-hour. It seemed nonetheless too fine a thing to eliminate, and a pity to present it otherwise than under semiformal circumstances.</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em>cèpes</em> will suffer little from being prepared ahead of time and kept warm for a half-hour or so. As for the other courses, the sorrel soup may, but for the final thickening, be prepared in advance, the fritters require only the incorporation of beaten egg whites into the batter, and the actual frying, and the dessert is of necessity prepared hours ahead.</p>

  <p class="indent">Nasturtiums persist until the first freeze.</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve the <em>cèpes</em> toward the end of the <em>salmis</em> service. They marry very well indeed, but the subtlety of each risks being muted by the other’s rich presence. One may, by serving in this way, appreciate them together and enjoy them apart.</p>

  <p class="indent">The presence of mushrooms in two different preparations (they also appear in the <em>fritto misto</em>) may seem bizarre, but their similarity is in name only.</p>

  <p class="indent">Save the leftover egg yolks from the jelly clarification when you make the orange jelly (immersed in water to prevent their drying out) for thickening in the soup and the whites from the extra yolks, which will be needed for use in the frying batter for the <em>fritto misto</em>.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE SORREL SOUP</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">With very little cooking, sorrel “melts” almost completely into a purée, and in simpler soups than this one nothing is gained by passing it through a sieve. Its light, refreshing acidity renders it useful in many soups, hot and cold. One sorrel soup, simple in preparation and far less rich, but delicious, is made with water, thickened with potato and lightly buttered before serving—a finely chopped onion is cooked in <a id="page123"></a>butter to which shredded sorrel is added, and when it is reduced to a purée, boiling water and finely sliced potatoes are added and cooked until the latter are partially dissolved. A soup prepared like the Germiny but made with water is also possible, but should not, of course, be dignified by that title.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c02-s6"><em><span class="color">Sorrel Soup</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Potage Germiny</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 6 ounces sorrel leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart consommé (or veal stock)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>handful of chervil leaves</em> (<em>stems removed</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the stems from the sorrel leaves, pulling the stems backward to tear out the fibrous threads in the leaves. Wash the leaves in several waters, drain well, and gather them into a compact mass on the chopping board, holding them well together while cutting or chopping them into coarse shreds (<em>chiffonade</em>). Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy saucepan, add the sorrel and cook over low heat, stirring regularly, until it is reduced almost to a purée (about 15 minutes), then pass it through a fine sieve and return to the saucepan. Assuming the stalks and fibrous elements to have been completely removed, it may instead be puréed in a blender with a bit of stock.) Add the stock to the sorrel purée. Mix together, in another receptacle, the cream and the egg yolks. Combine the two mixtures, whisking, and cook over a low to medium flame, whisking constantly, until the liquid turns creamy and velvety in consistency—it is then said to “coat the spoon.” It must absolutely not be allowed to come to a boil. Remove from the flame, taste for seasoning and add salt if necessary, whisk in the remaining butter cut into small pieces, pour into a warmed soup tureen and sprinkle with a handful of chervil leaves.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page124"></a>THE FRITTO MISTO</h2>

  <p class="center"><em>(Mixed Fritters)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The origins of this preparation are respected in both English and French, on the condition that brains and artichoke hearts count among the elements to be fried. Besides those vegetables given in this recipe, others such as small young onions, sliced raw zucchini, parboiled green beans, cauliflower sections, broccoli flowers, may add variety to the mixture.</p>

  <p class="indent">A simple tomato sauce, served separately, goes well in some instances, but in this framework, it would not be an attractive preface to the <em>salmis</em> sauce. The nuances of the marinating liquid and the fried parsley lend sufficient character to permit these fritters to be served without a sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c02-s7"><em><span class="color">Fritto Misto (Mixed Fritters)</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Fritto Misto (Beignets Mixtes)</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 calf’s brain</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Court-bouillon:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 cups water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup wine vinegar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 carrot and 1 onion, both peeled and finely sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>bouquet of parsley, thyme, bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium Artichokes (plus lemon and thyme—see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound small firm young mushrooms</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Marinade:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped fines herbes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of ½ lemon</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><a id="page125"></a><em>Frying batter:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pinch salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup tepid water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>at least 1 quart frying oil</em> (<em>preferably olive</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large handful parsley bouquets (short sections of stem with their leaves attached)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CALF’S BRAIN</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Put the brain to soak in cold water. Carefully peel off the fine enveloping membrane, immersing the brain repeatedly in water if the membrane resists (it sometimes helps to hold it under water while removing particularly adherent sections), and leave it again to soak in cold water in order to clear it as nearly as possible of bloodstains.</p>

  <p class="indent">For the <em>court-bouillon</em>, bring the water and the vinegar to a boil, add all the other ingredients and boil gently, covered, for ½ hour before using.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slip the brain into the boiling <em>court-bouillon</em> and poach, covered, at a bare simmer, for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from liquid and drain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare the artichokes as indicated on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>, paring them somewhat less radically than for bottoms and keeping them quite firm. Cut each into quarters or sixths, depending on their size, and cut out the chokes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pare the mushrooms, if necessary, rinse them rapidly and sponge them dry in a towel. Those whose diameter is no larger than that of a five-cent piece may be left whole; others should be cut into halves or quarters.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the brain into more-or-less cube-shaped pieces measuring approximately ¾ inch across, combine them in a bowl with the mushrooms and artichokes, sprinkle over them the ingredients of the marinade, and mix together all the elements, lifting with the fingertips and letting them drop back into the bowl. Repeat this two or three times in the course of the marination, always gently, for the brains are fragile. They should be left for 1 hour at least, but may remain for several hours or overnight.</p>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page126"></a><span class="small">THE FRYING BATTER</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the center, pour in the oil, and slowly add the water, stirring from the center and moving outward in an enlarging circle as the flour is absorbed. Work the batter no more than is necessary to achieve a smooth mixture and leave it to “relax” at kitchen temperature for a good hour to ensure its losing all elasticity. Just before using it, gently fold in the two egg whites, beaten stiff.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat the oil until it sizzles at contact with a drop of batter. Do not use a frying basket. Drop several of the elements to be fried into the batter; ladle batter over them with a teaspoon, and drop them, one by one, from the spoon into the hot fat. A void cooking more at a time than may freely float without touching one another. Turn them over in the fat with the prong tips of a fork, taking care not to pierce the crisp surface and, when evenly golden, remove to a kitchen towel, using a large wire skimming spoon to scoop them up. Keep them warm in a folded towel while frying the remaining batches. It may be necessary to regulate the heat to prevent the oil from becoming too hot.</p>

  <p class="indent">When the last of the fritters are removed from the oil, drop in the parsley and fry until crisp (only a few seconds). Drain it on a towel, but do not try to “sponge” it, for it will crumble. Serve the fritters enclosed in a folded napkin, the parsley sprinkled on top.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE PHEASANT SALMIS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Pheasant, abundant in American farming regions, is often appreciated more as a hunting target than as a table delicacy. Many American cookbooks treat game birds summarily, suggesting simply that they be dealt with in the same way as domestic fowl. Pheasant hens are often plumper and their flesh less dry than that of cocks, but American law shields them.</p>

  <p class="indent">A pheasant should be young, hatched in the spring of the same year it is killed. The flesh of the breast will seem tender to the touch and the breastbone flexible; the final and longest wing feather remains pointed. (Older birds may be braised with cabbage or used for stock.) <a id="page127"></a>Simply roasted, its breast protected by a fine strip of fresh fat pork, young pheasant should be served slightly rare (about 35 minutes in a fairly hot oven) and accompanied by triangles or rounds of crouton spread with <em>farce gratin</em> (the pheasant’s liver, supplemented by that of a chicken, rapidly sautéed in butter with salt, pepper, and a pinch of herbs, flamed with a spoonful of cognac and passed through a fine sieve).</p>

  <p class="indent">A <em>salmis</em> is a rare-roasted game bird whose sauce is drawn from the carcass and a reduction of white wine and shallots and tempered with stock. In season, the canned truffles are better replaced by fresh, and when the stock is enriched by the addition of another roast pheasant carcass, the preparation achieves ultimate perfection. In a professional kitchen a certain amount of meat glaze would be available to lend additional body and succulence to the sauce. The dish is elegant in concept but, to be enjoyed under perfect circumstances, does not permit of an elegant presentation.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c02-s8"><em><span class="color">Pheasant Salmis</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Salmis de Faisan</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Velouté:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh1">Veal Stock</a> (—if prepared especially, use 1 pound veal, a few chicken necks, and the neck, head and giblets of the pheasant)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped gray shallots (if only red shallots are available, substitute 1 tablespoon chopped white onion and ½ clove garlic)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 or 5 white peppercorns, slightly crushed</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small jar of preserved truffles (those in jars are usually better than those in cans—in any case they should be vacuum-packed in a minimum of liquid, not swimming in salt water)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 young pheasant</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page128"></a>thin strips of fresh fat pork or, if possible, a single sheet</em> (<em>omit this step rather than substitute bacon</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>few tablespoons white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE VELOUTE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan, add the flour and cook gently, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon for two or three minutes. Away from the flame, add the stock slowly, stirring all the while to prevent its lumping. Simmer over a low flame for about ½ hour, skimming from time to time. Boil the white wine, chopped shallots and peppercorns over a high flame until only a few spoonfuls of liquid remain. Add it, along with the truffles’ preserving liquid, to the <em>velouté</em>.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE PHEASANT</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sprinkle the pheasant inside and out with salt, completely cover the breast with a sheet or strips of fat pork, if you have it, tie with a kitchen string, and place it in a small skillet or other pan just the size to hold it. Roast it in a very hot oven for 25 minutes. Remove from roasting pan, discard the fat pork and any fragments of skin that may be charred. Remove the legs, leaving thighs and drumsticks attached, cut the joint end from the drumstick bone and peel off the skin. Reserve skin. Clip the breast and wings loose from the carcass with heavy kitchen shears. Cut the bird in two the length of the breastbone, remove the breastbone, and cut each half in two lengthwise. Remove the skin and reserve, and any fragments of splintered bone, trim the pieces of pheasant neatly and place them and the legs in a presentable earthenware or copper <em>cocotte</em> just large enough to hold them. Distribute the truffles, sliced fairly thickly, over the surface, grind a bit of pepper over and sprinkle with the cognac, which has first been heated and flamed to rid it of its alcohol. Keep covered in a warm place while finishing the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pour off the fat from the roasting pan and dissolve the caramelized meat juices in a couple of tablespoons of white wine, stirring, scraping and reducing over a high flame. Chop the reserved skin, trimmings and carcass coarsely, pound in a mortar, add this and roasting juices to the <a id="page129"></a><em>velouté</em>, boil for 8 to 10 minutes, and pass the contents of the saucepan through a sieve, pressing the solids firmly with a pestle in order to extract all the juices. Bring the sauce back to a boil and simmer with the heat to one side of the saucepan, skimming regularly (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page90">this page</a>) for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by about one third. Pass it through a very fine sieve, taste for seasoning and reheat. Away from the flame, swirl in the butter, cut into small pieces. Pour the sauce over the pheasant and truffles and serve immediately.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c02-s9"><em><span class="color">Sautéed Cèpes (wild mushrooms) à la Bordelaise</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Cèpes Sautés à la Bordelaise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound cèpes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped gray shallot (or substitute chopped white onion)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 clove garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon fine bread crumbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Choose small, firm mushrooms that have not completely opened out. Larger ones should be reserved for grilling. Don’t wash them, but wipe each carefully with a damp towel after having cut off the stem ends to remove any adhering earth or sand. Remove the stems, slice each in two lengthwise and cut out and discard any parts that may be wormy. Chop about half the stems (the equivalent of a good cupful) fairly fine and put them aside with the chopped shallot or onion and garlic clove. Any heads that are no larger than a small walnut may be left whole. The others should be cut into halves, quarters or thick slices.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat the oil in a large skillet or <em>sauteuse</em>, add the mushrooms and stem pieces, season and cook them over a high flame for about 10 minutes, tossing them or gently stirring them regularly with a wooden spoon. (At the beginning, the mushrooms must not be too crowded in <a id="page130"></a>the pan—if it is not large enough, use two pans and additional oil. After all are browned, they may be put together for the finishing processes.) When they are lightly browned, turn the flame low and leave them to cook, covered, for another 5 minutes or so. Turn the flame high again, add the chopped stems, chopped shallots and the garlic clove, and cook, stirring and tossing, for another 2 or 3 minutes. Drain off as much of the oil as possible. (The large quantity of oil is essential for the first stage in the cooking to be correctly carried out, but must not remain. It may, however, be used again and will lend an attractive flavor to fried potatoes, for instance.) Turn the flame down again, add the bread crumbs and two-thirds of the chopped parsley, stir together and leave over a low heat, stirring regularly, long enough for the bread crumbs to completely absorb the remaining oil. Discard the garlic clove. Sprinkle the mushrooms with a few drops of lemon juice, add salt and pepper to taste, and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_5">THE ORANGE JELLY</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The ghastly commercial jellies, symbol of the sordid cafeteria counter, have, understandably, formed a block of prejudice against their highly respectable ancestor. Few people today have ever tasted wine or freshfruit calf’s-foot jellies. Limpid, trembling, set in old-fashioned jelly molds with their intricate geometric designs and central tubes, their beauty of presentation rivals their delicacy of flavor.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c02-s10"><em><span class="color">Orange Jelly</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gelée à l’Orange</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 calves’ feet</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>5 pints water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon, plus several strips of the peel of both</em> (<em>sliced thin to avoid the white</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page131"></a>2 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of cinnamon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3½ cups freshly squeezed orange juice</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Have the large, upper bone removed from the feet. Soak them in cold water for 2 or 3 hours, then cover them with fresh cold water and parboil them for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse them well, cover with the 5 pints of water, bring to a boil, cover and allow to barely simmer for about 7 hours. Skim the fat from the surface several times during the cooking and as completely as possible at the end. Pass the jelly through a sieve and, when it has cooled until firm, remove all traces of fat, first using a spoon, then wiping the surface with a cloth slightly dampened in hot water. About 1 quart of jelly should remain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mix the sugar, the juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon, and the peels together in a saucepan, add the jelly, bring to a boil and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Beat the egg whites with the white wine, add them with pinch of cinnamon to the jelly and bring to a boil, whisking all the time, then simmer for 15 minutes, whisking from time to time. Line a sieve with a tightly woven towel, pass the jelly through, and leave it until nearly cool.</p>

  <p class="indent">Let the 3½ cups of orange juice settle for ½ hour after squeezing, pass it through a fine cloth, stir it into the jelly, pour into a mold and chill for at least 4 hours. Unmold just before serving, first dipping the mold for a second in hot water and wiping it dry.</p>
