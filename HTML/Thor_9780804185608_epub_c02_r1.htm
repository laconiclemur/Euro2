<h1 class="chapter_title" id="ch01"><span class="red"><span class="bold">SUMMER</span></span></h1>
</div>
</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div4"><span class="dropcaps2line">S</span>ometimes people play a game of conjuring up a fantasy meal where you invite anyone you’d like to a dinner party, from any period in history. I suppose I wouldn’t mind a little soirée with some of my favorite celebrities. I would hold it in Paris at Le Grand Véfour, the most beautiful dining room in the world, where I was lucky enough to have my wedding lunch. Invitees would include Woody Allen and Sophia Loren and I would ask Alain Passard or Stephane Jégo to assist me in the kitchen (because I’d actually really want to cook at my own party—especially with those great chefs!). We’d have Champagne and foie gras and squab and a soufflé for dessert.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div5">But my real fantasy meal, one I think about all the time, would take place in my garden at summer, with no one but our children and their families. By then, there would be lots of grandchildren and everyone would help me in the kitchen. We’d have an abundance of food on the table and many puppies under it, and at the end of the meal, I would look with pride over everything and think to myself, “You did it.”</div>
<div class="indent" id="div6">Of course, we have a small version of that meal every year—several of them, to be exact. In summer we are united, the seven children all with us for a lengthy period, and every day feels like a celebration. The day typically starts with a very late breakfast, anything from waffles or pancakes with fresh berries to a lovely omelet or <span class="italic">oeufs à la coque.</span> Then the cooking begins—if it wasn’t already started the night before. By 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon, lunch is ready to be <a id="page82"/>served. The children will gather from all corners of the house, some needing to be fished out of the pool, to help set the table. Because we are so many, we like to take one of our dining tables outside, and somehow this is always done at the last minute. I will be in the kitchen shouting, “It’s ready, it’s ready, it won’t be good if it gets cold!” while chairs are rushed out of windows and doors; glasses, plates, and cutlery somehow make their way to the garden via a human conveyor belt formed by the kids. (Needless to say, I take the really fragile stuff out myself, just to be sure.) My husband tends to be suspiciously absent from these chaotic preparations, “tending to the dogs,” he calls it.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div7">Eating outside under the shade of a tree, with everybody who matters around me, is pure bliss. For the first few minutes, we hardly speak to each other, so busy are we eating. (It’s fair to say we are a family of robust appetites.) My favorite moment is when I can finally relax, have that last sip of wine, and scoop up the remainder of the sauce with my bread. If I am lucky, and I often am, someone brings me coffee and my husband will tidy up in gentlemanly fashion, aided by some of the kids. That’s when I head for the hammock. Before leaving the table, I usually say something like, “Let’s make something light for dinner,” and for a little while I really mean it. But an hour later, I often find myself back in the kitchen ready to do it all over again, just to re-create that magic moment.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div8">In summer, I take one of the kids’ wagons with me to the market. It is the season of plenty—every market stall bursting with peaches and apricots, plums and cherries—and I can’t resist any of it. I buy crates of fruit, stacks of baguettes, too much of everything, I think. When I arrive home, I feel we are set for a week at least. But then the little mice sneak in and by the next day, there are only crumbs and perhaps a few odd vegetables that can be salvaged into a salad, and it’s off to market again.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div9">When I arrive at the fishmonger’s on Saturday morning, I feel that every fish is calling to me, “Cook me, cook me!” As I align vegetables in a roasting pan for a tian or when I have just put several dozen freshly picked tomatoes on my table, I think there cannot be more beautiful colors anywhere. When I have fresh strawberries to serve with mascarpone cream, I am filled with delight. No matter how many trips I make to the market or how many feasts I plan, it always feels new and exciting to me.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div10">I am someone who likes to exaggerate a bit. I have many “favorites” and quite a few things are “the best thing I have ever tasted.” My husband often makes fun of me for this. But cooking for my family is my absolute favorite thing. Especially in summer.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div45">Although this chilled soup has a creamy texture, it is surprisingly refreshing. It’s a recipe I make sparingly, though: it has an unusual (in a good way) and somewhat fancy (for lack of a better word) flavor, and it reminds me of the soups you get in modern restaurants in Spain, the sort of places that have tasting menus with a different wine for every course. If I’m planning a very special dinner for guests, I might first serve foie gras on toast, then a small bowl of this soup, then fish, then meat, and then cheese, dessert, and <a class="hlink" href="Thor_9780804185608_epub_c01_r1.htm#h17">canelés</a>, just because we are in Bordeaux.

<div class="headnote" id="div66">To me, this Provençal soup is very much the French version of a minestrone, and while I would not go so far to say that it’s an improvement on the original, it’s at least a very nice alternative. The people of Provence did a two-for-one deal, also borrowing a pesto recipe from their Italian neighbors to mix into the soup, which makes for a very rare Franco-Italian invention. Provençal pesto is usually made without pine nuts and some versions add tomatoes to the mix, which I like. Leftover pistou is lovely on grilled bread with aperitifs. So many of the soups I make are thick and velvety, so when a change is called for, it’s great to have in my repertoire a tasty clear one studded with goodies.</div>

The rule of thumb goes something like this: If we have pasta for lunch, we will most likely pair it with the Italian version. If we have fish or cold cuts, we go for the French salad. This is a very simple recipe, of course, but one I thought I had to include because it’s such a big part of what we enjoy at our daily table.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div119">There are the tomatoes readily available in supermarkets, which are often hard, watery, and fairly flavorless. And then there are the locally grown tomatoes of summer, which come in a variety of shapes and sizes, shades and colors, ranging from dark greens and yellows to deep orange reds. They have intriguing names and many of them taste so good that they explain in a single bite why the tomato is really a fruit, not a vegetable. Over the last few years, these tomatoes have spoiled my palate for any other kind. I have them on their own, with just a little olive oil, or in salads or in tarts, which really bring out their flavor. I make many different kinds of tomato tarts, but I think this is the one I like best.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div163"><span class="italic">Rillettes</span> are pâté-like spreads that usually consist of chunky bits of meat that have been cooked in their own fat. You find them everywhere in France; many families have their own recipes and most butchers offer more than one variety. The most common version is made of pork, but there are no rules, and I’ve had more types than I can remember. I am particularly fond of tuna rillettes, which are less fatty than those made from meat and are a great starter or amuse-bouche served on toast. The texture and flavor is at once fishy and creamy, somewhere between a tuna tartare and a terrine. I suppose you will just have to try this.</div>

So, while I still love ’80s music, when I think of some of the overwrought dishes I had in those days, complete with raspberry coulis, I have to shudder.

If it’s possible to grow delicious, beautiful vegetables without using pesticides, as so many dedicated farmers have proven, why should we do otherwise? Do we really need our apples to be so shiny that we can see our reflection in them, our tomatoes so hard that they can fall on the floor without splattering? Some say that organic vegetables are ugly, but I wholeheartedly disagree. I like character in my vegetables, in both the way they taste and the way they look.

All those different types of fish, all those bones, all that mess. A few years ago, though, I compromised and made a simple version, with fewer types of fish—which bouillabaisse enthusiasts would probably regard as a sacrilege. But it tasted divine and encouraged me to start cooking the soup (or stew) in all its full-blown glory. (So it all ends well, you see; there was no need to fret, bouillabaisse enthusiasts!) This dish is much easier to make than I ever thought and while it still requires a lot of work and cleanup, I encourage you to give it a shot.

<div class="headnote" id="div352">Duck breasts, or <span class="italic">magrets de canard,</span> are very much a usual suspect in traditional French bistros. I have countless memories of sitting with my parents in such establishments, eating duck breasts with rich sauces and sautéed potatoes. But now that I’m older, I feel that duck (perhaps my favorite meat) doesn’t really need creamy sauces, and so I like to pan-sear it and serve it with peaches sautéed in the duck fat, a dreamy combination. To add an extra touch to the dish, I sometimes grill the duck breasts for the final minutes over grapevines so they get a bit smoky and infused with the taste of the vines. So Médoc!</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div408">The Noir de Bigorre is an ancient breed of pig, dating back to prehistoric times. Native to the mountains between France and Spain, the Pyrenees, it just may be the tastiest pig on earth. One fine summer day, when I was having guests for dinner and really wanted to spoil them, I bought a big piece of Noir de Bigorre pork loin and asked my trusted butcher, M. Manenti, to wrap the meat in finely sliced pork belly from the same breed. He advised me not to preheat the oven and to slow-cook the pork roast at a low temperature so the meat would cook gently in the melting fat. If you want melt-in-your-mouth succulent meat, this is it. Seek out the best-quality pork you can find for this recipe. I serve this dish with an apple compote and extra-rich garlic mashed potatoes.</div>

<div class="textbox_nonindent" id="div438">I don’t think a day goes by when I don’t cook with garlic. It’s always there in my kitchen, ready to be crushed, baked, roasted, sliced, caramelized, or rubbed on bread. In winter, I love to break open a stubborn head of dry garlic and watch the papery white flakes and copper-colored cloves arrange themselves on my kitchen table. In spring, I marvel at the rich color of fresh purple garlic, and I enjoy cooking every bit of it, including the stalks. The symbol of this country is a proud rooster. A funny moustache, a bottle of wine, a baguette, and a piece of cheese are the most celebrated icons. But let’s face it: garlic is a big thing in <a class="hlink" id="ind325a"/><a class="hlink" id="ind620a"/>French cooking.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div443">The French love couscous, and this North-African dish has become as common in Paris as steak frites or onion soup. I always associate couscous with the sixties, when the Champs-Elysées was still cool and Belmondo was making movies with Godard. Maybe that’s because my father would always tell me that when he lived in Paris, couscous was his favorite “French” dish (along with all that stuff about the Champs-Elysées and Belmondo and Godard). You can buy prepared couscous almost everywhere in France, even at my local market here in the countryside, and these are often very good, but at the end of the day, I think the best version is the one I make myself.</div>

Some came from the need to preserve food or from lack of alternatives, or were happened upon by chance—as was the case with Champagne. This simple yet luscious dish was born out of two things: my having too much fruit and having too little time to do anything complicated with it. So the fruit ended up in a parchment envelope, a technique I most often use to cook fish. The result was satisfying, to say the least, and so this has become my go-to summer dessert when I have no time to make dessert.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div528">I adore the period in early summer when you can still get beautiful peonies at the market and cherries and apricots have started showing up in the stalls. The grass is still green and vivid, before the scorching temperatures of July and August take away its luster; there are no crowds at the beach; and the summer has still so much promise and winter seems an eternity away. I must admit that I don’t really use cherries much for cooking, though we buy bags and bags. It seems that no sooner have I put them in a bowl on our kitchen table, often mixed with apricots, than little hands have grabbed them all. Occasionally there are enough to have them with ice cream, or to make this cherry clafoutis, a family favorite. I leave the pits in, as I find they add to the flavor and somehow make the clafoutis more authentic—rustic and appealing. Just be sure to warn your guests about the pits!</div>
