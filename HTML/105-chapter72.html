<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This moist rice dish, common in the mountainous parts of Spain, is sometimes called <em>arroz a la cazuela</em>, after the round terra-cotta casserole (<em>cazuela</em>) used to prepare it. Sometimes it has chicken or fresh sausage, and not infrequently some pork ribs are added. I like stirring in a pounded picada of nuts to thicken the dish slightly and give it an earthy backbone.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Remove the skin from the chicken and trim any excess fat. Cut the thighs into two pieces each, keeping the knife blade along the bone, leaving the bone attached to one of the pieces. Generously season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden and fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove and reserve.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Add the chicken and sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In the same pan, prepare a sofrito with the onion and tomatoes, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. Stir in the pimentón and saffron, return the chicken and sausage to the pan, and turn over to coat. Add 1 cup/240 ml of the stock. Cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the liquid has mostly reduced and the chicken is quite tender.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Prepare a picada with the reserved garlic, the hazelnuts, parsley, and 1 tablespoon of liquid from the pan, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Add the remaining 6 cups/1.4 ml stock to the pan and bring to a boil. Add the rice and cook uncovered over medium-high heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the picada, reduce the heat to low, and cook uncovered for a final 7 to 8 minutes, or until the rice grains are tender but still have an al dente bite to them.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Remove from the heat and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</p>
