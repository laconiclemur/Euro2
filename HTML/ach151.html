<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pesce al forno intero</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This dish is not complicated to prepare and it makes for an impressive presentation. Red snapper, sea bass, striped bass, pompano, and salmon are all good whole fish to bake. When a fish is baked whole, it is flavorful and juicy. This is especially true for smaller fish that can be dry when cooked as fillets, such as Mediterranean sea bass (branzino) and sea bream (dorado). Whatever type of fish you select be sure it is fresh, with bright gills and no fishy smell.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Season the cavity of the fish with salt and pepper. Tuck the garlic, rosemary, thyme, parsley, fennel, and lemon wedges into the cavity. Place the celery stalks on the bottom of a roasting pan large enough to hold the fish, and lay the fish on top. Brush 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over the fish. Broil the fish about 3 inches below the heat source until the skin colors slightly, about 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Remove from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 375° F. Roast the fish until the flesh is firm and flakes away when a small knife is inserted near the spine, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven. Transfer the fish to a warm serving platter, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside.</p>

Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and simmer to thicken slightly, about 1 minute. Pour the sauce over the fish and serve immediately.</p>
