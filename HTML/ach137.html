<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_267"/><a id="ach137"/>pork tenderloin with fennel and rosemary</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">arista di maiale alla fiorentina</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">In this recipe, the pork absorbs the finely diced fennel’s sweet, pungent flavor while mellowing its natural licorice zest. Either pork tenderloin or boneless loin of pork may be used. Serve it with roasted potatoes and a simply prepared winter green, such as escarole or broccoli rabe.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 bulb fresh fennel, finely diced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons canola oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 pork tenderloins (1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds each)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 sprig fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely diced carrots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely diced celery</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup coarsely chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups chicken broth or water</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 375° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Toss the rosemary in a bowl with the garlic, fennel, and 1 tablespoon of the oil, stirring to make a paste. Spread half the mixture on top of one of the pork tenderloins. Place the second tenderloin on top. Firmly tie the two tenderloins together with butcher’s string. With a sharp knife, make several large holes or angled incisions in the tenderloins and stuff the remaining fennel mixture into these incisions. Cut the rosemary sprig into thirds and tuck under the string. Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper on all sides.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large flameproof casserole set over medium-high heat. Sear the tenderloin until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Distribute the carrots, celery, and onions around the meat. Place the casserole in the oven and bake until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 155° F on a meat thermometer, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_268"/><span class="red">4.</span> Remove the tenderloin from the casserole to a warm plate, wrap in aluminum foil, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Set the casserole over medium-high heat. Stir the chicken broth into the vegetables and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring frequently, to loosen any meat that has stuck to the bottom of the casserole. Allow the sauce to reduce slightly, about 5 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Press firmly on the vegetables with the back of a spoon to extract their flavor. Discard the vegetables and reserve the sauce. Remove the butcher’s string and thinly slice the pork.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Arrange the pork on a platter or individual plates. Spoon the sauce over the slices of pork, and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> Here are a few other ideas for cooking with fennel:</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> The leafy part of the fennel bulb may be used as an herb in place of dill; it is a flavorful addition to marinades for fish or meat.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> To make a simple salad, thinly slice a fennel bulb and toss it with orange sections, thinly sliced red onion, arugula, and a mild vinaigrette.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> Pureed fennel is an excellent accompaniment to fish. Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add 1 fennel bulb, cut into wedges, 1 shallot, diced, and 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves. Cover and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Puree these ingredients in a blender or processor. Stir in the grated zest of 1 orange and 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Place a dollop in the center of each diner’s plate, and top with a portion of grilled fish. Use a vegetable peeler to shave a few slices of raw fennel over the fish, and garnish with a few fennel leaves.</p>
