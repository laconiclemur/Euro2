<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">sardinas en escabeche–andalusia</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary">Escabeche <span class="italic">was originally a way of preserving game, such as partridge and rabbit, and fish, such as sardines, mackerel, and tuna, that has now become a delicacy to be served cold. The name is said to originate from the Persian word</span> sikbaj, <span class="italic">which refers to food with vinegar. Foods in</span> escabeche <span class="italic">are normally dipped in flour and deep-fried before being marinated, but in Andalusia, they prefer to just poach their sardines very briefly in the marinade. This can be a mix of just olive oil and vinegar (that is too sharp for me) or of olive oil, vinegar, and dry white wine. I did not have enough dry white wine when I made this, so I added some Moscatel, which gave the sardines a lovely sweet touch.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Ask the fishmonger to prepare the sardines. The sardines should be made at least a day before you want to start serving them as a tapa or starter, and they will keep for a few weeks in the refrigerator. Serve them, if you like, on toasted bread.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 5</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds sardines, heads cut off, gutted, scaled, and backbone removed</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup dry white wine or a mix of a dry wine with a little Moscatel, or as needed</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup white wine vinegar, or as needed</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup olive oil, or as needed</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">3 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">10 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="qun1">A sprig of thyme or oregano</p>
<p class="recsum">Arrange the sardines in layers in a wide saucepan.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Mix the white wine, vinegar, and olive oil together and season with a little salt. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and sprig of thyme or oregano and pour over the sardines. If the mixture does not cover them entirely, add a little more of the liquids in equal quantities. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool, then transfer to a glass or ceramic dish, cover with plastic wrap, and keep in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before serving, as the oil in the marinade almost solidifies when it is cold.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Add ½ teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika).</p>
<p class="bl-last">• If you don’t have Moscatel wine, you can add ½ to 1 teaspoon sugar.</p>
