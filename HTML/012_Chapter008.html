    <p class="noindent1"><a id="page_281"/><span class="small">TAPAS, PINCHOS, CANAPÉS, APPETIZERS</span>—call it what you will, these are small dishes that challenge the taste buds and tease the palate into wanting more. Ideally, these should be seasoned with something more than just salt and pepper. In Sweden, our tapas can be too polished, and I’m not just referring to the flavors, but rather how we eat them and how they look on the plate. Often in an environment that’s a little too stylish, and with a murmur in the background that’s a little too perfect, with wardrobes that are just a little too fashionable. But that’s the way Swedes are, and I’m probably just the same. Maybe in other countries, their tapas and tapas experiences are less overly refined.</p>

    <p class="indent">When serving your guests tapas, equip them with one simple fork, and plate the food a little haphazardly. This way, their focus will be on the flavors in the dish, and they won’t be distracted. Put the plates on the table and serve with a glass of Cava. Dare to be spontaneous, even if you’re in complete control. Don’t play too perfect music and don’t bother combing and bobby-pinning back your children’s hair until they look impeccable but stiff. Just avoid being too polished. That’s how I like it!</p>

    <p class="indent">The pictures on pages 282, 286, and 291 show three different kinds of tapas menus, in which the dishes complement each other perfectly. But, of course, you can also combine all sorts of tapas dishes and serve it up as a buffet or as appetizers. Or you can choose your five favorite tapas, and make them your whole dinner!</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_1"><a id="page_282"/>167. Smoked Salmon in Puff Pastry</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Puff pastry is folded dough that flakes when baked and becomes really crispy. Puff pastry should be cold when you work with it. One tip is to throw the rolling pin in the freezer to prevent the dough from sticking to it. You can buy great ready-made puff pastry dough, both refrigerated and frozen varieties. And if you bake puff pastry whole in the oven, you’ll always achieve fantastic results.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 sheets of frozen puff pastry</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 silver onions</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp (50 g) butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10½ oz (300 g) smoked salmon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (200 ml) sour cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Roll out each puff pastry until it has doubled in length and width. Tear the sheets more or less in half and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Peel the onions and slice them thinly, preferably with a mandolin. Melt the butter in a frying pan and toss the onions. Let them absorb the fat and soften without getting any color. Divide the onion across the middles of the four pastry sheets, leaving a wide margin all around.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Bake the puff pastry in the oven for about 15 minutes until it puffs up and turns golden.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Put the smoked salmon pieces onto the puff pastry. Drizzle some sour cream on top and season with salt and pepper. Serve right away.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_2">168. Catalan Breakfast—<span class="italic">Pa Amb Tomàquet</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">A Catalan breakfast at its finest! To breakfast in a Catalonian household is something truly special. They serve freshly crushed tomatoes, their best olive oil, some white bread, and a cup of coffee so delicious it blows your mind. It’s a far cry from the daily typical milk and cereal breakfast. This Catalan breakfast can be eaten in large quantities and at any time, even as an appetizer or a snack.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 thick slices of sourdough bread</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 garlic cloves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tomatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2–3 tbsp peppery olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp sea salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the tomatoes by first scoring an “x” at the top of each tomato and then putting them in the boiling water for about 30 seconds. Remove them from the water and let them cool down in ice water.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Peel the tomatoes and cut them into pieces—remember to remove the stems. Place the tomatoes in a bowl and crush them haphazardly with a fork. Stir in 1 tbsp of olive oil.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Peel and crush the garlic cloves. Toast the bread and the garlic cloves in a frying pan with some olive oil until the bread is golden brown.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve the bread with a heaping helping of crushed tomatoes on top. Drizzle with some olive oil and season with sea salt and freshly ground pepper.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_3"><a id="page_283"/>169. Marinated Peppers with Goat Cheese and Sultan Raisins</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I’ve been “dragging” this dish around with me for a long time, and I’ve served it more times than I can remember for just about every kind of occasion. Mix it into a salad or eat it as is with some fresh bread.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 bell peppers (1 yellow and 1 red)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">7 oz (200 g) goat cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">fresh basil for garnish</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MARINADE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 shallot, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp white wine vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp honey</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp roasted almond slices</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp sultana raisins</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Set the oven to broil.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Glaze the peppers with some oil and lay them in a baking pan. Place the pan in the oven and char the pepper skins. This will take about 10 minutes. Remove the peppers and put them in a plastic bag that you can close with a knot; it’s easier to peel the peppers after they have steamed in the bag.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix all the ingredients for the marinade.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Remove the peppers from the bag. Peel them and cut them into thick slivers. Break the cheese into pieces. Arrange the cheese and peppers in a serving bowl, and pour the sweet and sour marinade over them. Top it all off with some almond slices and this dish is ready to be served!</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_4">170. Roast Beef with Julienned Vegetables and Horseradish Dip</p>

  <p class="noindentl">One sunny day in Sandhamn, we were recording a TV program and made these roast beef roll-ups. Buy presliced roast beef to make them in a jiffy!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8–10 slices of roast beef (cold cuts)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 carrot</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 celery stalks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1–2 inches (a few cm) fresh horseradish</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MARINADE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp mirin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp Japanese soy sauce</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Julienne the celery and carrot (i.e., cut into thin strips). Shred the horseradish.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Roll up the roast beef, wrapped around the julienned vegetables.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix all the ingredients for the marinade in a bowl.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_5"><a id="page_285"/>171. Large White Beans with Chorizo</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This is a favorite of mine. It only contains a few ingredients but still packs a punch. The acid from the vinegar is important, so feel free to apply it liberally. My colleague, Benny, and I made this simple farmer’s dish in Barcelona. The beans were scooped onto rustic, chipped plates and didn’t exactly look like fine dining. But to our palates, it was like arriving in heaven. I love this kind of food—where the focus is on <span class="italic">flavor</span>! You can also serve this dish as the main course.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 fresh chorizo sausages</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 can large white beans (save 3½ tbsp of the bean juice)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tbsp white wine vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   In a frying pan, sauté the sausages over medium heat until they are golden brown. Place them on a cutting board.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Pour the beans and the stock into the frying pan and mix in the butter and vinegar. Shred the garlic into the pan and mix. The beans should get hot.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Cut the sausages roughly on the diagonal—they shouldn’t look pretty!—and serve with the beans. Season with salt and pepper. It’s so simple and is delicious beyond belief!</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_6">172. Potato Pancakes with Cheese, Bresaola, and Caramelized Lemon</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I once made these potato pancakes with Robert Aschberg at Högmarsö, just outside of Stockholm. Fat, juicy, and hearty. A substantial lunch dish. Rough and a little unpolished.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 potatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 small piece of leek (approx. 2 inches [5 cm])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9–11 oz (250–300 g) fresh cheese, with a white crust (e.g., Chaource or aged brie)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 lemons</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">6–8 slices of bresaola or dry cured ham</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Peel and coarsely shred the potatoes. Slice the leek finely. Combine the potatoes and leeks, and season with salt and pepper. Shape the potatoes into pancakes and pan-fry them in olive oil until they are crispy. Keep them hot.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Heat up another frying pan. Drizzle some olive oil into the pan and sprinkle in some salt. Flash-fry the cheese at high heat until it caramelizes (is nicely browned) and then stick it in the oven for a few minutes until it feels soft.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Caramelize the lemons in the frying pan by cutting them in half and frying the cut surface.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Plate the cheese and potato pancakes on a large platter and garnish with the bresaola. Squeeze fresh lemon juice on top of each potato pancake.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_7"><a id="page_286"/>173. Khachapuri</p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">Khachapuri</span> is a traditional Georgian cheese bread and is served at parties in that country. A delicious little dish that complements other tapas dishes. My version includes some shortcuts.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 Sara Lee thick pizza dough</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) mozzarella or other fatty cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ red chili</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of sage (or thyme or rosemary)</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Shred the cheese. Core and thinly slice the chili.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Place the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle cheese, chili, and sage on half the dough. Fold the other half over it and pinch the edges together with your fingers, like you’re making a calzone.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Bake the cheese bread in the oven for about 15 minutes. It should then be really tall and will have a crispy crust—the surface can even be a little charred. Remove the bread from the oven and let it rest for a minute before you cut it up and sink your teeth into it.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">EASILY CORE A CHILI</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Roll the whole chili between your fingers and then cut off the root. I promise all the seeds will fall out through the hole once you turn the chili upside down.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_8">174. Toast Pelle Janzon</p>

  <p class="noindentl">We all love to put tasty toppings on bread. Toast Pelle Janzon got its name from the Swedish opera singer Per Janzon. It’s a less famous cousin of the classic Toast Skagen, but it’s a success every time!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) beef tenderloin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 red onion, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">small, delicate lettuce leaves, such as radicchio</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 slices of white bread</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp (30 g) butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 tbsp fish roe</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 egg yolks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of chives, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">sea salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Clean the beef tenderloin of any tendons. Slice the meat into four thin slices and put them between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound them with a meat tenderizer until they are thin. Since the beef tenderloin is so tender, you have to be careful not to break it when pounding it. Use a meat tenderizer.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the red onion and lettuce in a bowl.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Pan-fry the bread in butter. Layer the raw meat, a dollop of fish roe, and egg yolk on top of the bread just as in the picture on <a href="../Text/012_Chapter008.html#page_286">page 286</a>. Top it off with the onion and lettuce mixture, some chives, sea salt, and some freshly ground pepper.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">PREPARE THE TOAST</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Toast Pelle Janzon is perfect to serve at big gatherings. Pound out the meat, wrap it carefully, and then stick it in the freezer. When you take it out of the freezer, you can just put it on a plate and it will thaw in minutes!</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_9"><a id="page_288"/>175. Roasted Eggplant with Sesame Seeds and Balsamic Vinegar</p>

  <p class="noindentl">It really can be this simple! A tasty roasted eggplant with roasted sesame seeds and the fine acidity of the balsamic vinegar. You can mix it all together with a hand mixer if you so desire. Add a little bit of olive oil, and you’ll have yourself a delicious eggplant dip.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 eggplants</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Halve the eggplant lengthwise. Split the garlic and rub it into the eggplant halves. Add some olive oil. Place the eggplants with their open-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes until they are lightly roasted and soft. Turn them over and sprinkle some sesame seeds on top.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Plate the eggplants and drizzle with balsamic vinegar. When serving, let your guests scoop the eggplant flesh directly onto their own plates.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_10">176. Black Beans with Mango and Cumin</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Perhaps not the prettiest dish but it’s certainly tasty! Mango, cumin, and black beans make a heavenly combination. The cilantro and lemon are the cherry on top.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 large mango or a package of frozen mango</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">chunks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (200 ml) canned black beans</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Squeeze the lime juice over the mixture and garnish with some fresh cilantro.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_11"><a id="page_289"/>177. Saganaki with Capers and Lemon Salsa</p>

  <p class="noindentl">The capers and lemon salsa is the key to this dish. Previously I used halloumi cheese, but then I discovered its Greek cousin saganaki, named for the frying pan it’s made in. Freshly chopped lemon is really great for everyday salad, since you can forget about oil and vinegar.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) saganaki cheese (or halloumi)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CAPERS AND LEMON SALSA:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel and core the cucumber and cut it into thin slices. Wash the lemon and zest it. Mix the cucumber, capers, and lemon zest in a bowl. Cut the pulp of lemon coarsely—just remember to remove the seeds first. Mix the red onion, basil, and olive oil into the bowl with cucumber, capers, and lemon zest. Season with pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Heat up a frying pan on the stove. Pour in a small amount of oil, about ½ tsp, and then add the cheese. Let it sauté until it turns golden brown. Try to be patient and only lift the cheese after it has been in the pan for at least 30 seconds. Then flip it over and repeat the procedure.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Tear the cheese into large chunks. Pour the salsa on top and serve right away.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_12">178. Chicken Salad with Truffle Mayo</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Great with any tapas dish, as a stand-alone, or as part of a buffet. Be careful with the truffle oil as it can easily become overpowering. The mayo is also great with the carpaccio on <a href="../Text/012_Chapter008.html#page_292">page 292</a>.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10½ oz (300 g) chicken meat, pan-fried or from a store-bought roasted chicken</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add all the beans, do a 10-second dance, and drain the beans. Rinse them in cold water. Let them dry on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the egg yolks and Dijon mustard in a bowl. Drip the oil into the mixture while whisking until the mayo has thickened. Add the heavy cream and season with truffle oil and freshly squeezed lemon juice.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Combine the chicken, beans, and onion in a bowl. Mix in the truffle mayo to make the salad “stick together.” The chicken isn’t supposed to be drowning in mayonnaise.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Plate the salad and season with salt and a hearty dose of freshly ground pepper.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">My colleague, Benny, and I made this dish during a guest appearance in Moscow. Even though it has very few ingredients, it’s quite a long “to do” list. It’s not difficult, but it does take some time to prepare.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 parsnips</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">phyllo dough</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp (50 g) butter, melted</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">sea salt flakes</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">LEMON MARINADE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) powdered sugar</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel the parsnips and put them in water, preferably with some lemon juice so they don’t change color. In the meantime, bring a sauce-pan of water to a boil and sprinkle in some salt. Add the parsnips and boil until soft.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Cut the lemon half into pieces and remove the seeds. Mix zest and pulp with powdered sugar until it turns into a thick sauce.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Add the parsnips and lemon marinade. Let them rest for as long as possible, preferably overnight but certainly no less than an hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Preheat the oven to 500ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Place two sheets of phyllo dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Glaze one-half of each sheet with butter and fold the sheets in half. You should end up with two sheets of double phyllo dough.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Place a cooked parsnip on each sheet of phyllo dough and add a little bit of marinade. Roll up the dough tight. Glaze the roll-ups with some butter and sprinkle some of the salt on top. Bake in the oven for 7–10 minutes. They should be golden brown and crispy when they are ready. Slice the rolls and serve them hot.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_14">180. Quail Eggs with Marinated Salmon Roe</p>

  <p class="noindentl">You might think it’s difficult to get a hold of quail eggs, but that’s not really the case. Go to a Polish supermarket to find them fresh and cheap. You’ll have to buy the salmon roe at a fish counter though. The main thing about the salmon roe is that they need to be big to soak up as much of the marinade as possible.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">12 quail eggs</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) salmon roe</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MARINADE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lime</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tsp mirin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp rice wine vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp finely shredded ginger</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Boil the quail eggs for 3 minutes. Rinse them quickly in cold water. Peel the eggs (see below) and put them aside.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix all the ingredients for the marinade. Add the salmon roe and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes. The longer the better, since the roe will absorb the marinade and be really tasty.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Serve the salmon roe with the quail eggs as tapas or as an appetizer—preferably with some cream-marinated red currant salad (see <a href="../Text/006_Chapter002.html#page_33">page 33</a>).</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">HOW TO PEEL QUAIL EGGS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Pour equal parts of white wine vinegar and water into a bowl. Put the quail eggs into the water-vinegar mix, and soon the quail shells will start to crackle and dissolve.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_15"><a id="page_291"/>181. Coppa-baked Ground Meat with Dates</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I got bored of making our traditional “jumping devils.” It’s like taking a sleeping pill—it’s so mundane. I decided to update this dish and make these little devils. Give them a try—see if they’re to your liking!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">14 oz (400 g) ground meat of your choice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) cream cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tbsp green curry paste</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp chopped, pickled coriander (can be found in the Asian food section in the supermarket)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) chopped and cored dates</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">15 slices coppa (air-dried pork shoulder)</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the ground meat with cream cheese, curry paste, coriander, salt, and dates.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Roll the meat mixture into little balls and cover them with the coppa (see picture opposite). Keep in mind to wrap the balls delicately so they’re smooth on the surface.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Place the coppa balls on a baking sheet and bake them in the oven for 10–15 minutes. Serve the little devils hot.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_16">182. Olive-baked Cabbage with Cress</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Both my husband and I love cabbage, preferably roasted cabbage. When the cabbage comes out of the oven something magical happens, and the whole kitchen is filled with a sweet, nutty scent that is hard to beat. The pointy cabbage is great served cold for buffets and is a feast for the eyes.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 pointy cabbage</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">tapenade (olive paste, which can be bought ready-made)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">watercress, arugula, or parsley for garnish</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Cut the cabbage into 8 wedges. Place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle some olive oil on top and season with salt and pepper. Bake in the oven until the cabbage has turned almost black, for about 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Dollop the tapenade in between the leaves. Then, remove the stem and roll up the cabbage into a ball. Garnish with watercress, arugula, or parsley.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_17">183. Pan-fried Calamari</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Calamari can be found frozen in most fish markets.</p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Toast the bread in a hot frying pan with some olive oil. Break the bread into pieces and put aside.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Sauté them in oil until they turn soft. Turn the heat up and add the calamari. Continue to sauté over high heat for another 2–3 minutes until the calamari appears springy and rolls up on itself. Season with salt and pepper. Add the bread pieces and squeeze the lemon on top. Serve straight from the pan.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_18"><a id="page_293"/>184. Carpaccio with Chanterelles and Artichoke Cream</p>

  <p class="noindentl">The last time I made carpaccio, I used elk tenderloin, but that can be a challenge to find, so using beef is perfectly fine. The artichoke cream is also perfect to dip vegetables or bread in.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) elk or beef tenderloin</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CHANTERELLE MIX:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cups (500 ml) chanterelles</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) fresh or frozen &amp; thawed lingonberries (or cranberries)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (50 g) aged cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">ARTICHOKE CREAM:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 jar artichoke hearts (approx. 14 oz [400 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Clean the meat of any tendons or membranes. Cut it into thin slices and pound it flat between sheets of plastic wrap. Don’t pound too hard on the tenderloin; you have to be gentle to prevent it from tearing. The bottom of a pot works well.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the artichoke hearts (without the juice they come in) with olive oil and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Mix into a smooth cream. Season with salt.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Peel the garlic and crush it with the side of a knife blade. Pan-fry the chanterelles in butter with the garlic until they are crispy.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Spread out the meat onto individual plates or on a large platter. Dollop the cream on top of each piece and spread the chanterelle mixture on top. Sprinkle lingonberries and cheese over it. Drizzle with olive oil and enjoy it outside/inside/standing/sitting down.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">HOW TO SAUTÉ MUSHROOMS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Sautéing mushrooms can be complicated because they contain so much water. If you don’t have enough heat when sautéing them, the mushrooms have a tendency to boil rather than sauté. If that happens, just let the water evaporate! When all the water is gone you can just sauté the mushrooms until they’re really crispy. Don’t be afraid to burn them!</span></p>
