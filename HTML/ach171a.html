<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_339"/>traditional flaky cake with mascarpone sauce</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">torta sabbiosa con salsa al mascarpone</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a rather old-fashioned cake—one from Gianni’s childhood—but its delicate texture and great flavor stand the test of time. Potato starch is one reason this cake is very flaky and light-tasting. It is available in health food stores and in some supermarkets. The cake may be stored in an airtight container for up to three days.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CAKE</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">14 tablespoons (1<sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> sticks) butter, softened</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups potato starch</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon baking powder</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon cognac or dark rum (such as Myers’s)</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE MASCARPONE SAUCE</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 ounces mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon Grand Marnier, brandy, or grappa</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 300° F. Grease the bottom and sides of a loaf pan with butter or cooking spray. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease the parchment paper with butter or cooking spray, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the butter with the granulated sugar and vanilla until very creamy, about 5 minutes. Mix in the potato starch and salt. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. In a small bowl, whisk the baking powder and cognac. Beat this mixture into the cake batter.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_340"/><span class="red">3.</span> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake until it is lightly browned and a cake tester comes out clean, about 1 hour. (Do not open the oven during the first 40 minutes of baking or the cake may fall.) Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan. When it has cooled gently remove it from the pan and peel away the parchment paper.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> When ready to serve, place the mascarpone cheese, confectioners’ sugar, and Grand Marnier in a small bowl and whisk together. Cut the cake into 1-inch-thick slices and top with a dollop of mascarpone sauce.</p>

This cake also goes well with assorted fresh summer berries.</p>
