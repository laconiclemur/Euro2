<p class="nonindent1" id="bm1-K11"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind17a"/>ANGELICA:</span> Found in colder climates as remote as Greenland and Lapland, angelica is a tall, hearty plant with a cap of greenish white blossoms. Gunnar uses every part of the angelica—stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds—in both fresh and pickled preparations. Its flavor is similar to that of celery, and in some parts of the world it is known as wild celery. Good alternatives for angelica are either tarragon or lovage.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind29a"/>ARCTIC CHAR:</span> Arctic char has been fished in Iceland since the arrival of the earliest settlers. It is a slow-growing fish with deep coral flesh, similar to that of salmon. Numerous char varieties exist, with some living part of their life at sea and finding their way back to Iceland’s pristine rivers where they were born and others spending their entire life in rivers. The arctic char is similar to trout in its firm structure and flavor. In Icelandic, both trout and arctic char are called <em>silunger</em>.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind35a"/>ARCTIC THYME:</span> You will find arctic thyme growing nearly everywhere in Iceland. In spite of its abundance, it wasn’t until recently that it started showing up as both a cooking ingredient and a garnish in Icelandic kitchens. Today, it is a favorite with the nation’s restaurant chefs and home cooks alike, who are delighted that it often flourishes just outside their kitchen door. Arctic thyme is available in some specialty food markets outside of Iceland. It perfumes a dish with subtle florals, and its cheerful violet flowers prove an attractive garnish. A good substitute for arctic thyme is regular thyme.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind151a"/>BACALAO:</span> Cod that has been salted and dried in the traditional way for several months is a staple in Iceland. It is also popular in Spain and Portugal, which import much of Iceland’s salted cod production. But Icelanders make sure to keep enough of the firm, briny fish for their dinner tables. Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and Greek specialty markets will most likely stock bacalao on their shelves.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind68a"/>BIRCH:</span> It is only recently that Icelandic cooks have begun to look to their native trees for cooking ingredients. Contemporary Icelandic chefs are smoking and infusing oils with birch leaves, as well as grinding the dried leaves to a powder to use as a seasoning. Bay leaves are a comparable flavoring, though taking the time to source birch leaves will add an appealing woodsy flavor to recipes.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind392a"/>BLUE MUSSELS:</span> Although blue mussels have long been in the clean, clear waters off Iceland, they are only now being eaten by locals. Large and sweet with flesh the color of apricots, blue mussels derive their name from their shells, which gleam an electric blue in the sunlight. They are available in most fish markets.</p>
<p class="extract" id="bm1-K12"><a id="page334"/><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind162a"/>CROWBERRIES:</span> Dark, tart crowberries are one of the few berries that grow in Iceland. Similar in flavor and color to blueberries (which can be substituted), they are abundant in most areas of the country and are a favorite pairing with skyr and a sprinkling of sugar.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind542a"/>DULSE:</span> One of the foods eaten by Iceland’s earliest inhabitants, dulse, a deep red seaweed, has a leathery texture when fresh and is therefore typically dried before using. It is eaten as a snack and also used to flavor soups and breads, imparting a salty flavor that hints of the sea. Dulse is typically available dried, and sometimes it is salted and dried. Many Asian and Nordic specialty markets will carry it, but a good substitute is kombu.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind237a"/><a id="ind292a"/>HARDFISKUR:</span> The volcanic terrain of much of Iceland has meant that agricultural land is in short supply, and as a result, grains for making bread are an expensive proposition. Icelanders have devised a clever and healthful way to replace bread at the table with ocean-dried fish known as <em>hardfiskur</em>. It is made from wolffish, which is dried for several months in open-air houses perched just steps from the sea. Wind and salt blow through the fish as it dries, resulting in a briny flavor that pairs perfectly with sweet Icelandic butter.</p>
<p class="extract" id="bm1-K16"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind325a"/><a id="ind385a"/>ICELANDIC MOSS:</span> Despite the name, Icelandic moss is actually a lichen, and since the earliest times, it has been prized for both its health benefits and its flavoring properties. It is available dried in markets, and in the past, it provided—and continues to do so in some households—much-needed nutrients for vegetable-deprived Icelanders. It grows in nearly every region of the country and has the texture of dried shiitake mushrooms before rehydration. Once it is rehydrated, it becomes soft and gelatinous, making it an ideal ingredient for soups, breads, and sausages. Unfortunately, there is no substitute for Icelandic moss and should you not have it and a recipe calls for it, the best thing to do is omit it.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind358a"/>LOVAGE:</span> A hearty, tall-growing plant, lovage has a robust celerylike flavor, smooth green leaves, and small yellow flowers. It stands up to cooking in such preparations as soups, stews, and even sautés, and in early spring, when its flavor is less intense, it also makes a good salad ingredient. Tender celery leaves are a good substitute.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind362a"/>LUMPFISH:</span> Also known as lumpsuckers, stocky, short lumpfish thrive in the cold waters of Iceland, where they are a vital part of the fishing industry. Their roe is valued in Scandinavian cooking as an inexpensive alternative to sturgeon caviar and is used extensively throughout Iceland as a briny garnish. Salmon roe or whitefish roe are good substitutes.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind482a"/>RAPESEED OIL:</span> The neutral flavor of rapeseed oil makes it an ideal cooking oil. It also contains half the amount of saturated fat as olive oil and higher amounts of omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids than any other vegetable oil. Canola oil is the same thing as rapeseed oil. The name was changed by a Canadian company that did not think the word “rapeseed” would appeal to American and Canadian consumers. In Iceland, it’s always referred to as rapeseed.</p>
<p class="extract" id="bm1-K1"><a id="page335"/><span class="dk_blue">RUGBRAUD:</span> Also known as geyser bread, this sweet rye bread has been baked for centuries using geothermal heat naturally pumped into ovens dug in the ground. Its dense texture and hearty composition make it an ideal companion to a slick of softened butter.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind593a"/>SORREL:</span> Frequently used as an herb in salads, sorrel grows wild throughout much of Iceland. It has a bright, zesty flavor and is also enjoyed plucked straight from the bush. Wherever he finds himself in Iceland, Gunnar knows the herb composition of the land beneath his feet, and you’ll often find him nibbling on wild sorrel as he explores the countryside. A good alternative to sorrel is a robust green such as spinach or arugula sprinkled with lemon juice.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind567a"/>SKYR:</span> Although skyr is technically a cheese, it is often compared to thick Greek yogurt in texture and flavor. Icelanders are crazy for skyr, and it is sold in virtually every market, both plain and in such flavored varieties as melon, almond, and banana. Skyr was originally a by-product of the lacto-fermentation technique used to ferment lamb by soaking it in milk. Icelanders soon developed a taste for the residual thickened milk that formed on the interior barrel walls. They eventually began to make a vegetarian version of skyr, and today it is hard to imagine an Icelandic refrigerator without skyr in it. Skyr is available at many large grocery store chains. A suitable alternative is Greek yogurt.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind663a"/>WHEY:</span> A by-product of skyr making in Iceland, whey is the liquid that remains when the curds have separated. It is used in marinades to add a vibrant tanginess to meats and is a nice addition to bread and pastry recipes. It can be used to preserve and ferment such items as lamb and fish. In Iceland, it has been traditionally used to make mysuostur, a caramelized brown cheese spread beloved throughout the country.</p>
