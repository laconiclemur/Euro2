  <p class="h1">Breads, Flatbread, Lefse, and More</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Our Daily Bread (V</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">rt daglige brød)</span></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Surely one of the happiest memories of home is the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread. I have seen many persons butter a thick slice of homemade bread with such a gleam of anticipation in their eyes that it defies description.</span></p>

  <p class="indent1">In Norway, homemade bread, hot out of the oven, is a favorite treat anytime. Today we do not have to fire up the old wood stove, so set aside an afternoon, or an evening, to make some delicious breads, rolls, lefser, or flatbread to keep for those times when you wish for something nourishing and tasty. Breads, rolls, and lefser freeze well, and flatbread keeps well in airtight containers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many shy away from making bread because they think it is a difficult process, when actually it is rather easy. It does take a little time and muscle, unless you have a food processor with a kneading hook (I love my Braun). But one’s efforts are richly rewarded as soon as the heavenly aroma begins to seep out of the oven. You can make your breads plain or do what is popular in Norway—try out a fancy design.</p>

  <p class="indent">I realize there are several good bread-making machines on the market, which obviously are great time savers. But they do take away the joy of making the bread. But if a bread machine is the only way you have time to enjoy homemade bread, by all means use one.</p>

  <p class="indent">No matter what type of bread you make, it is an undisputed fact that homemade bread benefits our families greatly, since we choose the ingredients and do not add chemical stabilizers or preservatives. Homemade bread is an excellent source of dietary fiber and provides protein and carbohydrates. And when we bake with whole grains, we ensure our families are supplied with one of the richest sources of vitamin B and iron.</p>

  <p class="indent">Natural food stores usually carry a large selection of varied grains and flour, and they are often willing to take special orders. Once your grain or flour is purchased, maintain its food value by storing it in a cool, dry place. Freezing or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids are perfect for this.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/109-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_110"/>Successful Bread Making (Vellykket brødbakst)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Use the best ingredients you can afford. It is of no avail to exert the effort of bread making only to see your endeavor fail or fall short of your expectation because you cheated on the ingredients.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">All ingredients should be at room temperature. Assemble in advance all ingredients and any needed equipment and utensils. Prepare the baking pans.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The proper flour is important. Bread flour is best for all types of bread, or use unbleached flour.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Handle the yeast with care for its complete cooperation. Dry yeast should be dissolved in a temperature of approximately 110–115°F (43–46°C), whereas 85°F (30°C) is just right for compressed yeast. To hasten this action you may add a little sugar, but no more than specified in the recipe. Fresh yeast will activate within a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">The dough must be workable, neither too stiff nor sticky. Allow it to rise in a warm, draft-free area, giving it enough time to double in bulk. If desired, the dough may be allowed to rise and fall a number of times during the dough-making process to improve texture, but do not allow it to over-expand.</p>

  <p class="indent">Do not cheat on your kneading. Gluten develops through prolonged kneading and results in smoother, more elastic dough. A food processor with a dough hook is ideal (see Special Help chapter).</p>

  <p class="indent">Oven temperature must be accurate. Be sure the bread is thoroughly baked. Do invest in a <span class="bold">Commercial-Grade Instant-Read Test Thermometer</span>; it takes the guessing out of bread baking. The internal temperature of perfectly baked bread is 190–205°F (88–96°C). The Instant-Read Test Thermometer can tell you the internal temperature in seconds. If you do not have one, tap the bottom of the bread; when it sounds hollow, it is done.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="blue">Causes of Failure in Bread Making:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Porous bread:</span> usually stems from insufficient kneading, thus not giving the gluten a chance to develop. This in turn causes bubbles of gas to be distributed unevenly throughout the loaf. It is of utmost importance to knead thoroughly. Allowing the dough to over-expand may also result in porous bread. Do not allow dough to exceed double in bulk before punching down.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Sour or yeast flavored bread:</span> caused by too much yeast, allowing the dough to over-expand, or not keeping the dough warm enough during the rising process. By placing dough in a closed draft-free area, such as an oven, this problem will be eliminated.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Water-streaked, soggy, or heavy bread:</span> may be caused by poor quality flour, inferior quality yeast and slow rising, lack of thorough baking, or rough handling of the freshly baked bread before it was completely cooled.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Broken or separated crust:</span> could be caused by poor quality flour or adding too much flour, or not allowing dough to rise properly. To give each loaf a shiny surface, brush with water, milk, or butter before you bake. However, loaves will get a rougher surface and a more homemade look—which many prefer—if you do not brush the dough. Whatever you do, find the time to make homemade bread. <span class="italic">Lykke til,</span> Good luck!</p>

  <p class="h3">Herb Bread (Urteloff)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Excellent with hot soups or salads.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 pkg. active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="ing">4 cups (500 g.) bread flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¼ cups (3 dl) water, warm</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (50 g.) butter, softened</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing"><a id="page_111"/>¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) mixed fresh herbs, such as chives, dill, parsley, and basil</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (50 g.) scant butter</p>

  <p class="ingl">Egg</p>

  <p class="noindent">Dissolve yeast in warm water and add to a large bowl. Add salt and sugar. Work ¼ cup butter into 3 cups flour as for pie crust and add to yeast mixture. Knead 7 minutes until the dough is pliable and smooth. Cover and let rise in the refrigerator overnight. Remove to a floured surface and work in as much of the remaining flour as needed to make smooth dough. Roll the dough out to 10 × 20 inches (25 × 50 cm). Spread softened butter across the dough. Sprinkle with finely chopped herbs. Beginning with the long edge, roll the bread up jelly roll fashion, and place seam down on a parchment-covered baking sheet. With a sharp knife make diagonal cuts, on top of the bread’s surface, about 1 inch (2 ½ cm) apart. Cover and rise 20 minutes. Brush with egg and bake in preheated 435°F (225°C) oven for 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="h3">Else’s Coarse Bread (Else’s Grovbrød)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Else Rønnevig is the vivacious and talented Mistress of Snoringsmoen, the first Swiss Chalet build in 1867, in Lillesand. Else has a deep love and concern for the Norwegian cultural history and food traditions. She has won many prizes for her delicious and fancy breads (see picture).</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/111-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">As Mistress of Snøringsmoen she favors her guests with meals spiced with cultural history. To visit Snøringsmoen is “a journey for the senses.” It is to enjoy the tastes, sounds, aromas, and atmosphere of the past. Now you can make her delicious and beautifully decorated bread. Make the dough in the evening and set in refrigerator overnight.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (6 ¼ dl) water 115°F (45°C)</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) dark rye flour</p>

  <p class="ing">2 pkgs. active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="ing">1½–2 cups (4–5 dl) bread flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. dark syrup</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (20 g.) wheat bran</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. margarine, melted and cooled</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (80 g.) oat bran</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (5 dl) graham flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tbsp. salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a large bowl, add warm water, yeast, and syrup. Let stand 5 minutes until the yeast dissolves. Melt margarine and cool. When yeast has dissolved, add all remaining ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5–8 minutes. Place in a lightly-greased bowl and turn once. Cover tightly with lightly-greased plastic wrap and set to cool overnight. Remove to a lightly-floured surface and knead 2–3 minutes and shape into a round loaf. Place on a parchment-covered baking sheet.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Dough for decorations:</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) water, warm</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¼ cups (150 g.) bread flour</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tbsp. active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="ing">Egg yolk</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (100 g.) light rye flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">Water</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a medium-sized bowl, add warm water and yeast. Let stand 5 minutes until yeast dissolves. Stir in enough flour to make fairly firm dough. Do not begin to knead before as much water as possible has carefully been worked into the flour. If the dough is too firm a <span class="italic">little</span> additional water may be added. Cover tightly with lightly greased plastic wrap, and set to cool overnight. To make spike of grain, roll into two ropes pointed at one end. Cut along the edges to form a spike (see picture). Or, shape into desired decoration and fasten to the round loaf with water. Set bread to rise 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Just before baking, brush the decoration only, with a slightly beaten egg yolk to which has been added 1 tablespoon of water. Bake on lowest rack 30–40 minutes. Bread <a id="page_112"/>is done when internal temperature is 190–205°F (88–96°C). Or tap bread on the bottom—when it sounds hollow, it is done. Watch the decoration so it does not become too dark. Cover with aluminum foil if necessary.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Makes 1 large round loaf</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Tips:</span> If you would like to display your beautiful creation, leave the bread to dry for 48 hours, with oven doors ajar, and temperature between 140–210°F (60–100°C). The breads must be completely dry or they could explode. If desired spray with a non-glossy lacquer.</p>

  <p class="h3">Multi-Grain Bread (Kneipploff)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Triticale, the first man-made hybrid grain, combines the nutrition of wheat, the taste of rye, and a protein/gluten content right in between the two. It also has a better balance of amino acids than either rye or wheat alone.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/113-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">A wonderfully satisfying bread made with either triticale or wheat kernels, easily attainable at natural food markets.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (180 g.) triticale or wheat kernels</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. molasses or honey</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) water, boiling</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (300 g.) whole wheat flour</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) kefir or soured skim milk</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. sunflower seed oil</p>

  <p class="ingl">3 ⅓ cups (450 g.) bread flour</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a small bowl, pour the boiling water over the triticale or wheat kernels and let stand for 1 hour. In a large bowl, add the yeast to a little of the kefir or sour skim milk, which has been slightly warmed. Add molasses or honey. When yeast is dissolved, add the remaining milk. Beat in the whole wheat flour, salt, and oil. Add the whole kernels and bread flour. Turn dough out on a floured board and knead the dough until glossy and elastic, about 10 minutes. Return to bowl which has been lightly greased, turn once, and cover. Set to rise in a draft-free, warm place until double in bulk. Remove onto a lightly floured board. Shape into a large round loaf and place in a 10-inch (25-cm) greased springform pan. Cover and let rise approximately 20 minutes. Brush with water and bake in preheated oven, 355–390°F (180–200°C), about 1 hour. The loaf is done when internal temperature is 190–205°F (88–96°C), or when the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let cool slightly in the pan before removing to a rack. Cool completely.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Makes 1 large round loaf</p>

  <p class="h3">Sweet Cardamom Bread (Hvetekake)</p>

  <p class="leftpara"><span class="italic">Traditionally this bread is formed into round loaves, so flavorful they are called hvetekake, wheat cake. Norwegians enjoy this bread with the heavenly cardamom aroma and flavor topped with the ever-popular sweet caramel-colored gjetost, goat cheese. It also tastes good with other mild cheeses or preserves.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 pkgs. active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="ing">⅓ cup (65 g.) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (6 dl) milk, warmed</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp. margarine, melted</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. cardamom, freshly ground</p>

  <p class="ing">4 ¾ cups (11 ¾ dl) unbleached, all-purpose flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">Butter, melted</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a large bowl, add yeast, milk, and margarine and stir until yeast is dissolved. Sift in 3 ½–3 ¾ cups <a id="page_114"/>(8 ¾–9 ¼ dl) of the flour, sugar, salt, and cardamom. Beat batter until glossy. Add 1 cup more flour. The dough will be very soft. Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead until elastic and glossy, 8–10 minutes, adding additional flour if needed. Lightly grease the bowl, and return dough to the bowl, turning once. Let rise in a draft free, warm place until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down. Turn dough out on a lightly floured board, using as little flour as possible. Divide into 2 parts, and shape into round loaves. Place on baking sheets covered with parchment paper, or dust lightly with flour, but do not grease the sheets. Set to rise in a draft-free, warm place until almost double in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush with melted butter and bake until done and a golden color, about 40–45 minutes. Remove to racks and brush with butter once more. Breads are done when they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</p>

  <p class="h3">Sigrid’s Best Rusks (Sigrid’s beste skonroker)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">A rusk is kind of a large round biscuit, sliced in two, and toasted in the oven after baking. The people of Selbu, where Sigrid Juul Røset lives, use a lot of tettemelk, a Norwegian type yogurt, during the summer. Traditionally tettemelk is served with crushed rusks and brown sugar.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">With a little variation in the recipe, you can serve these rusks with butter and cheese, particularly Norwegian goat cheese. That is how I remember enjoying the rusks as a child. Delicious!</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 ½ tbsp. (50 g.) margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ cups (100 g.) wheat bran</p>

  <p class="ing">7 tbsp. (100 g.) lard</p>

  <p class="ing">⅓ cup (75 g.) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">3 ¼ cups (8 dl) water or milk</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt of hartshorn</p>

  <p class="ingl">⅝ cup (200 g.) whole wheat flour</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a heavy pan melt the margarine and lard and add water or milk; heat to lukewarm. Use a small amount of the liquid to dissolve the yeast, let stand for 5 minutes, then return to the milk mixture. In a large bowl add remaining ingredients, but save out ⅓ of the unbleached flour. Pour in the milk and fat mixture. Add additional flour if needed. The dough should be very soft and pliable. Set to rise in a lightly greased bowl until it doubles in bulk. Turn dough out on lightly oiled working surface. Knead lightly. Divide the dough into thirty pieces and roll into balls. Place on greased baking sheet, and let rise until almost double in bulk. Preheat the oven to 480°F (250°C) and bake 10–12 minutes, or until they barely get color. Cool on rack. Divide the buns with a saw-toothed knife (it makes a smooth surface) and continue baking for 45–60 minutes at 175–210°F (80–100°C) with oven door ajar. Dry until crisp. These rusks are best used crushed for toppings. If you desire to use the rusks with butter and cheese use 3 ½ tbsp. (50 g.) lard and 7 tbsp. (100 g.) margarine, and use half milk (not 2%) and half water.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_120"/>Lefse</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Lefse is gjestebudkost! That is to say, party fare. In the last century flatbread was everyday fare; lefse belonged to the banquets and special celebrations. Almost every district had, and still has, its own favorite recipe for lefse, although it goes by different names in the different Norwegian districts.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Most lefse recipes do not require yeast, though a few do, such as <span class="italic">krotakaker</span> from Hardanger. It used to be that some women would go from farm to farm and make enough lefse for the families to last a year. It does take a little time to make lefse; however, when it tastes that good it is worth the effort. So go to work to keep this long-enjoyed Norwegian tradition alive.</p>

  <p class="indent">Most likely your first lefse will not be a paper-thin tasty creation, yet, if you keep at it, you will triumph. Today, we have so many tools to help us succeed, and if you are serious about learning how to make lefse, make a few investments to ensure success:</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Not all the above tools are a must, but they do save time and make the job more pleasant. However, a lefse grill is expensive and many have started out with just a skillet or electric frying pan. Your lefse will not be as large, but it will taste just as good, and then, when you have become more proficient you can make the investment in the grill. You can get by with a regular rolling pin, but I highly recommend you invest in a grooved rolling pin that helps with heat distribution, pulverizes any lumps, and, as experts agree, prevent tearing.</p>

  <p class="h3">Quick Potato Lefse (Snøgg potet lefse)</p>

  <p class="noindent1">This is a great recipe for beginners, or those stressed for time. A no-fail recipe. The water content of instant potatoes is always the same. You will feel good about your efforts from your very first try. I promise!</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ingl">3 tbsp. shortening</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring water to a boil, remove from heat, and stir in instant potatoes, shortening, butter, salt, and sugar. Cool. For each measuring cup of this mixture add ½ cup flour and divide in four portions. Keep the remainder of the potato mixture refrigerated until ready to use. Roll each portion to dinner-plate size, as thin as possible, using additional flour (as little as possible—too much flour makes a tough lefse), a pastry cloth, and a grooved rolling pin with sock will make this go easier. To prevent sticking, turn the dough with the stick as needed. When lefse is of desired thickness, flip one end of the lefse over the stick and roll up to center. Place lefse on a grill and unroll. When bubbles appear turn and bake the other side. If needed, turn over once more till the brown spots appear. Do not over-bake as it will make the lefse dry and it will lose its flavor. It is traditionally served with butter and sugar.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Whip together sour cream and sugar. Stir in syrup. Sift salt of hartshorn with flour and stir into the sour cream mixture until it forms fairly soft dough. Substituting some barley flour for the unbleached flour will make the lefse darker but very tender and delicious. Allow to rest for an hour for easier rolling. Handle the dough as little as possible. Divide dough into six or seven parts and roll out a little thicker than flatbread. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Prick the entire surface with a fork and bake until golden in a hot oven, 400–425°F (205–220°C)—the lefse will rise somewhat. Be sure it is thoroughly baked but tender and pliable. When baking is completed, stack on a clean cloth and keep covered. When cool, butter generously and sprinkle with sugar. Place together like a sandwich and cut in wedges.</p>

All types of flour can be used, either all of one or several mixed, but the tastiest and softest result when only potatoes and barley flour are used. A mixture of all-purpose and barley flour also gives a good result.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 lbs. (900 g.) potatoes</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¼ cups (3 dl) barley flour, approx.</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">Boil unpeeled potatoes. Peel and twice grind, rice, or mash while still warm, until potatoes are smooth and elastic, thus requiring less flour. Add salt during this process; rather than adding it to the water, it increases the elasticity of the potatoes. The more elastic the potatoes the better the <span class="italic">lumpe</span>. Cool. Add flour to a small portion of potatoes at a time; stir just enough to make a firm, easily-handled dough. Making a lot of dough at once and leaving it stand may cause the dough to become sticky. Cut off slices with a sharp knife. Press these down lightly with the back of your hand, and finish rolling out with grooved rolling pin into 6–8-inch (15–17 ½ cm) flaps. Doing it this way one needs less flour. Brush off all excess flour before baking.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place <span class="italic">lumpe</span> on medium hot lefse or other griddle and turn often with a pliable spatula. Prick any blisters that form while baking. When done they should be light in color with large, light brown spots. If the griddle is too hot they will remain raw inside; if too low, they will be hard and tough. Allow them to dry out for a few minutes, then wrap in a clean towel and cover until ready to be served. They are tastiest when used immediately. They can be served with butter and sugar, or with sharp cheese. As for me it will always be <span class="italic">pølse med lumpe.</span></p>

  <p class="h3">Flatbread (Flatbrød)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Flatbread, Norway’s most frequently used and most loved bread, was at one time considered a mainstay. In western Norway, a homemaker was not considered to be a good manager if she did not keep a supply of flatbread at all times. A young girl who couldn’t weave, spin, or make flatbread wasn’t considered much of a catch by eligible bachelors.</span></p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Years ago the Norwegian homemaker stacked rocks on top of the flatbread pile to prevent the mice from gnawing their way through.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Gunnar Askeland, in his book <span class="italic">Norsk Mat</span>, talks about the history and art of making flatbread. He says there were many reasons why the homemakers clung to the use of flatbread. One was its exceptional keeping quality. It would keep for years in a stabbur—a storehouse built on stilts. Another reason was that it suited itself to the available Norwegian flour, such as barley and oats. Finally, it was the type of bread that made many variations possible, from a paper-thin to <a id="page_123"/>a thick, coarse type, the latter being very filling and satisfying.</p>

  <p class="indent">For years flatbread almost disappeared but has now regained its popular place in the Norwegian diet. There are only a few places where flatbread is baked at home. It is now made in factories.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Flatbread is a tie with old-home cooking, Gunnar explains, and we should not allow it to be forgotten. It takes practice to learn this art but the reward is great for those who make the attempt. A more delightful addition to a meal than freshly baked, crisp, fragrant flatbread is hard to find. Flatbread should be just as much a mainstay to the Norwegian as French bread is to the French.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Years ago <span class="italic">flatbrød bakedagen</span>—the day for making flatbread—was a hard day’s work on the farms. Often the day was set aside to make enough to last through the winter. Because it was such a tedious, back-breaking job the men of the household were often called upon to assist. The liquid ingredients were water and sour whey, thus making flatbread, with its coarse flour, a good addition to the nutritional needs of the family.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Any kind of flour may be used for flatbread, but oat and barley flour have been the most-widely used, either together or separately. They are also preferred by the factories. It does make delicious bread but is rather difficult to work with. For this reason, a little white or rye flour was subsequently added in the preparation of the flatbread, making it not only delicious but much easier to handle. Water is the most widely used for a finer, lighter type of flatbread. The usual proportion is about 1 ¼ cups (3 dl) liquid to 2.2 lbs. (1 kg.) of flour.</p>

  <p class="indent">“It is important to mix flatbread in a large bowl, allowing ample room for kneading. Experienced flatbread makers usually let the dough rest for a period of time before rolling out.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The art of rolling out flatbread is not easily acquired—but persevere! The first requirement is a large, sturdy table and a good, medium weight, grooved rolling pin. It is quite fascinating to watch an experienced flatbread maker at work. The round of dough seems to slide almost by itself underneath the rolling pin until suddenly it lies there as an almost transparent flap of bread of uniform shape. One won’t become that experienced after only a few tries, of course, but if we start by handling smaller portions of dough and bake it on a smaller surface such as a griddle, complications are minimized and confidence is established. If, in early rolling attempts, the outside edges become frayed, do not despair—they can be trimmed off. It is of greater importance to roll the dough thin enough as this ensures a crisp, delicate finished product. The dough should be turned often during the rolling out period, using a long, straight carving knife or spatula. When the dough is rolled out to the proper thickness, it must, according to custom, <span class="italic">vippe</span> (be beaten)—in the old days’ a clean linen cloth was tied to the end of a stick, dipped in water, and then used to beat the dough. A wooden whisk dipped in water may also be used. Dampening the dough is an important step.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Before rolling out the dough it must be kneaded well, without additional flour, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Press flat, place in the middle of a table with plenty of flour underneath and on top, and begin to roll. While rolling, stretch the dough often and make certain it does not stick to the table as this will result in a flatbread with holes and an irregular shape. An even, moderate griddle temperature for baking the flatbread is essential; if it is too hot the bread will bubble. To test, spread a little flour on the griddle and if it turns brown within a couple of minutes it is the proper temperature. Bake until crisp and light brown on both sides.</p>

  <p class="indent">“When the bread is baked, put it on a rack or large piece of paper on the table to cool. Stack the flatbread, one on top of the other, and cover with a weight to help maintain a uniform flatness after they have cooled.”</p>

  <p class="indent">If you wish, you can complete rolling out all the dough before beginning the baking process. It is not easy for an inexperienced person to accomplish both the rolling out and baking in one operation. If all the rolling is done at once, stack the rolled-out flaps, one on top of the other, and sprinkle with a little flour between each piece and on the bottom of the stack. Do not allow them to remain like this for very long, especially if the room is warm, because they will all adhere to one another.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_124"/>Potato Flatbread (Flatbrød med poteter)</p>

  <p class="noindent">If you are making flatbread with potatoes, boil the unpeeled potatoes, then peel and rice or grind twice. Cool potatoes completely before adding flour. It is difficult to give an exact measurement for flour as the potatoes differ widely in moisture content; therefore, one must add flour accordingly. The kind of flour most satisfactorily used with potatoes is barley, oat, pea (available at natural food stores), whole-wheat, wheat, or rye. Place the riced or ground potatoes in a bowl with a little flour on the bottom and add a little salt (optional) and flour as you knead a little at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. It is not necessary to add liquid to the potato flatbread. It is best to work in a cool room as the dough has a tendency to become soft when it is warm. The potato dough should be prepared the night before baking, covered with a piece of cloth, and put in a cool place. Knead a little more flour into the dough just before rolling out, using the same type of flour as was incorporated into the dough. Potato bread is very crisp and delicious.</p>

  <p class="h3">Barley Flatbread (Flatbrød med byggmel)</p>

  <p class="noindent">To 3 ½ cups (8 ½ dl) barley flour and ½ cup (1 ½ dl) rye flour, use approximately ¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) liquid and ½ teaspoon salt. This makes dough that is very easy to handle.</p>

  <p class="h3">Oat Flour Flatbread (Flatbrød med havremel)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/124-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Use the same measurements as for barley flatbread. This dough is very soft and should be put through a potato ricer or meat grinder at least twice before beginning to knead. Make these rather thick and bake as soon as they are rolled out. Use low heat.</p>

  <p class="h3">Flatbread I (Flatbrød I)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) lard, melted</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ tsp. baking soda</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) oatmeal flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ cups (3 ½ dl) buttermilk</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) graham flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">Unbleached flour as needed</p>

  <p class="noindent">Combine ingredients, adding just enough white flour to make the dough workable but not sticky. Roll out into rounds using a grooved rolling pin and a pastry cloth. Cut into pieces and bake on a cookie sheet in a 350°F (175°C) oven for about 8 minutes or until crisp.</p>

  <p class="h3">Flatbread II (Flatbrød II)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) buttermilk</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) Karo syrup, dark</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. baking soda</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) shortening, melted</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups graham flour, or 2 ½–3 cups (6 ¼–7 ½ dl)</p>

  <p class="ing">whole wheat flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">Mix all ingredients together. Roll out the dough paper thin. Place on a big sheet on an ungreased baking sheet sprinkled with a little corn meal, and bake in a 350°F (175°C) oven for about 8 minutes. If desired, once you have placed the dough on the baking sheet you may use a <span class="italic">fattigman</span> cutter or a pizza wheel to mark the desired size. This will make it easy to separate the flatbread into even pieces once baked.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_125"/>Weddings (Bryllup)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Weddings are among the most tradition-rich of all Norwegian observances. During the Middle Ages, in addition to the church wedding ceremony, there was always a financial settlement ceremony performed at home. The church at that time insisted that the minister take part in the financial settlement ritual at home, it being very similar to the wedding ritual performed earlier in the church. During the financial arrangement ceremony a determination was made as to type of gifts and the necessary financial arrangements between the groom and the bride’s parents. Five witnesses were required. Following this ritual the couple exchanged gifts as did their parents on both sides as well as other members of the family.</p>

  <p class="indent">The marriage was not sanctioned until the bridegroom had paid <span class="italic">kjøpesum</span> (a price) for his bride. Before leaving for the church the bridegroom presented his bride-to-be with a <span class="italic">benkegave</span> (a gift fixed by negotiations and given by a bridegroom to his wife in her home previous to the marriage), and on the day following the wedding he was expected to give her a <span class="italic">morgengave</span> (morning gift). Both these gifts were very elaborate and were hers to keep in case of her husband’s death.</p>

  <p class="indent">Generally, weddings were performed at particular times of the year—usually spring or early summer, or in the fall following the harvest.</p>

  <p class="indent">As a rule weddings were performed on the farm where the couple planned to live, which in many cases was the bridegroom’s home. The wedding would last from 2–3 days or as long as a week, with the more prosperous families celebrating the longest. Food was plentiful at these wedding banquets as family and friends participated in <span class="italic">matsendinga</span> (food contributions), which were sent either the day before or brought along to the wedding celebration.</p>

  <p class="indent">Everyone pitched in and helped to make it a feast to remember with plenty of food and drink—especially drink—as this was the measuring stick by which the success of the wedding was judged.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/125-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Both bride and groom had their own officials, <span class="italic">embetsfolk. Brudekonene</span> (women assisting the bride) never left her side from dressing time prior to the ceremony until she was <span class="italic">konekledd</span> (dressed as a married woman). Likewise the <span class="italic">brurmennene</span> (bridegroom’s attendants) remained with and assisted the bridegroom. Each “official” had his duty to perform from the time the music began for ushering in the bride until the fiddler played <span class="italic">reiselåten</span> (farewell tune) on the last day.</p>

  <p class="indent">These wedding traditions were in use throughout the nineteenth and partly into the twentieth centuries. Rules were strictly followed but there was also an abundance of fun and frolic on this joyous occasion. The betrothed couple had many fond memories to reminisce over in the years to come.</p>

  <p class="indent">Food at today’s weddings is quite varied, as each couple selects special delights from favorite dinner menus; however, luscious cream cakes and festive <span class="italic">kransekake</span> (tall almond wreath cake) seem to remain the favored choice of dessert.</p>
