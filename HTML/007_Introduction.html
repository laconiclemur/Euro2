  <p class="snoindent">Norway is a winterland where snow covers most of the country for more than half of the year. It also is a land of mountains where only 3 percent of the land can be cultivated.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Norway has a long rugged coast with many fjords, and half of the country lies north of the Arctic Circle. However the weather is milder than one would expect because of the Gulf Stream that crosses the Atlantic from America. People in the past subsisted on minuscule land because the sea provided an abundance of fish.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Nature and climatic conditions caused the Norwegians to adapt to the circumstances where they lived. Diverse food traditions developed through the centuries in north and south Norway, as well as in the east and the west.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Notwithstanding, mingled with these food traditions, a deep friendliness and sincere hospitality unfolded toward strangers. In the ancient Edda poems, <span class="italic">Håvamål</span>, it is written: “. . . the man who has traveled in the mountains needs food and drink.”</p>

  <p class="sindent">It is self-evident that people took advantage of the summers because of the long difficult winters. They needed time to till the ground, to plant, and to harvest crops, yet in many places the climate was such that the grain did not ripen. The people received their main nourishment from grain, meat, fish, and milk. The fish farmers along the coast always kept a cow and a few sheep. Inland they sowed barley and oats on the minuscule land available. They would say, “Grain is borrowed from God” or often, “Grain is life.”</p>

  <p class="sindent">The life-sustaining potato was not grown in Norway until the late 1700s. The so-called potato-priests from their pulpits encouraged people to cultivate potatoes. Today many Norwegians clearly remember the war years, 1940–1945. In many homes hunger would have been unbearable had we not been able to grow potatoes.</p>

  <p class="sindent">The Norwegian people learned early from experience to preserve food. They learned various conservation methods. Cattle and goats gave little milk during the winter months, but the summer milk was churned to butter and made into cheese. Many Norwegian cheeses have a long history, and even today we think that <span class="italic">gammalosten</span>—a pungent sour milk cheese—and goat cheese are among the best. Many new cheeses have a milder taste like the <span class="italic">gudbrandsdalosten</span>, something many enjoy.</p>

  <p class="sindent">The old farmers attempted to be self-sufficient. However, no matter how remote some farms were, salt was necessary for all. Most meat was salted down. Fresh meat was provided only for certain days, like church holidays and other important celebrations. From the middle ages the grain was ground in water gristmills. Up to the 1800s grains were mostly used for flatbread and porridge. Porridge, a food for all, was often eaten with sour milk, a piece of cured meat, or a few pieces of flatbread. Porridge was <span class="italic">vassgraut</span> (gruel usually made with barley) and <span class="italic">rømmegraut</span>, sour cream porridge. <span class="italic">Vassgraut</span> has saved many a life. Sour cream porridge (served with sugar, cinnamon, and currant juice) is enjoyed as a celebration food even today wherever people cherish Norwegian food traditions.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Fresh meat was available in the fall when the animals were slaughtered. Many claim that <span class="italic">fårikål</span>—lamb with cabbage—a typical dish served at that time is our national dish. One could discuss how many spices to use. It was not a problem for Norwegians who managed with whatever nature provided.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Lutefish and <span class="italic">rakørret</span> (cured trout) had a bad reputation in the old topographical writings but are today a much enjoyed (and expensive) food served in restaurants and homes.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Notwithstanding, there was a marked difference between <span class="italic">hverdagsmat</span>, everyday food, and foods served on feast days. Heavy physical labor required nourishment first. However, at weddings and funerals, and other important social events, neighbors helped each other with what was called <span class="italic">sendings</span>, a beautiful expression of unity by people who out of necessity toiled heavily. They cherished the security and enjoyment of these gatherings.</p>

  <p class="sindent">Since World War II many foreign food traditions have been introduced to Norway, but simultaneously, there is a deeper appreciation for the old food traditions. We cling to the simple food of two open-face pieces of bread, in place of lunch. On the 17th of May (Norway’s Constitution Day), we are only too pleased to be invited for sour cream porridge and cured meat.<span class="super"><a href="#Afn_1" id="Bfn_1">1*</a></span></p>

  <p class="sindent">With her thorough knowledge of cooking, and of Norwegian recipes and a background in tradition and popular food usage in Norway, Astrid Karlsen Scott has produced a book that rightly deserves the title of <span class="italic">Authentic Norwegian Cooking.</span></p>

  <p class="sindent">The translated poems and her own youth and childhood memories from Norway add much to the charm and genuineness of her work, and also make it enjoyable reading apart from the recipes.</p>
