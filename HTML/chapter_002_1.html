<h2 class="h2-a">Au Bord de la Mer</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">THE PROVENÇAUX HAVE</span> a passion for their fruit of the sea that borders on obsession. If you get caught up in the excitement of a fish market (our closest is St Tropez), hear the shouting and bartering, and put up with the occasional shove in the back, you experience how much they want – and will have, thank you very much – their seafood. Shimmering piles of red mullet, <em>daurade</em>, sea bass, anchovies and sardines diminish during the early morning sales at an astonishing speed. The marble and concrete hall in which the market is held is not that large, but seems so in summer with such a variety on display – not only of fish but also St Tropez glamour and tourists from all over the world.</p>
<p class="normala">It’s a real crush. If you don’t get there early, as the crowds swell it is difficult to get fish or even to move. Turning around is impossible: you have to go outside and come back in again from the other direction. Each stall-holder is shouting, meeting your eyes if they can, and doing everything possible to grab your attention. They’ll insist theirs are the best fish, the freshest wild sea bass, the smoothest squid, the fattest <em>gambas</em> and heaviest, juice-filled, most sublime oysters and <em>violets</em> (knobbly rock-encrusting creatures also known as sea figs). Each fishmonger is so, so proud and truly enthusiastic. They are real artisans and genuinely delighted when you choose something from their stall. They’re also quite happy to charge you through the nose, smiling as they do so.</p>
<p class="normala">Most fish dishes in Provence are very simply cooked. Sea bass or the many different sorts of sea bream will be stuffed full of fennel and grilled over charcoal and vine clippings, or, as I prefer, baked with lots of olive oil, garlic and orange peel. Because of this simplicity, as with any dish where the ingredients are left to speak for themselves, the fish need to be as sparklingly fresh as possible, carefully selected and lovingly cooked.</p>
<p class="normala">The magical thing about an open fish market is that first you find the fish, or, staring out from his bed of ice, the bright-eyed devil finds you. Then you decide what you are going to have with it. While you’re buying some bread for an aperitif, or a few peaches, the fishmonger is deftly scaling, gutting and lovingly packaging your choice.</p>
<p class="normala">I often stop at the sardines. Perfectly fresh, shiny and silver-blue, firm to the touch and bright of eye, they’re irresistible. They are also invariably the best value catch and, once scaled, easy to work with. Grilled, fried or baked whole with a smattering of salt, a good squeeze of lemon and some olive oil, they make a sort of old-fashioned feast. Greedy fingers pick the flesh from the bones as piles of little skeletons build up at the side of each plate. This is a wonderful way to eat them, but you don’t need a full-blown recipe for that. In the sardine recipes in this chapter they are carefully boned, stuffed with Swiss chard and pine nuts and baked with lemon, or simply grilled and served with tomato compote, olives and lemon.</p>
<p class="normala">Of all the crustaceans on offer, very few come from the Mediterranean. One type that does, and that I now use whenever I can, is the selection of prawn or <em>gamba</em>, going from the fairly small, each about 6cm (2½in), up to the enormous <em>camarones</em> (one of which I bought and devoured alone was a mite over 600g – 1lb 5oz – or the size of an average lobster). Their flesh is sweeter and less prone to becoming like cotton wool than lobster or langoustines. They can be cooked in all manner of wonderful ways: grilled in their shells, oozing with herb or tomato butter; shelled and pan-fried until golden, then doused with olive oil and pepper; steamed and served warm to be lovingly peeled from their shells and dipped into thick, garlicky aïoli. (This is undoubtedly one of the best things to eat in the early stages of romance, being not only naturally sexy, but also suggestive.) If I strip the shells before cooking, I always keep them. As they are much thinner than the shells of lobster, they can be very quickly cooked, releasing their flavour completely in about 10 minutes to make incredibly fragrant and intense stocks and bisques.</p>
<p class="normala">There are also the highly regarded spider crabs (I have only ever seen one or two at a time), the <em>langoustes</em> and <em>cigales de mer</em> (a flat, lobster-like crustacean). All three are delicious and regarded as luxuries. They are now extremely rare, fetching massively high prices, which is not too much of a problem for St Tropéziens but still astonishing when you do the maths. The last time I saw a <em>cigale de mer</em> I got gazumped while thinking about the £30 price tag. I turned around, having decided to buy it, as it was loaded, its tail flapping, into the basket of a young man with a crew cut and a rich boss waiting in his gin palace. I really should know by now just to push, shove and grab when I see something I like.</p>
<p class="normala">After the hustle and bustle of the morning, things start to quieten down in the market around midday. The bars on the port are crowded, waiters are hastily chalking their specialities of <em>daurade, loup</em> and <em>chapon</em> on their restaurant blackboards, and grills are being lit on patios all down the coast. After one o’clock only the odd scale and pile of melting ice would tell you that the fish market had been there at all. The halls are hosed down and all the fisher folk have gone for lunch or a game of boules.</p>
