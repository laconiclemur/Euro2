<p class="flush_left_large"><a id="pg_308"/>During my first summer in Spain, when I worked for Pepa Salvador at her restaurant, La Salsita, on the Costa Brava, I had no concept of the way Spanish families ate at home or during the working week. It was so hot that everyone seemed to be living outside in the sunshine and the waves, and only going home very late. I imagined kitchens to have breakfast foods and a chiller full of cold drinks, and that was it. It was only really when the summer ended and I went on to study in Barcelona that I realised the biggest meal of the day was lunch, and the biggest meal of the week was Sunday lunch, when everyone would be involved in the cooking, and the main course would often be more elaborate. On one occasion in Catalunya I helped a friend marinate a wild boar in the bath overnight ready for a big family gathering.</p>
<p class="indented_large">As always, Spain’s big dishes vary from region to region, from the fire-grilled meat feasts that are famous in the Basque country to hearty coastal fish and shellfish soups or stews (call them what you will, as they are somewhere in between), to <em>bacalao</em> (salt cod) further inland, and rice dishes: <em>paella</em>s and the more risotto-like <em>melosos</em> or quite soupy <em>caldosos.</em> Less known outside of Spain is the tradition of <em>fideo</em> (or <em>fideu</em> in Catalan) – short, fine pasta, which is used in a very similar way to rice. Then there are the big one-pot meat dishes that traditionally would be started off, or left cooking slowly in the oven while the family went to church, ready to be finished off on their return and shared following drinks and a procession of small plates.</p>
<p class="indented_large">In the mountainous regions, in particular, these might be hearty dishes of slow-cooked game, or beans with pork and <em>chorizo</em> or <em>morcilla</em>. The grandest – symbols of wealth or celebration – are the mixed meat and vegetable extravaganzas, which often contain chicken as well as beef and pork dumplings. There are versions all over Spain, the most famous being the <em>cocido madrileño</em> ‘of Madrid’ and the surrounding region, and the <em>escudella</em> of Catalunya (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_447">here</a>). Almost every region of Spain has its own <em>cocido</em> recipe that is adapted to its climate, local preferences and produce. Not quite so charmingly named is the Castilian <a id="pg_309"/><em>olla podrida</em>, which dates back to medieval times. Though it translates roughly as ‘rotten pot’, it was actually a rich man’s stew, so it is sometimes thought that its original name was <em>olla poderida</em>, or ‘powerful pot’. It combined beans (most typically <em>alubias de Ibeas</em>, from the hills of Sierra de la Demanda in La Rioja) with any available pieces of meat, from chicken to mutton, beef, pork and sausages – it was even usual to add whole eggs in their shells.</p>
<p class="indented_large">At the opposite end of the scale are the waste-not-want-not sharing stews that either made use of the leftovers in the days following the big Sunday <em>cocido</em>, or were born out of poverty and making the most of whatever ingredients were available and affordable. Many years ago in the market in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands I first came across dishes of <em>ropa vieja</em> – ‘old clothes’ – at the <em>tratoría</em> stand. Such a great descriptive name. For me it conjured up childhood memories of polishing the furniture with dad’s old vests, rather than throw them away, but in food terms it is a generic name for any one-pot dish made with snippets of leftover chicken, beef, sausages or pieces of octopus, cooked up with onions, garlic, tomatoes, <em>pimentón</em> (paprika) and chickpeas or whatever handfuls of potatoes, carrots, peppers or herbs you might have. In hard times it might be only a pot of vegetables, coloured deep gold with a little saffron or <em>colorante</em> (colouring).</p>
<p class="indented_large">On a similar theme, in Catalunya you have <em>lentejas poti poti</em>. <em>Poti poti</em> is the glorious phrase for ‘bits and pieces’, i.e. the bric-a-brac you might find on a stall in the flea market. In this case it is about leftovers added to a pot of cooked lentils, thickened and seasoned with a <em>picada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>) of garlic, the juice of a lemon and fried bread, pounded using a pestle and mortar.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec125"><a id="pg_311"/>Suquet de pescadores de l’Empordà</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fishermen’s stew Empordà style</p>
<p class="flush_left">To translate <em>suquet</em> as a stew hardly seems to do justice to the dish, since a good <em>suquet</em> is one of the classics of Catalan cooking and enjoys almost legendary status among seafood lovers.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally it was a one-pot meal made by fishermen on board their boats, using sea water to cook the fish with a few potatoes and pieces of bread, flavoured with parsley and garlic. Or it would be a way of using up the fish that was left at the quay at the end of the day’s trading.</p>
<p class="indented">Over the centuries, though, it has been considerably enhanced, enriched with <em>picadas</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>) of almonds and garlic, or made golden with saffron – additions which give a distinctive flavour that helps set the <em>suquet</em> apart from similar French fish stews.</p>
<p class="indented">At weekends along the Costa Brava, families and groups of friends will make an expedition to a favourite waterside restaurant especially to share a <em>suquet</em>, partly to make an occasion of it and partly because these dishes take time to prepare at home and the ingredients are expensive. So I would say think of it as something quite special to make for a celebration.</p>
<p class="indented">As a family, we love <em>suquet</em>, so I have included two different versions. This first one is the most popular in the Empordà: hearty, but not too heavy, and slightly more humble than the more elaborate one which follows. It uses a whole head of garlic, which softens out during the slow cooking, creating a mellow savoury base. It is inspired by a recipe featured in a tiny gem of a book, <em>Cuina Casolana Empordanesa</em>, which my friend Pepa Salvador (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_371">here</a>) lent me, since she often took inspiration from it at her restaurant, La Salsita, on the Costa Brava. Originally printed in 1981, in two volumes, it is a collection of recipes gathered by the French gastronomic society Chaîne des Rôtisseurs, from the fine kitchens of the Girona coastline.</p>
<p class="indented">We worked on the recipe a little at Brindisa, and came up with this version using a lighter <em>picada</em>. The fish is cooked on the bone for added flavour, and the flesh will easily fall off once it is ladled into bowls – but it is good to warn people that the bones are there.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic, peeled and finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tomatoes, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg potatoes, ideally peeled and cracked <strong><em>cascada</em></strong> style (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_292">here</a>) into 5cm chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg gurnard (about 2–3 whole fish), cleaned but still on the bone, cut into chunks (about 5cm) – keep the heads to flavour the cooking water</p>
<p class="forhead">For the picada</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 slices of toasted bread</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little olive oil (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a casserole or large pan, put in the garlic and fry gently until it begins to turn golden. Add the tomatoes and a good pinch of salt, stir, and allow the tomatoes to soften and sweat for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the potatoes and stir into the mixture, so that they are well covered with oil. Put in the fish heads (these will be removed before serving) and cook over a medium heat for a further 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>
<p class="method">Pour in 2 litres of cold water and bring slowly to the boil, to ensure that the potatoes cook through evenly. If they are cooked too quickly the outer edges will begin to break up and make the stew too thick and starchy. Once it has begun to boil, turn down the heat and simmer gently for around 15 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the fish heads and add the fish, then bring back to a low simmer and allow to bubble for 10 minutes. Again, by cooking slowly and <a id="pg_312"/>gently, the flavour of the stew will develop but the fish won’t lose its texture and start falling off the bone.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, make the <em>picada</em> by pounding all the ingredients into a smooth paste, using a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p class="method">The stew is ready when the fish is cooked through and can be lifted lightly off the bone. Take the pan off the heat and add the <em>picada</em>. Taste and season with a little more salt if necessary – the fish will have added their own salt so you may not need much.</p>
<p class="method">Ladle the stew into 6 large bowls. Rub the toasted bread with the cut clove of garlic, drizzle with oil, if you like, and serve alongside.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec126">Suquet de peix a l’all cremat</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fishermen’s stew with toasted garlic</p>
<p class="flush_left">En route to my brother’s farmhouse in Catalunya on one occasion, I stopped off in Bigas to see Ángel, the master <em>coquero</em> who makes our wonderful <em>coca</em> bread (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>). He and his great friend and colleague Josep Pujol made this <em>suquet</em> outside over an enormous gas ring, and since there were ten of us, they used a heavy-based frying pan 50cm in diameter. Lobsters on a camping stove, that’s Spanish picnicking for you. But then the word picnic is supposed to have come from the Spanish court, who loved elaborate meals outside on tapestry-covered tables, with music and dancing.</p>
<p class="indented">The art of making this <em>suquet</em> is in patiently sautéing each fish, and the potatoes, separately, so they keep from breaking up before being combined in the final cooking. Marcona almonds are not cheap, but neither are lobsters, so it is worth investing in superior nuts, as they are so creamy they really add richness to the <em>picada</em>.</p>
<p class="makes"><a id="pg_313"/>Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium prepared lobsters</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g clams</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g mussels</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g monkfish, cut into rough 4cm chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g gurnard fillet, cut into rough 4cm chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g potatoes, peeled and cut <strong><em>cascada</em></strong> style (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_292">here</a>) into rough 4cm chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g cuttlefish, cut into small squares, about 2cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.6 litres hot <strong><em>fumet blanco</em></strong> (white fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">salt, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon chopped parsley (optional)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the toasted garlic picada</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons hot <strong><em>fumet blanco</em></strong> (white fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 slice of good white bread, crusts cut off</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Cut the lobsters in half lengthways and separate the halved heads from the tails. Keep the halves of the heads intact, as the flavours found there will contribute to the sauce. Separate the claws and crack them.</p>
<p class="method">To start the <em>picada</em>, spread the almonds and hazelnuts on a baking tray, put into the preheated oven and roast for about 8 minutes, until lightly browned, making sure you watch carefully, gently shaking the tray and turning it if necessary to keep the nuts from getting burnt. Take out of the oven and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Leave the garlic cloves in their skins, but bash them with the flat of a knife to crack them. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small frying pan and add the garlic cloves, tilting the pan so that they are well covered and can sizzle steadily in the oil. As they cook, press down on them with the back of a spoon. The skin of the cloves will become crisp and peel off, so you can remove it with tongs. By cooking the garlic this way the thinner parts of the cloves will turn a quite deep golden brown, and the thicker parts will become lightly golden, with a soft interior. Check for this by pushing them down with a spoon. As soon as there is some give, the cloves are ready. Take them out of the oil, and when cool enough to handle, remove any remaining skin and cut off the root base. Keep the pan of oil for use again in a minute.</p>
<p class="method">Using a pestle and mortar, grind the garlic cloves with a pinch of salt, to a smooth paste. Add the reserved nuts, grind to a paste once more, then slowly pour in 1 tablespoon of the oil, a little at a time, working it well in until it is all incorporated. Finally, stir in 1 tablespoon of <em>fumet</em> <em>blanco</em>, to loosen the paste a little.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the reserved pan of garlicky oil, adding the rest of the oil, then put in the slice of bread and fry gently to a golden toffee colour and rich, savoury flavour. Remove and, when cool enough to handle, break into pieces and add to the nuts in the mortar, grinding again to a smooth paste, adding the rest of the stock to loosen it slightly. Keep this <em>picada</em> to one side.</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>suquet</em>, wash the clams and mussels in plenty of water, cutting off any beards from the mussels. Discard any that are not closed, or won’t close if tapped against your work surface.</p>
<p class="method">Start by heating a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large, high-sided pan, at least 40cm in diameter, until it shimmers. Put in the monkfish and fry for a minute on each side, just to seal – treat it gently, as you don’t want the fish to break up later and turn the <em>suquet</em> into a gloopy fishy paste. Lift out and keep to one side. If necessary, add a little more oil, but keep it to just a fine film as you cook the different fish.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_314"/>Put the gurnard into the pan, skin side down, for 1 minute, then lift out and reserve.</p>
<p class="method">Now put in the cracked lobster claws and cook for 2 minutes on each side until they turn dark red, then lift out and reserve. Next put in the split lobster heads, shell down, for another 2 minutes, without turning them over, then take them out of the pan and reserve. Now cook the tail pieces, shell side down, for only 1 minute, until the shells turn red. Remove and reserve.</p>
<p class="method">Put the potatoes into the pan, adding another tablespoon of oil if necessary, sauté until they are brown at the edges, then lift out and reserve.</p>
<p class="method">Put in the cuttlefish and cook until it turns translucent, then add the mussels and clams together with 50ml of water. Cover the pan and steam the shellfish until the shells have opened. Remove and reserve, discarding any that fail to open.</p>
<p class="method">Return the potatoes to the pan, stirring them well to coat them in the juices released by the shellfish, then add the stock and bring to the boil. Taste and add a pinch of salt if needed, then simmer the potatoes for around 12 minutes, until tender.</p>
<p class="method">Stir in the <em>picada</em>, taste again and adjust for salt if necessary, then add the monkfish and the lobster heads, with the shell side upwards. Add the rest of the reserved lobster, fish and shellfish, boil steadily for about 2 minutes, until the fish and shellfish are just cooked through, and serve immediately. Remove the lobster heads and finish, if you like, with the chopped parsley.</p>

<p class="quote">‘a base for sauces, stews and pulses’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The word <em>sofrito</em> comes from the verb <em>sofreir</em>, which means to sauté or fry lightly, and so it is used to describe the process of making a base for sauces, stews and pulses. Classically, this will be made with tomatoes and onions, but these can be enhanced with green and/or red peppers, bay leaves or herbs; or leeks might be used instead of onion, according to taste or context. Sometimes the ingredients are sautéd relatively quickly but more often they require long slow cooking. Then they might be puréed or pounded until smooth; sometimes not.</p>
<p class="indented">When this base is made up in advance, either commercially or at home, if it is primarily made with tomatoes and onions it is known as <em>sofrito de tomate,</em> and if peppers are added it will be called <em>fritada.</em></p>
<p class="indented">In Spain families will typically spend a week or two each summer cooking up different combinations of tomatoes and peppers when they are at their best, storing the <em>sofrito</em> or <em>fritada</em> in the freezer or under oil in jars ready to use later.</p>
<p class="indented">You can also buy good-quality, ready-made tomato <em>sofrito</em> or <em>fritada</em> in jars, tins and cartons in the same way as the Italian <em>passata</em>; however, these will usually contain a high level of water and so should be reduced to the intensity you prefer for your dish. It is also worth noting that in these preparations the tomato tends to dominate over the onion or pepper, whereas in some of the recipes in this book you will see that only a small quantity of tomato is used in the base, as in some regions, particularly the Mediterranean coast, the feeling is that too much can overwhelm other flavours, especially in more delicate fish and vegetable dishes. It is good to be aware of this, as a jarred <em>sofrito</em> is not always a straightforward substitute for a homemade one.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_317"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg317.jpg"/></div>


<p class="small-recipe-head"><a id="pg_318"/>Sofrito de tomate</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Tomato and onion base</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is our Brindisa recipe for the traditional onion and tomato base that you will see referred to time and again throughout this book. Although it is simple to make, it isn’t a quick fix, as the secret is to first cook the onions very, very slowly in just enough oil to stop them burning, but not so much that they drown in it. As they cook, their water content reduces, their natural sugar becomes intensely concentrated and the onions become very sweet, which really helps to bring out the flavour of the tomatoes once you add them. Because the heat needs to be really low, it is best to use a diffuser. When we cook large amounts of onions in this way in the restaurant it can take many hours, but for the kind of quantities you are likely to be using at home, it should normally take no more than an hour for the onions to reach the right stage.</p>
<p class="indented">In the UK I would say it is only really worth making <em>sofrito de tomate</em> yourself during that brief moment in summer when there is a glut of tomatoes at their absolute best. Ideally, choose a mix of very ripe and soft tomatoes and some slightly harder ones. Then I would do as our friends in Spain do, and make plenty of <em>sofrito</em>, seal it in jars, then pasteurise these in boiling water, or store it in containers in the freezer. Alternatively, it will keep in the fridge for a week.</p>
<p class="indented">It is best to season the <em>sofrito de tomate</em> only very lightly with a little salt and sugar as necessary, as when you come to use it in a recipe you will usually add more seasoning.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 600g</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g sweet white onions (around 1 large whole onion), finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg good, fresh red and ripe tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">sugar and sea salt to taste</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_319"/>Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan, add the onions and cook gently for at least 30 minutes (even better for 45–60 minutes, if you have the time), using a diffuser, until the onions are light golden, soft and very sweet. Add the tomato and cook gently, stirring regularly, for 30–40 minutes, until you have a deep red sauce that has a thick, pouring consistency. Taste, and add a little sugar and/or salt if necessary. Pass through a fine sieve.</p>
<p class="method">Keep in the fridge and use within a week, or put into a freezer bag or box and freeze.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p318a">Fritada de tomate y pimientos</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Tomato and pepper base</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Fritada</em> is very similar to <em>sofrito de tomate,</em> but with peppers added, and it is their sweet-savoury flavour that distinguishes it.</p>
<p class="indented">Our executive chef, Josep, uses long red peppers, as well as green ones which are known as <em>italianos</em> and come in from Barcelona. The red ones weigh in at about 500g each, and are deep red with wide streaks of rich green, and very sweet. In the UK the long, pointed red Romano peppers that you can find in supermarkets are the best equivalent. While the green peppers are meant to add piquancy, you don’t want the bitterness that often comes with hydroponically grown ones, so look out for long, Mediterranean peppers that will have seen sun.</p>
<p class="indented">If a recipe should call for red pepper <em>fritada</em>, use 1½ long red peppers and omit the green one.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 700g</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g onions (around 1 whole large onion), finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large long red pepper (about 400g), finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a large long green pepper, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sugar, to taste</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan, then add the garlic and fry lightly.</p>
<p class="method">Add the chopped onions and cook very gently for about 15 minutes, until the onions are light golden, soft and very sweet.</p>
<p class="method">Add the peppers and the rosemary sprig and continue to cook gently for another 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Stir in the grated tomato and cook for another 40 minutes over a low heat, stirring often to keep the mixture from sticking to the pan. Taste and add salt, freshly ground black pepper and sugar as necessary. Remove the rosemary sprig.</p>
<p class="method">If not using immediately, keep in the fridge and use within a week, or put into a freezer bag or box and freeze.</p>

<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p319a">Cebolla caramelizada</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Caramelised onion base</p>
<p class="flush_left">The origin of this is French, but it is typical of Catalunya. It is a very intense base that is made predominantly with onion and only a little tomato. Our head chef at Brindisa, Leo Rivera, who is Catalan, always has a big pot of it on the go, and uses it to give depth to all kinds of recipes. Whenever we cater at events he seems to have a vial of it secreted about his person, like a wizard with a magic potion. Leo uses it as a base for Catalan rice and pasta dishes; however, in other regions there is an ongoing debate about whether or not onion should be used in dry rice dishes (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_347">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">As with <em>sofrito de tomate</em>, it is best made using a diffuser, which will allow you to cook the onions very, very slowly for hours with garlic and oil, so that, as with all these bases, the onions become beautifully sweet.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 300g of drained onions</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 onions, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium tomato, grated, or ¼ of a tin (i.e. 100g) of chopped plum tomatoes</p>
<p class="method">Put the grated onions into a sieve for 10 minutes to allow excess juice to drain away.</p>
<p class="method">Warm the oil in a pan, add the onions and cook very gently until transparent, then add the tomato. Cook very gently over the lowest heat possible, preferably using a diffuser, for at least 45–60 minutes. The onions must not burn, but they will darken as they cook, and will look very dark and taste very sweet when ready.</p>
<p class="method">If using straight away, drain off the oil and use only the darkened onions in whatever recipe you choose. Alternatively, store under the oil in the fridge for up to a week.</p>

<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_320"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg320.jpg"/></div>
<p class="quote"> ‘where sofrito leads, picada finishes’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The inspired idea of combining ingredients pounded together into a paste to thicken, flavour and aromatise a dish, typically a stew, is an ancient idea.</p>
<p class="indented">In Catalan the name is <em>picada,</em> while elsewhere in Spain it is <em>majada</em> – though for the purposes of this book, I have referred to <em>picada</em> throughout, to avoid confusion. There is a saying that where <em>sofrito</em> leads, <em>picada</em> finishes, i.e. the <em>sofrito –</em> typically a mix of onions and tomato, to which peppers and other ingredients may be added – forms the base of a dish, while the <em>picada</em> is added towards the end of cooking to give an extra dimension of flavour and texture.</p>
<p class="indented">The ingredients vary, often according to region, but there will be something starchy like nuts (almonds, hazelnuts or pine nuts), bread or biscuits, combined with aromatics, such as saffron, herbs, peppercorns, chillies, <em>ñora</em> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_280">here</a>), tomatoes, fresh peppers, garlic, or even chocolate.</p>
<p class="indented">Where nuts are used these will almost always be roasted but unsalted (packaged roasted and salted nuts are too overwhelming). You can easily buy toasted unsalted hazelnuts, but it is usually best to buy plain blanched almonds and pine nuts and toast them yourself without any salt, as I have indicated in the recipes.</p>
<p class="indented">In general, when you make a <em>picada</em> you crush the harder ingredients first, and work through to the softest, finally adding some liquid to bind: usually olive oil, stock or <em>vi ranci</em> wine (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_373">here</a>). Sometimes there may even be a touch of cuttlefish liver or rabbit liver, fish eggs or egg yolk, to add another deeper layer of flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">Whatever the combination, the ingredients thicken sauces with a freshness and lightness that is very different from the heavier butter and cream used in traditional French cooking, and more varied than Italian pestos.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec127"><a id="pg_322"/>Sépia amb mandonguilles</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Cuttlefish with meatballs</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Mar i muntanya</em> (sea and mountain dishes) – the equivalent of surf and turf – can often sound very odd, but many of these traditional Catalan recipes are brilliant, as they are not fussy or overworked, and so make for really hearty and nourishing family meals. This is a recipe from Montserrat Fruitos (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_406">here</a>). Of all the <em>mar i muntanya</em> combinations I have tried, this, for me, is the most forthright, as the contrast of meat and fish is more striking and the flavours and aromas heartier than, say, a more classic lobster and chicken (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_416">here</a>) – so you either love it or hate it.</p>
<p class="indented">Always with one eye on the next dish, Montserrat used the main body of the cuttlefish for this, keeping the wings and tentacles (<em>potes i aletes</em>) in the fridge, or freezing them to put into another rice dish, or <em>croquetas</em>, to serve at the big family house in the country at the weekends. There was never any waste in Montserrat’s kitchen.</p>
<p class="indented">She would insist on peeling off the outer greyish skin of the cuttlefish so that the pieces were tender and white, and would also keep the soft pouch of liver attached behind the head. It has a strong taste, so you don’t need to use it all, but a little adds strength to the colour, and gives depth to the fish flavours within the thick stock.</p>
<p class="indented">Montserrat used to prepare the cuttlefish herself, but you might find it easier to buy yours cleaned and ready for you.</p>
<p class="indented">If you prefer, you can use a light red wine, rather than white, but it will make the dish darker in colour. You can also make up the meatball mixture the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight.</p>
<p class="indented">Montserrat’s way of serving the dish was to scatter sprouting seeds on top of the meatballs or add some fresh peas. She would either put these into the cooking pot for the last 5 minutes or so, or cook them separately and serve them on the side.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium onion, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large tomato, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">sugar, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a cuttlefish liver (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">250ml white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g cleaned cuttlefish, cut into pieces about 2cm x 0.5cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre <strong><em>fumet blanco</em></strong> (white fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>), or water</p>
<p class="forhead">For the meatballs</p>
<p class="ingredients">160g very lean minced beef</p>
<p class="ingredients">480g very lean minced pork</p>
<p class="ingredients">20g breadcrumbs, soaked in a little milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 cloves of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 dessertspoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">plain flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g peas (optional)</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_323"/>To make the meatballs, mix the minced meats together. Squeeze out the milk from the breadcrumbs and add to the meat, followed by the beaten eggs, garlic and parsley, and mix well. Season and leave to rest for an hour.</p>
<p class="method">Have the flour ready in a shallow bowl. Form the mixture into 16 balls each slightly smaller than a golf ball and pass them through the flour.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a large pan, making sure it comes no higher than a third of the way up. If you have a thermometer it should be 180°C, otherwise drop in a little flour, and if it sizzles gently the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p class="method">Put in the meatballs (in batches if necessary) and fry for 2–3 minutes, until brown on all sides – they will cook fully later – then lift out and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">Heat a little olive oil in a pan, add the onion and cook gently for a few minutes. Add the garlic and after 3 minutes, when it has released its aroma, put in the grated tomato. Cook for 30 minutes over a very low heat. Taste and season with salt to taste, adding a little sugar if necessary to balance the acidity. If using the cuttlefish liver, add it now and cook for another 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, warm the wine in a separate pan with the cinnamon stick and put in the cuttlefish pieces. Poach for about 5 minutes, until all the alcohol has boiled away. Take off the heat and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Add the fish stock or water to the pan of onions and tomato. Bring to the boil and add the reserved cuttlefish and wine, turn down to a simmer for 15 minutes, then add the meatballs. Add the peas, if using, and continue to simmer for a further 10–15 minutes, then serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec128"><a id="pg_324"/>Bonito escabeche Barrera</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Ana Barrera’s <em>escabeche</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">The origin of the word <em>escabeche</em> is Persian, and the idea of putting a cooked piece of fish, chicken, game bird or rabbit into an acidic marinade before serving was brought to Spain by the Arabs during the Moorish conquests.</p>
<p class="indented">This is our version of a dish that Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) makes with a fresh <em>bonito</em>, but this can be hard to find in the UK. If there is none available, use another oily fish like mackerel, or <em>melva</em>, which is sometimes known as frigate or bullet mackerel, and has a darker flesh and slightly drier texture.</p>
<p class="indented">The wine Ana uses is Chardonnay, and she loves to use fruit as a garnish for dishes like this. Perhaps surprisingly, mango turns out to be an amazing complement to <em>escabeche</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Ana serves this with <em>ensaladilla Barrera</em>, her variation on Russian salad (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_207">here</a>).</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small <strong><em>bonito</em></strong> (about 800g), Spanish mackerel, frigate tuna or <strong><em>melva</em></strong>, butterfly-filleted, i.e. the fillets are still joined on one side</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 cloves of garlic, peeled, 3 of them crushed</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 10 peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 10 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">175ml white wine, such as Chardonnay</p>
<p class="ingredients">175ml white wine vinegar, such as Chardonnay</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 orange, unpeeled and sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 lemon, peeled and sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 6 strands of saffron, infused in warm water</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">sliced avocado or mango (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">red <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">Russian salad (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_207">here</a>, optional)</p>
<p class="method">Make sure you have a pan that is big enough to take the fish, or cut off the tails. Season the fish, then dust with flour.</p>
<p class="method">Heat a little olive oil in the pan, put in the fillets and the whole garlic cloves and sauté until the fish is golden, taking care not to burn it. If you feel that it is beginning to burn, drain off the olive oil and replace it with new oil.</p>
<p class="method">When the fish is golden, lift it out and keep on one side. Drain the oil through a sieve into another pan.</p>
<p class="method">Add the paprika, crushed garlic cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, cloves, wine and vinegar, with a dash of water, and bring to a simmer. Add the fish, the orange, lemon and saffron, with its soaking water and cook gently for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Turn off the heat and leave to cool down to room temperature before serving. Remove the skin from the fish, garnish, if you like, with avocado or mango, and serve with <em>piquillo</em> peppers and Russian salad.</p>

<p class="quote">‘a mindset I have come to value’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Salt cod, or ‘stockfish’, is the most famous <em>salazón</em> (salted fish) and known to everyone in Spain, though it is not very well understood in the UK, probably because it involves an unfamiliar mindset; however, it is a mindset I have come to value as a great way of getting to eat fish more often, without having to go out and find a good fishmonger or buy frozen fish.</p>
<p class="indented">Before the invention of refrigeration, if you wanted to eat fish in the most remote inland areas of Spain, salting was the only option, which is why it is sometimes known as the ‘mountain fish’, and recipes for it abound. Now, of course, everyone has access to either fresh or frozen fish, but the tradition of cooking with salt cod, often in quite inspirational ways, has remained strongly woven into the culinary fabric of Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean, with discerning cooks stocking up on it, planning ahead and buying from specialist sellers, and inventive chefs coming up with ever newer ways of using it.</p>
<p class="indented">Spanish salt cod is done with a quite gentle cure, sometimes known as a green cure (<em>bacalao salado verde</em>), which involves keeping the fish in salt in large barrels for four months and gives soft flakes of white fish, a clean, fresh aroma of the sea and a delicate flavour, albeit more pronounced than fresh cod. This is in contrast to the style of salt cod that is more popular in Portugal, the Caribbean, Africa and Brazil, where it is air-dried (sometimes it is salted first, sometimes not), so it becomes drier, tougher and chewier in texture, tending to be more stringy and fibrous, with a much stronger fish taste and a light yellow colour.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>Ready de-salted cod</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">Of course, before you cook with salt cod you have to de-salt it by soaking it in water. While aficionados will stock up on it and keep the soaking process going continually in the fridge so they always have some ready to go, there is an increasing market for ready de-salted cod that you can use straight away, or that you can keep in the fridge for about three weeks, and you can also buy it pre-packed.</p>
<p class="indented">The de-salting may be done at a specialist salt cod shop, and many markets, especially in Catalunya and the Basque country, have dedicated stalls where the fish will be soaking in stone or marble basins. Or it will be done by the original salting factory. In the Basque country our supplier, Iban Alkorta, has a special long blue de-salting room, filled with lines of tanks, each one with its own taps for changing the water, in which the various cuts are carefully labelled and monitored as they soak for varying lengths of time according to the size of the pieces.</p>
<p class="indented">Iban will often offer chefs and catering businesses a bespoke service tailored to their <a id="pg_328"/>style of cooking, so that they have a consistent ingredient that will always behave the same way in a recipe. On one occasion when I visited, Iban’s father was skilfully tearing fat de-salted cod <em>morros</em> into strips in the traditional manner for the Catalan salad <em>esquiexada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_200">here</a>), for a customer who requested that only he should do the tearing.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_327"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg327.jpg"/></div>
<p class="flush_left1" id="p328a"><strong>De-salting cod yourself</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">If you are able to buy salt cod and are prepared to de-salt it yourself, here are some guidelines:</p>
<p class="method">Spanish salt cod is only lightly cured and not dried like its Portuguese counterpart, so it barely gains in weight once soaked. So although I have given weights for de-salted cod throughout this book, if you choose to do the de-salting yourself the starting weight of the fish will be roughly the same.</p>
<p class="method">Before de-salting, wash the cod under running water, as you can remove quite a bit of salt at this initial stage.</p>
<p class="method">Always do the de-salting in the fridge, because as you soak out the salt you are also losing its preservative properties, and without it the fish will begin to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="method">Put the cod, skin side up, on a rack in a dish of very cold water, so it isn’t in contact with the base of the dish, where all the salt will be deposited, and so that the gelatine that is released from under the skin penetrates the flesh as well as the water. It is the gelatine that enables the fish to retain its unctuous texture when cooked and to contribute to the creaminess of any sauce that is involved in the dish.</p>
<p class="method">The water you use for the actual soaking is very important – at this stage the taste and smell of tap water can be transmitted to the cod, so it is better to use spring or mineral water, as people would do in Spain. Ozonised water is the absolute ideal: no chlorine, no micro-organisms and no minerals.</p>
<p class="method">Using very cold water is important. If you use warm water the gelatine will seep out too soon, and the flesh of the fish will separate and also become yellow.</p>
<p class="method">Soaking times obviously depend on the size and thickness (pieces can be from 0.5–3.5cm), but small pieces of fillet up to 500g can be de-salted relatively quickly, say for 24 hours, changing the water 2–3 times. Larger pieces might take up to 36 hours, again changing the water 2–3 times. Don’t be tempted to change the water more regularly, as every time you do so you disturb the cod and risk losing some of its vital properties, particularly the gelatine. The cod whitens slightly as it de-salts and the texture softens. If you want to check that it has lost enough salt, taste a small corner of fish, remembering that you will probably be adding fresh salt when you use it in a recipe.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>How to choose and use salt cod</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">Salt cod isn’t just salt cod: there are many specific cuts which are used for different dishes. Spanish cooks can be quite obsessive about the subject and know when it is worth spending money on the best loin cuts and when this is a complete waste of money, as cheaper pieces will do a particular job better. While the various cuts are known as <em>bacalao</em>, a whole salted cod is called <em>una bacalada</em>, and can be up to 60cm long and weigh 4–5kg. These huge cod give fat fillets which provide the finest and most sought-after cuts, and then, as the fish scale down in size, there is a whole science behind defining the cuts to be taken from them, all the way down to the smallest cod, weighing less than a kilo, which provide two fillets only.</p>
<p class="method">The fishmonger will get out what looks like a paper-cutter and if you don’t know which pieces to buy, he will invariably ask you what you are <a id="pg_329"/>going to cook and cut the fish accordingly – at which point anyone else waiting to be served will usually pitch in and offer some tips.</p>
<p class="method">Because I am on something of a mission to spread the message about salt cod, at Brindisa we have spent a long time researching the whole subject, and I invited our supplier in the Basque country, Iban Alkorta, to come over and give a workshop for colleagues in my kitchen at home. We packed everyone in, piled the table with ingredients, and spent an entire day with Iban and Leo Rivera, our head chef, making all kinds of dishes using the various cuts, many of which appear throughout this book in everything from big dishes to salads and omelettes.</p>
<p class="method">However, I am aware that salt cod and de-salted cod are only slowly gaining an audience in the UK, so unless you seek out a specialist supplier, you may have a more limited choice, and sometimes might only find fillets taken from small fish, but it is worth keeping an eye out for the following:</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Lomo</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Loin</p>
<p class="method">The best loins come from the central part of the very biggest fish (up to 4 kilos). They are boneless and cut square or rectangular, for dishes where you really want to show off the perfect <em>láminas</em> or flakes of the fish, which stay beautifully intact during cooking, then fall apart elegantly as you eat. You can lightly steam them and add a sauce, or poach and then grill them, and they are ideal for recipes such as <em>bacallà amb mel</em> (salt cod with honey, <a href="chapter_004.html#p330e">here</a>).</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Morro</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Cheeks</p>
<p class="method">If you can find these, they have the longest and largest <em>láminas</em> (flakes) of all, and are especially popular in Catalunya. Juicy and aesthetically quite beautiful, they are best broken up and shown off in salads such as <em>remojón</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec69">here</a>), <em>esquiexada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_200">here</a>) and <em>xatonada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec70">here</a>).</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Pil pil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is the special cut for the famous Basque dish of the same name (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_332">here</a>). It is the most muscular part of the fish, behind the loin and before the tail, and has the greatest gelatine content from bones and skin of all the central cuts – it is this gelatine that is needed to form the emulsion that is essential to <em>bacalao al pil pil</em>. When the cut is taken from a smaller fish it is known as <em>txiki</em> (small) in the Basque language.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head">Kokotxas</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Jowls</p>
<p class="flush_left">Salt cod jowls are considered a delicacy. Known as <em>kokotxa</em>s in the Basque language and <em>cocochas</em> in Castilian, these used to be eaten fresh by the fishermen after the fish had been filleted. Now everyone else has woken up to how delicate, tasty and textural they are: very gelatinous, and juicy, they slip down almost like oysters, and salted jowls are much sought after. Quick to cook, they make perfect light and tasty bite-sized tapas. In Basque bars they are popular as <em>kokotxas rebozadas,</em> coated with flour and egg, then deep-fried until lightly golden and dressed with chopped parsley, garlic and lemon juice.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Kokotxas al pil pil</em> is another favourite, in which the jowls are cooked in the garlic and olive oil sauce that is also used for salt cod loins (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_332">here</a>). Of course the drawback is that jowls aren’t that readily available, as there is only one per fish.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_330"/>Cuts that are worth knowing about if you are in Spain, but that you are unlikely to come across in this country are:</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p330a">Colas recortes</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">The tails</p>
<p class="method">These are high in gelatine and too good to waste. Those from the smaller fish, in particular, are juicy and delicious breaded and fried for tapas, or used in <em>buñuelos de bacalao</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_248">here</a>), omelettes, or for making fish stock (see <em>fumet blanco</em>, <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>).</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p330b">Recortes</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">The edges</p>
<p class="method">Also called skirt or belly pieces, these are trimmings from fillets, which tend to be drier, and are used in recipes where the quality of the fish is less detectable – so, like the tail pieces, they can be used for <em>buñuelos de bacalao</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_248">here</a>).</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p330c">Migas</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Crumbs or pieces</p>
<p class="method">These vary in quality according to the cut they come from, but are mostly used in dishes where their appearance isn’t crucial (as they are more randomly shaped and not so elegant as the shreds from the <em>morro</em>), such as <em>buñuelos</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_248">here</a>), <em>tortilla</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_267">here</a>), <em>empedrat</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_201">here</a>) and <em>porrusalda</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_226">here</a>).</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head" id="p330d">Tripet</p>
<p class="small-recipe-subhead">Tripe</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Tripet</em> in Catalan, or <em>tripa</em> in Spanish, this is not the intestines, but the breathing pouch which comes from the underside of the fish. It is bigger than you might expect and contains high levels of gelatine. Once de-salted it is usually blanched so that its grey skin can be peeled off easily, after which it is put into cold water, brought to the boil, then taken off the heat and left to cool. After that it is usually diced, and typically cooked in a tomato <em>sofrito</em> with pieces of <em>chorizo</em> or <em>panceta</em>, chickpeas and a <em>picada</em> added at the end.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p330e">Some salt cod notes</p>
<p class="flush_left">Although it might sound strange, it is still necessary to season the cod to taste during cooking, as once de-salted it needs to be treated like a fresh fish.</p>
<p class="indented">Since salt cod isn’t as readily available in the UK as in Spain, some recipes I have seen suggest substituting fresh cod, and salting it overnight; however, the fish won’t gain the flavour or perfect flaking of salt cod, so I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec129"><a id="pg_331"/>Bacallà amb mel</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Salt cod with honey</p>
<p class="flush_left">When you buy your salt cod or de-salted cod, make sure that the pieces are long enough to cover the apple slices which form the base layer of the dish.</p>

<p class="ingredients">a little olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">120g sugar</p>

<p class="method">Coat the cod pieces in flour, then heat a generous amount of olive oil in a pan, making sure it comes no further than a third of the way up the pan. If you have a thermometer it should be 180°C; otherwise, drop in some flour and if it sizzles gently then the oil is ready.</p>
<p class="method">Put in the floured cod and deep-fry for around 2 minutes until golden, depending on the thickness. Lift out and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the apple slices in the base of an ovenproof dish, and place the fried cod on top, skin side down. Spread a thick layer of the <em>alioli</em> and honey mixture over the top. Sprinkle with the pine nuts and bake in the preheated oven for 4–6 minutes, until golden brown (if it doesn’t brown enough, you could put it under a hot grill to finish for 2–3 minutes).</p>
<p class="method">Heat the PX vinegar in a pan and let it bubble up until reduced by just over half, then drizzle over the dish before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec130"><a id="pg_332"/>Bacalao al pil pil</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Salt cod in olive oil</p>
<p class="flush_left">Salt cod is one of the famous treasures of Basque cuisine and <em>pil pil</em> is a very Basque dish. Made with only four ingredients – salt cod, olive oil, garlic and peppers – its name seems to come from the sound that the sauce makes as the gelatine from the fish, olive oil and garlic emulsify around the cod pieces, almost like an <em>alioli</em>, as the dish cooks slowly over several hours.</p>
<p class="indented">The story goes that the dish has its origin in a peculiar circumstance during the Carlist wars of the 1800s, when the people of Bilbao were cut off from supplies by the second siege and faced starvation. Miraculously, just before the siege a tradesman who had ordered around 20 pieces of salt cod unaccountably received more than 20,000. So the people had salt cod, as well as olive oil, which sustained them over a long period – and <em>pil pil</em> was born.</p>
<p class="indented">Two important things: you need cod with the skin on, as this is where the gelatine is concentrated. Ideally, this will be a special <em>pil pil</em> cut of loin, from the most gelatinous tail end; and also you need to cook it over a gentle heat (around 50ºC and no higher than 60ºC), otherwise the emulsion won’t form properly, or will break down if you overheat it once it has formed. This is a dish that can’t be served piping hot for that reason.</p>
<p class="indented">There are two ways of making the dish. The traditional one involves putting all the ingredients into the pan and gently shaking it continuously over a low heat to create the emulsion – a skill, like making <em>alioli</em>, that most Spanish cooks are comfortable with. Some restaurants use <em>pilpileras</em>, which are small electric cookers which move the <em>pil pil</em> pan gently in a circular motion so that you do not have to do this manually; however, where these are used, sometimes milk and flour are also added if the sauce is not thickening itself enough. There is also a more contemporary way, which involves cooking the de-salted cod first, then whisking the sauce separately until it is thick; I favour the traditional version I have given here, which comes courtesy of my friends Ambro and Asun in Pedrosa de Duero in Burgos (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>). Ambro made it for us for Sunday lunch using a big, wide but light enamel pan with two handles, which he could shake backwards and forwards without too much strain on the wrists.</p>
<p class="indented">Asun and I bought three whole <em>bacalada</em> with bones, fins, skin and tails, as Ambro was cooking for ten, going on a hundred. The fishmonger sliced each fish into eight pieces so that we ended up with 5kg of fish, ready for the soaking over 1–2 days in a series of big buckets. This was serious cooking, with 1.2 litres of olive oil and 30 cloves of garlic. Ambro does sometimes like to use a shocking amount of garlic – he had 20 cloves for the pan and ten for decoration; plus five peppers. Despite his off-the-scale portions, over a long slow lunch everything was devoured!</p>
<p class="makes"><a id="pg_333"/>Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">350ml strong olive oil (with a deep colour)</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 peppers, de-seeded and sliced (or dried red chillies)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 de-salted <strong><em>pil pil</em></strong> cod loins, around 800g</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a light, wide, two-handled pan.</p>
<p class="method">Slice 2 of the garlic cloves and fry in the oil until golden, then lift out and keep to one side. Put in the peppers or chillies and fry for 30 seconds, then remove these, too, and keep to one side. Let the oil cool down – if you drop in a small piece of bread it shouldn’t fry – then put in the cod loins, skin side down. Slowly heat the oil up again to a slow bubbling. Crush all the other garlic cloves and place them in the oil, dotted around the loins, making sure they are well submerged in the liquid.</p>
<p class="method">Now you need to move and gently shake the pan continuously for all of 30–45 minutes (yes, really) as the sauce warms and cooks – making sure it doesn’t get too hot and burn. The fish should remain whole and intact, so that it will break into shards later as you eat it, and the sauce will slowly begin to thicken and emulsify, until after about 30–45 minutes it will have formed into a silky yellow sauce which has folded itself around the fish.</p>
<p class="method">Sprinkle with the reserved toasted garlic and peppers or chillies and serve.</p>

<p class="quote">‘the planet’s most expensive spice’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The <em>manto</em>, the day the saffron flowers come into bloom in the fields around the villages of Castilla La Mancha in central Spain, is a beautiful sight. It usually happens around the last week in October. One day you can drive through the region and see only barren hillsides, and the next, you are surrounded by a gorgeous blanket of deep purple petals shimmering in the late sunshine: a spectacle that will last only about two weeks before the landscape returns to brown earth and mud. It really is one of the wonders of nature and there is something magical about it.</p>
<p class="indented">Saffron, which comes from the dried stigma of <em>Crocus sativus</em>, has been grown in La Mancha for at least 1,000 years, and the region, which encompasses part of the provinces of Cuenca, Toledo and Albacete, as well as the majority of Ciudad Real, is still the most famous for the spice. It also used to be grown in small quantities in Galicia, Asturias and Jaén, and is now cultivated in a tiny area of Aragón near Teruel, known as Jiloca, where it has been championed by Slow Food, but not, strangely, in Valencia, the land of the <em>paella</em>, although this is where most of the packers, distributors and exporters are based. Here, as in other regions of Spain, people often use food colouring (<em>colorante</em>) instead.</p>
<p class="indented">The planet’s most expensive spice, a pound of which, in the eighteenth century, was quoted as being literally worth its weight in gold, saffron was introduced by the Moors, originally from Iran, and the name La Mancha is probably derived from the Arabic <em>al-mansha</em> (meaning a dry area or wilderness). Saffron’s fascination lies not only in its unique flavour and aroma but in its colour. In ancient times it was used as a dye in the finest fabrics and carpets – Buddhist monks dyed their robes with it, and Irish chiefs their cloaks. The fact that it can only be harvested by hand adds to its worth, and it is not only an ingredient for our kitchens but also a remedy. Like honey, it is often seen as a natural source of goodness that can help to ward off illness and ease conditions such as asthma, assist digestion and stimulate appetite. I heard of an opera singer who insisted on drinking warm milk infused with saffron before singing, as a way to wake up her larynx.</p>
<p class="indented">At one time in La Mancha, most villagers would cultivate an area of saffron flowers, however tiny, to boost their income at a time when other agricultural work tended to be quite quiet – for a few weeks of intensive work, even the smallest pocket-handkerchief patch of flowers would earn a family enough to buy a new washing machine or a small luxury. There are stories of families keeping saffron in a special <em>guardazafrán</em>, a locked chest, to form part of a young girl’s dowry, or of flowers being stolen from the fields on a Sunday during harvest time when the villagers were all at church.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_335"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg335.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_336"/>However, in the last decade Iranian saffron has taken over the market, so much so that it now satisfies 80 per cent of the world’s demand. Spain, like everywhere else, began importing Iranian saffron in the late eighties, when trade embargos were lifted. The market flooded, the price went down, and there was little motivation for the growers in La Mancha to carry on, so the production shrank and people began abandoning the crocus fields for the building trade, or to work in the cities. Then, ironically, the building trade collapsed, unemployment rose, and locals began looking to plant saffron once again. La Mancha was granted its own PDO and began finding new markets.</p>
<p class="indented">The reality, however, is that Spanish home cooks who use a great deal of saffron baulk at the price of the La Mancha spice, preferring to keep it for special dishes. The rest of the time they might buy saffron from Iran or design their own blend of imported and home-grown. At Brindisa we sell saffron from Iran as well as from La Mancha – but both are selected for us by our saffron specialists, the Sotos family, in Albacete in La Mancha. Antonio Sotos has run the current operation since 1958 with his wife, Encarnación González Tolosa, who comes from a saffron dynasty going back four generations, to 1912. Their son, also called Antonio, is involved in the business as well, and the two generations live and work out of a large, elegant town house in the centre of Albacete.</p>
<p class="indented">I am often asked if saffron from La Mancha is worth its high price. Well, I believe it is, partly because its deep brick-red colour and intense aroma mean that you can add less of it to your cooking than Iranian saffron and achieve a much greater impact. To highlight the differences between the two, at Brindisa one day I asked some of our chefs to make two batches of ice cream, one flavoured with saffron from Iran, the other with saffron from La Mancha. Then we held a blind tasting. The Iranian saffron did the job very well, but the ice cream made with Spanish saffron had the most incredibly rich flavour, colour, and above all aroma that hung like a little cloud in the air and made for a much fuller experience (see recipe on <a href="chapter_005.html#rec208">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">The dedication to quality in La Mancha begins with the cultivation of the crocus bulbs in June (each 5–8cm bulb produces a new one the following year). The specifications of the PDO insist on the bulbs being planted 15–20cm apart, so that they can fatten up properly and produce the prized long threads. By contrast, in Iran planting tends to be more intensive, which can result in threads that are shorter and thinner. Also in La Mancha new bulbs are planted on a four-year cycle, whereas in Iran this refreshing of the bulbs might happen only every ten years.</p>
<p class="indented">As soon as the first flowers bloom they have to be picked, signalling the start of around two weeks of back-breaking work, since each crocus blooms up to three times. The pickers begin early in the morning, sometimes in the autumn mist, before the sun has a chance to warm the petals and make them limp and more difficult to pick without damaging the threads, which, of course, are the precious part of the flower.</p>
<p class="indented">In the town of Consuegra a famous saffron festival takes place each year. This is pure Don Quixote windmill country, and the last time I visited I went out into the fields with Encarnación in the early morning. By midday the pickers had already harvested a piece of land the size of an Olympic swimming pool. Most of the villagers and neighbours of the growers will join the harvest for free, and children are even allowed to take time off school in order to help.</p>
<p class="indented">Once the baskets are filled to overflowing, they are taken indoors to the <em>mondadores</em> and <em>mondadoras</em>, the men and women – but mostly women – who settle down for the afternoon around tables piled high with the flowers to carry out <em>la monda</em>, the separating of the stigmas from the petals. The skill is to do this with one quick but delicate turn of the thumb and index finger, removing the three stigmas in one go but keeping them joined at the base. As the <em>mondadores</em> work, their fingers become stained a deep red-yellow, the mound of deep red-orange filaments gets higher, and pillows of purple flowers drop to <a id="pg_337"/>the floor. It seems such a scandal that no one yet has seemed to find a use for the discarded petals.</p>
<p class="indented">Certain villages and areas of La Mancha have different reputations for the quality of their saffron, and particular <em>mondadores</em> are renowned for being the most skilled. One of the highlights of the Consuegra festival is a race in which competitors from different villages are each given 100 flowers, then the <em>monda</em> begins, against the clock, to find the champion who can produce the quickest perfect batch of saffron threads, in their threesomes. I believe the record is around ten minutes, and I’m sure the locals have been known to have a bet or two on the outcome.</p>
<p class="indented">Once the threads have all been removed, they must be dried or ‘cured’, either by the sun, by fan (a more intensive method) – or the gentler, old-fashioned dry-toasting in small batches favoured in La Mancha and known as <em>el tueste</em>, which preserves the aroma better.</p>
<p class="indented">A big round sieve is filled with the threads, placed over the low heat of a gas heater and shuffled from time to time so that they are toasted slowly and evenly. The room is filled with the heady aroma and as you watch over 20 minutes or so, the volume of threads sinks as the moisture rises off, and a flat dry red disc of saffron is left in the sieve.</p>
<p class="indented">For every kilo of stigmas just 200g of saffron is produced, and since you can only expect to harvest around 12 kilos of threads per hectare, it is clear why the saffron is considered so valuable.</p>
<p class="indented">In La Mancha the local people traditionally cook with whole threads of saffron, but for use elsewhere around Spain and abroad, the spice might be powdered. In this form it is popular, since it gives a more uniform colour, without the blotchy spots of intense colour that the threads create. So, many of the best saffron selectors are now selling ground saffron, as well as the threads, packed in little paper envelopes, known colloquially around Asturias, Galicia and Murcia as <em>sardinetas</em> (the name for the ceremonial stripe on military uniforms), which contain enough saffron to put into most dishes for four people.</p>
<p class="indented">Among the younger generation, the packets of powdered saffron are becoming increasingly popular because of their convenience and approachability; however, you often find that older home cooks trust threads more, as they remember times when the powder has been adulterated because of the greed to make money from saffron. Although some unscrupulous saffron dealers attempt to pass off the threads of the safflower as <em>Crocus sativus,</em> it is far easier to mix the powdered spice with inferior saffron, powdered safflower or paprika.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><a id="pg_338"/><strong>How to choose saffron</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">Saffron consists only of the three red stigmas of the saffron crocus and none of the rest of the flower.</p>
<p class="method">Quality is measured by the flavour, aroma and colour that the saffron produces when put into warm water. The flavour should be hay-like with a hint of bitterness, its aroma a combination of honey with grassy tones, and the colour it imparts should be a luminous, delicate yellow-gold.</p>
<p class="method">When buying threads, look for long, whole ones with no broken bits.</p>
<p class="method">Check the country of origin on the packaging or look for the PDO (Protected Denomination of Origin) mark of La Mancha. If you see neither listed, only the country where the saffron was packed, then you cannot be sure of what you are buying. It could be Iranian saffron or a blend of Iranian and Spanish (since these two countries account for 80 per cent of the world production it is unlikely to be from anywhere else).</p>
<p class="method">The price of Spanish, and especially La Mancha, saffron can be high, so if you are using it for stocks, or rice dishes, especially those containing meat, even the most ardent supporters of La Mancha saffron agree that the Iranian spice is fine. It is worth splashing out on more expensive threads for sauces and dishes where these will be very visible.</p>
<p class="method">You also need to be aware of the possibility that in order to increase the weight, improve the look, and demand a higher price, the saffron might not be what it appears. Safflower threads are often sold as saffron, and past scandals have involved padding out genuine saffron with beet or pomegranate fibres, even red-dyed silk fibres. More recently, in 2011, consignments of saffron were found to have been bulked out with other parts of the crocus flower that had been dyed.</p>
<p class="method">You can recognise safflower threads, as they will look more like dry, golden, wide-stemmed grass with no distinctive aroma, whereas a genuine, good-quality saffron thread will most likely be deep crimson red, and will have a marked trumpet-shaped end. Some genuine saffron threads, however, have a more yellow appearance, so the real test is to put them into water. Real saffron will keep its own colour but turn the water golden, and the threads will float. Fake saffron will lose its colour into the water, and will usually sink. Ultimately, the safest thing is to stick with a clearly labelled brand or supplier that you trust.</p>
<p class="method">Powdered saffron, too, has been known to have been adulterated with turmeric, paprika – even brick dust. So the same advice about trust applies.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>How to keep and use saffron</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">All saffron should be protected from the light so it retains its properties for longer. So avoid packaging that doesn’t recognise this.</p>
<p class="method">Although saffron, once packaged, has a 5-year date code, time is not its friend, so it is best to buy it within the first year of its lifetime, and then use it quickly.</p>
<p class="method">Remember that although saffron has the potential to add a powerful and specific flavour to a dish, it is not meant to dominate, but to enhance the key ingredients. Most recipes tend to leave the quantity of saffron quite loose: a pinch, or a few strands; however, I feel that it is helpful to have a guide as to how much to use, at least when experimenting for the first time – then you can vary the quantity if you wish. So I would say as a very rough guide, for a dish that serves 4–6 people you need around 0.1g, which equates to 15–25 threads, depending on their size and weight – but meat dishes usually require more (María José San Román, who is the major contemporary researcher of saffron, often uses <a id="pg_339"/>double this quantity). Also, drier, baked dishes which rely on aroma might need a little more, and dishes based on fats, such as ice cream, might also need larger amounts for colour.</p>
<p class="method">While I would usually favour strands over powder in general cooking, María José recommends that a good, authentic powdered saffron is better in baking, where you are adding it to flour, and want the colour to diffuse evenly.</p>
<p class="method">While the most popular way to awaken the character of the saffron before you add it to your dish is either to toast the threads or powder in a dry frying pan (just long enough for it to release its aroma), unless a dish is very dry, María José prefers the infusion method, putting the stigmas into warm water (65ºC) often for 4 hours before using.</p>

<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_340"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg340.jpg"/></div>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_341"/>Just as I always say tapas are not the only Spanish food, <em>paella</em> is not the only rice dish. Rice plays a big part in everyone’s life in Spain, whatever the region, but rice dishes come in one of three styles. The relatively dry styles are called either <em>paellas</em> or <em>arroces secos</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_346">here</a>). Then there are creamy risotto-like dishes known as <em>melosos</em> – usually cooked in a <em>cazuela</em> (terracotta dish) – and soupy <em>caldosos</em>, made in a deep casserole. All might be eaten communally, straight from the pan or earthenware pot, or served in individual portions.</p>
<p class="indented">Rice dishes are the food of the people, not the elite, however elaborate they might become in the hands of a creative chef. As always, the recipes reflect the season and locality, so the added ingredients might be wild mushrooms, seafood, rabbit, <em>chorizo</em>, garlic shoots or snails.</p>
<p class="indented">On rice menus you might also see ‘<em>a banda</em>’– which means ‘on the side’, so a fish pot arrives first, in which there might be langoustines, red snapper, large chunks of monkfish and potatoes in a rich stock. Rice will follow, quite alone, but its taste will be sumptuous because it will have been cooked in stock from the cooking of the fish.</p>
<p class="indented">Across the world there are in excess of 40,000 varieties of rice, but the basic divide is between lowland tropical types and higher-altitude cooler varieties, although there are crosses and hybrids in between. In Spain the traditional rice is of the Japonica type, which is plump and slightly opaque with a bright white concentration of starch in the centre of the grain.</p>
<p class="indented">The starch in rice is made up of amylose and amylopectine, and it is the ratio of these that determines the way the grains behave during cooking. At one end of the scale, strains that are high in amylose and low in amylopectine will be more resilient and the grains will stay separate and springy, as with Indian Basmati rice. At the opposite end, those that are low in amylose and high in amylopectine are more fragile and will become more sticky as they cook, so at the extreme end of the scale, you have sushi rice. In between are the Mediterranean rices, whose grains swell up and glisten, enriched by the stocks, oils and ingredients that are introduced to them, and then deliver all these flavours, intensified, in each spoonful, while at the same time retaining a little bite. Spanish rice and Italian risotto rice, which is also of the Japonica strain, are very similar; however, the Italian varieties are even more absorbent. Interestingly, a Spanish strain of the Italian risotto rice Carnaroli is being grown in Catalunya and it works very well in soupier dishes like <em>melosos</em> and <em>caldosos</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_359">here</a> and <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_362">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Of the Spanish varieties, the most popular, Bomba, has achieved almost mythical status, partly because it is one of the oldest varieties (first identified in the eighteenth century) but also because its production is limited and its purity as a strain remains intact. For this reason Bomba is the only varietal you are likely to see identified on a label, as producers want to extol its reputation and its heritage. Otherwise rice is usually just marketed under brand names.</p>
<p class="indented">The Bomba grains are very small, almost a perfect round, with a tiny tail at one end. This is the most resilient and tolerant of Spanish varieties, with 23 per cent amylose (compared to 28 per cent for Basmati), so, while it has the ability to absorb enough liquid to double in size, the grains remain loose, making it easier to cook the rice well. Other varieties, such as Senia, Bahía, and the Balilla x Sollana from Calasparra all have their fans, but with only 17 per cent amylose they are more sensitive, and if you are not used to them, there is more of a risk of overcooking and releasing so much starch that they become gloopy. As expert rice grower Juan Trías (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_342">here</a>) puts it, <em>Bomba tiene un espacio de cocción en vez que un momento de cocción</em>: <em>‘</em>Bomba has a space in which to cook perfectly, rather than just a moment.’</p>
<p class="indented">So, although I give some alternatives in the recipes that follow, and I would favour Carnaroli for the soupy <em>melosos</em>, as the variety releases more starch, I would say if you want to choose one rice and stick with it, it would have to be Bomba, or a rice from Calasparra (especially for <em>paella</em>s or in soups).</p>

<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_342"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg342.jpg"/></div>
<p class="quote">‘numerous and varying dramatically’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Originally from Asia, rice came to Spain with the Arabs in the eighth century and they used the large fresh-water lagoon in the region of Albufera in Valencia to plant and grow it. These days the rice-growing areas across Spain are numerous and vary dramatically in the volume they produce, from Andalucía, which is the largest, then Extremadura, through to the Delta del Ebre in Tarragona, Catalunya; Albufera de Valencia; Zaragoza, Navarra, Calasparra in Murcia; and Pals, down to the tiniest 500-acre paddy field in Mallorca. However, the most famous areas are measured by quality, rather than quantity, and these include the Delta de l’Ebre; a small area in Gerona; Albufera; and Calasparra, each of which is very different.</p>
<p class="indented">In most of these regions you find a mix of large and small producers. The big concerns may use industrial processes and chemicals in the cultivation and processing of the grains and are geared to producing more cost-efficient crops. But there are also smaller family businesses and co-operatives that concentrate on one exceptional, pure varietal, or a carefully cultivated cross, and use more alternative or traditional methods of growing, cropping that encourages biodiversity and protects wildlife, sun-drying of the grains and in some cases even stone-milling. Many things can have an impact on the quality of the grains, from altitude, to the water used to irrigate the fields, or the use of sun-drying; however, the most important element is the varietal, its genealogy and the care with which it is cultivated, harvested, dried, milled, and carefully selected for intact grains.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><strong>Tarragona</strong></p>
<p class="flush_left">In Tarragona the rice-growing region stretches over some 20,000 hectares of coastal delta, populated by growers large and small, producing some excellent rice. When we were developing the rice menu for our restaurant in Shoreditch, I went to visit the flat delta land, stretching to the sea, with Josep, our executive chef. It is an area dotted with small, very Mediterranean-looking villages with white-washed houses and gardens full of colourful flowers. We visited a family estate, Illa de Riu, where Juan Trías del Romero focuses on single varietals, mainly Bomba (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_341">here</a>), and it was a joy to see the understanding and empathy between chef and grower.</p>
<p class="indented">Juan is the third generation of this rice-growing family. This is a difficult area to cultivate, as its proximity to the sea makes the salinity high, and irrigation is done by a network of channels and gates which allow the movement of water. The fields are waterlogged for at least 10 months of the year, which helps to support wildlife. <a id="pg_344"/>Ducks and eels abound in this area and both are favourites cooked with rice. All around the fields you see one-storey white cottages with thatched roofs that are hunting lodges for duck shooting, and lines of eels, cleaned and drying in the sun ready to be preserved, in which case they are known as <em>xapadillos</em>.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_343"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg343.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">In the great white estate house next to the rice stores you can still see the room with the blackboard where Juan’s mother taught the children of the estate workers to read and write. A crocheted rice calendar, made by one of Juan’s sisters, runs along the edge of a dresser, showing the yearly schedule of draining the fields in January, levelling the soil, flooding, sowing and, finally, harvesting the tall, golden plants in October, before the fields are mulched and filled with water and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p class="indented">The rice varieties they cultivate are Tebre, Senia, Bahía, Carnaroli and Bomba (which now accounts for 40 per cent of the crop). It was harvest time when we visited and rice was flowing in every direction – trailers brought in fresh grains from the field which waited in a vast aerated tunnel, to be sucked up into the old drying machines, upgraded, but still a maze of moving wooden beams, pivots, funnels and towers. The flames beneath roared and reflected deep orange on the brick walls as the hot air was funnelled through the turning cylinders of rice, until the right humidity levels were achieved. Then the rice passed into cooling silos and, finally, the storage chamber, with its cool air vents and thermometers buried deep in the mountains of rice to ensure no rogue grains ruined the valuable stock.</p>
<p class="indented">The production of rice in this area has changed over the years and many small growers no longer have mills, so they rely on the benevolence of larger establishments to mill their rice. Fortunately, in the Delta de l’Ebre area of Tarragona there are still two co-operatives, one on each side of the river, that work with small-scale growers. The rice is milled bright white, packed, then returned to the estate to sell.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Gerona</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In Pals in Gerona, there is a smaller rice-growing area that covers just over 900 hectares, irrigated by the river Ter. The land mass is small, and the labour cost high, as, although the rice is harvested using modern machinery, in order to ensure it is collected quickly and efficiently the weeding and replanting is all done manually, and the crops are kept healthy without chemicals. The rice is excellent, and at the Molí de Pals mill varieties go by old local names, so the Bahia variety, mainly used for <em>caldosos</em> and <em>melosos</em>, is known as Rodó Perlat, and Semillarg Cristal is the name given to the Loto variety, which is the favourite locally for dry <em>paella</em> dishes.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Valencia</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In the Valencia region there are about 15,000 hectares under cultivation in the massive still-water lagoon, which stretches over 50,000 acres at sea level. It is an amazing sight with herons swooping over the fields of water which reach as far as the horizon, bordered by the bright green leaves of the citrus groves. All varieties grow here, on a large and small scale, but the main crop is Senia and Bomba.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Murcia</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In Calasparra in Murcia, along with Bomba, a variety that is a cross of Balilla and Solana is grown across 400 hectares of land, high up, with elevations that vary from 1,150 to 1,650 metres above sea level. Since this medium-grain rice usually features the name Calasparra on packets, I find that people often tend to think this is the variety rather than the region where it is grown.</p>
<p class="indented">The Arabs recognised that this point where the Segura and Mundo rivers meet would make an ideal rice-growing area, and built terraces and irrigation channels which remain unchanged, so that exceptionally clean water irrigates the fields and is never still or stagnant.</p>
<p class="indented">The landscape around Murcia is almost lunar, but the dry rocky hills change to wild flower <a id="pg_345"/>meadows the closer you get to Calasparra, and the rice fields feel like an oasis in the midst of the surrounding barren land. Most of the rice is harvested by a co-operative of 160 members, and only half the area is planted each year, so that other crops – fruit trees and vegetables – can be rotated systematically, in order to keep the level of nutrients in the soil at its best and maintain the ecosystem for the birds and wild life.</p>
<p class="indented">Outside the village is a sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady of Hope, and her statue is carried on the shoulders of robust locals at Easter time and other festivals. In the local restaurant they make seafood, rabbit and chicken <em>paella</em> using the Bomba rice, and people arrive in coachloads for a day out looking at the rice fields and having lunch. The last time I visited, a large group of elderly nuns were lunching and singing hymns and dancing around the tables in between courses.</p>

<p class="recipe-panel"><a id="pg_346"/>ARROCES SECOS Y PAELLAS</p>
<p class="recipe-panel-sub">Dry rice dishes</p>
<p class="flush_left">When we were developing the rice menu for our Shoreditch restaurant, we decided not to use the word <em>paella</em> at all, primarily because it isn’t representative of all the dry rice dishes of Spain that make good use of many different ingredients. The name <em>paella</em> doesn’t refer to any specific recipe, but to the wide flat pan typical of Valencia that was first used by farm workers to cook a meal of rice with snails or maybe rabbit, and vegetables – typically green beans – over an open fire. Because of the association with Valencia, the word <em>paella</em> has often been avoided in other regions, except on tourist menus, and rice dishes made in neighbouring Alicante, Catalunya and the Balearic Islands are rarely if ever called <em>paella</em>. Instead, dry rice dishes are simply known as <em>arroces</em> and sometimes the word <em>paellera</em> is used to describe the cooking pan, to distinguish it from the dish.</p>
<p class="indented">Confusingly, even in Valencia they also have dishes labelled <em>arroces</em> – just don’t ask me to explain the difference, as no one I have met in that region or anywhere else has been able to come up with a definitive answer. One explanation is that a true <em>paella</em> includes not only meat and green beans, but also dried white beans; however, there are endless exceptions, and people just seem to know instinctively whether a dish is a <em>paella</em> or an <em>arroz.</em></p>
<p class="indented">The other reason for our avoidance of the word <em>paella</em> on the Shoreditch restaurant menu was that the concept has become so misunderstood, thanks to a touristy experience of badly made dishes, often containing frozen mussels and prawns, indifferent chicken, and electric yellow food colouring. And the experience hasn’t only been confined to coastal resorts. My husband Rupert remembers eating atrocious stodgy reheated <em>paellas</em> in motorway restaurants when he was growing up in Spain.</p>
<p class="indented">At the opposite end of the scale, traditional restaurants would often rather sniffily insist on 45 minutes warning to prepare the dish. However, a new, exciting wave of appreciation for the <em>paella</em> is sweeping around Spain, re-interpreting it as something contemporary, fun <a id="pg_347"/>and accessible. Smart specialist restaurants are springing up, serving many different, and often experimental, contemporary recipes, such as Thai mussel or salt cod <em>paella</em>, so that if you have a party of people going out for lunch or dinner, you can order a selection and share. Often these new-style <em>paellas</em> are quite shallow, the equivalent of thin-crust pizzas; and the use of heritage, rare and organic rices with individual characteristics, as opposed to blander hybrids, has become a selling point in the most progressive restaurants. There is even a new and popular fashion for ordering <em>paella</em> to be delivered to your home on a moped, like pizza.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Some <strong><em>arroz seco</em></strong> notes</h4>
<p class="flush_left">It is hard to give exact cooking times, because as well as the varietal and the quality of the grains, there are other important variables, such as the softness or hardness of the water, the temperature of any stock added, the cooking vessel, and the type of heat used for cooking. So I would say, cook by eye and by taste, and use proportions and cooking times only as a guide.</p>
<p class="method">There is an ongoing debate about the use of onions in a dry rice dish – should you use them in the base or shouldn’t you? Our Catalan chef Leo adds his special <em>cebolla</em> <em>caramelizada</em> – onions reduced right down with a touch of tomato (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p319a">here</a>) – to rice dishes, but in other regions the thinking is that because onions have a high level of humidity they can interfere with the cooking time. Certainly if you were to add onion to a dry rice dish in Valencia or Alicante, you would be upsetting the purists.</p>
<p class="method">Making an <em>arroz seco</em> is a different process from that of a <em>risotto</em> or its Spanish equivalent, <em>meloso</em>. In a risotto, the hot stock is added ladleful by ladleful and you let the rice take it up before adding any more, stirring constantly to release the starch from the rice, at the same time as allowing it to absorb flavours. In an <em>arroz seco</em> the hot stock or water is added at the beginning – initially you put in enough to bring the level to just below the handle studs of the pan, holding some back in case you need it. The liquid is brought to a gentle simmer, but then isn’t stirred during cooking, though the pan is shaken occasionally to meld the ingredients a little and a little extra hot stock can be added as necessary to ensure the rice cooks perfectly.</p>
<p class="method">Where an <em>arroz seco</em> <em>is</em> similar to risotto or <em>meloso</em>, however, is in the need for good-quality stock. The rice will absorb it all, so you can’t use a feeble stock and expect a dish full of flavour.</p>
<p class="method"><em>Paella</em> pans are wide and don’t always fit conveniently over a domestic hob. If it looks like the rice is cooking unevenly, rotate the pan clockwise every minute and a half or so, taking it off centre too if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">There are two approaches to cooking an <em>arroz seco</em>: either you let it cook on the hob all the way through, or you start it off on the hob and then transfer it to a hot oven at 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">If you cook the rice entirely on the hob, towards the end of the cooking time the thin metal of the pan causes a crusty layer of toasted rice (the <em>socarrat)</em> to form on the base and edge of the pan. This <em>socarrat</em> is one of the characteristics that most aficionados adore. Once the liquid is absorbed and the rice is ready the pan should be taken off the heat and covered with a clean tea towel or foil for a couple of minutes before serving to even out the texture of the rice by allowing the upper layer to steam and finish cooking.</p>
<p class="method">If you put it into the oven the rice cooks through more evenly without the need to steam it at the end, but you need to keep an eye on it, and if it is getting too dry pour in a couple of ladlefuls of stock around the edges in a circular movement.</p>
<p class="method">Which method you prefer is up to you, but in the recipes that follow, we have suggested the one we think suits each dish best.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec131"><a id="pg_348"/>Arroz de alcachofas con bacalao</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Artichoke and salt cod rice</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is the dish that Leo, our head chef, made for us after a meeting one day, and it was so good it spurred us on to develop a serious rice menu for our Shoreditch restaurant. The base is the intense Catalan <em>cebolla</em> <em>caramelizada</em> – onion and garlic paste, made with a little tomato added (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p319a">here</a>) – and in this case the <em>arroz</em> is finished off in the oven, to dry off the rice a little more, but without the crunchy base, or <em>socarrat</em>, that is produced by cooking on the hob. Because there is more rice and liquid involved, the cooking time is also a bit longer. The dish uses a <em>picada</em>, made with nuts, for added flavour interest.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 medium globe artichokes</p>
<p class="ingredients">a squeeze of lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 young garlic shoots or mild spring onions, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">40g <strong><em>cebolla caramelizada</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p319a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g Bomba or Calasparra rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.25 litres hot <strong><em>fumet rojo</em></strong> (red fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">350g salt cod (fillet or loin), cut into 2.5cm chunks (skinned and boned)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <strong><em>picada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">5 blanched almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon flat-leaf parsley, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">12 strands of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 200ºC/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">Put the nuts for the <em>picada</em> on a small tray and roast them in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Prepare the artichokes (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_350">here</a>) and cut each one into 6 pieces, keeping them in a bowl of water acidulated with a squeeze of lemon juice until you are ready to use them.</p>
<p class="method">Make the <em>picada</em> by pounding the roasted nuts with the rest of the ingredients, using a pestle and mortar, until really smooth. You should have about a tablespoon of paste. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a 38cm paella pan, add the chopped garlic cloves and cook for a minute, then add the artichoke pieces and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring frequently over a medium heat. Add the garlic shoots or spring onions and cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring from time to time.</p>
<p class="method">Add the <em>cebolla</em> <em>caramelizada</em> and stir well, then add the <em>picada</em> and stir for about 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="method">Add the rice and stir around for a few minutes to ‘toast’ the rice, taking care not to burn the <em>picada</em>.</p>
<p class="method">Add the hot stock, all in one go, then sprinkle with a pinch of salt and stir. Leave to bubble over a medium heat, and when the stock has reduced by half (about 10 minutes), quickly stir in the pieces of cod and leave to cook undisturbed for 2 more minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Transfer the pan to the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, until the grains of rice are quite dry and still slightly <em>al dente</em>. Remove the pan from the oven, leave to sit for 2 minutes, then serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec132"><a id="pg_349"/>Arroz a la zamorana</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Rice Zamora style</p>
<p class="flush_left">The province of Zamora is in north-west Spain, close to the border with Portugal – a region which couldn’t be further from the rice-producing area of Valencia, where the <em>paella</em> is said to have originated. Nevertheless, they have their regional interpretation, which is all about the pig, and can be a real nose to tail affair. This is a dish that our former chef Roberto’s mother makes regularly at home and she will include any part of the pig she happens to have, from minced pork or sausages to ears, cheeks, trotters or tails, all boiled until tender and then cut into tasty chunks. This version, however, sticks to easily accessible cuts.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, cut into 6–8 chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g pork ribs/chops <strong><em>adobado</em></strong> (i.e. marinated in <strong><em>adobo</em></strong> spice mix, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_398">here</a>), cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g fresh cooking <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong>, sliced into 1cm rounds</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small red pepper or ½ a large one, cut into medium strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small green pepper or ½ a large one, cut into medium strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g Bomba or Calasparra rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml vegetable stock or water</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón de La Vera picante</em></strong> (smoked hot paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g Serrano ham, finely chopped</p>
<p class="method">Ideally, use a wide, flat-bottomed heatproof terracotta dish about 6cm deep or so. You can also use a <em>paella</em> pan or a wide, high-sided casserole.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in the dish, put in the <em>panceta</em> and the ribs and cook until browned on all sides, then add the <em>chorizo</em> slices and fry for 2 minutes. Lift out all the meat and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Now add the chopped onion and garlic and allow to fry gently, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes (remember that if you are using a terracotta dish, it will retain the heat more than a metal or enamel one, so be careful not to burn the ingredients).</p>
<p class="method">Add the strips of red and green pepper, stirring and pushing the vegetables about for a few more minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Now return the meat to the dish, add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes, then add the stock or water and bring to the boil. Add a pinch of salt, the <em>pimentón</em> and the oregano. Allow the rice to bubble gently for about 15 minutes, by which time all the liquid should be absorbed.</p>
<p class="method">Take the dish off the heat and stir in the ham. Cover with foil (or a clean tea towel) for about 4 minutes to retain the heat and finish cooking the upper level of rice grains, before serving.</p>

<p class="quote">‘preparing an artichoke is second nature’</p>
<p class="flush_left">For most Mediterranean home cooks, preparing an artichoke is second nature and in Spain market stalls will be piled high with them in season. Whenever one of my former colleagues at Brindisa, Sandra Jarauta, would return from visiting her family in Navarra, she would bring us wonderful artichokes grown by her mother on their allotment, which she had picked fresh and fried in a light batter that morning – they were just amazing: bursting with flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">The main variety in Spain is the Blanca de Tudela, cultivated in the Ebro valley around Navarra and La Rioja, across Catalunya, the Levante and Andalucía, where the harvest starts in October and lasts until the first frosts. It is small and round, with green-grey leaves which remain open at the top of the flower. They are excellent trimmed and then cooked whole, either grilled on an open fire, steamed or boiled. Then you can peel off the hard outer leaves to get to the inner yellowish-green leaves, whose bases are soft and smooth with a delicate flavour, before you get to the tender, meaty heart, excellent with homemade mayonnaise or melted butter.</p>
<p class="indented">Most Spanish recipes, however, require the artichokes to be cut into four or six pieces, depending on their size, or sliced. First you need to snap off the outer leaves at the base near the stem. Once you get to the lighter-coloured leaves, tidy up the stem by trimming it where the leaves have been snapped off. Next, lay the artichoke on its side, and chop off the top two-thirds of the leaves. Now cut the artichoke into quarters, or into sixths.</p>
<p class="indented">In all but baby artichokes you will see the fuzzy layer of choke above the heart in each section – in small artichokes it will be very small. Take this out with the tip of a knife.</p>
<p class="indented">Either keep the artichokes in quarters, or slice them thinly, depending on the recipe. Whichever you do, put them into a stainless steel, glass or terracotta bowl of water acidulated with lemon juice (3 tablespoons to 1 litre of water) to stop them turning black, until you are ready to use them.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Jarred artichokes</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The texture of an artichoke lends itself very well to cooking/char-grilling and then preserving in jars in brine or olive oil. The Spanish, however, tend not to char-grill them, preferring to allow their pure flavour to come through. Also they usually cook artichokes destined for jarring a little longer than the Italians, who prefer them a little more <em>al dente</em>. As a result they have a softer texture, and are more delicately flavoured.</p>
<p class="indented">Drained of their brine and dressed with lemon juice, oil and salt, they make a good, quick and easy tapa on pieces of toasted bread.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec133"><a id="pg_352"/>Arroz de pollo y conejo con pimentón</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Rice with chicken, rabbit and paprika</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a fine rice dish from Imanol Jaca who supplies us with our wonderful buttery beef, and which he made for me at his gastronomic club, Txoko el Sauco, in San Sebastián, where the men cook, and then the families come to eat. Compared to the layering of some <em>paella</em>s, it was a simple, almost one-dimensional dish – quite macho really: just meat, rice and copious amounts of paprika, but very, very tasty. While we have remained true to his macho aesthetic, we have added another dimension, using the heart, liver and kidneys of the rabbit to make a <em>picada</em>, which in this part of Spain would be known as a <em>majada</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Imanol likes to spread out the rice in the <em>paella</em> to keep it very shallow (2cm maximum) so although this recipe is for 4, he uses a pan that would be big enough to serve 8 people.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 rabbit saddles, cut into 8 pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 rabbit legs</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rabbit head, cut into 2 pieces (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 chicken thighs</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 chicken drumsticks</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 level teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (mild paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 10 threads of saffron, infused in 4 tablespoons warm water</p>
<p class="ingredients">a sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">380g Bomba rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">800ml warm <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (dark chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">salt</p>
<p class="forhead">For the <strong><em>picada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil, plus a little more if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rabbit heart</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rabbit liver</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 rabbit kidneys</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 <strong><em>ñora</em></strong> pepper (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_280">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons chicken stock (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_352">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>picada</em>, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a small frying pan. Crush the garlic cloves, still in their skins, and put them into the pan, then take it off the heat and tilt it, so that the cloves cook in deep oil without running the risk of burning. The reason for cooking the garlic this way is that the irregular shapes develop more complex garlic flavours. When the cloves have cooled a little, remove any remaining dry skin and transfer to a mortar with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p class="method">Put the pan of oil back on the heat, then add the rabbit heart, liver and kidneys and fry well for 5–10 minutes, breaking up the liver if necessary to make sure it is cooked well through and will crumble easily, as its powdery consistency is an essential quality of the <em>picada</em>. Lift out all the <a id="pg_353"/>offal and keep to one side, leaving any remaining oil in the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Crush the garlic and salt in the mortar with the pestle, and when it is creamy add the kidneys and gently work them into the paste. Use your fingers to separate the lobes of the liver and remove any gristly bits, then add the lobes to the mortar and continue to pound. Add the heart and pound a bit more. Again, remove any gristly bits. The finished paste should have the consistency of pâté.</p>
<p class="method">Cut the stalk from the <em>ñora</em> pepper and remove the seeds, breaking the pepper into 2 or 3 large pieces. Heat the oil in the pan again, adding a drop more if necessary, then add the <em>ñora</em> and tilt the pan in the same way as for the garlic earlier, so that the pepper fries in the deeper oil for just a few seconds, otherwise its thin skin will burn. It should just turn crisp and the flesh white. Take off the heat and clear a space at the bottom of the mortar so that there is a hard surface on which to pound the <em>ñora</em>. Crush it, piece by piece, gradually blending it into the paste, until all the <em>ñora</em> has been incorporated. Don’t worry if there are flakes of skin left in, as the <em>picada</em> will be passed through a sieve.</p>
<p class="method">Return the pan of oil to the heat one last time, add the parsley and cook until crisp, then blend into the paste. Add the 3 tablespoons of stock to the <em>picada</em>, to give it the consistency of a thick soup, then pass through a coarse sieve into a bowl, in order to remove any flakes of <em>ñora</em> skin and any stray bits of connective tissue. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">To start the dish, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large <em>paella</em> pan (46cm if you have one, otherwise 38cm). Add the rabbit (and the head, if using, cut in half lengthways) and chicken pieces and brown well over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the skin is crisp and toffee-coloured on all sides.</p>
<p class="method">Make a space in the centre of the pan and heat another tablespoon of olive oil, then add the paprika, saffron, with its soaking water, and thyme and take the pan off the heat, to make sure the paprika doesn’t burn and turn bitter. Stir quickly for a minute, then mix the chicken and rabbit pieces into the red-coloured oil, making sure they are well coated.</p>
<p class="method">Add the rice and stir well, again making sure each grain is coated with oil. Ladle in the chicken stock in a circular motion until the level reaches just below the handle studs.</p>
<p class="method">Bring to a fast boil for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to a simmer, taste and season with salt as necessary. Add the <em>picada,</em> sprinkling it around into the stock.</p>
<p class="method">Simmer for 11 minutes, then test the grains of rice around the edge of the pan. The finished texture needs to be just <em>al dente</em>, so if it looks like the stock is going to evaporate before the rice is cooked, add another ladleful.</p>
<p class="method">If you like a <em>socarrat</em> (crunchy crust) to form on the base of the pan, turn up the heat for a few seconds at the end of the cooking time, until you begin to hear a crackling sound and start to smell gently toasted rice.</p>
<p class="method">Take the rice off the heat and let it rest for 4 minutes, covered with foil or a clean tea towel. This will allow the rice to absorb any excess liquid but leave the centre moist.</p>

<p class="panel-title"><a id="pg_354"/>Gastronomy and Trade Societies and Clubs</p>
<p class="flush_left">The north of Spain, particularly the Basque country, is known for its often sophisticated cooking, which is related to that of the nearby region of Biarritz. Aristocrats would often spend some of the summer season at these seaside spa resorts, and those who cooked for them (mostly women) would take their knowledge of haute cuisine home with them and apply it to local ingredients. While in the largely matriarchal society the women ran the domestic arrangements, the men set up <em>txokos,</em> gastronomic clubs, where they would gather to cook (the word <em>txoko</em> means a small space or corner and is often also used for a den or cellar in the home). Only through knowing an existing member would you be allowed to join the <em>txokos</em>, which are places of great camaraderie, yet usually pretty macho, competitive environments, in which the communal kitchen is inevitably brilliantly equipped with big ovens, big burners and <em>planchas</em>, with every conceivable knife and pan housed in specially made shelves.</p>
<p class="indented">Each society has its own rules. Some don’t allow wives, girl-friends or families in at all; in others the men cook together on a Sunday and then join their families in the dining room, where every-one eats together outside the forbidden bastion of the kitchen. In areas where people live in flats with quite small kitchens, this must still be quite a practical answer to feeding large families for the traditional Sunday meal.</p>
<p class="indented">In San Sebastián our meat supplier, Imanol Jaca, cooked for us at his club, Txoko el Sauco, where each member had their own locker, and there was a communal stock of wine and key store-cupboard ingredients, with each member being trusted to write down what they had used on a chit. Imanol laid our table with cloths and school-style cutlery and served his wonderful rice dish with rabbit and chicken. I think on this occasion the women were allowed in after the meal to clean up!</p>

<p class="panel-title"><a id="pg_355"/>The Pots of Zamora</p>

<p class="flush_left">When we opened Casa Brindisa in South Kensington, the space felt so like a house with its different rooms and levels that I thought this was the chance I had been waiting for, to fill one of our restaurants with some of the beautiful old <em>arcilla</em> (clay) cooking pots, jars and jugs, hand-made by the local women of the villages of the Zamora region. If you are lucky you can find wonderful ancient, traditional and collectable decorative pots – enormous, many of them – in local antique markets and shops, each with a specific purpose. There might be <em>ollas</em> or <em>pucheros</em> (different names for stew-pots), <em>barriles</em> (ceramic urns for wine storage)<em>, barrilas</em> (double-handled water-carriers used by workers in the field)<em>, cantimploras</em> (water bottles), <em>botijos</em> (drinking jugs), <em>cántaros</em> (pouring vessels) and <em>tinajas</em> (jars) or <em>jarrones</em> (shaped like a vase) that were once used to store meat preserved in silky white pork fat.</p>
<p class="indented">Rupert, our cheese-maker friend, Félix Pastor (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_432">here</a>) and his friend Ramón, a ceramicist and collector, set off to scour Zamora and the surrounding villages of Moveros de Aliste, Carbellino de Sayago, Pereruela and Toro. After ten days Rupert arrived home with the car packed with antique vessels and a story to tell about each one. I love those pots. They make a real connection between the ingredients of the region that we have come to know at Brindisa and the local families who once used them.</p>
<p class="indented">Such pots are still made in the villages of the region in the traditional way. They are fashioned by <em>alfareras</em> (women craft potters), while the men are delegated the jobs of stacking firewood, preparing the ovens and collecting the local clay, which gives beautiful tones of biscuit ranging through to fudge, depending on where a piece has sat in the kiln. The pots include the famous <em>cazuelas</em>, the terracotta-coloured dishes which are glazed inside and can be used on the hob or in the oven, as well as other traditional pieces, still made to the old shapes, and more contemporary styles which are often more decorative than practical.</p>
<p class="indented">Especially beautiful are the pieces from Moveros de Aliste, where there is still a communal oven in the middle of the village, dating back to Arab times, fired with rock rose and heather woods. In the face of competition from ceramic factories, the village community is still optimistic that by holding firm to the ancient roots of their craft, their pottery can flourish on its reputation.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec134"><a id="pg_357"/>Arroz con costillas y morcilla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Rice with pork ribs and black pudding</p>
<p class="flush_left">This was one of our earliest recipes for the Shoreditch restaurant. We started out with only rice dishes made with fish and then felt that, especially in winter, people would also like the choice of some more hearty, sustaining dishes, with a generous dose of pork – and this one, created by our head chef, Nico Modad, is exceptional. Preferably make it with Ibérico pork ribs, but otherwise use the best ribs you can find that have tasty nuggets of meat on them. In the finished dish they will emerge from the rice a bit like the circle at Stonehenge.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 good pork ribs, preferably Ibérico</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium onions, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium red pepper, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong>, peeled and sliced (2cm pieces)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a sprig of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1–2 teaspoons sugar, if necessary, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">360g Bomba rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 litres hot <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (dark chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="method">Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a 38cm <em>paella</em> pan, tilting the pan to ensure the oil covers the surface as far as possible, put in the ribs and brown them on all sides, then lift them out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Add 3 more tablespoons of olive oil to the pan, and, keeping it on a low heat, add the onions and garlic and cook gently until the onion is translucent. Add the red pepper and stir and coat well in the oil, adding another tablespoon if necessary, then season with a pinch of salt and cook very gently for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add a quarter of the <em>morcilla</em>, along with the thyme, and continue to cook gently for a further 10 minutes. Add the reserved ribs and stir and coat them in the ingredients in the pan for about 4 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">Add the tomatoes, stir well and bring to the boil, then taste and if necessary add 1 or 2 teaspoons of sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes. Turn the heat down and simmer for another 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens to the consistency of a runny jam.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_358"/>Add the rice and stir until the grains are well coated. Stir in 2 ladlefuls of the hot stock and the paprika, then ladle in around 1 litre of the stock in a circular motion until it reaches just below the handle studs. Bring the stock to a fast boil, taste the liquid and adjust for salt if necessary. After 5 minutes push the reserved ribs into the <em>paella</em> and lower the heat to a simmer for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the remaining <em>morcilla</em> on the rice in a decorative pattern, then add another ladleful of stock, sprinkling it in as before, in a circular motion, working in from the edges of the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Simmer for a further 2 minutes – the <em>morcilla</em> will begin to break up – then transfer to the preheated oven for a final 4 minutes. During this time the <em>morcilla</em> will cook through, and any excess stock should have reduced, leaving the rice moist and dark and the top slightly crisped.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the oven and gently stir the <em>morcilla</em> through the rice before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe-panel"><a id="pg_359"/>MELOSOS</p>
<p class="recipe-panel-sub">Risotto-like rice dishes</p>
<p class="method">These are much stickier than <em>paellas</em> and are made with either Bomba rice or an Italian risotto rice such as Carnaroli, which is now grown in Spain. As in a risotto, the stock is added ladleful by ladleful, letting the rice absorb it before adding more, but there is no butter and cheese beaten in at the end.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec135">Meloso de arroz negro con calamar</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Black rice with squid</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a long-standing favourite at our Borough tapas bar that we can’t take off the menu. It is served in terracotta bowls and the colours are wonderful: black-stained grains of rice, on a copper background with the straw-coloured squid on top.</p>
<p class="indented">Any of this that you have left over makes a wonderful stuffing for <em>piquillo</em> peppers as a tapa (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_276">here</a>).</p>

<p class="ingredients">200g <strong><em>alioli</em></strong>, to serve (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_136">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Heat a little olive oil in a large pan, add the onion and the chopped squid and cook briefly until they colour, then add the rice and the squid ink and stir well. Add the hot stock a ladleful at a time, stirring in and waiting for each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next one. Cook in this way for 15–20 minutes, until the rice is still <em>al dente</em>, but quite creamy, like a risotto.</p>
<p class="indented">Meanwhile, preheat the grill until very hot. Open out the squid tubes and with a sharp knife make diagonal scores on them one way and then the other (taking care not to cut all the way through), to give a criss-cross effect. Put under the grill for 4–5 minutes. They will probably curl, so turn them until they are golden all over. Serve on top of the rice, with the <em>alioli</em> alongside.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Creamy wild mushroom rice</p>
<p class="flush_left">This dish was created by Josep Carbonell, Brindisa’s executive chef. We make it with Carnaroli rice, grown on the Illa de Riu estate in Tarragona.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g wild mushrooms, sliced chunkily</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g Bomba or Carnaroli rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">800–850ml hot vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="forhead">For the picada</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 <strong><em>ñora</em></strong> or other mild dried pepper, de-seeded (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 mini breadsticks or ½ a slice of white bread, crust cut off</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>picada</em>, soak the <em>ñora</em>, if using, in hot water. Once softened, scrape the flesh from the skin and set aside. Heat the oil in a pan, put in the garlic and fry gently until golden-yellow, then lift out and keep to one side. If using bread, add it to the same pan and fry until golden in the same oil, then remove and also keep to one side. Put the reserved garlic into a mortar with the breadsticks, or fried bread, and the rest of the ingredients, and grind to a very smooth paste. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a deep-sided frying pan, add the garlic and mushrooms and cook lightly for 3–4 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the rice and stir for a minute. Add the hot stock a little at a time, stirring constantly so the rice can release some starch and thicken the stock. During 10 minutes of cooking you should have added half the stock.</p>
<p class="method">Add the <em>picada</em>, saffron and salt and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring and adding the rest of the stock until the consistency is creamy. Serve in soup dishes.</p>

<p class="recipe-panel"><a id="pg_362"/>CALDOSOS</p>
<p class="recipe-panel-sub">Soupy rice dishes</p>
<p class="flush_left">These are the soupiest of all rice dishes, served in deep bowls so that the rice is only just visible beneath the level of the soupy stock.</p>
<p class="indented">Though traditionally <em>caldosos</em> would be made with Bomba rice, again you can use the Italian Carnaroli, as it releases more starch but absorbs the liquid less.</p>
<p class="indented">The important thing with a <em>caldoso</em> is the timing: when it is just <em>al dente</em> and only a tiny dot of starch remains inside each grain, you need to take the dish off the heat and eat it straight away, as if you leave it for any length of time, the rice will carry on absorbing liquid and the dish will lose its essential soupiness.</p>
<p class="indented">Beware leaving the table for a moment in a restaurant specialising in <em>caldoso</em>, as if the chef has cooked the rice to the point of perfection he won’t be amused if you are not ready to eat it immediately.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec137">Caldoso de langosta</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Soupy lobster rice</p>
<p class="flush_left">When we opened the doors of our Shoreditch restaurant, this was one of the most popular dishes on the menu. One of our neighbours loved it so much he came and ate it twice a week for about two months. It is similar to the Menorcan <em>caldereta</em>, made with spiny lobster, which we have enjoyed so many times on the island.</p>
<p class="indented">If you prefer not to use lobster you could use 8 langoustines instead.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">2–3 prepared lobsters (allow 500g per person)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium red pepper, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g cuttlefish, finely chopped into 1cm pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large tomato, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little sugar to taste, if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ of a sachet of squid ink</p>
<p class="ingredients">360g Bomba rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 litres warm <strong><em>fumet blanco</em></strong> (white fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="forhead">For the picada</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 threads of saffron, toasted in a dry pan</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_363"/>Cut each lobster in half lengthways and remove the claws. Wrap them in a tea towel in case of flying shards, and crack the shells with a hammer or the handle of a heavy knife. Cut each lobster tail into four pieces and leave the rest of the lobster uncleaned.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a large pan or ceramic dish and fry the lobster tail and claws quickly for a minute on each side, so that their juices flavour the oil. Lift out and reserve. Add the onions, red pepper and garlic, together with a pinch of salt, and cook steadily for 15 minutes, until the onion is translucent and just beginning to turn a light golden brown.</p>
<p class="method">Add the cuttlefish and fry for 10 minutes, allowing any liquid it releases to bubble up until the pan is almost dry. Add the grated tomato and let the mixture simmer for a further 20 minutes. Taste, and if the tomato is too acidic add a little sugar.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, pound all the ingredients for the <em>picada</em> together, using a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p class="method">Add the squid ink and a tablespoon of the <em>picada</em> to the pan, stirring briefly to heat through, then put in the rice and stir thoroughly for 1 minute, ensuring each grain is coated. Now begin adding 400ml of the warm <em>fumet blanco</em>. Let the rice simmer quickly until the stock is almost all absorbed, then continue to add more stock by the ladleful for another 6 minutes. Don’t stir, as the dish should have the consistency of soup and if it is stirred, the grains will begin to break up.</p>
<p class="method">In between adding the ladlefuls of stock, scoop out the creamy green liquid from the lobster’s thorax and add it to the pan. It will dissolve and flavour the rice.</p>
<p class="method">Return the lobster pieces to the soup, ensuring they are covered with the <em>fumet</em>, and keep on a steady fast simmer for another 6 minutes. Taste the rice regularly, to see how quickly it is cooking. It should take 16–18 minutes in all, and when you estimate that there are about 2 minutes to go, stir in another tablespoon of the <em>picada</em>.</p>
<p class="method">Check the rice again. It should be just <em>al dente</em> – bite a grain in half and you should see just a tiny pinprick of white at the core of the grain. Take the pan off the heat and leave to rest for a minute. Sprinkle with the parsley and season to taste with a pinch of sea salt and a twist of black pepper.</p>
<p class="method">Serve immediately, as the rice will continue to cook in the hot soup.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Soupy rice with artichokes, cuttlefish and prawns</p>
<p class="flush_left">Many of the dishes from the Levante coast have a generous amount of vegetables, which gives them a certain lightness. Our friend Pilar, of Gutiérrez de la Vega wines in Alicante (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>), insists on using smaller amounts of onion and tomato than many Spanish cooks, so that the other flavours in the dish can find their way to the forefront, and I love this <em>caldoso</em> that she makes with two kinds of seafood, artichokes and peas, finished with a superb stock.</p>
<p class="indented">In season you can add fresh broad beans. If they are big, Pilar suggests peeling them, but this isn’t essential.</p>
<p class="indented">If, when you buy the fish for the stock, the liver of the cuttlefish is intact, keep it and add about a third of it to the dish, as it gives another layer of flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">Choose deep wide bowls to serve it in, as there will be lots of wonderful soupy stock, and serve some good bread with it, to soak this up.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 large artichokes or 8 small ones</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 ripe medium tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">120g cuttlefish or squid, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 litres warm <strong><em>fumet blanco</em></strong> (white fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_466b">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g peas, podded</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g broad beans (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g Bomba or Carnaroli rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon cuttlefish liver (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g small prawns, peeled</p>
<p class="method">Prepare the artichokes (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_350">here</a>), and chop each one into 8 pieces (into 4 if small). Put into a bowl of water acidulated with some lemon juice to stop them discolouring.</p>
<p class="method">Either grate the tomatoes or, if you prefer a smoother, more elegant texture, de-skin and de-seed them (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_206">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Heat a tablespoon of oil in a deep pan. Put in the cuttlefish or squid, fry for a few minutes, until it turns white, then remove and reserve. Put the artichoke pieces into the pan and cook for about 3 minutes, just to soften them, then remove and set aside.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the rest of the oil in the same pan and add the shallot and garlic, then the tomato. Cook gently over a low heat for about 10 minutes, until the onion is soft but not coloured. Add half the warm <em>fumet</em> and the saffron and bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add the peas and beans, if using, to the pan. Then add the rice and the rest of the <em>fumet</em>, the salt, reserved cuttlefish and the cuttlefish liver, if using. Add the artichokes and continue to cook for another 14 minutes. Stir a little occasionally to release the starch in the rice. Finally, add the peeled prawns and cook for a further 3 minutes, or until the rice is tender but still has some bite and the stock has reduced by about half.</p>
<p class="method">Serve immediately so that the rice doesn’t absorb any more stock.</p>

<p class="flush_left"><a id="pg_367"/>Particularly in Catalunya and all along the Levante coast, there is quite a tradition of using pasta, possibly because the Catalans ruled Sicily in medieval times and there would inevitably have been an exchange of ideas. So when I first began living in Catalunya I shouldn’t really have been surprised to see <em>macarrones</em> and <em>canelones</em> (macaroni and cannelloni) being enjoyed in homes and restaurants – originally these were created as a way of using up the meats left over from a big family meal, of roast chicken or even <em>escudella</em> (stew, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_447">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Cannelloni was actually made fashionable by an Italian chef at the Barcelona restaurant Rossini in La Vila de Gràcia, who made <em>cannelloni a la Rossini</em>, named after the composer and great food lover in the 1920s (the dish is still served today), and it has passed into the Catalan cooking tradition. Cannelloni followed by roast chicken is a popular Sunday lunch.</p>
<p class="indented">Pasta was first introduced to Spain by the Moors around the eighth to ninth centuries. It was called <em>aletria</em> and appeared in the first Catalan cookbook, published in 1323, <em>Llibre de Sent Soví</em>. In fact, the name is still used in Murcia in a pasta dish called <em>costillejas con aletria</em>, made with thick noodles and pork.</p>
<p class="indented">Less well known outside Spain is the thin pasta known as <em>fideos</em> (<em>fideus</em> in Catalan), originally a Moorish pasta whose name comes from the Arab word <em>fada</em> (meaning abundance), and which appeared in Catalunya as early as 1429. It can be added to soups, but is more typically used in the same way as the rice in an <em>arroz seco</em> and with the same combinations of ingredients, from seafood and chicken to pork and sausages. Usually the pasta is toasted in a dry pan for about 3 minutes or lightly baked in the oven (at 180°C/gas 4 for about 5 minutes) until it turns golden before cooking.</p>
<p class="indented">Whereas the Italian way of cooking dried pasta is to plunge it into masses of boiling water in which it can swirl around, <em>fideos</em> goes into hot stock – and not much of it – so that the pasta absorbs the flavours and becomes completely coated in the stock from the beginning. Then, in a similar way to the rice in a hob-cooked <em>arroz seco</em>, it is allowed to become a little crusty on the base of a pan. At the end of cooking you take the pan off the heat and put a damp cloth over the top, again as you would do with an <em>arroz</em>, and the extraordinary thing is that the moistness pulls up the little pasta ‘hairs’ so they stand on end, giving an intriguing spiky look.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Fideos</em> comes in various diameters, the finest being similar to angel hair pasta and the thickest almost like macaroni. The finest are most likely to be added to light stock soups, such as <em>sopa cubierta</em>, or ‘cupboard soup’, which is like a minestrone and is a household staple in Valencia. For <em>fideu</em>à with seafood I would recommend the sizes No. 1 or No. 2, broken into short pieces, as the larger diameter ones (No. 3) can look clumsy and suit meat versions much better.</p>
<p class="indented">Like <em>paella,</em> <em>fideuà</em> is a dish that has often been very badly represented in tourist resorts, but done well it is elegant, delicious and a little lighter than a <em>paella</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">I have included two versions here which, though they may appear to have similar ingredients, are actually incredibly different. The first is a quite substantial, garlicky, vibrant dish made with prawn stock and Cognac; the second is a much lighter, more subtle and seductively delicate affair.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec139"><a id="pg_368"/>Fideuà Casta Diva</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Fideus</em> with seafood, spinach and fennel</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a delicate, very original version of <em>fideuà</em> from Pilar Sapena, whose husband Felipe makes the beautiful Casta Diva wines in Alicante (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>). It is a dish typical of Pilar’s imaginative cooking: light, balanced and delicate, with the unusual addition of spinach and fennel fronds.</p>
<p class="indented">Pilar always buys her fish whole, and uses all the trimmings to make her stock, but in Spain there is also a way of shopping for ingredients that is known as ‘<em>muy señorito</em>’. It means ‘gentlemanly’, indicating you don’t get your hands dirty, because the fish, or meat, will be cleaned and prepared for you – I would say go for this option, and ask your fishmonger to do the work for you.</p>
<p class="indented">You need 700g of fish and shellfish in all – the proportions below are Pilar’s suggestions, but you can vary it according to what you can find that is good and fresh.</p>
<p class="indented">Pilar serves this with <em>alioli</em> to mix in as you eat, but she makes an interesting variation by cooking a small potato and mashing it into the <em>alioli</em>, which, she says, softens the garlic and also adds some texture.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4–6</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g <strong><em>fideu</em></strong> No. 1 or No. 2</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g monkfish or sea bream fillets, cut into pieces about 2cm square</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g cuttlefish, chopped, or baby cuttlefish, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g small prawns, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">2–4 of the largest prawns you can find, kept in their shells</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g red mullet fillet</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a green pepper, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium onion, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 1 teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.8 litres hot <strong><em>fumet rojo</em></strong> (red fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">40g baby spinach (or chopped large leaves)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the picada</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 whole <strong><em>ñora</em></strong> pepper, seeds and stalk discarded</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">10 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons chopped fennel fronds</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons <strong><em>fumet</em></strong> (from quantity above), if needed</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients"><strong><em>alioli</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_136">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Have ready a large tray or plate for putting the cooked ingredients on as you go, keeping each one separate.</p>
<p class="method">Put a 38cm <em>paella</em> pan on a low to medium heat. Add the pasta and spread it out thinly over the pan, stirring and turning it for 3 minutes to stop it burning, until it ‘toasts’, i.e. turns golden brown. Turn out into a bowl and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in the pan, add the monkfish or sea bream and sauté for about 4 minutes, turning with tongs, to ensure it has browned a little on all sides, then remove from the pan to your tray or plate. Next, add the cuttlefish to the pan, along with the <em>ñora</em> pepper. The <em>ñora</em> is going to go into the <em>picada</em>, but needs to be briefly fried first, so it makes sense to do it now. As soon as the <em>ñora</em> flesh turns white or chars, take it out, or it will become bitter, and put into the mortar ready to make the <em>picada</em>. Allow the cuttlefish to cook for another 4 minutes, then move the pieces to the edge of the pan where it is cooler. Turn down the heat, add another tablespoon of oil to the centre of the pan, and when it is hot put in both the peeled and unpeeled prawns and sauté for a minute on each side. Stir the prawns and cuttlefish together, then lift out and add to your tray or plate in a separate mound.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_370"/>Finally, heat another tablespoon of oil, if necessary, put in the red mullet and fry for a minute on each side, then lift out and add to the tray or plate. Scrape any crisp bits of fish from the base of the pan to avoid burning, then add another tablespoon of oil. Put in the green pepper, stir for 30 seconds, turn down the heat to medium, and cook for another 4 minutes until browned and beginning to caramelise. Lift out and keep to one side, taking the pan off the heat.</p>
<p class="method">To make the <em>picada</em>, crush the garlic cloves with the flat of a knife. Return the pan to the heat and add the oil. Put in the garlic cloves and fry for a minute, tilting the pan, so that they cook in a depth of oil, and removing the pieces of skin as they separate from the cloves. Lift out, chop and put into the mortar. Put the saffron into the pan in a small pile, then take the pan from the heat to stop the threads from burning. As soon as they start to release their aroma, lift them out with a teaspoon and add to the mortar. Take the pan off the heat, but keep to one side for use again in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Add a pinch of salt to the <em>ñora</em>, garlic and saffron in the mortar. Crush with the pestle, then add the parsley and the fennel fronds and continue to work everything into a paste. Add the grated tomato. The <em>picada</em> should have the consistency of a thick soup. If you need to loosen it some more, add a tablespoon or two of <em>fumet</em>. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Heat another tablespoon of oil in the <em>paella</em> pan and add the chopped onion, along with the bay leaf (lightly crushed first in your fingertips). Cook gently, until soft but not coloured, for about 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Add the reserved green pepper and pasta and the paprika and stir together over a high heat. When the mixture begins to sizzle, add around 850ml of the stock, a ladleful at a time, in a circular motion around the edge of the pan until the level is just below the studs that connect the handles. Add the spinach and let the pasta boil vigorously for 1 minute before turning the heat down to a steady simmer. Add the <em>picada</em> in tablespoonfuls so that it is well spread out throughout the pan. Add another 200ml of stock and stir gently. Taste and add a little salt if necessary. Let the pasta simmer for 5 minutes, testing regularly until the <em>fideu</em> is cooked, but still <em>al dente</em>, with the strands around the edges becoming crisp and dry, and most of the stock has been absorbed or evaporated.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the reserved pieces of fish and seafood decoratively in a circle around the <em>paella</em> pan and cook for a further 3 minutes, until these are cooked through. To finish off, rotate the pan off-centre, so that any wobbly areas which are holding too much liquid around the edge can cook through, too (remember that <em>paella</em> pans are big, and the centre will always be hotter than the edges).</p>
<p class="method">When a light crackling sound emerges from the pan it means that the crusty base is just beginning to form and that it is time to take the pan off the heat and cover it with a clean tea towel for 4 minutes. The trapped steam allows the top layer of pasta to steam and dry a little more, and the pasta will curl upwards.</p>
<p class="method">Serve with the <em>alioli</em> to mix in as you eat.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec140"><a id="pg_371"/>Fideuà bandera</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Fideus</em> with prawns and cuttlefish</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is based on a recipe from one of my oldest friends and my first boss in Catalunya, Pepa Salvador, who ran La Salsita restaurant on the Costa Brava. <em>Fideuà</em> is something we never cooked at La Salsita, because so many other restaurants around the coast served it, and Pepa always wanted her menus to be a little different, but in the 1980s she and her husband, Sergi Medir, and brother Oriol built their own boat, a beautiful schooner called <em>Pepa Bandera I</em>, which Sergi and Oriol sailed around Cape Horn and the islands of Chile, and on to the Galapagos and the Arctic Circle, before returning home through the Panama Canal. Pepa would close the restaurant in the low season to join them and she found <em>fideuà</em> to be a perfect one-pan dish to cook in the galley or out on deck.</p>
<p class="indented">She makes her <em>fumet rojo</em> (red fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468">here</a>) in advance, then enriches it by making an extra little stock with the heads and shells of the small prawns she has peeled for the <em>fideuà</em>, plus a generous amount of Cognac.</p>
<p class="indented">Pepa’s local port is Palamós in the Empordà, and she has the luxury of being able to select the famous local large, deep pink prawns, <em>gambas de Palamós,</em> which are brought in on the day boats. These are so outstanding, they are always eaten on their own or used, shell-on, to adorn <em>fideuà</em> or rice dishes, so while Pepa uses smaller prawns to mix into the pasta, she arranges these big ones on top so the dish looks stunning. In the UK it isn’t so easy to find the equivalent, so when we make the dish at home we use tiger prawns throughout. We buy them shell on, so we can still use the shells for the stock.</p>
<p class="indented">When Pepa made this <em>fideuà</em> for us she served it with <em>alioli</em> and a simple leaf salad. As is her custom, Pepa first put some finely chopped sweet young onions into the bottom of the salad bowl to marinate in oil and vinegar for a while before putting in the leaves and tossing the oniony vinaigrette through them.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4–6</p>
<p class="ingredients">30 tiger prawns, shell on</p>
<p class="ingredients">5–7 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml Cognac</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5 litres hot <strong><em>fumet rojo</em></strong> (red fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves of garlic, skin on</p>
<p class="ingredients">700g cuttlefish, cleaned and cut into 2cm squares</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 2 medium tomatoes, grated (you need about 150g of pulp)</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g <strong><em>fideus</em></strong> No. 1 or No. 2</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients"><strong><em>alioli</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_136">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Remove the heads and shells from 20 of the prawns and reserve the tails in a bowl in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method">Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over a high heat and put in the heads and shells. Stir with tongs, pressing the heads to get as much juice out as possible, then turn down the heat and cook for 4 minutes, continuing to stir and press.</p>
<p class="method">Turn up the heat again, so that the shells begin to sizzle and release their aroma, then move the pan off the direct heat and add the Cognac. Stand away from the pan, as there is a lot of alcohol and it may well ignite. Put the pan back on a low heat and let it bubble and reduce until almost all the liquid has evaporated.</p>
<p class="method">Add the hot <em>fumet,</em> bring to the boil and skim off any foam from the surface. After a couple of minutes of boiling, take the pan off the heat and leave the shells to infuse in the stock for another 5 minutes. Don’t leave it longer, as the shells can start to release sulphurous flavours.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pan, pressing the shells with the back of a spoon <a id="pg_372"/>as you do so, to release every last drop of tasty juice. Keep the enriched stock hot on the hob.</p>
<p class="method">Crush 3 of the garlic cloves, still in their skins, with the flat of a knife. Heat 3 more tablespoons of oil in a 40cm <em>paella</em> pan (or larger), put in the garlic and stir for a minute, then put in the peeled and unpeeled prawns – spread them out well, so that they have space to fry for a minute on each side until coloured (if you overcrowd them, the temperature will lower and they will boil). Remove the prawns and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Add the cuttlefish to the pan and stir to coat in the oil (you may need to add another couple of tablespoons). Sauté over a high heat until translucent.</p>
<p class="method">Add the tomato and 150ml of the reserved stock and bring to the boil. Turn down to a simmer for another 10 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by about half – this may take a bit longer if the cuttlefish release water (this can happen especially if they have been previously frozen). When the cuttlefish are tender, transfer the mixture to a bowl and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Crush the remaining garlic clove in the same way as before. Wipe out the <em>paella</em> pan with kitchen paper and put it back on a low to medium heat. Add the pasta, together with the crushed garlic, and spread it out thinly over the pan, stirring and turning it for 3 minutes to stop it burning, until it ‘toasts’, i.e. turns golden brown.</p>
<p class="method">Add the saffron and continue to toast for another minute.</p>
<p class="method">Add the reserved cuttlefish and tomato mixture, turn up the heat and stir continuously for a minute, then begin adding the hot enriched stock a ladleful at a time in a circular motion around the edge of the pan until the level is just below the studs of the handles (around 850ml to 1 litre). Keep some stock in reserve in case the <em>fideuà</em> becomes dry. With a spoon, make sure the ingredients are spread evenly around the <em>paella</em> pan, then don’t stir it again. Turn up the heat and boil fast for a minute, then turn down to a simmer for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Push in the reserved peeled prawns and arrange the unpeeled ones like the spokes of a wheel on top (tails pointing inwards). Add more stock if necessary, and continue to cook for another 3 minutes, until the <em>fideu</em> is cooked, but still <em>al dente</em>, with the strands around the edges becoming crisp and dry, and most of the stock has been absorbed or evaporated.</p>
<p class="method">When you hear a light crackling sound it means that the crusty base is just beginning to form and that it is time to take the pan off the heat and cover it with a clean tea towel for 4 minutes. The trapped steam allows the top layer of pasta to steam and dry a little more and the pasta will curl upwards.</p>
<p class="method">Serve with the <em>alioli</em> – which should be mixed in as you eat.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec141"><a id="pg_373"/>Cassola de fideus</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Fideus</em> with Catalan sausage and Ibérico pork ribs</p>
<p class="flush_left">This meaty <em>fideu</em>à, made with a fatter <em>fideu</em> (sometimes called <em>perla</em>) and rich with hearty stock and tasty meats, is more of an inland dish, which I often enjoyed when I lived in Vic, Catalunya. Our head chef, Leo, whose family are from an inland village near Manresa, put this version on the menu in our South Kensington tapas bar and restaurant, and it is especially popular in the winter. I like it with Savoy cabbage.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Vi ranci</em> is a traditional Catalan ingredient. Literally ‘rancid wine’, it is fortified wine made from white or red grapes that is allowed to oxidise as it ages. It can be drunk like a dessert wine if you dare, or used in cooking. It isn’t easy to find in the UK, so you can substitute a dry or <em>amontillado</em> sherry.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">160g <strong><em>fideu</em></strong>, No. 3 (or <strong><em>perla</em></strong>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 pork or Ibérico pork ribs (ask your butcher to cut them in half)</p>
<p class="ingredients">plain flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 large, fat sausages such as <strong><em>botifarra</em></strong>, or good-quality Toulouse sausages, cut into chunky pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 small onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 ripe tomato, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sugar, if necessary (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml <strong><em>vi ranci</em></strong> or <strong><em>palo cortado</em></strong> or <strong><em>amontillado</em></strong> sherry</p>
<p class="ingredients">750ml hot <strong><em>caldo de pollo</em></strong> (chicken stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the picada</p>
<p class="ingredients">10g blanched, unsalted almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">10g blanched hazelnuts, in their skins</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 threads of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 heaped tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="method">First toast the <em>fideu</em>. Put a 38cm <em>paella</em> pan on a low to medium heat, add the pasta and spread it out thinly, stirring and turning it for 3 minutes to stop it burning, until it ‘toasts’, i.e. turns golden brown. Turn out into a bowl and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Dust the ribs with flour. Heat the oil in the <em>paella</em> pan. Fry the ribs until well browned, then remove from the pan; put in the sausages and fry them until they colour. Lift out and set aside with the ribs. Put the garlic into the pan, then add the onions and fry gently for a few minutes until softened but not coloured. Add the grated tomato and cook for 10 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Taste, and add the sugar if the tomatoes are too acidic.</p>
<p class="method">Put the ribs and sausages back into the pan, add the <em>vi ranci</em> or sherry and cook for 1 minute before adding the hot stock, a ladleful at a time, in a circular motion around the edge of the pan until the level is just below the studs of the handles. Bring to the boil, then add the <em>fideu</em> and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">While the <em>fideu</em> is cooking, make the <em>picada</em>. Crush the nuts in a pestle and mortar. Heat a dry pan and briefly toast the saffron, then add it to the nuts with the parsley and grind to a paste.</p>
<p class="method">Once the <em>fideu</em> is soft but still a little <em>al dente</em>, scatter the <em>picada</em> over the surface, stir in and cook gently for 2 minutes, until the stock has reduced and coats the ingredients generously.</p>
<p class="method">To finish off, rotate the pan off-centre, so that any wobbly areas which are holding too much liquid around the edge can cook through too (remember that <em>paella</em> pans are big, and the centre will always be hotter than the edges).</p>
<p class="method">When a light crackling sound emerges from the pan it means that the crusty base is just beginning to form and that it is time to take the pan off the heat and to cover it with a clean tea towel for 4 minutes. The trapped steam allows the top layer of pasta to steam and dry a little more, and the pasta will curl upwards, giving the dish its spiky look.</p>

<p class="flush_left"><a id="pg_375"/>On a visit to the Villarejo dairy in Castilla La Mancha, from which we buy one of our Manchego cheeses, the owner, Francisco Antonio Moral Sánchez, took us to a roadside truckstop for lunch, and on the menu of the day was a huge choice of white bean, lentil and chickpea stews. It really highlighted for me how fundamental all these legumes are to Spanish cooking. Such dishes were usually born in times when meat was a luxury but legumes could be relied on for their ability to absorb tasty stocks and sauces, so that you could pack a dish full of flavour and provide hearty, cheap nutrition on a shoestring.</p>
<p class="indented">The nineteenth-century writer Pérez Galdos gave a snapshot of this in his novel <em>Miau</em>, in which he portrayed a relatively well-off family in Madrid in the nineteenth century who lived on a stew of chickpeas and cabbage almost every day. If the father was lucky enough to get a bone to make the stock a bit more juicy and flavoursome, it was a cause for celebration.</p>
<p class="indented">Over the centuries hundreds of legume recipes have been handed down through the generations, which feature added ingredients from clams to partridge, cabbage to pumpkin and almonds. The classic partner for legumes, however, must be cured pork, from <em>panceta</em> to vibrant, spicy red <em>chorizos</em> and <em>morcillas</em>, particularly those from Asturias, with their dark smouldering flavours.</p>
<p class="indented">Chickpeas, lentils and broad beans were originally cultivated in the Middle East and have been grown in Spain since at least Roman times, while most of the other beans typical of Spanish cooking originate in Latin America: <em>pinto</em> and <em>frijol</em> from Mexico and large white varietals from the Andes. On small plots in regions such as Tolosa, the old Latin American way of planting beans around the stems of maize is still practised, since the two crops are complementary, with the beans fixing nitrogen in the soil to nourish the maize.</p>
<p class="indented">Most households in Spain will use both dried and prepared (i.e. cooked and jarred) legumes and you can usually buy both in the markets and <em>ultramarinos</em> (grocers) shops. In the specialist <em>cansaladerias</em> that you still find in some towns, they sell beans and pulses freshly cooked in their own kitchens, along with their own stocks and cured produce, so you can buy everything you need for a quick and easy, nutritious meal.</p>
<p class="indented">For over 20 years at Brindisa we have been buying superb-quality prepared legumes from Navarrico, the company started in the 1950s by José and Amalia Salcedo in San Adrián in Navarra. Their artisan philosophy still prevails, and rigorous selection and careful cooking are the key. Their <em>alubias blancas</em> (haricot beans), in particular, are creamy, delicate and quite special.</p>

<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_376"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg376.jpg"/></div>
<p class="quote">‘in some recipes only dried beans, chickpeas or lentils will do’</p>
<p class="flush_left">There are some recipes in which only dried beans, chickpeas or lentils, soaked overnight and cooked from scratch, will do. For example, in a rich stew such as a <em>fabada</em> or <em>cocido</em>, the beans need to absorb the stock and fats to an extent that ready-cooked beans can’t match.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Beans</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In the UK we love baked beans from tins, and fresh runner beans and broad beans in the spring, but beans dried naturally on the plant haven’t figured very highly in our culture since medieval times, when they were grown for subsistence and cooked up in potages. These days our climate is considered too damp to allow most varieties to dry well in this way without risk of mould and mildew, and as a consequence we haven’t retained the tradition of soaking and slow-cooking them that prevails in Spain and the Mediterranean, where certain heritage varieties will often be so cherished that they are granted the mark of a PDO and championed by the Slow Food movement.</p>
<p class="indented">So I’m sure it isn’t usual in British households to talk about beans for hours on end as we seem to do in our family, but as Rupert and I both lived in Spain for many years, we have a healthy respect for all legumes, and a working lunch when we are both at home will often be a bowl of home-cooked beans, just dressed with oil and vinegar and salt and pepper, perhaps with some Spanish sardines for me, and chunks of bread.</p>
<p class="indented">I find dried beans quite entrancing. Visually they are splendid: their colours, shapes and shiny skins are so beautiful and tactile that I always want to plunge my hands into the sacks and run my fingers through these jewels.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain dried beans are ideally bought loose from a trusted market stallholder, preferably local to the area of cultivation. I have a vivid memory of an old lady sitting on a step in the tiny village square of Castellfollit de la Roca in Catalunya, carefully podding pale yellow pods of <em>mongete</em> beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p381a">here</a>) for sale.</p>
<p class="indented">When the beans are harvested in the autumn you can buy and cook them immediately: an experience beyond compare, as the virtually ‘fresh’ bean will cook through within about 30 minutes and be as smooth as cream, with the tenderest of skins that melts away. I love to see the women shopping in the markets, so knowledgeably weighing up the qualitative features of the different varieties piled on trestle tables, and have been lucky enough to be in San Sebastián at just the right time to pick up armfuls of ‘fresh’ <em>pochas</em> in their mottled mauve pods.</p>
<p class="indented">In some regions there are heritage varieties that are so local you won’t see them anywhere else, and they may have evocative names and nicknames that vary from village to village.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_378"/>Sometimes the beans are produced with great care and attention in such tiny quantities that they become rare and very expensive, for example, in the villages outside Madrid there is a bean called Rascafría, which is so highly prized that bags of them are given as presents. Occasionally at Brindisa we bring over the most incredible beans that really do cost a lot of money because a small farmer has only a field of them to sell, but they will cook to clotted-cream silkiness, and incredibly their skins will appear not to have moved at all, because they will have swollen in tandem with the bean inside, without a single split or tear.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_377"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg377.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose and store beans</h4>
<p class="flush_left">It isn’t only the way it is grown that marks out a high-quality dried bean, but its age. It is easy to forget, when dealing with dry produce, that beans, like vegetables, are seasonal: every year the crop is harvested, dried and then sold. And the idea, among societies that have a strong culture of eating beans, is that you finish up the dried beans from one season and then move on to the next – something that is a little alien to us in the UK. In the last 20 years or so at Brindisa our sales of new-season beans have been mostly to chefs, and rarely beyond, so most people have yet to discover the pure pleasure of cooking and eating them.</p>
<p class="method">The newer the dried bean, the more elastic the skin, which means you can happily slow-simmer or bake the beans over many hours and they will hold up – or as chef Jeremy Lee, one of our earliest bean friends at Brindisa, puts it, as only he can: ‘the skins behave impeccably, stretching and expanding as the beans swell up in the water, holding their structure superbly, so they can withstand long, long, one-bubble-on-the-surface cooking over many, many hours and develop an amazing intensity of flavour and creaminess – but you can still put in a spoon and lift them out, or decant them from one pot to another and they will stay intact, and their stock will never be overly soupy. If you tried to cook older, poorer-quality beans for the same length of time, they would just break up and produce a much more starchy stock.’</p>
<p class="method">In Spain, because of this bean culture, there is a quick and diligent rotation of stock in the shops as well as the markets, so beans are not allowed to get old and stale, and a Spanish home cook is highly unlikely to come across a forgotten packet bought on a whim and languishing in the kitchen cupboard (often they are sold loose, or in beautiful cloth bags in shops with a high turnover). Whereas, even if you buy a packet of supermarket beans in the UK and use them straight away, the chances are that the slow customer turnaround means that the beans will have been stored for a long time. It can be so frustrating to buy a packet of dried beans, soak them diligently overnight, cook them for the correct amount of time stated in a recipe, and then find that the skins are tough and the beans won’t give when you bite into them, however much longer you cook them for. Or, alternatively, the skins will split and the beans turn to mush.</p>
<p class="method">There isn’t an obvious way to tell by looking at a bean (unless it is excessively wrinkled and discoloured) whether it is recently dried and at its best, or older. Ideally, you want to buy your beans from a reliable supplier who can assure you that they have been harvested in the previous season – and I would say to enjoy them at their best, consume them within a year of harvest; eighteen months maximum. So if you are buying beans in a packet, check the ‘best before’ date – if it is years ahead, avoid them.</p>
<p class="method">In the UK most beans are sold in cellophane packets and will have been sterilised, to close off any danger of finding weevils. Weevil eggs will hatch in warmth. When high-quality beans are kept properly at low temperatures this is not a problem, but since there is no telling what temperature the beans will be kept at once people take them home, large-scale <a id="pg_379"/>packers won’t take any chances. However, the sterilisation process can be brief, gentle and graduated according to the variety of bean; or more aggressive, with the beans blasted at a higher, indiscriminate temperature which can harden their skins and reduce the creaminess of their texture. Unfortunately, the difference is indiscernible to the eye; however, if you can find them, it is worth buying beans in vacuum packs, as this is usually an indication of good quality. The beans will still have been sterilised, but as vacuuming is an extra cost to the producer/supplier, it is a sign that they are considered worthy of extra care and the process will have been done more considerately, producing fresher, more delicate beans that deserve not to be kept for too long.</p>
<p class="method">Always store your beans in a cool dry place (the optimum temperature is less than 18°C), not under bright lights – at home this could be a cellar or larder. Otherwise their skins will harden. A fridge is fine in the summer, as long as the beans aren’t allowed to get wet.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Cooking dried beans</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Apart from the white <em>pochas</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p380">here</a>), which can be bought virtually ‘fresh’ in the summer in Navarra and the Basque country, and need no soaking and only 20–30 minutes cooking, the beans suggested for the recipes in this book are dried, therefore they need to be soaked for a minimum of 12 hours or overnight. Make sure you do this in plenty of cold water in a spacious bowl – the water should cover the beans by at least 5cm – as larger beans such as <em>judiones</em>, especially, can plump up to double their size.</p>
<p class="method">Transfer them to a pan of fresh cold water before cooking (some recipes call for you to keep the soaking water).</p>
<p class="method">Calculate 70–80g of dried beans per person for a main dish.</p>
<p class="method">Long, slow cooking is best and a terracotta pot is often a better option than a metal pan, as it helps you to slow-cook the beans to a creamy texture, without the risk of the beans catching on the base. Even better, put a diffuser underneath the pot to keep the temperature stable and even.</p>
<p class="method">Since so much depends on the age of the bean, the important thing is to keep watching and testing. I have bought beans a few months after harvesting that have cooked through in 20 minutes, while much older ones have sometimes needed 5 hours.</p>
<p class="method">You need to cook the beans without salt, which will toughen their skins and, as Harold McGee, expert on science in the kitchen, explains in his book, <em>On Food and Cooking</em>: ‘salt reduces swelling of starch granules within beans creating a mealy texture rather than a creamy one’. Only salt them at the end of cooking.</p>
<p class="method">Finally, a trick for cooking beans that are being really slow to absorb liquid: you need to ‘frighten’ or blast the beans (the verb is <em>asustar</em>), so once they break into their first boil, throw in some cold water to halt it. This allows the bean to begin to rehydrate better. Once should be enough, but if the beans show no sign of softening, you can repeat the process.</p>
<p class="method">When you drain them, rinse them with tepid water, to prevent the skins peeling back as they change temperature.</p>
<p class="method">This is my guide to some of the most interesting of Spanish beans, and the best way to use them.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec142"><a id="pg_380"/>Alubias blancas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">White beans</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Faba</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Not to be confused with the dried <em>fava</em> beans of the eastern Mediterranean/north Africa, <em>fabas</em> are long, lozenge-shaped white beans traditionally grown in the Picos de Europa mountains of Asturias, around the municipalities of Villaviciosa, Pravia and Cangas de Narcea, and above the port of Luarca in the municipality of Valdés. They are probably the most expensive legumes in Spain, since they are grown on small allotments and mountain terraces that are often only accessible on foot, and must be tended and harvested by hand.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Fabas</em> are the classic ingredient in the local bean and sausage stew, the luxurious <em>fabada asturiana</em>, which provides much-needed winter fuel in the high mountain villages. One January when Rupert and I were staying in the village of Sanabria, we were snowed in and it was the big bowls of <em>fabada</em>, with the white beans luxuriating in rich, glossy molten pork meat and fat, that gave us the strength to walk through six kilometres of deep, deep snow to the nearest garage to find chains for the car. I remember passing a frozen stream where a white stork was serenely stepping over the ice, trying to peck its way through to find food, and thinking how much luckier we were to be fuelled with beans and pork fat.</p>
<p class="indented">There is also an exceptional, similar and equally lovely bean, also named <em>faba</em>, grown in small plots over the border from Asturias in Lourenza, Galicia, but here the beans are used in a different way, often cooked with fish, especially octopus.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p380">Pochas</p>
<p class="flush_left">These young round white beans inside purple and white streaked pods are similar to fresh Italian borlotti beans and are harvested in August and early September, most typically in Navarra and La Rioja. Since they have not been allowed to fully dry on the plant, they are treated like fresh beans that need no overnight soaking and cook through in about 20 minutes, after which time they just melt in the mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">In Navarra they are cooked with quail, eel, crab and/or even lamb’s tail. They can be equally good with vinaigrette or accompanying a vegetable dish.</p>
<p class="indented">Like fresh borlotti, they can be difficult to find in the UK, but if you do come across them, for four people, you need around 300g of beans.</p>
<p class="indented">Put them into a pan of cold water, bring to the boil, then turn down the heat to medium and add a red and a green pepper, roughly sliced, a couple of tomatoes, and a couple of whole garlic cloves. Simmer for 20–30 minutes, until tender, then take off the heat, take out the peppers and tomatoes and put them into a bowl, with 2 tablespoons of beans and 2 tablespoons of their cooking water. Mash these together roughly, then mix in the rest of the drained beans, season, stir in a couple of tablespoons of good olive oil, such as Arbequina, and enjoy.</p>
<p class="indented">Alternatively, you can buy jarred cooked <em>pochas</em>, which can simply be heated through in a pan. Sauté the peppers, tomatoes and garlic separately and then combine with the beans in the same way.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_381"/>Fesols de Santa Pau</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These are white and round, similar to small navy beans. They are grown in the volcanic soil of the national park of Garrotxa in Catalunya and so contain an exceptionally high level of minerals. On the edge of the famous beech forest, La Fageda d’en Jordà, which is rooted in lava, we had a dish of <em>f</em><em>è</em><em>sols</em> with pork scratchings – which was a bit hairy in texture – but the combination of pork skin and beans was very tasty.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p381a">Mongetes del ganxet</p>
<p class="flush_left">These are the beautiful little white Catalan hooked beans (<em>ganxet</em> means ‘little hook’ in Catalan), which have exceptionally delicate, almost indiscernible skins. In Catalunya people often grow <em>mongete</em> beans in the garden, picking them either quite fresh or leaving them to dry on the plant until the pods are wrinkled. You can also buy them cooked, in jars, and they are lovely, just heated through and served with some grilled fresh <em>botifarra</em> sausages (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#p450a">here</a>). They are also typical in <em>empedrat</em>, a salad which combines the beans with salt cod or white tuna (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_201">here</a>). However, their production is relatively small and so they are quite expensive, especially the exceptional ones from the PDO of Vallès-Maresme, whose territory includes villages within the beautiful, wild and hilly areas of Vallès Occidental and Vallès Oriental just outside Barcelona and whose sunny, dry microclimate encourages the best beans to be grown.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p381b">Alubias arrocinas</p>
<p class="flush_left">Tiny, round, white beans which are an elegant addition to soups and leaf salads, <em>arrocinas</em> are also ideal for homemade baked beans (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec21">here</a>). One of my favourite ways of cooking them is in the same way as for <em>pochas</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p380">here</a>). Being fully dried, they just need longer to cook – about an hour.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p381c">Blancas redondas</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a very similar bean to <em>alubias arrocinas</em>, but bigger.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p381d">Alubias planchadas</p>
<p class="flush_left">Long, white, slightly flat beans – <em>planchada</em> means flattened or ironed – these are excellent in hearty stews or as an accompaniment to roast meats, especially lamb, in which case the beans are cooked quite plainly in bay-scented vegetable stock. You might also come across <em>blanca riñón</em>: white, kidney-shaped beans, which are similar, but not as flat, and often cheaper.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec143"><a id="pg_382"/>Alubias pintadas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Coloured beans</p>

<h4 class="c_head">Tolosas</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These shiny, deep coppery-purple, oval-shaped beans are now protected by a Slow Food Presidia. They come from the Basque town of Tolosa, where the water is low in calcium, and the locals insist that if you don’t have the good fortune to live there you should cook the beans in mineral or rain water instead. Tolosa chefs also recommend cooking them in a terracotta pot until velvety, sometimes enriched with <em>panceta</em> and <em>chorizo</em>. Typically, they are then served with the local pickled peppers<em>,</em> known as <em>langostinos de Ibarra</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>), on the side.</p>
<p class="indented">I ate a special lunch at the home of Pello Urdapilleta and his wife, Maite Izaquirre, who farm black and white Euskal Txerria pigs in the region. In 1981 the breed was close to extinction with only 50 animals left. They were saved by a French Basque stockbreeder and butcher, Pierre Oteiza, who began making high-quality hams in the Aldudes forests in Pyrénées-Atlantique. Then in 1997 Pello and Maite began their own project, nurturing a small herd on their farm in Bidegoian, in the north-eastern Basque province of Gipuzkoa. Pello’s surname actually means ‘load of pigs’, and when he started researching the history of his family, who had lived in the same house for generations, he found that they had pig-farming roots going back to the sixteenth century, so his mission is a personal, as well as an ethical one.</p>
<p class="indented">The animals roam around 54 hectares of verdant forest where they can feast on chestnuts, cobnuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, grasses and herbs, a diet as privileged and complex as that of their distant Ibérico cousins in the Dehesa of Extremadura. For the last two-month fattening phase they are fed corn, beans and bran until they reach the required weight, and the resulting ham and its fat have a beautiful nutty and buttery character.</p>
<p class="indented">Following plates of their stunning home- cured ham, lomo (loin) and <em>salchichón</em> (sausage) made with pepper, and before the main dish of <em>pollazo</em> (free-range roast chicken with <em>piquillo</em> peppers), Maite served up the silkiest, creamiest <em>Tolosa</em> beans, cooked very gently for a long time in the traditional way, which she believes gives the beans such a full-bodied flavour that the addition of meat is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="indented">For four of us she soaked 300g of <em>Tolosa</em> beans overnight, then drained them and put them into a casserole with enough fresh cold water to cover by two fingers, maximum. She added a large red onion, chopped finely, and a medium potato, roughly cut into chunks, brought the water to the boil, then turned down the heat, skimmed off any foam that had come to the surface, and simmered the beans very slowly for 2–3 hours, before seasoning them with sea salt. She told me that some people insist on not stirring the beans at all as they cook, while others say you must stir very occasionally (Maite prefers not to stir). Again, if you can use a diffuser under the pan it helps the beans cook evenly without sticking or burning. As is traditional, she served the beans with pickled green <em>guindilla</em> peppers.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Moradas</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These can be either <em>redonda</em> (round) or <em>larga</em> (long). The small <em>redonda</em> are similar to the <em>Tolosa</em> (left) and very delicate, but are expensive and hard to find, while the bigger <em>larga</em> are closer in appearance to the red kidney bean. Both are traditionally used in pork stews.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Frijoles negros</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These mild, sweet, black haricot beans are loved across Spain, particularly in rice dishes, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean. They are good cooked with bay leaves and whole dried peppers to give them a touch of aromatic spice. In the Balearic Islands they are famously used in a dish called <em>moros y cristianos</em>, in which the black beans are mixed with white rice to symbolise a sixteenth-century battle between the Moors and the Christians.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_383"/>Verdinas</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These are very similar to the more well-known green flageolet beans. Picked before they are ripe, they have a pale green colour which they manage to hold as they cook. Unusually for a bean, they are enjoyed a little <em>al dente</em>, and their delicate flavour goes very well with seafood such as clams and prawns, and also small game, like partridge.</p>
<p class="small-recipe-head1" id="p383a">Canelas</p>
<p class="flush_left">Quite rare beans, local to León and Burgos in Castilla y León, these are the colour of ground cinnamon, and turn more salmon-pink as they are cooked – typically with local <em>chorizos</em>.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Pintas leonesas</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Although these pale, oval, purple-streaked coloured beans are often more associated with the Texas/Mexican border, where they are known as <em>pinto</em>, there is a traditional production area in León. The beans are often served with meats such as <em>chorizo</em>, but in order to aid digestion the locals like to add greens, such as cabbage, turnip tops, chard, or the Andalusian speciality, <em>pintas con tagarninas</em> (common golden thistle).</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Caparrones</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In the village shops of La Rioja and Burgos you see baskets full of these medium-sized, oval aubergine and beige-white beans, which are typically cooked with cured meats such as <em>chorizos</em>, <em>panceta</em> and black puddings.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec144">Judiones</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Butter beans</p>
<p class="method"><em>Judión</em> really just means a large white bean, and when you see these in Spain they will have different names attached, e.g. <em>judión de La Granja</em>, <em>del monasterio</em>, <em>del Barco</em>, which mostly indicate where they are grown. They are characteristically plump, ivory white and creamy in texture, very versatile and especially delicious with meat, clams and grilled vegetable salads. (See Barny Haughton’s salad on <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_208">here</a>). You could also use them for the <em>fabada</em> on <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_390">here</a> if you cannot find <em>fabas</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_380">here</a>).</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec145"><a id="pg_384"/>Garbanzos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Chickpeas</p>
<p class="method">A good chickpea, properly cooked until it is creamy and tender, is a delight, traditionally paired with <em>chorizo</em> and vegetables, such as Swiss chard, and there is a famous Andalusian dish in which the chickpeas are cooked with the stalks of an edible thistle. Spain has specific varieties of chickpea grown in different regions which are used for local dishes, but they are all interchangeable.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Garbanzo pedrosillano</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Known as <em>cigronet</em> (little chickpea) in Catalan, this is a small, very fine, golden-yellow-coloured chickpea with a small pointy tail and a smooth exterior. It does not increase much in weight as it soaks or cooks, so it looks very elegant in a dish. It is cultivated in a number of provinces in Castilla la Mancha and Castilla y León, most significantly in Salamanca and Zamora in Castilla y León, and takes its name specifically from the village of Pedrosillo in Salamanca. Here the combination of altitude, high mineral content in the soil, clean mountain water for irrigation, and dry cold winters and sunny summers gives the perfect growing conditions, and the chickpeas that come from Pedrosillo and Fuentesaúco in Zamora, in particular, are supreme.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Garbanzo castellano</h4>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Cigron</em> in Catalan, this is the most popular chickpea. It is larger in size, ochre in colour with clear ridges, and it often cooks to a softer texture than the <em>pedrosillano</em>. It is cultivated across the central <em>meseta</em> (plateau) of Castilla y León and Castilla La Mancha as well as in Andalucía. It is excellent in <em>contundente</em> (hearty) dishes such as <em>potaje de quaresma</em>, a spinach and salt cod stew, and <em>escudella</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_447">here</a>). It also combines brilliantly with <em>chorizo</em> (see <em>cocido montañés</em>, <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_449">here</a>). Its nutty taste and firm texture makes it perfect with combinations such as <em>morcilla</em> and pine nuts, aubergine and red pepper, tomatoes and fresh cheese, clams (see <em>garbanzos con almejas,</em> <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_396">here</a>) pork and cabbage, and white tuna and peppers (see <em>ensalada de bonito con piquillos huevos y garbanzos</em>, <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_206">here</a>).</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Garbanzo blanco lechoso</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The <em>lechoso</em> is grown in the southern regions of Andalucía and Badajoz. It is a fatter chickpea which is bone white, so it is a favourite in clear soups along with <em>fideu</em> pasta and vegetables.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose, store and cook chickpeas</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Like beans, chickpeas are typically allowed to dry in their pods on the plant and are then harvested at the optimum point, but, also like beans, if they are stored for too long and become old, their skins may never soften properly however long you cook them; whereas a fresher chickpea will have a delicate thin skin which will become very tender, allowing the chickpeas to become beautifully creamy.</p>
<p class="method">An old chickpea is more obvious than an ageing bean, however, as it will have become wrinkly and hard. Look for a clean colour, with few or no marks or wrinkles, a shine to the skin and a smooth feel.</p>
<p class="method">Store in the same way as beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_378">here</a>). Chickpeas need to be rinsed well and soaked, for at least 12 hours. Our friends Sam and Sam Clark at Moro swear by adding a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to help soften them. Always drain and rinse them well after soaking, and never cook them in the soaking water, or they will give you terrible wind.</p>
<p class="method">To cook, put them into a pan, cover with twice their quantity of cold water, and for every 200g of dried and soaked chickpeas add a carrot, halved lengthways, half an onion, 4 cloves of <a id="pg_385"/>garlic, a stick of celery, a sprig of thyme and a bay leaf, if you like (but no salt initially, as it will toughen the skins of the chickpeas). Bring to the boil, skim off any froth that rises to the surface, then turn down the heat and simmer very slowly until tender. This can take anything between 40 and 90 minutes (depending on the variety, quality and age – the older the chickpeas, the longer they will take to cook), so start checking after about half an hour. When the chickpeas are <em>al dente</em>, you can add a pinch of salt and cook them for another 10–20 minutes, to the point where you can lift out a chickpea, press it between your fingers and it will split in two.</p>
<p class="method">As with beans, chickpeas that are very hard can be helped by bringing them to the boil, then ‘shocking’ them by adding cold water, before continuing to cook gently – you can do this again from time to time if they are failing to soften.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec146">Lentejas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Lentils</p>
<p class="flush_left">Rich in iron and minerals and very versatile, lentils are a crucial staple food in most Spanish homes – in our house, too, they are almost sacred and we are never without at least a couple of varieties in our larder. Their cooking time is shorter than other legumes, soaking is rarely needed, and the best ones will hold their shape as they cook. Equally good eaten hot or cold, they can be humble, but it only takes the addition of some diced vegetables and aromatics such as bay leaves, peppers and garlic and they can pair with more luxurious ingredients to great acclaim.</p>
<p class="indented">Castilla y León and La Mancha are the heartlands of lentil cultivation, where growers with long experience select varietals valued for their quality over quantity.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lenteja pardina</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These are tiny, brown lentils which are favoured for their earthy flavour, have a good texture and retain their shape well during cooking. They are excellent with most meat, fish and vegetarian dishes.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lenteja verdina</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Small, dark green lentils with dark purple speckles, very similar to Puy lentils from France.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lenteja rubia castellana</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Larger, pale-pinky green lentils, shaped like little flat flying saucers, that grow mainly in La Mancha. These are the most popular varietal across Spain and will be found in <em>menús del día</em> up and down the country.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose and cook lentils</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Lentils don’t need to be soaked before cooking but they must be thoroughly rinsed. For four people as part of a dish, or for a salad, you need around 300g. Start them off in cold water – enough to cover – preferably with finely chopped onion, carrot and celery, plus a bay leaf and some peppercorns, then bring to the boil, turn down the heat, skim off any froth that comes to the surface, and simmer for about 20–25 minutes until tender, depending on the variety. Just don’t overcook them – if anything they are better slightly <em>al dente.</em></p>

<h2 class="box-head" id="box12"><a id="pg_386"/>Julián and the Beans of El Barco</h2>
<p class="flush_left">One day during the autumn of 1989, in the fledgling days of Brindisa, the phone rang. It was Sally Clarke, chef/proprietor of Clarke’s restaurant, famous for her fixed menus of elegant dishes made with fresh seasonal ingredients – something of a revolution at the time. She was asking if we could supply her with some new season’s beans from Spain. ‘Yes, of course. We have some on the way. They will be with us next week,’ I told her. As I put the phone down I yelped with delight – only a month earlier, after researching Spanish bean suppliers and discovering Julián Sánchez García in Castile, the man who still supplies us, I had decided to invest in some truly superior beans at what seemed like a terrifyingly high price, especially as at the time I had no customers for them and no real plan for how to gain any. But now, not only did I have a customer, but a chef famous for her insistence on the best produce, someone I knew would understand and appreciate a good bean.</p>
<p class="indented">The village of El Barco (the Ship), where Julián is based, and where he also roasts coffee beans and grinds cocoa beans for the family chocolate business (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p34a">here</a>), is so called because it sits on the flat plain at the foot of the Gredos mountains, and in the days before it expanded with new houses, when you approached the village it looked like the body of a ship with its castle and church steeple resembling two funnels.</p>
<p class="indented">The beans are grown in neat rows in fields and smallholdings outside the village, and Julián gives his own names to some of the varieties, which often relate to the colours of his stunning horses – for example, he has a speckled bean which he calls Appaloosa.</p>
<p class="indented">He is involved with each grower from the moment they plant their seeds to the point of harvesting. An outstanding dried bean has a delicate skin, a hearty size and a creamy texture that is able to absorb stocks and flavours, and in Julián’s view the key to growing such superior beans is loose soil, well irrigated, in this case with the exceptionally clean Gredos mountain water, and a dry climate, cold in winter and hot in summer. If the bean suffers from an absence of good water, or is subjected to humidity, combined with high temperatures during the growing season, this can create a hard outer skin which is very water-resistant, so the beans can refuse to soften during cooking.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_387"/>The growers know how to harvest the beans at just the right moment when they have dried on the plants. In the case of the more delicate varieties, this can often mean collecting them by hand on a pod by pod basis, a special skill which sets Julián’s operation apart from more industrial systems where the beans would be dried using mechanical methods.</p>
<p class="indented">Back at the plant, the shiny, sleek dried beans are sorted by hand and graded in wooden sieves in an astonishingly simple operation. Much of Julián’s equipment is a collector’s dream – antique machinery kept running by a network of friends throughout Spain who supply spare parts and expertise – and hung on the wall, like the trays used for panning for gold, are old-fashioned <em>crivas,</em> sieves made from animal hide.</p>
<p class="indented">After my first inspirational trip to El Barco, as I headed back to Madrid I was firmly convinced that beans would one day be the next pasta in the UK. It didn’t happen then, but as this is the International Year of Pulses, as declared by the WHO, and the health-giving properties of beans are better understood all the time, I can still hope.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec147"><a id="pg_388"/>Changurro con alubias</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Cantabrian white crabmeat with white beans</p>
<p class="flush_left">Agustín Bedía, who has a wonderful fish restaurant in Somo, near Santander, makes a rich and stunning signature dish of crab in a sauce made with tomato <em>sofrito</em>, wine and Cognac, to which he adds large <em>judión</em> beans. It is so well-loved and in such demand that you have to pre-book it, as it takes time and planning to prepare. One time when our family turned up at the restaurant after snow-shoeing in the Picos de Europa mountains, I had completely forgotten about this, so we missed out on being able to order it: heartbreaking!</p>
<p class="indented">As some compensation Agustín generously gave me a version of the recipe made with smaller beans for ease. In the restaurant he uses a cock crab (which is bigger than the female) and breaks out all the white meat from the body and legs; however, I have simplified the recipe further by suggesting you just use white crabmeat.</p>
<p class="indented">Serve with good bread to soak up the sauce.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 small leeks, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium carrot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">60ml Cognac</p>
<p class="ingredients">60ml white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g good tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_316">here</a>), either from a jar or homemade (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_318">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g good white crabmeat, plus some clawmeat (optional), sautéd in a little butter</p>
<p class="forhead">For the beans</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g small white beans, such as <strong><em>arrocina</em></strong> or <strong><em>planchada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium potato, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ an onion, chopped small</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a green pepper, chopped small</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (mild paprika)</p>
<p class="method">Soak the beans overnight. Next day put them into a pan of cold water, ensuring that it covers them by three fingers. Bring to the boil, scrape away any foam from the surface, then turn down the heat and simmer for about an hour. At this point, chop the potato into medium pieces and add to the beans, along with the onion, green pepper and <em>pimentón.</em> Leave to cook for a maximum of another hour, until the beans are just tender. Keep checking as they cook, as the timing will depend on the variety of beans; for example <em>planchada</em> will take longer than <em>arrocina</em>.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, heat the butter in a wide pan, add the onion, leeks and carrot, and cook gently until soft but not coloured. Add the Cognac and flame it, then add the wine and the <em>sofrito</em>. Stir well and allow the sauce to bubble for a few minutes, then turn down the heat and simmer for 20 minutes or so, until it has reduced by half. Blend with a hand blender until the sauce is smooth. Taste and season with salt as required.</p>
<p class="method">Drain the beans, reserving a little of the cooking water. Mix the crabmeat with the tomato sauce and beans in a terracotta dish or dishes, loosening with a little of the cooking water if necessary, and serve straight away.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec148"><a id="pg_390"/>Fabada asturiana</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Asturian white bean pot with <em>chorizo</em> and black pudding</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is quite a rich and heavy dish, a medieval-style stew really, not for eating late in the evening as you need several hours to digest it. Amazingly, we once saw it as a starter on a provincial restaurant menu of the day, to be eaten before the main meat course.</p>
<p class="indented">When I first came across this bean pot it was interesting to me that saffron should be a key ingredient, given that Asturias is on the other side of Spain from the Castilian saffron fields, and it is a dish full of such big flavours that you wonder why such a delicate spice would be added. Then I discovered that saffron used to be cultivated in the allotments of central and north-eastern Galicia next door, which may explain it<em>.</em> And in fact, even up against <em>chorizo</em> and <em>morcilla,</em> as well as pork shoulder and <em>panceta</em>, it makes its presence felt.</p>
<p class="indented">Ideally, this is made with <em>faba</em> beans, but since these can be both hard to find and expensive, we often use <em>judión</em> (butter beans) or other large white beans, such as <em>planchada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p381d">here</a>), as they behave in the same way, absorbing the fats and flavours and holding their integrity during long slow cooking.</p>
<p class="indented">Asturian <em>morcilla</em> is semi-cured and highly spiced, so it holds up to long slow cooking without falling apart and adds a bigger flavour than other <em>morcillas</em>. If you can’t find it, and are using a softer, poached <em>morcilla</em>, such as the one from Burgos, a <em>boudin noir</em>, or an English black pudding, then I suggest you slice it, fry it gently and add it at the end of cooking instead.</p>
<p class="indented">The key to this is the very long slow cooking, and since it shouldn’t be stirred, it is a good idea to use a heat diffuser, especially if you are using a saucepan rather than a terracotta dish, to make sure that the beans cook gently and evenly with no risk of burning.</p>
<p class="indented">If you like, you can make this the day before you need it, as it will improve massively with a night’s keeping in the fridge. Just reheat very gently before serving.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 8</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg <strong><em>faba</em></strong> beans, butter beans or <strong><em>planchada</em></strong> beans, soaked overnight</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g <strong><em>panceta,</em></strong> in a single piece</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 lightly smoked cooking <strong><em>chorizos</em></strong>, from León or Rioja</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 lightly smoked Asturian <strong><em>morcillas</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 head of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 dried red <strong><em>guindilla</em></strong> pepper (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 strands of saffron</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="method">Drain the beans and put them into a casserole with all the ingredients except the saffron and salt. Cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil. Skim off any foam that comes to the surface, then turn down the heat. If possible, place a diffuser under the casserole, as from now on the dish shouldn’t be stirred at all since moving the beans around will break them up as well as the <em>morcilla</em>. Cook very gently – just the occasional bubble breaking the surface will be enough – then, after an hour, pour in 50ml of cold water. This is the traditional process of ‘shocking’ the beans, to stop the boiling, causing the cell walls of the beans to contract and allowing the whole process of developing flavours to begin again as the water comes back to a bare simmer. If you like, you can repeat the shocking process again after an hour or so to help the flavours develop.</p>
<p class="method">Because the quality and age of dried beans is so variable, it is impossible to give precise cooking times, so it is a good idea to try a bean after the first hour and at regular intervals, in order that you can begin to assess how long the cooking process might be. Ideally, if you keep the cooking really slow and gentle, it should be 3–4 hours.</p>
<p class="method">About 15 minutes before the beans are ready, lightly toast the saffron in a small dry pan and add to the casserole. The <em>panceta</em> and <em>chorizo</em> will add salt, but taste just before serving and add a little more if necessary.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec149"><a id="pg_391"/>Alubiada de Tolosa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Tolosa bean stew with <em>chorizo</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">Sandra Salcedo’s family have been preparing Navarrico jarred legumes since the 1950s, and we have worked with them for over 20 years. This is her recipe for Tolosa beans, which is really simple and good eaten with some pickled <em>guindilla</em> peppers on the side. The idea of resting the beans for half an hour or so before serving is a personal touch that she believes improves the flavour.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g Tolosa beans or other coloured beans, such as <strong><em>caparrones</em></strong> or <strong><em>canelas</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p383a">here</a>)</p>

<p class="method">Soak the beans in cold water overnight.</p>
<p class="method">Drain the beans and put into a pan or terracotta pot with the onion, leek, carrot, <em>panceta</em> and <em>chorizo</em> and cover with fresh cold water. Bring to the boil and skim off any foam that comes to the surface. Turn down the heat and preferably place a diffuser underneath the casserole. Simmer very, very slowly, ideally for 2 hours, until the beans are cooked, but still intact and creamy inside, though not mushy – start testing after 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, put in the garlic and paprika and fry briefly, then add to the bean pot. Continue to cook slowly for about 10 minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle, then take off the heat and leave to rest for 30 minutes, so the beans settle before serving, to help them absorb the flavours a bit more. Warm through if necessary before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec150">Judiones a la cazuela estilo Jeremy</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Jeremy Lee’s slow-cooked butter beans</p>
<p class="flush_left">When Jeremy Lee, now of Quo Vadis, launched the Blueprint Café on the banks of the Thames, he was one of Brindisa’s earliest customers. Spanish anchovies, oils and hams all featured on his menu, but above all he loved the beans. For Jeremy there is ‘something miraculous’ about a bean. ‘A beautifully braised, silky bean, holding its shape, with a bit of pork is an absolute joy that can bring grown men to tears,’ he says.</p>
<p class="indented">This is Jeremy’s way of cooking <em>judión</em> beans, one of his favourite varieties, with vegetables, <em>panceta</em> and lots of whole garlic cloves that melt over the slow cooking time and become beautifully sweet. ‘I follow the same method for chickpeas, even lentils – you would be amazed how long good lentils hold their shape for,’ he says. ‘The key is to curb your instinct to stir. Leave them alone.’</p>
<p class="indented">If you like, once the beans and vegetables have come to the boil, instead of turning them down to a bare simmer on the hob, you could put the pot into a very low oven (120°C/gas ½) or even the slow oven of an Aga overnight. You could also sprinkle the surface of the near-finished dish with breadcrumbs and bake at 180°C/gas 4 for 30 minutes, until the crumbs are golden and crunchy.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4–6</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g good-quality dried <strong><em>judión</em></strong> beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#rec144">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 piece of <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, about 300g, coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small stick of celery, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 6 garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">a bundle of thyme, rosemary, sage sprigs and about 3 bay leaves, tied with string (or a <strong><em>farcellet</em></strong>/bouquet garni)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> or <strong><em>picante</em></strong> (sweet or hot paprika, as you like, optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">good extra virgin olive oil, to finish</p>
<p class="method">Soak the beans overnight in plenty of cold water, then drain them and wash them thoroughly under the cold tap until the water is crystal clear.</p>
<p class="method">Put the drained and washed beans into a large pan. Cover them generously with fresh cold water, bring quickly up to a furious boil, then drain and rinse them again under the cold tap to get rid of the excess starch.</p>
<p class="method">Warm the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot and throw in the <em>panceta</em>, vegetables, garlic and herbs, together with a large shot of black pepper – but no salt. Put the lid on and cook quickly, just to soften and colour everything a little.</p>
<p class="method">Add the drained beans to the pot of vegetables and cover with enough cold water to clear the beans by 8–10cm. Put the lid on and bring to the boil. Spoon off any froth that comes to the top, then turn down the heat and cook half-covered very, very gently – the water should just tick over with the odd bubble on the surface – for as long as you can: preferably at least 3–4 hours, but really anything up to 12 hours. The beans are ready when they yield completely when you bite into them, and they will be enrobed in their own sauce – rich and delicate and full of character.</p>
<p class="method">Now you can taste and season them with salt if necessary. The beans can be served just as they are, finished with some good extra virgin olive oil, or you could heat a little paprika in olive oil quickly in a small pan and stir it in.</p>

<p class="quote">‘no fat no cooking’</p>
<p class="flush_left">There is a saying in Spain, ‘<em>sin el cerdo no hay tocino y sin tocino no hay cocina</em>’, which translates as, ‘no pig means no fat, and no fat means no cooking’. <em>Tocino</em> is fat from the back of the animal, and usually has no lean at all, whereas <em>panceta</em> is slightly streaked fat from the belly button upwards.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Tocino</em> is mostly used in dishes of beans, chickpeas and lentils, stews and <em>cocidos</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_446">here</a>) while <em>panceta</em> is used more on grills and barbecues. However, since <em>tocino</em> is impossible to find in the UK, we have substituted <em>panceta</em> in this book.</p>
<p class="indented">When <em>panceta</em> comes from the Ibérico pig it is extra special, though this too can be hard to find, even in Spain, if you are outside the designated production areas, as most goes into cured sausages, rather than being sold in its own right. However, it is well worth seeking out.</p>
<p class="indented">One of my most memorable experiences of Ibérico <em>panceta</em> was on a visit to the Dehesa, the vast expanse of forest in south-west Spain where the pigs roam freely. I took a band of chefs to visit José Gómez of Joselito, one of Spain’s most eminent and legendary ham producers, whose great grandfather began the business over a century ago, and at one of the <em>cortijos</em> in the area (houses with a courtyard where the tenant family and workers live) the woman of the house cooked her silky home-cured <em>panceta</em> for us for breakfast. The hens in the yard provided the freshest eggs, with yolks of the most beautiful rich gold colour, which were fried until the edges were crisp like a lace mantilla – I doubt if I’ve had a better egg, ever – and the combination of those eggs and the <em>panceta</em> was simple but heavenly.</p>
<p class="indented">Often Ibérico <em>panceta</em> is cut into very chunky <em>torreznos,</em> or lardons (sometimes pork neck fat, known as <em>papada</em>, is also used), which are cooked slowly in very little oil at first, then the flame is increased so that the <em>torreznos</em> become brown and crunchy and irresistible. One of the classic ways to serve them is with roughly crushed potato (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_293">here</a>). My daughter, Daniela, is the greatest bacon eater of our family, and on one occasion when we were staying with our friends Ambro and Ásun (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>), Ambro brought out a great side of the pork belly, then meticulously trimmed off the tough outer skin, and instead of chunky pieces he cut slender pillars of about half a centimetre wide which consisted of fat with just a small speck or two of lean pork at the base. This time, rather than starting off the <em>torreznos</em> slowly, he reversed the cooking process and sealed the pieces quickly in hot fat so that they were crisp on the outside, then turned down the heat until they were cooked to a silky texture inside. The wait was agonising and we were practically drooling at the smell of the <em>panceta</em> cooking, but when the <em>torreznos</em> eventually found their way on to our plates they were devoured in seconds.</p>
<p class="indented">Our executive chef, Josep, has another method for <em>papada,</em> which involves first poaching and then frying. He puts whole fresh <em>papada</em> into a large pan of water, brings it to the boil and spoons off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface, then he changes the water to fresh, puts in a bay leaf, brings it back to the boil and turns down the heat to a simmer for 2 hours. At this point he lifts out the <em>papada</em>, dries it off, cuts it into chunks, and fries it in hot oil for 2–3 minutes, so that the <em>torreznos</em> are almost melting in the middle, like warm caramel.</p>
<p class="indented">Alternatives to Ibérico <em>panceta</em> include the lightly smoked <em>panceta</em> <em>ahumada</em> from León, which can also be paprika-coated, in which case it is known as <em>adobada</em>. You could even use chunks of good British streaky bacon, though none of these options will have the intensely sweet and unctuous fat of the Ibérico <em>panceta</em>.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Chickpeas with clams</p>

<p class="flush_left">While testing recipes Rupert and Nico were keen to pair chickpeas with seafood, a combination often favoured in Asturias, as an alternative to the more traditional <em>chorizo</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#rec153">here</a>).</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">800g clams</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g tomato <strong><em>sofrito</em></strong> (from a jar, or see recipe on <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_318">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">600g chickpeas, cooked as on <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_384">here</a> and drained of their cooking water</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml hot <strong><em>fumet rojo</em></strong> (red fish stock, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_468">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sugar (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, plus a little extra to finish</p>
<p class="ingredients">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="method">Wash the clams well, discarding any shells that are open, or that won’t close if tapped against your work surface.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the <em>sofrito</em> in a pan and add the cooked chickpeas. Heat together for 2 minutes, until the mixture comes to a simmer. Add the <em>fumet rojo</em> – there should now be enough liquid for the chickpeas to begin to float. Taste the liquid and add the sugar if the <em>sofrito</em> tastes a little too acidic.</p>
<p class="method">Add the clams, bring to a vigorous boil, and put the lid on the pan for 1–2 minutes, just long enough for the clams to open and release their juices (discard any that don’t open).</p>
<p class="method">Take the pan from the heat, stir in the parsley, and add a twist of black pepper.</p>
<p class="method">To serve, lift out the chickpeas and clams with a slotted spoon and put into small bowls, then cover them with a ladleful of the cooking liquid. Garnish with a final sprinkling of parsley.</p>
