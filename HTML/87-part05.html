<p class="running_first">The Spanish eat a lot of eggs, though just about never for breakfast. Apart from a mid-morning slice of <em>tortilla de patatas</em> <a href="88-chapter61.html#page_124">(see page 124)</a>—for me, nothing is better than a slice of yesterday’s tortilla and a café con leche at about 11 a.m.—eggs are not considered morning food. But for a simple lunch or dinner, well, that’s a different matter.</p>
<p class="running_first">While Spanish egg dishes can be simple in preparation, their flavors are often rich and complex. A pair of eggs fried in extra-virgin olive oil and served with hand-cut slices of Iberian jamón and fried potatoes <a href="94-chapter66.html#page_132">(see page 132)</a> along with a glass of bold Ribera del Duero wine makes a most exquisite meal.</p>
<p class="running_first">Excellent eggs are not hard to find. In the country’s covered food markets, there is usually a stall or two dedicated to selling only eggs, offering a wide selection of options, from free-range, corn-fed chicken eggs to tiny speckled quail eggs.</p>
<p class="running_first">While sold fresh across Spain, quail eggs seem to be most appreciated as part of a Basque pintxo, or tapa, fried and “mounted” on a slice of baguette with a slice of cured jamón. But they are tricky to crack into the pan to fry—you don’t so much as <em>crack</em> them as cut off the end with the tip of a paring knife and gently tip the contents out of the shell and into the pan—and sometimes even more devilishly tricky to peel when boiled.</p>
<p class="running_first">But never are eggs as delicious as when fresh—really fresh. In the summer we have a treat at the <em>finca</em> (estate) we’ve rented in Menorca. My girls head down the hill to the <em>gallinero</em> (henhouse) in the morning to pick up the eggs. The dozen hens at the finca are a local Menorcan breed—beautiful birds with brilliant black plumage and a great white spot on their heads—that, unfortunately, largely take the summer off from laying. But there are always one or two hens who indulge us, and offer a steady if slow supply. When asking about this summer recess, someone repeated the old saying, <em>“Por San Antón, huevos a montón.”</em> (That is, on Saint Anthony’s Day [January 17th], there are tons of eggs.) I looked up that expression later and found there was another, just as fitting: <em>“Por San Antón, todo ave pon.”</em> (For Saint Anthony’s Day, every bird lays.)</p>
<p class="running_first">In the savory Spanish kitchen, eggs are probably most enjoyed in <em>tortillas</em> (Spanish egg omelets). While the potato tortilla—often with some onion to help keep it moist—remains <em>the</em> classic, it can be prepared with any vegetable, depending on the season. Eggplant. Zucchini. Mushrooms. Artichokes <a href="89-chapter62.html#page_126">(see page 126)</a>. Asparagus. It is a happy coincidence that the hens’ peak laying season is the same as many of the tortilla’s more delicious fillings.</p>
<p class="running_first">While the trick of a good egg tortilla largely rests in flipping it, a good <em>revuelto</em> is more about stirring. In revueltos, eggs are scrambled with sautéed ingredients. Well, scrambled is not exactly the correct word. The name comes from the verb <em>revolver</em>—to turn or to stir. That’s a closer way of describing the light stirring used when cooking. Shrimp and asparagus <a href="91-chapter64.html#page_128">(see page 128)</a>, say, or some wild mushrooms <a href="92-chapter65.html#page_130">(see page 130)</a>, are quickly sautéed in a pan and then the whisked egg is poured over them. After a few seconds, the eggs are turned using just a couple of wide sweeps through the pan with a wooden spoon until the eggs are just set but still moist. Simple, perhaps, but also marvelous-tasting.</p>
