<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This surprising recipe with almonds and a gentle sweet-and-sour flavor is from Rosa Tovar. She says it is of Jewish origin. In Majorca, many dishes are. You can use the same filling for fat zucchini.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 medium elongated eggplants (about 1 pound)</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup water</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup fresh white bread crumbs</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="qun">2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun1">1½ tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Trim the stem ends of the eggplants and cut them lengthwise in half. Pour the water into a wide casserole or a skillet, and stir in the vinegar, the sugar, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Put in the eggplant halves cut side up, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and let the eggplant halves steam for 5 to 8 minutes, until they soften but still hold their shape.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When they are cool enough to handle, hollow out the eggplants with a large pointed spoon, leaving just enough pulp to form a thin wall; reserve the pulp. Leave the eggplant shells in the casserole, or, if you used a skillet, transfer them to a baking dish, along with any remaining liquid. Coarsely chop the pulp.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Fry the onion in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet, stirring occasionally until soft and beginning to color. Add the eggplant pulp and cook, stirring and mashing it, for 5 to 10 minutes, until it is very soft and the liquid has evaporated. Add the bread crumbs, ground almonds, and eggs, season with salt and pepper, and mix well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Fill the eggplant shells with the ground almond mixture. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for about 20 minutes, or until the stuffing puffs up and collapses. Serve hot, sprinkled with the chopped parsley.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Add 2 teaspoons rose water or 1 teaspoon chopped oregano to the filling.</p>
