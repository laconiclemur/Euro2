<p class="author1"><span class="txit">crema cannoli</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe for cream-filled cannoli, a classic Italian dessert, comes from my father’s sister Dora and was handed down to my mother. “Dora prepares them during the Christmas holidays,” says Joan, “making the cream several hours ahead of time and filling the cannoli shells just before serving. She prefers to use small shells, which may be purchased at Italian bakeries and gourmet shops. The cinnamon flavoring may be purchased at bakeries, supermarkets, or specialty food shops.”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 pounds ricotta cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound confectioners’ sugar, plus more for dusting</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 drops liquid cinnamon flavoring</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">48 small cannoli shells</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Place the ricotta, sugar, cinnamon flavoring, and vanilla in a large bowl and stir to combine thoroughly. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to fill the shells, up to one day. Stir briskly, then using a small spoon, fill each shell with the cream. Arrange on a serving platter. Place some confectioners’ sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and shake over the filled shells to lightly dust. Serve immediately.</p>
