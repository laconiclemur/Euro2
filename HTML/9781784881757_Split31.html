<h1 class="chapter"><a id="page_50"/>how to store low-sugar preserves</h1>
<div class="covser1"><a id="page_51"/><img alt="images" src="images/p51.jpg"/></div>
<p class="tx2"><b>Since we wrote our book <i>The Gentle Art of Preserving</i>, we have incorporated many of the techniques we learnt into our lives. Giancarlo’s mother would have preserved vegetables and fruits throughout the season, and cured meats in winter, as she had no fridge until the 1970s. If a jam consists of over 60 per cent sugar it can be poured into sterilised jars and kept out of the fridge, as harmful bacteria cannot grow in a solution so sugary. However, we like to use little sugar in our recipes these days, so preserving under a vacuum is a better solution.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">First of all, clean your jars by pouring boiling water into them up to the top (I do this in the sink) and put the lids into a bowl of just-boiled water for 10 minutes. This method is better for jars with metal lids lined with plastic coating rather than Kilner-style jars. The jars can be recycled ones but the lids should be new to ensure a tight seal.</p>
<p class="tx">Tip away the water from the jars using a pair of tongs. Spoon the low-sugar preserve or compote evenly between the jars and pour over the juices. The level of liquid should completely submerge the fruit, so add a little boiled water if necessary. Drain and screw on the lids with a clean cloth. The jars can either be cooled at this point and stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, or they can be further sterilised to extend their shelf life as follows.</p>
<p class="tx">Put a clean tea towel (dish towel) in the bottom of a large saucepan big enough to hold the filled and sealed jars, and deep enough to be able to cover them with water. Put the jars into the pan and put a piece of paper towel or a small cloth between all the jars. Fill the pan with water so that the jars are completely covered. Put the pan over a high heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and let it bubble gently for 10 minutes, then turn off the heat. Allow the jars to cool in the pan. When the water is at room temperature, remove the jars and check that there is a depression in the lids. This means you have created a vacuum and your jars can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months. If they have not created a vacuum, store them in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</p>
