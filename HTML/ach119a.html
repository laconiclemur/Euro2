<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_233"/>fresh tomato salad</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">insalata di pomodoro</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My mother remembers her father growing wonderful tomatoes in his garden. “When they were in season, we ate this salad almost every day. My mother didn’t eat raw tomatoes,” recalls Joan. “Instead, she would use a piece of fresh or grilled bread (<span class="txit">biscotto,</span> as we called it) to soak up the juice and the dressing, a move the Italians call <span class="txit">la scarpetta,</span> meaning ‘little shoe.’”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 large ripe tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 fresh basil leaves, torn in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Cut the tomatoes in half and then into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-wide wedges. Cut these wedges in half to create chunks. Place in a medium-size serving bowl and toss with the olive oil, basil, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper just before serving.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 4 —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Light white, light red, and rosé</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> For an excellent luncheon salad, add a 6-ounce can Italian tuna, drained and flaked apart with a fork, and substitute <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup thinly sliced red onions for the garlic.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Another way to vary the basic recipe is to add a cucumber that has been peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and then cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices. Toss with 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar and a pinch of chopped fresh oregano leaves in addition to the ingredients in the basic recipe.</p>
