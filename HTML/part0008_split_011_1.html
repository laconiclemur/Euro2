  <h3 class="h3a">Baked pasta and potatoes</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">My sister, Adriana, makes this dish; it is a cross between <em class="calibre4">pasta e patate</em> (pasta and potatoes), which was a much-loved dish in our family, and <em class="calibre4">patate arraganate</em> (sliced potatoes baked in the oven with oregano and tomatoes). It’s a thrifty way to use up small amounts of dried pasta from your store cupboard, making a tasty, nutritious meal for a family midweek supper.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz potatoes, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">60g/2¼oz Parmesan: 30g/1oz roughly cut into cubes; 30g/1oz grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz dried pasta, broken up</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the sauce</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk with leaves, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">600g/1lb 5oz canned chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of fresh basil leaves, plus extra to serve</p>

  <p class="ing2">a pinch of dried oregano salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="para">First, make the sauce: heat the olive oil in a saucepan and sweat the onion and celery for a couple of minutes. Add the tomatoes, then rinse out the can with 200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup water and add to the pan. Stir in the basil, oregano, salt and pepper and cook on a medium heat for 25 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the tomato sauce and potatoes in an ovenproof dish about 20 x 25cm/8 x 10 inches, dot with pieces of Parmesan, cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Cook the pasta in plenty of salted boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain, reserving about 200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce and potatoes, together with the reserved pasta cooking water. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan and scatter over a few basil leaves, then return to the oven for 15 minutes, without the foil. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
