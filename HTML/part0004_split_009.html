			<p class="rec-intro">The name comes from bouilli and baisse – meaning to boil, then turn down – because the fish is put into the pot when boiling and is then slowly poached. As with many well-loved dishes, there are 101 versions and no consensus as to which is the ultimate. Traditionally, whole fish is cooked in the broth and brought to the table to be filleted and served with the piping hot soup. My version is a little more dainty, but still remains true to the original. The weights of the fish given are just a guide, as what you buy will depend on what’s available on the day. Other fish that can be used are bass, pout, bream, garfish and grey mullet, but they should be from the Mediterranean for the recipe to remain authentic.</p>

			<p class="body">Scale, gut and fillet the fish – or ask your fishmonger to do this for you. Keep all the bones for the stock and also keep the mullet livers, if any, to add to the rouille (see below). Remove any pin bones from the fish and cut them all into generous portions, keeping any trimmings. Rinse the fish bones well, put them in a pan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skim, then cook for 20 minutes to make a fish stock. Pass the stock through a fine sieve. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a huge pan and gently cook the onions, leek, garlic and chilli until soft. Turn up the heat and add the fish trimmings and velvet crabs, crushing them down in the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook over a high heat for 5–6 minutes, then add the saffron, bay, thyme, orange peel, fennel and tomatoes and mix well. Pour on the pastis, white wine and enough of the fish stock to cover well, adding a little water if you need it. Season and simmer for 30 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Pass the soup through a mouli, then a sieve if necessary, and keep it warm. Pan-fry the fish in a drizzle of olive oil. Serve the fish with boiled, sliced potatoes in wide bowls and pour in some hot soup. Serve more soup on the side and some croutons and rouille.</p>

			<p class="body">Put all the ingredients except the oil in a food processor and blitz to a purée. With the motor running, slowly add the oil.</p>
