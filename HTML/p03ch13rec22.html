</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="bi">We were twenty around the table, wearing straw hats with fresh flowers pinned on.</span> We ate for hours, laughing and dancing in between courses—conviviality and <span class="italic">alegría de vivir</span> (joy of living) are the spirit of Mediterranean Spain. We started with marinated anchovies; tiny sweet tomatoes; green olives; <span class="italic">pan con tomate</span> (page 154); <span class="italic">cocas</span> (like pizzas) with tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant (page 209); and broad beans and artichokes cooked with pancetta. The main course was chicken and baby lamb chops cooked over embers on the outside grill, and we finished with fruit and pumpkin fritters. A giant pumpkin filled with honey and brandy was baked in the outside bread oven. Nearly all the ingredients for the meal came from the estate.</p>
<p class="summary">Our host, Andresito—Andrés Bertomeu—a handsome stocky man with a goatee, had cooked all the dishes with his wife. The rest of us were the houseguests of Alicia and her mother, Josefa, in their neighboring <span class="italic">casitas</span> (country houses) by the sea. Andresito was born on Alicia’s grandfather’s estate in Benissa, Alicante, province of Valencia. His grandparents and parents were peasant retainers. Alicia’s grandmother died giving birth to Josefa, and Andresito’s grandmother, who had just lost her own baby, breast-fed her.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p548.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="summary">Andresito’s father planted fruit trees, tended grapevines, and grew vegetables on the estate. As a young boy, Andresito boarded with the Franciscans, who offered poor children a free education, but he ran away from the convent after only two years, and that was the only schooling he had. At twelve, he worked in the fields with his father, and as a teenager, he worked in construction, building houses for tourists. After army service, he started his own construction company, with builders, painters, electricians, plumbers, and eventually a secretary, who spoke several languages. Now he is a contractor and multimillionaire with an estate of his own—a grand house with a central courtyard and a swimming pool, vegetable gardens, and every kind of fruit tree imaginable. There are geese, ducks, and turkeys running around. He is an example of the many Spaniards who have done well from the tourist boom. Everybody who owned even the tiniest bit of land by the sea became a millionaire.</p>
<p class="summary">Andresito now lets his wife, Maria (her father was the village butcher), run the business while he paints, cooks, collects old recipes, and writes nostalgically about what life was like before tourism in the mountain interior and by the sea. Villages were small. Church bells rang to announce births, deaths, and weddings. People traveled by mule and cart. There was no electricity; they kept food cool in wells. Andresito’s grandmother never bought meat or fish, and she cooked chicken only once or twice a year. When a woman gave birth, the villagers boiled a hen and gave the woman the broth, and the men ate the meat. People ate wild rabbits, hares, and wild ducks. They caught small birds in nets and hunted game. Bullets were expensive, so they took used ones out of the game they shot and reused them. They went out at night with oil lamps to find snails in the vineyard.</p>
<p class="summary">They ate rice every day. The paella of the interior was made with wild things—rabbit, duck, snails, and water rat—and vegetables in season. Andresito’s father kept a pig or two. They cooked the meat, cut into pieces, slowly in its own fat, and kept it in jars. Once in a while, they would bring out a small piece from a jar and divide it among them; his mother always said she did not want any. His father had a milk brother (who was breast-fed by his mother) who kept goats and a few cows. The villagers came to him with bottles and clay jars to be filled with milk. Laborers walked to the fields at sunrise and returned home at sunset. They took their food with them and carried their wine in goatskin bags. Bread was the mainstay, and they used it instead of cutlery to pick up other morsels of food.</p>
<p class="summary">On our way from Alicia’s to Andresito’s estate, we passed through small mountain towns and villages, many of them walled, with the names of Berber tribes and the characteristic prefixes of “Ben” and “Al.” There had been a large population of Moriscos (see page 20). When they left en masse in the early seventeenth century, Alicante was repopulated mainly with people from Majorca and Ibiza, who took over their land and houses. The descendants of Moriscos who remained can be recognized today by the names, which came from the jobs—such as Ferrer (iron worker), Fuster (carpenter), Zapatero (shoemaker)—that their forebears took when they converted. The festival of Moros y Cristianos that is celebrated throughout the whole of Spain at different times of the year is, in Alicante, an extraordinary event that takes place in April, with a procession and a dramatic reenactment of battles between Moors and Christians in medieval costume. The area continued to have connections with North Africa, and it shows. When the French were in Algeria, the people of Denia on the Costa Blanca went there to work in the vineyards. More recently, Moroccans have been coming to Alicante to work in construction.</p>
<p class="summary">Tourism has not entirely destroyed the old life. The young, like Andresito’s sons, eat pizza and fast foods, but in the villages in the interior, they still cook traditional foods. Many families now live in small towns and keep a <span class="italic">casita</span> (rural house) with a small plot where they have fruit trees and grow vegetables and vines.</p>
