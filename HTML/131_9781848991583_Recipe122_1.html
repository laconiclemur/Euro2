<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_204"/><b>Earl Grey Rice Pudding</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Blackberry Marmalade</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Most of my childhood memories are great, except for rice pudding. My mom used to make it so often I did not want to eat it any more for a long time. But this recipe somehow brings it back to life. In the restaurant, we use carnaroli rice, which I think it is the perfect grain for it—strong enough, nutty enough, too. So cook the pudding very gently with all the other ingredients and it will taste delicious, but take note that I said gently. It must be cooked that way otherwise the grain will explode and the mixture burn if you have the heat too high. Then, of course, the lovely blackberry marmalade is perfect drizzled over the top to finish the dish.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE BLACKBERRY MARMALADE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1⅔ cups blackberries</p>
<p class="acktxta">¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE RICE PUDDING</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup carnaroli risotto rice</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 Earl Grey teabags</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sugar, or to taste</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Start by making the blackberry marmalade. Put the blackberries and sugar in a nonstick skillet or sauté pan over low heat and cook 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how soft the berries are, stirring occasionally, until there is not any juice left and the blackberries are fully cooked. You want the blackberries to release their juices as they cook so don’t be tempted to increase the heat. Eventually, they will dehydrate and turn into a marmalade.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, make the rice pudding. Put the rice, milk, cream and teabags in a saucepan, stir once to make sure all the rice is dispersed through the liquid, then bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and simmer 18 minutes, or until the rice is tender. You shouldn’t need to stir, but just check a couple of times.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Remove the pan from the heat. There should be a little liquid left in the pan. Remove the teabags and squeeze them over the saucepan so the liquid goes into the rice, but be careful not to tear the teabags. Only then do you add the sugar and fold it delicately into the cooked rice, adding a little more to taste. Keep turning the rice very gently about 5 minutes to cool it down.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Serve the rice topped with a spoonful of the fresh blackberry marmalade.</p>
