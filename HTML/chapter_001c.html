<h3 class="h3"><em>Braised Peppers and Olives</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>Red, yellow and sometimes orange peppers brighten any market shelf. To be honest, although I can never resist mixing the colours, I think the red have the best, most natural flavour. Often partially green where they haven’t completely ripened, some people leave them in the sun for a few days to finish them off, but I like them just as they are. When each one is individually shaped, bent and twisted, they are so full of flavour that when cut or broken they give off a powerful scent of chillies. This makes them very hard to skin, but as I become more of a cook and less of a chef I do this less often anyway</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>The olives and anchovies add a bit of bite and are a very traditional accompaniment. You could also serve these with fresh mozzarella or goats’ cheese and basil</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2 red peppers and 2 yellow peppers<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) red wine vinegar<br/>
50g (1¾oz) anchovies<br/>
16 black olives, stoned<br/>
1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut each pepper in half lengthways, remove the seeds and cut them in half again. Lay them skin side up on a roasting tray, and season well. Press the garlic cloves lightly but don’t crush them, and add to the peppers in the tray. Pour over the olive oil and vinegar, cover the tray with foil, and put it in the oven. Braise the peppers for 45 minutes until they are completely soft. Lift off the foil and transfer them to a bowl. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="normala">Next skin the peppers, but if any of the skins are really stubborn don’t worry too much. Just leave them, or you will end up with no peppers.</p>
<p class="normala">To finish the vinaigrette, remove the whole garlic cloves from the tray, and crush in a bowl. Whisk in the cooking juices, and season well with salt and cayenne pepper. Pour this over the roasted peppers and serve with the anchovies, olives and flat-leaf parsley.</p>
