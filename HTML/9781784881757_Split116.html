<p class="tx2"><b>Antonella Secciani, who showed us this recipe, cooks stews long and slow. She adjusts the heat to make sure the stew just quivers on the surface. When she was growing up she lived in a small village and there was a room, a <i>mattatoio</i> (a rudimentary butchers), where the wild boar were brought to clean, cut and distribute after a hunt. The best bit went to the person who shot it and the rest would be shared between them. It took around 20 men to kill one, maybe due to the fact that grappa was served frequently throughout the day!</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 8 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1.6 kg (2 lb 5 oz) wild boar stewing steak, cut into 3 cm (1¼ in) cubes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 garlic cloves, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) rosemary leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 teaspoons salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>180 ml (6 fl oz/¾ cup) extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2¼ cups) red wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 heaped tablespoons tomato purée (paste)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1.2–1.5 litres (2–2½ pints/5–6½ cups) <a href="9781784881757_Split17.html#page_34a">Beef Bone Broth</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split19.html#page_35a">Vegetable Stock</a>, or boiling water</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE MARINADE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 onion, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 long sprig of rosemary</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 carrot, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon juniper berries</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>750 ml (25 fl oz/3 cups) red wine</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl with the wild boar. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge. The following day, remove the meat from the marinade and discard everything but the meat.</p>
<p class="tx">Make a <i>battuto</i> from the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper (see <a href="9781784881757_Split13.html#page_29a">battuto</a>). This time when making the <i>battuto</i>, as it is a large quantity, you can make it with the oil in a food processor, if you have one, to form a coarse paste.</p>
<p class="tx">Pour the oil and <i>battuto</i> into a large heavy-based saucepan and put it over a low heat. Add the marinated wild boar to the pan and stir through. Cook for 30 minutes or so until the water has evaporated from the meat.</p>
<p class="tx">Add the wine, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Continue to cook for about 10 minutes until the scent of wine has disappeared. Dissolve the tomato purée in the stock or water and pour into the pan. Cover and cook on a low heat for 2½–3 hours or until the meat is very tender. Add a little more stock or water from time to time if it looks dry. Remove the lid for the last hour of cooking, to concentrate the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Serve with soft <a href="9781784881757_Split20.html#page_37">polenta</a>, cannellini beans (see <a href="9781784881757_Split28.html#page_44">how to cook beans</a>) or mashed potato.</p>
