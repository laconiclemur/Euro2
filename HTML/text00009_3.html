 CAYENNE EGGS BENEDICT</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0000560">
<em>This is one of my favourite café breakfasts, for the kind of day when I’ve rushed out with just hot tea inside me and the intention to shamelessly shop and then ease the guilt by ordering something delicious, warm and filling. But it’s also a recipe that I love to cook at home, when I have someone special over for breakfast or just want to prove to myself that I can do it as well as any café. My method simplifies the two slightly more time-consuming (some may say tricky!) elements – the poached egg and the hollandaise – helping you save time and face for when you have someone to impress (even if it’s just yourself!).</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Bring a litre of water to the boil in a small pan and leave on a medium heat.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000574">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, get a cup that is big enough to house an entire egg and a piece of cling film about 23cm square (or big enough to fit the inside of the cup). Push the cling film inside the cup.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000575">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Spray the inside generously with oil – this will stop the egg sticking to the cling film. Crack the egg into the cling film-covered cup. Seal it in by tying up the top and repeat with the second egg.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000576">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 At this point, I become mesmerized by the look of a raw egg encased in cling film! Once you’ve finished admiring this sight, place the egg parcels in the pan of hot water for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000577">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Have a bowl of cold water ready. When the eggs have been in the pan for 5 minutes, lift them out and immerse in the cold water.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000578">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Toast the muffin halves lightly until crisp around the edges. Butter them and place on your serving plates.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000579">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a medium pan and put on a medium heat. Add the rashers and cook them for 5 minutes, turning when required. They should be lightly crisp.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000580">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Put 3 rashers on each buttered muffin half.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000581">
<span class="red">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Get a bowl of hot water ready. Take the eggs out of the cold water, cut off the top of the cling film and unwrap. Dunk the eggs in the hot water for 30 seconds to rewarm them. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper, then place carefully on top of the rashers.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000582">
<span class="red">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, put the mayonnaise, milk, cayenne pepper and vinegar into a small pan. Stir on a low heat until the sauce is warm, check the seasoning, then spoon over the poached eggs. Sprinkle with chopped chives and a little more cayenne, if you like.</p>
