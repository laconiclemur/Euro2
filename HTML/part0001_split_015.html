			<p class="rec-intro">Velouté means velvety in French and that is the texture this soup should have. You can adapt the recipe for different shellfish, according to what is available and your preferences, but do always include mussels and clams as they are the base of the soup. Whelks, scallops and lobster also work really well. </p>

			<p class="body">Wash the mussels, cockles and clams in cold water. Trim and clean the squid, removing the ‘beak’ and innards from each one – your fishmonger will do this for you if you prefer. Slice the bodies into rounds and keep the bunches of tentacles whole. Peel the langoustines and discard their shells. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the clams and mussels in separate pans over a high heat, dividing the wine equally between each pan. Cover and leave to cook for 4–6 minutes, depending on the size of the shellfish, then drain and keep the juice. Be careful not to overcook them or they will go chewy. Sear the squid in a very hot pan for 30 seconds.</p>
			<p class="body">Pick out the meat from the clams and mussels and divide this and the rest of the seafood between the soup bowls. Strain the juice through a fine sieve into a pan and place it over a high heat. When it boils, add the double cream and crème fraiche and bring it back to the boil. Season well and add the lemon juice, then pour the hot soup over the clams and the rest of the seafood. Grate a little nutmeg on top and serve immediately. </p>
