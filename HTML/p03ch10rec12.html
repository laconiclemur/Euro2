<p class="summary"><span class="bi">I had heard a lot on my travels about peasant lives and peasant cooking</span> from people whose parents—or who themselves—had been subsistence farmers or landless laborers. I wanted to hear what the landowning elite had to say about food. I was going to Seville, so my friend Alicia suggested I phone Marina Domecq, a member of the famous sherry family. Marina gave me her cousin José María Conde de Ybarra’s telephone number; she said he was the ultimate gourmet and gastronome. We met at the Hotel Alfonso XIII in the center of the city. I recognized the bon vivant, a large man with a beautiful smiling face.</p>
<p class="summary">Count Ybarra lives in the prestigious residential development of Sotogrande in Cadiz with his wife and young son, and they also have a home in Seville and an old converted oil mill on their country estate. The Ybarra family company produces and exports all manner of products, from olives and olive oil to mayonnaise and sauces and preserves, all over the world. Count Ybarra inherited his title as the eldest son, but he does not run the company. His main interest is food. He is a member of a gastronomic society, Tercos y sordos (the stubborn and the deaf), in which members cook for one another and compete for excellence; it was nominated the best in Europe. He enjoys cooking for friends and neighbors on the coast, many of them British aristocrats and celebrities. He radiates pleasure when he describes what he cooks. I filled pages and pages with notes about dishes and techniques as we went from one tapas bar to another over three days in Seville.</p>
<p class="summary">I asked Count Ybarra if his ancestors had obtained their land by helping to conquer it from the Moors. No, he said, they were a Basque family who became rich from coal and shipping during the industrial revolution in northern Spain. In the 1840s, the eldest son, José María Ybarra Gutiérrez de Caviedes, came to Andalusia and bought Church land that was being sold off. He planted olive trees and started exporting olives and olive oil to Latin America. He also farmed sturgeon for caviar in the Guadalquivir River. He became mayor of Seville and received a title for his philanthropy—he built hospitals and paid for public works, including covering many streets with cobblestones. He is remembered for having initiated the most popular festival of Seville, the spring Feria, when everyone comes out to dance, eat, and drink.</p>
<p class="summary">The Andalusian aristocracy doubled during the nineteenth century, when the old aristocracy was joined by newly ennobled industrialists and men grown rich in the Americas. Investors and industrialists from northern Spain and Catholics from other European countries had been invited to settle in Andalusia since the late eighteenth century. The Belgians controlled lead mines, the French the coal mines. British wine merchants settled in an area around Cádiz that produced fortified wines for which there was great demand in England. The production of sherry was in the hands of a small group of families. Among them were the González family and the Barbadillos; the Domecqs, who came from France; and the Byasses, Garveys, and Osbornes, who were all British. These leading dynasties intermarried and formed a wine aristocracy. Around it developed a closed social world of trilingual grandees. Some of them were brought up by English nannies and sent to Irish convent schools. The aristocracy and landed proprietors combined in a class that owned olive groves and vineyards and bred Arabian horses and fighting bulls.</p>
<p class="summary">Jacobo Martínez de Irujo, son of the duchess of Alba, to whom Count José María is related, once said that “the [Spanish] aristocracy no longer exists as a class, neither economically, nor socially, nor culturally.” Perhaps that is so, but their unique Hispano-cosmopolitan cuisine, with its English and Gallic touches, has not disappeared in Andalusia. Many of the large wineries have been taken over by multinationals, but the bread-and-butter puddings, the stuffed turkeys, and the sauces with sherry and brandy remain within the families, like a secret cuisine. On special occasions, such as horse races on the beach, people can go from one group of picnickers to another and taste the foods of other families. Count Ybarra knows all the best dishes of Spain, but he remembers nostalgically the ones his mother taught their cook, Teresa. Several recipes in this book were inspired by him.</p>
