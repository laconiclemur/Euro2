<p class="nonindent" id="p1"><span class="dropcaps2line">W</span>HETHER YOU TRAVEL to Valencia on the Mediterranean, to Galicia on the Atlantic, or to Castile in the heartland, a trip to Spain is a culinary pleasure. Choose at random a fancy restaurant, a humble tavern, or a roadside bar anywhere in the country and you will be surprised by the quality of the food. You’ll be truly fortunate, though, if you are invited to dine in a private house. In the following pages, we will sneak into home kitchens across Spain to see what’s on the stove, because everybody eats well in my country.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p2">When speaking of Spanish food, I refer to the cuisines, rather than the cuisine, of Spain because diversity—rooted in history and preserved by geography—is an integral part of the culinary culture. More than five hundred years ago, before the marriage of Fernando of Aragón and Isabel of Castile and the unification of their respective kingdoms established the territory of Spain as we know it today, a string of independent kingdoms was spread across the Iberian Peninsula. The discrete cultures took great pride in their distinctiveness, maintaining unique languages and dialects, social customs, and culinary traditions. Indeed, in many instances regional cuisines themselves were—and continue to be—diverse; the favorite Sunday dish in one village was typically a different dish in a village just a few miles away.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p3">Even today, the varied terrain of the peninsula helps sustain regional differences. The third largest country in Europe, Spain is also the third most mountainous (after Switzerland and Austria), and it includes two archipelagos. There are snowy peaks in the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada a short distance from beaches and deserts in Almería; green pastures for cattle in Galicia and throughout the north; orange groves in Levante; wetlands with rice plantations around the Ebro delta; thousands of miles of coastline on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic; a central plateau, where Madrid reigns as the highest capital in Europe; and vast stretches planted with grapes, olives, and almonds nearly everywhere. A diverse climate also contributes to regional differences. In the winter, when temperatures in the interior are often below freezing, the islands, the coast, and the south enjoy relatively mild weather. Summers are typically scorching hot and dry on the central plateau and cooler along the northern and southern coasts.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p4">Some characteristics, however, transcend the regional distinctions. For example, all Spaniards, no matter their culinary tradition, consider quality to be of paramount importance. Because we are blessed with extraordinary products from the sea and the land, we have come to expect the finest ingredients, and we are demanding when stocking our pantry and refrigerator. We press more olive oil than any other country in the world, and our oils have magnificent flavor. Our wines rank among the best produced anywhere; our fishing fleets navigate <a id="pagexii"/>every ocean on earth; the fresh produce from our various microclimates is outstanding; our unique hams are food for the gods; and our exceptional canning industry supplies us with seasonal products year-round.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p5">We Spaniards have also been spoiled by our devoted mothers, who take family nourishment seriously. No shortcuts are allowed; every dish is artfully prepared with loving care and according to nearly sacred culinary rules that have been passed down through generations. Watch an average Spanish housewife buying in the market: she will make sure the lettuce leaves are green and crisp; select the most gorgeous seasonal vegetables from the region (<span class="italic">del pais</span>, as we say); and ask the butcher for this or that cut from a superb selection of veal, beef, lamb, or pork. And she does all this because she is knowledgeable, because she cares, and because taste is of primary importance to her and her family.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p6">In Spain, as elsewhere, culinary trends and products travel faster today. Efficient transportation, television cooking shows, culinary magazines, and, of course, cookbooks from other regions and countries allow individuals access to food products, information about cooking techniques, kitchen tools and equipment, and recipes from far away. But even though you may be served gazpacho in a home or restaurant in the Basque Country, the dish remains singularly Andalusian. The same is true for paella, which, although cooked all over Spain, is indisputably the flagship of the Valencian kitchen. Once I tasted a fantastic <span class="italic">bacalao al pil-pil</span> in Madrid, but you are more likely to have the best one in the Basque Country, its place of origin.</p>
<p class="center" id="p7"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L02_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p8">The recipes in this book can be combined in countless ways to create the delicious meals served in homes throughout Spain. Beyond strong regional traditions, Spaniards have a shared culinary heritage: many dishes belong everywhere, and are cooked and enjoyed with the same passion nationwide. But, when a dish has a distinct origin, even if it is now common to all of Spain, I indicate its provenance next to the recipe title. I want you to be able to assemble with ease a Catalan, Basque, or Andalusian meal should you decide to delight a guest from Spain or elsewhere with the dishes of a particular region.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p9">The recipe chapters are ordered according to the sequence in which I suggest you serve the dishes. But what I have often classified as a first course could certainly be served as a main course; conversely, certain main courses can, in small portions, be served as tapas. A book of this kind—and I will use a wonderful analogy from my dear friend, famed gastronomist Ismael Diaz Yubero—should not try to teach a painter to mix his colors; it should instead provide the information necessary to take up a palette and get started. It is in this spirit that I offer you my recipes.</p>
