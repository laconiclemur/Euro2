 Imeruli Khachapuri</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">-IMERULIAN CHEESE BREAD-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Perhaps the most iconic of all Georgian dishes, there are as many varieties of cheese bread as there are families in Georgia. I have included other versions later in this book, but, for me, this is the one that reminds me most of home. Because of the importation laws surrounding unpasteurized dairy products, it is impossible to find Imeretian cheese in the UK, and when I first arrived it took me a long time to find an alternative that I was happy with. The combination of feta and mozzarella used here combines to give a lovely salty flavour and melts into tantalizing strings that reveal themselves when you cut into the bread. (Pictured on <a href="text00008.html#page_80">here</a>

<strong>Preparation time: 45 minutes</strong>

<strong>Cooking time: 10–15 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Makes 1 large bread to serve 6 people</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the dough:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">200 g/7 oz/generous 1½ cups plain (all-purpose) flour</p>
<p class="side">¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</p>
<p class="side">125 g/4 oz/½ cup low-fat natural yogurt</p>

<p class="side1">1 tsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">125 g/4½ oz/generous ¾ cup feta cheese (preferably Turkish), crumbled</p>
<p class="side1">125 g/4½ oz/generous 1 cup grated mozzarella cheese (buy pre-grated cheese as the balls of mozzarella are too moist)</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>To serve:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side1">melted butter, to serve</p>
<p class="para1">To make the dough, sift the flour and bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) into a large bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">In another large bowl, place the yogurt, egg yolk, lemon salt, melted butter and sunflower oil and mix until combined.</p>
<p class="para1">Tip the sifted flour mixture into the wet ingredients and bring together to form a rough dough with your hands, then knead gently until it is smooth and pliable. If the dough sticks to your hands, add a touch more flour.</p>
<p class="para1">Lightly grease a clean bowl with sunflower oil and transfer the dough to it. Set aside, covered, for around 30 minutes to allow the dough to rest. Because this is not a yeasted bread, the dough will not rise during this time.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7 and lightly flour a shallow 23-cm/9-inch round cake pan.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the dough has rested, lightly flour a work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Use your hands to flatten the dough into a rough circle, then use a rolling pin to roll it into a large round, around 5-mm/¼-inch thick and roughly the size of the prepared cake pan.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_79"></a>
 Combine the 2 cheeses for the filling in a bowl, then pile the mixture into the centre of the dough circle, leaving a clear 5-cm/2-inch border of dough around the filling.</p>
<p class="para1">Now, working as fast as you can, bring the sides of the dough up over the filling to meet at the top and press the edges together to seal the dough and enclose the cheese. Gently pat the dough to smooth it as much as possible.</p>
<p class="para1">Invert the sealed dough ball into the prepared cake pan so that the seam is now on the bottom. Press the dough down to flatten it and spread to the edges of the cake pan; this will ensure that the cheese is spread evenly inside the bread once it is baked.</p>
<p class="para">Place the bread in the preheated oven and leave to cook for 10–15 minutes, until golden brown. Place on a serving platter and brush with the melted butter. Slice into 6 generous pieces and serve warm.</p>

<p class="para">Lightly grease a large frying pan (skillet) and place over a high heat. Once hot, reduce the heat to medium and, working with one bread at a time, invert the breads into the pan so that their tops are in contact with the pan’s base. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until just golden. Once all the breads have been browned, transfer them to the oven for 10–15 minutes to finish cooking. Serve hot from the oven.</p>

 Kubdari</h3>

<em>Spiced beef and pork bread from the valley of Svaneti</em>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>The historic region of Svaneti is situated in the north west of Georgia. It is an ancient land famous for its medieval villages and stone towers. Svaneti is amazingly beautiful and mysterious, featuring harsh living conditions and hardy people. The region is famous for producing a kind of salt which is mixed with spices and crushed on a wooden mortar. It is also famous for</strong>
 <em>kubdari</em>
 .</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>My first memory of this amazing place will always stay with me. We had a family friend who was from Svaneti. One day he said he wanted to take us for a few days’ vacation to his homeland, and I was very excited because I had never been to that part of Georgia before. We went by helicopter with a group of friends. When we landed, our friend asked me to walk with him to the house instead of taking the car with the rest of the group. We landed in the most incredible valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides. This big man who had always seemed so strong and unbreakable turned into a little boy who starting gambolling down the hills, touching the trees and telling his childhood stories.</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>He closed his eyes and walked through the wood towards his house, relying on his memories of the landscape to guide him home. It was as if nature recognised him and welcomed him home. It was the first time in my life that I witnessed such a transformation from a man to a boy.</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>I spent the most amazing few days there, being introduced to the Svan way of life with its delicious food. I particularly remember</strong>
 <em>kubdari</em>
 <strong>and</strong>
 <em>chvistari</em>
 .</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>On the way back, he asked the pilot if he could co-pilot the helicopter, and the pilot granted his wish (anything is possible in Georgia). On this journey he told us of the legend of Mountain. Deer make their home on this mountain, and there were parts of the landscape where man has never trod. With the pilot’s permission, he landed the helicopter on top of the mountain, telling us that it had been his dream since he was very young to reach the top of the mountain. There was a moment when I looked in his eyes and I saw that if he died now he would have no regrets. He returned my stare, smiling, and said ‘We fly high. We fly with eagles. Above is only god.’</strong>

<h2 class="h2a">-MOZZARELLA, CHILLI AND MINT ROULADE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>The technique required to make this dish can take time to master because it requires a certain amount of feel and intuition. Do persevere though, as the reward is more than worth the effort, and the alchemy of transforming mozzarella and milk into something new is still thrilling to me, despite having been making this dish for years. The subtle, milky flavour of the mozzarella is cut through with a fiery mint and chilli paste that can be adjusted to suit your tastes.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 25 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 20 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz mozzarella cheese, drained and sliced</p>
<p class="side">1 bird’s eye chilli, finely chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp sea salt</p>
<p class="side">1 bunch fresh mint, leaves chopped</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="side1">200 g/7 oz/1 scant cup sour cream</p>
<p class="para1">Put the milk in a large pan over a medium heat. When the milk starts to steam, turn the heat to low and add the mozzarella cheese to the pan. Continue to heat, stirring continuously, until the cheese comes together into a large, stringy ball. Strain the pan through a sieve (strainer) into a bowl, saving the leftover milk to use later. Transfer the cheese ball to a lightly greased chopping board and roll it out to a thickness of 5 mm/¼ inch, being careful that it does not break. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the chilli, salt and three-quarters of the mint in a large mortar and grind with a pestle to a smooth paste. Spread this paste over the mozzarella to just coat, reserving the leftover paste to use later. Working from one of the widest edges, roll the cheese as tightly as you can to create a long cylinder. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the ricotta cheese, sour cream and a little of the leftover milk in a large bowl and use an electric whisk to beat until smooth, adding more milk if the mixture is too thick. Add the remaining mint paste to the mixture and beat again to incorporate. Transfer to a large, shallow serving platter.</p>
<p class="para">Slice the rolled mozzarella into 5-cm/2-inch rounds. Spoon 1–2 tablespoons of the sauce onto plates and place a few of the rolled mozzarella rounds, spiral-side up, in the sauce. Scatter over the remaining mint leaves and serve.</p>

 Shemzvari Sulguni</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">-FRIED SULGUNI 2 WAYS-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>A friend of mine owns a hotel in the Kakheti (east Georgia) called Chateau Mere, and is always sending me recipes that her team create in the restaurant. Fried sulguni is a common dish in Georgia but this recipe has a twist in that it uses basil and tarragon. In Georgia, this would be made with sulguni, a brined cheese with a salty and slightly sour flavour but, because of the limitations on the importation of unpasteurized cheese, it is nearly impossible to get sulguni in the UK. Halloumi makes an excellent substitute. I prepare this in two ways, one soft and melty and the other with a bit of crunch. I can’t pick between them so have decided to share both with you here.</strong>
</p>
<h3 class="h3c">1. SHALLOW-FRIED SULGUNI WITH FRESH HERBS</h3>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 10 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 10 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">3 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side">600 g/1 lb 5 oz halloumi cheese, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="side">1 small handful fresh tarragon, leaves chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 small handful fresh basil, leaves torn</p>
<p class="side">2 spring onions (scallions), sliced</p>
<p class="side1">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>

<p class="para1">Flip the halloumi in the pan to cook the other side, then scatter over the fresh herbs, spring onions (scallions) and garlic. Cover the pan and leave to cook, covered, for 3 minutes, until soft and golden on both sides.</p>
<p class="para1">I like to place the hot pan in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in, but you could transfer to a serving plate if you prefer.</p>

 2. HERB-STUFFED SULGUNI WITH CRISPY BREADCRUMBS</h3>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 30 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 10 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">600 g/1 lb 5 oz halloumi cheese, cut into bite-sized triangular wedges – try to source very light, low-salt halloumi cheese if possible</p>
<p class="side">1 small handful fresh tarragon, leaves chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 small handful fresh basil, leaves torn</p>
<p class="side">2 eggs, beaten, in a bowl</p>
<p class="side">100 g/3½ oz panko breadcrumbs, in a bowl</p>
<p class="side1">3 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="para1">Using a sharp knife, cut a deep pocket into the longest edge of each of the wedges of halloumi, then stuff with a mixture of the fresh herbs. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the bowl of beaten eggs and the bowl of breadcrumbs on a work surface. Then, working with one piece of cheese at a time, dip the cheese into the egg and then roll in the breadcrumbs. Transfer to a plate while you finish the rest of the cheese. Transfer the prepared cheese to the fridge to rest for 15 minutes, but do not discard the bowls of egg and breadcrumbs as you will need them again.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the cheese has rested, remove it from the fridge and place it on the work surface next to the eggs and breadcrumbs. Again, working with one wedge at a time, dip the cheese in the egg one more time followed by the breadcrumbs. This double coating ensures that the breadcrumb coating is extra crispy once the cheese is fried. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para">Place the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Once hot, add the halloumi to the pan and cook for 2 minutes on each side, until all the edges are golden and crispy. Transfer to a serving plate and serve hot.</p>
