Sea fish, which as the name implies, live in the sea and include fish such as rosefish, haddock, cod, turbot, brill and halibut, plaice, pollack, sole, tuna fish, salmon, mackerel and herring. After being caught, the fish are chilled on ice (not frozen) and immediately dispatched to the shops. In the case of longer fishing trips the fish are processed on board the fishing boat (for instance, filleted) and deep-frozen.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Freshwater fish live in rivers, streams, lakes and ponds and include eel, pike, rainbow trout, salmon trout, carp, whitefish, zander, tench and catfish. Freshwater fish are often kept live in a small water-tank before being killed to ensure freshness.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Characteristics of freshness</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To check that a fish is fresh, make sure that:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1. the eyes are clear and firm with outward-curved lenses.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. the gills are brilliant red without mucus (lift the gills slightly to see underneath).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3. the skin is very shiny and covered with transparent mucus (this turns blue in the stock when cooking).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 4. the scales are firm.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 5. the smell is fresh (in the case of sea fish, it smells of seawater or seaweed).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">In the case of filleted fish or fish that has been cut up into pieces, it is more difficult to see whether it is fresh. The main criteria of freshness are a fresh smell and smooth, shiny flesh.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Deep-frozen fish is processed and frozen on the fishing boat immediately after being caught so that it is very fresh when it arrives in the shops.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Storage</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Fresh fish should be placed immediately on a glass or china dish (perhaps on a saucer turned upside down so that any liquid oozing from the fish can run away), cover with clingfilm and keep refrigerated. The fish should be cooked the same day if possible.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Deep-frozen fish stored at -18 °C/-0.4 °F can be kept for 2–5 months depending on the fat content (respect the bestbefore date). It will defrost at room temperature in just a few hours, after which it must be processed immediately.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparation of freshwater fish</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Usually freshwater fish is sold ready for cooking, in other words it will have been gutted, the scales partly removed, or filleted.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">To remove the scales</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1. Hold the tail of the fish firmly with one hand, if necessary using a towel or kitchen paper.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. Using a flat, broad knife or scaler, scrape off the scales going from the tail towards the head. The scales are less likely to go all over the place Fish and seafood Rosefish Plaice Pollack if you scrape them off under running water.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Removing the skin</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Example: sole</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1. Make an incision at the tail fin using a sharp knife.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. Hold the tail fin down with a cloth.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3. Pull the skin steadily in the direction of the head.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 4. Turn the fish over and repeat the operation on the other side.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Filleting fish</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Example: sole</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1. Having first removed the skin, cut the fish along the backbone from the head to the tail using a sharp knife.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. Carefully lift the two fillets from the bones using a flat knife.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3. Turn the fish over and remove the two fillets on the other side in the same way.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">In the case of round fish there are only two fillets:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1. Make a deep cut along the backbone from the head to the tail.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. Make an incision behind the gills.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3. Lift the complete fillet away from the bones.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 4. Using a knife, remove the bones from the fillet underneath.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 5. Remove the skin of the fillets using a knife. </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The three-step system</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">1 Cleaning</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Rinse the whole fish or fish fillets under cold running water (in the case of whole fish, rinse it inside and out) and pat dry. In the case of a whole fish which will be cooked in stock, be careful not to damage the mucous membrane when rinsing and wiping the fish dry.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">2 Pickling</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> In the past, fish used to be sprinkled with lemon juice, vinegar or white wine and left covered in the refrigerator to marinate for about 10–15 minutes. The purpose was to absorb the smell and firm up the flesh. Today pickling fish is no longer necessary because fresh fish correctly stored does not produce a fishy smell. Moreover, pickling has a tendency to dry out the flesh.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">3 Salting</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Whole fish and fish fillets should only be salted immediately before cooking because the salt draws out the fish juices, making the flesh dry. Fish which is going to be marinated should not be salted.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Fish smells</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Fish smells can easily be prevented by following a few simple rules:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Store the fish in a covered container in the refrigerator until it is used.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Wash your hands and all the objects which have come into contact with the fish in cold water, or better still, rub with lemon juice or vinegar.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Rinse used dishes in cold water first and only then wash them up carefully in hot water.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Cooking methods</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The following cooking methods are suitable for preparing fish:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Poaching in stock, braising, steaming, frying, baking, deepfrying and smoking.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Fish is cooked when:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • the fins and bones can easily be removed.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • the eyes bulge out and appear cloudy.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • the skin can easily be pulled off.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • the flesh separates in flakes when pressed with a fork.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Cockles/scallops/mussels</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cockles, mussels and oysters live in the sea. Their compressed bodies are surrounded by two shells which are held together on one side by a hinge-like joint. Their meat is tender and rich in protein but it goes off very quickly. This seafood is mostly available in the cooler seasons (the months with an “r”). There are also available deep-frozen or in cans. They are several kinds of these bivalves, for instance Pilgrim scallops, scallops, Venus mussels and common mussels.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Buying</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Only buy fresh mussels with closed shells. Throw away any that are already open because they are bad.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Fresh mussels have a fresh seawater smell.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparing mussels</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">1. Wash the mussels thoroughly in plenty of cold water and brush each one separately until it no longer feels sandy. Any mussels which open while being washed are not edible!</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. Remove any filaments.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3. Put the mussels in the boiling liquid, cover and heat (do not boil) for about 10 minutes until they open, stirring occasionally. Any mussels that do not open during this cooking process are not edible.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 4. Remove the mussels from the cooking liquid with a skimming ladle and arrange in a preheated dish.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Crustaceans</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Crustaceans are arthropods that live in stretches of water. The external skeleton is strengthened to varying degrees by deposits of calcium carbonate. Crustaceans discard their shells several times during the growing period. They breathe through gills. The shell contains a red dye that turns the shell of these brown-black animals a reddish colour.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Short-tailed crustaceans</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Deep-sea prawns, Norway lobsters, giant prawns, North sea prawns.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Removing prawns from their shells</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Hold the cooked prawn by the head in one hand and grasp the tail with the other.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Press the head and tail gently against each other, then twist and pull off the head.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Squeeze the shell gently and remove the meat from it.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • In the case of giant prawns or scampi, the intestines must also be removed. These look like dark filaments and are situated below the upper back. Pull the intestines out either with a knife or a wooden cocktail stick, or cut the prawn open along the back and remove the filaments of the intestines.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_73"></div>
