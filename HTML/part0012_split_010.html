  <h3 class="h3a">Christmas capon</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Capons are castrated roosters; larger than chickens but smaller than turkeys, they are eaten for Christmas in northern Italy, where they are bred specially for this time of year. Traditionally castrated on the day of Saint Rocco (16 August), the capons are then fattened up for four months. During this time they loose their rooster-like qualities, become calmer and more manageable, and develop more tender and succulent flesh. I really like capon and usually have one, stuffed with a mixture of seasonal fruits and nuts, for Christmas lunch.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 6</p>

  <p class="ing1">2kg/4lb 8oz capon</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">extra virgin olive oil, to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing">8 slices of pancetta</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the stuffing</p>

  <p class="ing1">140g/5oz dried apricots, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">140g/5oz prunes, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">12 walnuts, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz chestnuts, cooked and finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz salami, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of thyme leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">140g/5oz bread, soaked in a little lukewarm water, drained and roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing2">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup Marsala wine</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Rub salt and pepper all over the capon and inside the cavity and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Combine all the stuffing ingredients, season with salt and pepper to taste and use to fill the cavity of the capon. Drizzle a little olive oil in a roasting tin, add the capon, cover with pancetta slices and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Cover with foil and roast for 1½ hours, basting with the juices from time to time. Remove the foil and pancetta slices and roast for another 30 minutes or until thoroughly cooked. To test whether the capon is cooked, insert a skewer in the thigh – if the juices run clear, it is done.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Carve and serve with the stuffing.</p>
