<h2 class="h2b">CONFIT DE CANARD</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Duck Confit</em></h3>
<p class="normall0">Confit <em>of duck is normally more associated with the south-west of France, but it is nonetheless well featured and much loved in the cuisine of Provence. Whether it be to fry until crisp and serve with some well dressed leaves, or to warm and shred through a potato salad, duck</em> confit <em>is marvellous to have around. Buying duck fat is very expensive, but you can start by using vegetable oil which becomes more tasty each time you use it for this purpose</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 large duck legs<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) sea salt<br/>
1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed<br/>
About 500ml (18fl oz) duck fat or vegetable oil</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 110°C/225°F/Gas ¼.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the duck legs in a bowl and knead the salt, pepper and garlic in well. Cover and leave to marinate in a cool place for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="normala">Wipe any salt that hasn’t dissolved off the duck legs. Put them in a heatproof and ovenproof pan that just holds them. Cover with the fat or oil and bring almost (but not quite) to boiling point on top of the stove. Place in the preheated low oven and cook for 2–3 hours until the meat is almost falling from the bone.</p>
<p class="normala">Store the legs in the fridge, well covered in their cooking fat, where they will keep for up to a month. It is most important that they are completely covered by the fat so that they are thoroughly airtight.</p>
<p class="normala">To use, take the legs gently from the fat and wipe free of excess fat. Use as directed in individual recipes.</p>
