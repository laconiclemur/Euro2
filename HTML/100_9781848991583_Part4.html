<h6 class="h6"><b>Dishes that bring innovation and style to classic combinations of ingredients</b></h6>
<p class="normalw"><b>In these recipes, you’ll find a sense of originality, as I have taken ingredients that are classically put together, but combined them in innovative ways—in a kind of union, a friendship that can be achieved by modern association. There is more imagination in the construction of these dishes, so some might be more challenging to cook, but also more fun. I am sure your guests and family will enjoy these creative recipes.</b></p>
<p class="normalw"><b>There are some lovely ideas to discover in this chapter, from Smoked Duck and Lentils with Lavender (see <a href="102_9781848991583_Recipe93.html#pageid_154">page 154</a>) to Chocolate, Chili and Lemongrass Tart (see <a href="134_9781848991583_Recipe125.html#pageid_208">page 208</a>). You’ll find ingredients you might not have thought of putting together, but which will lift the dish and delight you when you taste them, so I am very much hoping you will try the recipes and give me some favorable feedback.</b></p>
