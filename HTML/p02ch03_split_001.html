</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">The vast Spanish interior that encompasses Castile and León,</span> Castile–La Mancha, Madrid, and Extremadura is a high plateau, the Meseta, bordered and divided into two by mountain ranges and crossed by great rivers. Before roads were built a few decades ago, it was difficult to enter—travelers came by horse or mule—and empty of people. It is the “dry Spain,” with the typical continental climate of extremely cold winters, unbearably hot summers, and hardly any rain, with no sea to soften the harshness. The predominant vegetation is treeless wild entanglements of thorny scrub, but there are grasslands in the river basins, and the mountains are cloaked in dense woodlands. The Romans planted wheat and barley on the plains and grapevines on the hillsides and valleys, making the Meseta a land of bread and wine. Agriculture consists mostly of small family farms that raise barley, wheat, grapes, sugar beets, and legumes. Chickpeas, lentils, and beans that need little water are major crops. Many also raise poultry and livestock, and almost all farm families have at least one or two pigs. Fruit and vegetables are grown in irrigated areas by the rivers.</p>
<p class="para">Although central Spain covers a huge area, there is little culinary diversity. Centuries of struggle against the Muslims had a profound effect on its culture and gastronomy. The area was the frontier zone during the eight-centuries-long struggle between the Christian kingdoms of the north and the Muslim kingdoms of the south. It was constantly at war: castles and fortified cities were won and lost, and kings were always on the move. Conquered lands were given over to the noble warlords and religious military orders on whom the kings depended for waging their wars. In such a world, ranching of sheep, cattle, and horses, which could be moved easily to new frontier settlements, was the primary activity. As new land was conquered and resettled, because of the new settlers’ inexperience in agriculture and the shortage of Muslim labor, cultivated lands were given over to sheep farming, and wool production became by far the most important part of the economy, providing the merino wool that was sold to Europe.</p>
<p class="para">Because of the arid environment, flocks and herds had to be moved huge distances from pasture to pasture. The necessity of driving the sheep and cattle from the north to the grasslands of La Mancha and Extremadura in the south was an important part of the push to conquer more territory from the Muslims. In the thirteenth century, a sheep-breeders’ guild, the Mesta, was formed by small sheep owners and a few great landlords and monasteries to organize the movement of the flocks that migrated seasonally and to ensure their protection from Muslim raids by knights and religious military orders. Large monasteries, many of which are now <span class="italic">paradores</span> (state-run hotels), are a reminder today of the warrior monks—the Knights Templars and Hospitalers, the orders of Calatrava, Alcántara, and Santiago—who fought for and then colonized the new frontiers for the Castilian kings. Like the huge and ever-growing nobility, they raised sheep, but they also had a strong interest in horticulture. They had vegetable gardens, orchards, and vineyards; they kept bees; and they made honey, wine, and cheese.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p104.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">As territory was regained, pork, forbidden in Muslim times, became the popular meat, and hog raising was taken up in a big way, especially in Extremadura, around Salamanca, and in the Andalusian interior. Pigs were left to forage on mushroom and acorns in the oak forests (<span class="italic">dehesas</span>) prevalent in these parts, giving the meat its distinctive flavor. Families without land were allowed to bring their pigs to feed on royal or common lands.</p>
<p class="para">The ascetic life and attitudes born under the hard frontier conditions and inhospitable climate changed little over the centuries. Life for shepherds and peasants was especially harsh. The simple and austere dishes they survived on are still with us; they are mainly winter stews. Elegantly restrained dishes of roast lamb and pork—the grandest being roast suckling pig and baby lamb, which are still offered today—were the status foods of the nobility and grandees. The wildlife, like the land, belonged to the nobility. The small game—partridge, pheasant, pigeon, quail, hare, and rabbit that inhabited the scrub and fed on wild herbs and berries—and the deer and wild boar of the woodlands were all theirs (though poachers had access to them). Shepherds and peasants got the “ignoble cuts”—feet, ears, heads, brains, tails, tripe. They cooked them with chickpeas, lentils, and beans. While central Spain is characterized as “the Spain of the roast,” <span class="italic">España del asado,</span> the festive peasant foods are stews, <span class="italic">platos de cuchara</span> (literally “spoon dishes”), that you eat with a spoon. Today these and the iconic foods of shepherds and peasants based on bread crumbs, <span class="italic">migas,</span> are extremely popular.</p>
<p class="para">In the seventeenth century, when famine spread throughout the peninsula, and wool was no longer in demand, the sheep breeders took up cereal farming. Pasturelands were given over to grain, and the sheep began to be bred for their meat and cheese rather than for wool. They were raised on the stubble of the cereal grasses and on barley, oats, and vetch. The migration of sheep (transhumance) became unnecessary. But still today, in celebration of the long sheep-walks (<span class="italic">cañadas</span>) and the rights granted to the Mesta in the fifteenth century, flocks cross the center of Madrid once a year.</p>
<p class="para">There is in parts of central Spain an exotic culinary heritage that is a legacy of the Muslims and Jews. Christians met them at the market, bought their food, and enjoyed their hospitality. Many Muslims and Jews remained after the expulsion of 1492, as converts to Christianity, and the Jews in particular melted into the population. The <span class="italic">pistos</span> and eggplant dishes, the <span class="italic">cocidos,</span> the liberal use of garlic, roast baby lamb cooked in a clay dish accompanied only by a green salad, almond sweets, and cheese served with honey are all part of the cosmopolitan culture the Castilians encountered when they first moved into Toledo.</p>
<p class="h">CASTILE AND LEÓN</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The ancient kingdom of León, which once encompassed Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, and Castile in the north, took up the torch of the Reconquista from the Asturian kings. Castile was a province of León. Its name derives from the vast number of castles that were built to defend the land. Castile split from León in the early eleventh century, and the two kingdoms were often at war and periodically united by conquest or royal marriage, until they were finally reunited in 1230. Today the region of Castile and León is studded with enchanting medieval cities, each with a Gothic cathedral and scores of Romanesque churches and monasteries, a reminder that those wars were about defending Christianity.</p>
<p class="para">Castile and León, also known as Castilla la Vieja (Old Castile), is a vast unending plain on the northern Meseta, a silent and austere landscape of rolling wheat fields and scrub, surrounded by the Montes de León in the north and the Sistema Central range in the south, with fertile valleys watered by the Duero River and its tributaries and lakes. The climate is dry, baking hot in summer, freezing cold in the long winter. But in the north in the mountains of León, it is rainy and green.</p>
<p class="para">Wheat is the main crop, and bread is the symbol of Castile, which was known as the breadbasket of Spain. Bread was the basis of the food of shepherds and peasants. Among these dishes are <span class="italic">sopa de ajo,</span> a soup of bread and garlic (page 178), and an endless variety of <span class="italic">migas,</span> bread crumbs with ham, chorizo, bacon, or blood sausage (see page 476). Communal bread ovens, where townspeople could bring their breads to be baked, were used into the twentieth century. No other region produces as many and as wide a variety of legumes: white, red, and black beans; lentils; and chickpeas. The small <span class="italic">pedrosillano</span> chickpeas are the most common ingredient in peasant stews, which also include cabbage. The huge white <span class="italic">la granja</span> beans (<span class="italic">granja</span> means “farm”) from around Segovia are the region’s most prized beans, famously cooked with pig’s ears and sausages (page 497). Soups and stews with beans or chickpeas and pork products—sausages, pig’s ears and feet—are now still everyday meals in the long winter months.</p>
<p class="para">Castile and León is pastoral ranching country. The Morucha breed of cattle, originally raised for the plow and the bullring around Salamanca, is now primarily raised for beef, while Ávila is famous for the veal from its indigenous Avileña black breed of cows. The two most common breeds of sheep are the Churra and the Castellana. Their meat has a distinctive and delicious taste, and cheeses from their milk include the intensely flavored, slightly sharp and salty Zamorano and Castellano and the Pata de Mulo (the name means mule’s leg). The fresh bland Burgos and Villalón are a mix of cow’s and sheep’s milk; their Del Tietar is goat cheese.</p>
<p class="para">The region is also one of Spain’s important hog-breeding areas. The dry, cool air of the highlands means that the <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> from white pigs requires only a light salt cure. Salamanca is famous for its magnificent ham and sausages from the small black Ibérico pig, variously known as <span class="italic">pata negra</span> (black foot) or <span class="italic">de bellota</span> if the pigs are fed on acorns (<span class="italic">bellotas</span>) in the woodlands. The <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (blood sausage) of Burgos, made with rice and onions, is particularly delicious. <span class="italic">Farinato</span> is a white sausage made with ground pork, bread crumbs, lard, and seasoning. The dishes that Castile and León is most famous for are roast suckling pig (<span class="italic">cochinillo</span>) and baby lamb (<span class="italic">lechazo</span>). It is said that baby lamb is at its meltingly tender best within the triangle of the cities of Segovia, Soria, and Burgos, and suckling pig is at its best in the area between Segovia, Arevalo, and Peñaranda de Bracamonte.</p>
<p class="para">The region is also hunting and shooting country. Wild boar is found in the mountain forests, roe deer in the national game preserve. Partridge, quail, hare, rabbit, and duck can be shot at game club reserves and on thousands of game estates. Partridge is the main Castilian game bird; its numbers are kept high by repopulation. Tender baby pigeons (squabs) are a traditional delicacy. You can still see curious <span class="italic">palomares</span> (dovecotes) in wheat fields, where the grains once provided ready seed for thousands of the birds.</p>
<p class="para">Except in León, there is not much culinary diversity in this largest of Spanish regions. You find similar dishes in all the towns—roast baby lamb served with green salad; bean and lentil stews; lamb with chickpeas (<span class="italic">olla podrida</span>); chicken in almond sauce (<span class="italic">pollo en pepitoria)</span> (page 357); partridge or quail in <span class="italic">escabeche;</span> rabbit or chicken with garlic. Among the many convent sweets, the <span class="italic">yemas de Santa Teresa</span> (page 575) made with egg yolk and sugar alone from Ávila are the most famous (see page 570).</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p107.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">León, in the mountainous north, on the pilgrims’ way to Santiago, a route once lined with dozens of hostels for pilgrims, has more gastronomic variety, with dishes similar to those of Galicia. La Margatería is the mountain homeland of the mysterious Maragatos, the muleteers who transported salt cod and other goods between the sea and the interior and who are whispered to be descendants of converted Muslims. They have distinctive dishes, and cherries in orujo, a powerful spirit, is a specialty.</p>
<p class="para">Astorga was one of the first places to manufacture chocolate in Europe, and it still does today. The cheeses of León are a strong-tasting goat’s-milk cheese called Armada and a blue cheese from Valdeón that is similar to the Asturian Cabrales.</p>
<p class="para">The region of Castile and León produces some of Spain’s best wines from vineyards along the river Duero. The prestigious red Ribera del Duero are delicious young and can age into splendid Gran Reservas. The majority of wineries use the native Tempranillo grape. A few mix in a small percentage of other grapes, such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Other top-quality local wines are the fruity red Toro, the Bierzo, the Cigales rosés, and the Rueda whites.</p>
<p class="h">MADRID</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Madrid, in the center of Spain, was a province of Castile–La Mancha until it became an autonomous community in 1983. The countryside is an area of changing landscapes, with cereal fields, mountains covered with forests, and rivers, lakes, and valleys. There are vineyards and wine villages, and wine-making is an old tradition. The purple-red Vinos de Madrid are very good fruity wines. A mature sheep’s milk cheese called Campo Real is produced here.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p108.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">The Fortress of Mayrit was reconquered from the Muslims in 1083 by King Alfonso VI of Castile, who took Toledo two years later. In 1561, the city of Madrid (which took its name from the fortress) was chosen by the Habsburg king Philip II to be the seat of his court and the permanent capital of Spain. Different quarters of the city reflect various periods of its history. The old medieval and Renaissance town center is the Madrid de los Austrias, built during the reign of the Habsburgs. The eighteenth-century Madrid de los Borbones (of the Bourbons) is luxurious, with grandiose monuments and Baroque and neoclassical palaces of the old aristocracy (some have been turned into hotels). There is the Romantic nineteenth-century Madrid Isabelino, and now a new ultramodern Madrid.</p>
<p class="para">As the capital of Spain, the city has drawn migrants from all the regions. In the past, it had attracted the aristocracy around the court. Today the inhabitants come from all over and their presence is evidenced by the huge number of restaurants representing every region. Overseas immigrants, mostly from Latin America, now form about one-sixth of the population. On warm weekend days, you can see some of these newer residents in the Párque del Oeste, where they set up stalls selling their homemade foods.</p>
<p class="para">Madrid is a city of civil servants, bankers, service providers, and painters. The old aristocracy is still there, too, so one might expect a sophisticated cuisine. But the region shares dishes with the rest of central Spain and has only a few of its own. The most famous is <span class="italic">cocido madrileño,</span> of pork and chicken with chickpeas, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, marrow bones, bacon, chorizo, and blood sausage (page 498). It is said to be a legacy of the wealthy Conversos (converted Jews) who married into the Castilian aristocracy—an old Sabbath dish into which the Jewish converts piled all kinds of pork to show that their conversion was real. Another specialty is <span class="italic">callos a la madrileña,</span> a “poor food” of tripe with tomato sauce.</p>
<p class="para">A Christmas specialty that is now cooked throughout the year and is also found elsewhere in the country is baked sea bream with slices of lemon embedded in cuts and a sprinkling of bread crumbs and parsley (page 323). And cafés and street vendors sell <span class="italic">churros</span> (crunchy ribbed strips of fried dough) and extra-thick hot chocolate (page 586).</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p110.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="h">CASTILE–LA MANCHA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The province of La Mancha covers most of the region of Castile–La Mancha, in the southern Meseta. It is the setting of Miguel de Cervantes’s <span class="italic">Don Quixote,</span> and the landscape is as Cervantes described it: rolling plains and low hills, for the most part desolate, arid, treeless, and covered with thorny scrub, but in parts mountainous with vast oak and pine forests, green pastures, rivers, and lakes. The climate is harsher and more extreme than that of the northern plateau, with intensely hot summers, very cold winters, and hardly any rain. Yet the region has always been an important agricultural zone, which still produces most of Spain’s wheat and half of its wine, and also olive oil. The old windmills that were used to grind flour, the kind that Don Quixote mistook for giants, dot the wide-open plains. Other crops are barley and corn, chickpeas and lentils, and beans and peas. La Mancha’s eggplants are famously delicious; its purple garlic is considered the best in Spain; its honey gets its flavor from the wild aromatic plants in the scrub; and its saffron, the dried stigmas of the <span class="italic">Crocus sativus,</span> is of the highest quality. The region also grows sugar beets, and sunflowers for their oil.</p>
<p class="para">The area was reconquered from the Muslims by the twelfth century. Castile’s frontiersmen, noble warlords, and military monastic orders were all big sheep owners, and sheep raising for merino wool became the pillar of the region’s economy. Sheep, shepherds, and cheese feature regularly in Don Quixote and Sancho Panza’s adventures. Today sheep are reared for meat and cheese, and the local Manchego is Spain’s most famous cheese. It ranges from fresh and creamy to mature and hard, slightly salty, and piquant. There is also Oropesa and Valle de Alcudia. Montes de Toledo is a goat’s-milk cheese.</p>
<p class="para">The wildlife includes deer, wild boar, rabbits and hares, partridges, and quail. The marshlands in the Guadiana River Basin are a stopping place for migratory and water birds. In the province of Toledo, where the red-legged partridge breeds, the most appreciated item on menus is <span class="italic">perdiz</span> (partridge). There are trout, barbel, and pike in the rivers.</p>
<p class="para">The cooking is like that in the rest of central Spain, featuring meat, offal and giblets, bread, and beans, and reflects the old medieval ascetic lifestyles. The grand status dishes—roast lamb, braised venison, and braised or stewed wild boar—are elegantly sober. Quail and partridge are prepared in simple ways, sometimes in <span class="italic">escabeche,</span> in a vinegary marinade, so as to preserve them. Only the <span class="italic">gazpachos</span> or <span class="italic">galianos</span> are over-the-top grandiose stews that include rabbit, hare, and pigeon all together in a bell pepper and tomato sauce; they are served on thin disks of fried unleavened bread with bits of fried dough to soak up the sauce. <span class="italic">Pisto</span> (page 254) is a combination of sautéed onions, peppers, eggplants, zucchini, and tomatoes, to which potatoes, ham, and eggs are sometimes added. <span class="italic">Asadillo</span> (page 236) is roasted red peppers simply dressed with garlic, tomato, and oil. Marinated eggplants can be found everywhere in central Spain, at fairs and taverns. <span class="italic">Mojetes</span> are potatoes sautéed with garlic, paprika, and tomatoes, to which an egg is sometimes added. Toledo’s marzipan (page 572) and almond pastries such as <span class="italic">marquesas</span> (page 574) are famous.</p>
<p class="para">La Mancha is the most extensive grapevine-growing region in Spain, perhaps in the world. Old photographs show peasants harvesting the grapes and carrying them in carts, treading them, dancing and laughing. They had a good time and it provided them with a living, but the wine they produced was characterless, in some cases plain awful, bulk wine. Now La Mancha produces some good wines at very competitive prices. Their whites from the old much-maligned Airén grapes are now crisp, light, and tasty. A number of fine reds are made with the indigenous Tempranillo grape (here also called Cencibel), with Monastrell and Garnacha Tintorera, mixed with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, or Merlot. Valdepeñas, also known as Aloque and Clarete, are a reborn classic, made by mixing white and red grapes.</p>
<p class="h">EXTREMADURA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Extremadura shares the southern plateau with Castile–La Mancha. It produces <span class="italic">jamón ibérico,</span> an incomparable delicacy and Spain’s greatest gastronomic treasure, from the small black Ibérico pig, which feeds on acorns in the oak woodlands. The hams are air-dried in the special microclimate of the Sierra de Montánchez for up to four years. The region also produces my very favorite Spanish cheese, the creamy, almost liquid Torta del Casar, made from the milk of merino sheep, which has a delicious slightly salty taste. You eat it with a spoon, first slicing a piece off the thin crust on the top, then putting it back on like a lid. Other high-quality products are extra virgin olive oils, honeys, and the famous smoked <span class="italic">pimentón de la Vera,</span> which comes in mild (<span class="italic">dulce</span>), bittersweet (<span class="italic">agridulce</span>), and hot (<span class="italic">picante</span>) varieties.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p112.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">Extremadura was never an independent kingdom. The Romans found silver mines there and the Muslims built fortified towns. When the area was reconquered in the thirteenth century, it became a province of Castile. The land was given over to nobles from Castile, León, and Galicia and to the knights of Santiago and Alcántara, the monastic military orders who organized its colonization. In the sixteenth century, because opportunities at home were limited in comparison with those in Castile, men of ambition left in great numbers for the Americas. The most famous conquistadores—Pizarro, Cortés, and Balboa, among others—as well as the majority of the early emigrants to the New World, came from Extremadura. Many who returned brought back riches and built mansions and palaces, emblazoned with their heraldic coats of arms. It is said that Extremadura was the first place that had chiles brought back from the Americas and that the monks were the first to grow them in their monastery vegetable gardens. In the mid-nineteenth century, farmers started to grow different varieties (from mild to hot) on a large scale. They dried them in barns heated by holm oak fires, which gave them a smokey flavor, then pulverized them into <span class="italic">pimentón,</span> the Spanish paprika that flavors chorizos and so many regional Spanish dishes.</p>
<p class="para">In this land of rolling plains, with fields of wheat, barley, corn, and chickpeas, great wooded mountains, and fertile valleys, sheep and pig farming was early on the most important part of the economy. Nobles owned extensive estates of agricultural and grazing lands. They sold their wool to Castilian merchants and rented their pastures in the winter to northern stock raisers. Small farmers could rent common lands owned by towns and villages for grazing animals and growing grapevines, fruits, and vegetables. They also had access to the royal lands, particularly the mountain woodlands that provided the sweet acorns that fattened their pigs. Monasteries and convents owned vineyards and olive groves in the hills. While the cooking of the region is serious and austere, known for pastoral and peasant dishes, with lamb, pork, and offal, the monasteries always had a reputation for fine cooking.</p>
<p class="para">Along with Torta del Casar, other good cheeses of Extremadura are the merino sheep’s-milk Cañarejal and La Serena and the goat’s-milk Ibores and Cabra del Tiétar. Like all Spanish regions, Extremadura has an old wine-making tradition. Ribera del Guadiana was one of the first wine areas in Spain to use modern refrigeration equipment to combat the extremely high summer temperatures. Their new fruity reds made with Tempranillo grapes and whites with Paradilla grapes are extremely reasonable. In some villages, such as Montánchez, the local Pitarra wine is fermented in clay pots called <span class="italic">tinajas</span> and kept in family cellars.</p>
