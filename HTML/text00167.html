 SALTED PRETZEL &amp; HAZELNUT BARK</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0001312">
<em>This bark may look complicated but it’s essentially just melted chocolate scattered with toppings. Easy, right? And the more creative you get, the fancier it looks. So let your imagination run wild. This is my favourite combination – bitter dark chocolate and sweet white chocolate marbled together, with saltiness from the twisted pretzels and nuttiness from the roasted hazelnuts. It’s lovely served as something sweet on the side, and also looks great broken into chaotic shards and used as decoration on top of a cake.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Start by melting the dark chocolate. I like to do this in the microwave in short bursts, stirring in between, or you can melt the chocolate in a bain-marie set over a pan of simmering water.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001319">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Line a baking tray with baking paper. Spread the melted dark chocolate on the paper in a thin and even layer, but making sure not to spread the chocolate <em>too</em>
 thinly.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001320">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Now melt the white chocolate in the same way as before and immediately dollop drops of the melted white chocolate on to the dark, using a skewer to marble the top and run the two colours together. Don’t be tempted to overdo it, or you will lose the marbled effect.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001321">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Now place the pretzels on top, making sure to push them in or they will pop out when you eventually cut the shards.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001322">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Sprinkle with the hazelnuts and leave to chill until the chocolate has set and is firm.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001323">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Using a sharp knife, cut the chocolate into shards.</p>
