<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">When I was a girl at boarding school in Paris, we often had the French Basque</span> piperade <span class="italic">for dinner. The fried onions, peppers, and tomatoes with eggs mixed in at the end looked a mess but tasted good. Modern Basque chefs roast the peppers and deconstruct the dish to make it more presentable and appetizing. That means more pans to wash, but it is worth it. And you can more easily double the quantities. Serve it with slices of toasted or fried bread.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2 TO 3</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, cut into ½-inch-thick slices</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="qun">1 small chile pepper, seeded and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 red bell pepper, roasted (see page 128), peeled, seeded, and cut into ½-inch-wide strips</p>
<p class="qun">1 green bell pepper, roasted (see page 128), peeled, seeded, and cut into ½-inch-wide strips</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon butter</p>
<p class="qun">4 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun1">3 or more slices <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> or prosciutto for garnish (optional)</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onion in the oil in a large skillet over low heat, stirring often, until soft and golden. Add the garlic and chile pepper and stir for a few seconds, then add the tomatoes. Add the sugar and salt and pepper to taste and cook for about 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have collapsed and the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the peppers. (You can do this well in advance and reheat the <span class="italic">piperada</span> when you are ready to serve.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Just before serving, melt the butter in a small skillet. Add the eggs, with a little salt. Let the eggs set slightly at the bottom over medium heat before gently turning and stirring them with a wooden spoon or spatula. Turn off the heat while there are still some runny parts—the eggs will continue to cook and will be done by the time you serve. They have to be creamy. Serve the <span class="italic">piperada</span> with the scrambled eggs on the side and the <span class="italic">jamón,</span> if using, heated under the broiler.</p>
