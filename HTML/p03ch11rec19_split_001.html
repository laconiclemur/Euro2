<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Asturias and Galicia were once the only regions, other than the Canaries and Murcia, where people ate the corn they grew. In the past they dried it and kept it in elevated stone grain stores, then ground it into a fine meal. The rest of Spain fed it to their animals. But in the hungry years during the civil war and afterward, many people made corn bread and ate</span> fariñes, <span class="italic">a cornmeal porridge that is like polenta. Some Spaniards remember nostalgically the way their grandmothers used to make it. They would cook the porridge for an hour or so, stirring it continually. Now we can use instant (precooked) maize cornmeal sold as polenta, which cooks in a few minutes.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In northern Spain, rural families had milk and butter from their cows and pork products from their pigs. For a treat, they served</span> fariñes <span class="italic">with fried bacon, chorizo, and</span> morcilla <span class="italic">(blood sausage). If you want to use them, slice the sausages and fry them and the bacon in a little oil, then serve them on top of the</span> fariñes<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">6½ cups water</p>
<p class="qun">2 teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups instant polenta</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="recsum">Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the salt, lower the heat, and gradually stir in the polenta with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring continuously, for 5 to 8 minutes, until the polenta pulls away from the sides of the pan. Stir in the butter.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Serve the <span class="italic">fariñes</span> in soup bowls and pass very hot milk for everyone to pour on top and let it seep in.</p>
