<p class="noindent2">Pity those who have never had the opportunity to go berry picking in the wild. To gather baskets and pails and head for the large mysterious forest where we as children, even in the middle of the day, imagined that behind the trees and hillocks, <i>hulder</i> and trolls were surely lurking. The lush woods and meadows at Nessodden where I grew up totally satisfied our family’s need for berries and our childhood imagination for play. Among my fondest memories of summer in Norway are our family’s berry-picking excursions. They included parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and children. We brought open-face sandwiches and drank water from the pristine, rushing brooks. Our dessert was fresh berries. We younger ones did not wait for dessert time for as soon as we saw the plants, heavy laden with berries, we rushed to taste them (like the children in the <i>Blueberry Outing</i>). At the end of the day our telltale blue-black teeth and lips were proof that possibly as many berries were eaten as had found their way into the pails we were supposed to have filled.</p>
<p class="indent">Another highlight was when we returned home and mamma made <i>pannekaker</i> (crepés) and blueberry soup from the berries we had gathered. During the week it was more blueberry soup, blueberry compotes, and fresh blueberries with milk (cream was a luxury) and sugar. And not many things tasted as good as mamma’s homemade bread with her homemade blueberry jam. Oops, guess we are talking about dessert.</p>
<p class="indent">Norwegians often enjoy fruit soups or compotes. Many revel in picking their own berries, (more so in days past than today), wild strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, lingonberries, and cloudberries. Norwegian children, like their elders, were excited when wild blueberries were ready to be picked. Alf Prøysen, Norway’s beloved folk songwriter, wrote this delightful song about berry picking in Norway; you can enjoy it in Norwegian or English.</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Blueberry Outing</span></p>
<p class="noindent5"><i>It was a pretty summer day when Pelle said to Kari, <br/>“Let’s go to the woods, they are brimming with berries! <br/>Let’s bring Lillebror, and Kjelleman and Mari <br/>there are plenty berries, mounds are everywhere. <br/>But we must have a gathering cup, and it must be large!” <br/>They all stormed into mother’s kitchen. <br/>And Pelle grabbed a milk pail, and Kari got a mug <br/>and Mari got a coffee cup and Kjell he got a cone. <br/>They ran towards the woods a glad and boisterous flock <br/>and Lillebror came last to gather berries in a lid. <br/>When they reached the woods they came to a plateau <br/>with blue on blue as far as their eyes could see. <br/>They sat down topsy turvy and ate until they were filled, <br/>then each found a mound, and shouted, “This one is mine!” <br/>“Let’s see whose cup will first be filled; all gave it a try!” <br/>The plateau resounded with “Kling” and “Pling” and “Plang.” <br/>First the milk pail sang, and then the mug clanged, <br/>something danced in the cup, and jangled in the cone, <br/>But from the smallest mound came a rush of “Plingelings” <br/>because Lillebror sat and picked berries in a lid.</i></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Blåbærturen</span></p>
<p class="noindent5"><i>Det var en deilig sommerdag at Pelle sa til Kari: <br/>“Nå går vi ut i skauen for det er så mye bær! <br/>Så får vi med oss Lillebror og Kjelleman og Mari <br/>for det er nok å ta av, det er mange tuer der. <br/>Men vi må ha en plukkekopp og den må være stor!” <br/>Så stormet alle sammen inn i kjøkkenet til mor: <br/>Og Pelle fikk et melkespann og Kari fikk et krus <br/>og Mari fikk en kaffekopp og Kjell et kremmerhus. <br/>Så fløy de opp i skauen i en gla og vilter flokk <br/>- og lillebror fløy sist og skulle plukke i et lokk. <br/>Så kom de opp i skauen, og så kom de til ei slette, <br/>der var det bare blått i blått så langt du kunne se. <br/>Så satte de seg ende ned, så spiste de seg mette, <br/>så fant de seg en tue hver og ropte: “Fritt for det!” <br/>“Nå ser vi hvem som først får fullt, nå setter vi igang!” <br/>Og over hele sletta sa det: “Kling” og “Pling” og “Plang.” <br/>Først sang det i et melkespann, så klang det i et krus, <br/>det danset i en kopp og raslet i et kremmerhus, <br/>men fra den minste tua sa det “Plingeling” i flokk, <br/> for oppi den satt Lillebror og plukket i et lokk.</i></p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Rose Hip Soup (Nypesuppe)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>The pretty wild roses that grow in Norway come in various shades of pink, usually a deep pink. They bloom profusely in the summer; and in the fall after the flowers have bloomed, myriads of oval scarlet seed pods appear, they are called rose hips.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg93_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">My siblings and I spent many happy years at Nessodden where these roses grew abundantly along the roads and on the hillsides. We picked and ate the rose hips by the handfuls. Eating the flesh and discarding their woody little seeds, not knowing at the time that we were eating large quantities of vitamin C.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The rose hips are one of our best sources of vitamin C, containing as much as 1,200 to 1,800 milligrams of vitamin C per half cup. They make a delicious soup or compote and a rose hip herb tea. The dried rose hips can be bought in certain import stores, natural food stores, and in most Scandinavian celicatessens.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) rose hips</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. potato starch flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ¼ qts. (liters) water</p>

<p class="noindent6">¾ cup (2 dl) sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) almonds, slivered</p>
<p class="noindent2">Wash rose hips, removing stems and blossom ends and discarding the seeds. In a saucepan combine rose hips, water, and sugar and cook until tender. Purée in a blender or food mill. Return to the pan. Make a thin paste of potato  flour and water; add to soup while stirring constantly. Return to heat and continue to stir until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat. Cool. Whip cream and add it to the soup a little at a time. Sprinkle almonds on top. </p>

<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Red Secret (Rod hemmelighet)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">There is indeed a secret hidden within this red Christmas dessert. It does take a little time, but it is not difficult. Your guests will long remember the mousse hidden inside and the effort you made in their behalf. The dessert should be started a day in advance and finished the morning of your party. You will need two bowls, a 7-cup and a 4-cup size in the same shape that fit inside each other.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 6 oz. (2 dl) strawberry Jell-O</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tsp. vanilla sugar or extract</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 6  cups (6 ¾ dl) water</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) whipping cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ¼ dl) strawberries, fresh or frozen</p>
<p class="noindent6">Vanilla sauce, double recipe</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 pkg. Knox gelatin</p>
<p class="noindent2">Make Jell-O following directions on the package, but use only 3 cups of water total. Pour the Jell-O into a 7-cup capacity round bowl. Place a second round 4–cup capacitiy bowl in the Jell-O and fill the cup with enough ice-cold water to make the Jell-O rise to the ridge of the large bowl. The Jell-O will form a layer between the two bowls. Chill until firmly set, overnight is best. Soften the Knox gelatin in a little water. Whip the cream with the vanilla sugar. Mix the cream and the vanilla sauce thoroughly. Place the softened gelatin in ¼ cup boiling water; cool slightly. Carefully stir in the cream/vanilla sauce mixture. Pour the water out of the small bowl. Rinse the bowl carefully with a little warm water to help loosen it frm the Jell-O. Cover the hollowed-out Jell-O with sliced strawberries. Fill the center of the Jell-O with the mousse and let stand till set, at least three hours. Just before serving dip the bowl in a little warm water, being careful not to have water too hot so as to melt the Jell-O. Use a knife to loosen the edge and allowing air to flow into the bowl. Invert the Jell-O melts on a pretty dessert platter. Decorate with whipped cream stars. See picture.</p>
<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Veiled Wilderness Girls with Vanilla<br/>Sauce (Tilslørte villmarksjenter<br/>med vaniljesaus)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Christmas is the time to show off the luscious berries you picked last summer. Some of them out of necessity you may have bought at a Scandinavian delicatessen, but nevertheless this is a luscious, colorful, and easy dessert to fix. “Stirred” berries means you use a wooden spoon to stir the berries and sugar together until the sugar melts. Whenever we were asked to do such a task as children our mother provided us with a good book. Most of us will not have access to stirred berries but frozen, sweetened ones, served half defrosted will do nicely. </p>
<p class="noindent5"><a id="page_96"/>Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ¼ dl) cloudberries, stirred or frozen</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 1/8 dl) hazelnuts, coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ¼ dl) lingonberries, stirred or frozen</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 1/8 dl) sweet oat crackers, crushed</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 dl) blueberries</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) sour cream</p>
<p class="noindent2">Stir chopped nuts and oat crackers constantly over low heat until nicely browned. Since it does not call for any butter, be careful not to burn. Cool. In tall stemmed glasses, arrange berries and sour cream in layers ending with a dab of sour cream. Top with the nut/cracker mixture.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4–6</p>
<p class="h1c"><span class="blue">Vanilla Sauce:</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">This sauce is used with the Red Dessert. However, Norwegians use Vanilla Sauce with many desserts, such as baked apples, chocolate pudding, and fruit compote.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients: </p>
<p class="noindent6">5/8 cup (1 ½ dl) coffee cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ vanilla bean, sliced lengthwise</p>
<p class="noindent6">2–3 tbsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ½ tsp. vanilla sugar or extract</p>
<p class="noindent6">3/8 cup (¾ dl) whipping cream</p>
<p class="noindent2">Place the split vanilla bean in a saucepan and pour in the cream. Bring the cream to a boil over moderate heat, being careful not to scorch. Remove from heat and allow to stand for 15 minutes so the cream can absorb the flavor of the vanilla bean. Remove the vanilla bean and scrape the seeds into the cream. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together using a wire whisk. Add to the cream. Place the sauce over low heat, stirring continually until it thickens. Stir from time to time as the sauce cools. Add additional sugar if desired. Whip the cream and add to the sauce just before serving.</p>

<p class="noinden7"><i>Julekurv</i> is a traditional Christmas paper basket we make for our Christmas tree every year. This year, with a little work, you may serve your family an eatable, exotic basket. See picture.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 pkg. Knox gelatin</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 passion fruits</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">2/3 cup (1 ½ dl) passion fruit juice</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (4 ½ dl) whipping cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">1/3 cup (½ dl) generous measure of sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 egg whites</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 kiwis, peeled</p>
<p class="noindent5">Decoration:</p>
<p class="noindent6">12 oz. (340 g.) marzipan</p>
<p class="noindent6">Red and green food coloring</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg96_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Soften gelatin in a little cold water. Bring the passion fruit, juice, and sugar to a boil. Run through a sieve to remove the seed from the sauce. Parboil the peeled kiwis in the sauce. Process the fruit in a food blender or through a sieve. Whip the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Blend with the fruit sauce. Melt the gelatin  in 1/3 cup boiling water. Cool slightly and stir into egg mixture. Whip the cream <a id="page_97"/>and fold into the mixture. Whip the egg whites until they form peaks, and stir carefully into the other ingredients. Pour into heart-shaped form and place in the freezer until frozen. Add food coloring to the marzipan, half red, half green. Do not use too bright of colors, which will make the marzipan look unappetizing. Make a paper pattern to fit the heartshaped pan. See illustration. Roll out marzipan large enough to cover the top of the cake, and with a warm, sharp knife, cut out one red and one green heart. Weave the two colors together to form a “basket.” Remove the ice cream from the freezer and dip the pan in a little warm water and invert onto a serving platter. Carefully place the marzipan on top. Cut the edges even. Cut letters out of the marzipan that say “God Jul” and place on top.</p>

<p class="h1b"><a id="page_98"/><span class="red">Troll Cream I (Trollkrem I)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>Troll cream was a magical part of our New Year’s Eve celebration. To us youngsters it was truly wizardry because the volume expanded as we stirred. And we did not mind sitting and stirring as long as we had a good book in our hands.</i></p>
<p class="noindent2">Today, of course, we use electric mixers to make the magical troll cream. You may substitute cranberries for the lingonberries, but be sure they are <i>very</i> ripe and adjust sugar accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) lingonberries, or ½ cup (1 ¼ dl)</p>
<p class="noindent6">lingonberry jam</p>
<p class="noindent6">2/3 cup (1 ½ dl) sugar</p>

<p class="noindent2">Wash berries and remove all unripe berries and foreign objects. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat until the volumes quadruples, about 15 minutes. If you are using lingonberry jam omit the sugar. Serve in a crystal dessert bowl sprinkled with a few lingonberries. If available, add a few mint leaves. Cookies are a great accompaniment or serve in Crisp Wafer Cups (<i>Krumkakeskåler</i>).</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 8</p>

<p class="noinden7"><i>One fall while hiking in the famed Rondane Mountains we unexpectedly came across a large patch of cloudberries, and we spent some time enjoying our unanticipated afternoon delicacy.</i> </p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg98_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Plump, orange-yellow cloudberries resemble raspberries in appearance; they do belong to the same family but their flavor is unique, resembling that of the magnificent mountain marshlands where they  flourish. Abundant in vitamin C, cloudberries are mainly used for jam and desserts. Cloudberry cream can be prepared with fresh or frozen berries that have been pressed through a sieve to remove the seeds, then combined with whipped cream and sugar to taste, or you may use cloudberry fruit spreads or jam. This is no everyday dessert, and the berries are rather </p>
<p class="noindentt2">expensive. But if you want to please a Norwegian, you will make a hit with this dessert.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cups (4 dl) whipping cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. vanilla extract, pure</p>
<p class="noindent6">4 tbsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ¼ cup (3 dl) cloudberries</p>
<p class="noindent2">Whip the cream and sugar, and add the vanilla extract. Carefully fold in the cloudberries, saving a few for decorations. Pour into a pretty bowl and decorate with saved cloudberries. <i>Krumkaker</i> are an excellent accompaniment, or serve in <i>krumkakeskåler</i>. Almond flavored cookies also taste good with cloudberry cream.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4</p>
<p class="noindent2">If you are unable to obtain cloudberries, use the following recipe:</p>
<p class="noindent5">1 ½ cups (3 ¾ dl) whipping cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) cloudberry jam</p>
<p class="noindent2">Lightly whip the cream. Gently fold in the jam. Serve in pretty dessert bowls with csrisp cookies.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 4–6</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg98_02.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Rice Cream (Riskrem)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Today the Norwegian homemaker can buy readymade frozen rice cream in the grocery store! Though it is good, nothing tops the homemade stuff. It is mainly a Christmas dessert in most Norwegian homes, and I say so very delicious it is worth waiting a year for! Do not mistake rice-cream for rice pudding. A whole almond is added to one of the bowls just before serving on Christmas Eve. The lucky finder receives a marzipan pig with a bright red bow, and in some homes the finder passes out the Christmas gifts that spill from underneath the tree. One Christmas, our five-year-old grandson, Paul, felt lucky and was sure he would find the almond in the rice cream that night. Well—when he did find it, with his mouth full of rice cream and his eyes bigger than his bulging cheeks, he tried desperately to rescue the almond before he swallowed it. Of course, no one noticed his father helping him clean up the spill. Paul ate the rest of the rice cream with a bright smile on his face, humming to himself while we watched us. Oh the joys of tradition!</p>

<p class="noinden7"><i>A delicate and much loved traditional dessert in Norway. Somehow, we Norwegians never tire of it. It is best when prepared a day in advance, as thorough chilling is a must.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg99_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">There are many variations of caramel pudding. It is made from eggs and cream or milk, either of which should result in a smooth, delectable pudding. It can be made in an oven-proof mold or in an oblong or round cake pan of a size in proportion to the pudding recipe. The container can be filled completely as caramel pudding, properly prepared and baked, will not rise. Use caution when working with caramel as it is extremely hot and if it comes in contact with any part of the body, a deep burn will result.</p>
<p class="indent1">If vanilla sugar or extract is used, add to the egg/ milk mixture last. If only cream is used, carefully bring it to a boil before adding the vanilla bean. If the eggs are small, use more. If all, or mostly, cream is used, more eggs are required than with milk only.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 ½ cups (6 ¼ dl) milk, or coffee cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ cup (½ dl) sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ vanilla bean, cut lengthwise</p>
<p class="noindent6">3–4 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent5">Caramel:</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) sugar</p>
<p class="noindent2">In a heavy-bottomed pan, simmer milk or coffee cream together with sugar and vanilla bean for 10 minutes. Cool to lukewarm and remove the vanilla bean. Thoroughly blend eggs, but do not beat excessively as this causes the pudding to become porous. Combine milk and eggs and strain through a sieve to remove stringy parts of the egg yolks. Cool. Both the caramel and the egg mixture should be at room temperature. If the mixture is too hot it will melt some of the caramel, which will mix with the pudding and cause it to turn brown.</p>
<p class="indent">Sprinkle the sugar over the bottom of a small, heavy skillet, and let it melt over low heat. Do not stir before sugar has completely melted or lumps may form that are difficult to reduce. Watch carefully <a id="page_100"/>so the sugar on the bottom does not brown before that on top has melted. When completely melted, increase the heat and stir constantly to achieve an even color. The heat should be high enough to maintain the caramel in a fluid state and yet allow for a gradual browning; but not so hot that the caramel boils and foams. Test by dropping some on a plate—it should be a golden chestnut color and easy flowing. This may take up to 10 minutes. As soon as the syrup reaches the proper color and consistency pour into a pre-heated mold, grip a pot holder in each hand, and tip and swirl the mold until the bottom and sides are evenly coated. The caramel stiffens quickly, so work fast. Set the mold aside until the caramel has hardened. Then pour the egg misture in the mold.</p>
<p class="indent">Set mold in pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the mold, and place in a preheated 300°F (150°C) oven. The water should not boil or the pudding will rise and have air pockets. A small amount of pudding requires about 1 hour to bake, and larger amounts from 2 to 3 hours. To test for doneness, use a toothpick—if it comes out clean the pudding is done. Remove from the oven and chill.</p>
<p class="indent">To remove the pudding, run a sharp knife around the edge and dip the mold briefly in hot water. Place a platter on top and invert. The caramel has now melted to a sauce. A successful caramel pudding should be light, golden, and velvet like. Use a decorator tube to glamorize it with “flowers” of whipped cream.</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sveler (Sveler)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">These have become very popular in Norway when friends drop in, or for dessert. They are simple and quick to make and one usually has all the ingredients on hand.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg106_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. baking soda</p>

<p class="noindent6">Salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ¾ cups (4 dl) flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">Butter</p>
<p class="noindent2">Beat eggs and sugar well. Add milk and sift in the  flour combined with baking soda and salt and beat until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest for 20 minutes. Pour a small amount into a frying pan and even the batter out with a spoon. Cook until golden brown on both sides. If svelene stick to the pan, melt a little butter and add to the batter. Serve with jam and sour cream or butter, and Norwegian goat cheese.</p>
<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Thick Rice Pancakes (Rislapper)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>When you make rice porridge plan to make enough so you have leftovers to make these rislapper. Mamma often managed to have leftover porridge to make them as a treat when we listened to Saturday barnetimen (Children’s Hour) on the radio!</i></p>
<p class="noindentt2">Once the batter is made, fry the pancakes immediately. Amounts will depend on how thick the porridge is. The batter will liquify if it stands and the pancakes will lose their shapes. Fry a sample cake, and add more  flour if needed.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) rice porridge</p>
<p class="noindent6">3 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent6">2–3 tbsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ tsp. salt (optional)</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ¼ cups (3 dl) flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">Butter or margarine</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ tsp. cinnamon or cardamom</p>
<p class="noindent2"><a id="page_107"/>Mix the rice porridge with sugar, most of the  flour, cinnamon or cardamom, and the lightly beaten eggs. Brown a little butter or margarine in a frying pan, and ladle enough batter into the pan to make about a 3-inch size pancake and smooth the surface to make the pancakes equally large. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Serve rice pancakes right from the frying pan with sugar or spread with jam.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Serves 5–6</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Telemark Gomme (Telemarkgomme)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>Gomme has a long history in Norway. This unique gomme from Telemark requires a lot of stirring, but with our electric beaters it is well worth the effort. The finished gomme will have a delicious and unusually creamy consistency.</i></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">6 qts. (6 liters) milk, whole</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup brown sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">6 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent2">In a heavy bottomed pan bring the milk, over moderate heat, to the boiling point while stirring continually. Pour into a separate casserole with a heavy bottom and let it simmer un covered for approximately 5 hours. Gently shake the pan periodically. Do not remove the coating, <i>snerken</i>, which will form on top of the milk. The <i>gomme</i> will now have the consistency of a thick sauce and have a light golden color. Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl. Add the boiled milk, a few tablespoons at a time, while continually beating at high speed. When all the milk is added, continue to beat on low until the <i>gomme</i> is lukewarm. Enjoy with waffles and lefse. There is plenty here to share as well.</p>
