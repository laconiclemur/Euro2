    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page211"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">In Iceland,</span></span> after a long day of driving, you often yearn for a comfortable, safe refuge. Vast stretches of the country afford nothing but gas stations selling hot dogs and hamburgers, and although these are both better than most of their incarnations anywhere else in the world, sometimes the drive is so painfully long that a hot dog just won’t satisfy you. A sliver of a dirt road in the north of the country conjures just such a desire for more than fast food, and at the moment that it strikes most intensely, nirvana in the form of turf houses and a restaurant with candlelit windows welcome the weary traveler for the night.</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="ind250a"/>Fjalladyrd, which is surrounded by snowcapped volcanoes, is the highest settled farm in Iceland. Perched atop a broad, windy plateau known as <a id="ind306a"/>The Highlands, it is a <a id="ind224a"/><a id="ind554a"/>sheep farm owned by the same family for as long as anyone can remember. <a id="ind209a"/>Elisabet Kristjánsdóttir married <a id="ind644a"/>Viljálmur Vernhardsson, the present owner, before moving to this remote corner of Iceland, and now she and her husband raise sheep, run a restaurant and hotel, and look after their young daughter on one of the largest privately owned farms in the nation.</p>
<p class="extract">At their restaurant—which is the stuff of log-cabin dreams—they serve smoked lamb and freshly caught arctic char. For dessert, there are hot waffles drizzled with rhubarb jam and crowned with whipped cream. In the mornings, Elisabet offers hotel guests guided outdoor adventures in the surrounding countryside, and year-round, she helps tend the sheep.</p>
<p class="extract">The sheep wander in the fields throughout the spring and summer, before being rounded up each autumn from the remote corners of the property. Their wool is transformed into mittens, hats, socks, and sweaters, and their meat is <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass1">dirt smoked</a> to infuse it with the <em>terroir</em> of the region. It tastes of the arctic thyme, sorrel, and angelica that flourishes on the farm, reminding those who eat it of the welcoming refuge they discovered just when they were ready to settle for another hot dog.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c09-s64"><a id="page212"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Sheep Farmer Elisabet Kristjánsdóttir</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How long has this property been in your husband’s family?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">It has been in the family for many generations. We have a church on the property that my husband’s grandfather built. He was an artist and a farmer. Over fifty people once lived on this land, but today only three people live here, my husband, our daughter, and me. I met my husband in 2004 and have lived here ever since. I had known him for only one month, and it was my birthday. For a gift he gave me a baby goat, and I knew he was the one.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Is it sometimes difficult to live in a place that is so isolated?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, it really isn’t. We have so many visitors who pass through here, and our daughter attends school for part of the year in <a id="ind12a"/>Akureyri, which provides her with companions. I love living here, I love raising my daughter here, and I feel privileged to be a part of such a long tradition.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How many sheep do you have here?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We used to have over fifteen hundred. Today we have one hundred sheep and fifty goats. We would like to increase the number for both species a bit. We are trying to raise a specific breed of sheep that we feel has the best-tasting meat. In the early days, the sheep lived outside and their legs were very hearty from walking so much. We are trying to re-create that experience. The sheep house is open, and the sheep are allowed to roam wherever and whenever they want to. It’s not a contained, isolated place. It’s a house that is a shelter, but they have their freedom, too. Our sheep house can house two hundred sheep, so we are constantly working to increase our numbers. We produce the manure blocks in the traditional way, by letting the sheep compress the hay and manure as they pass back and forth, and then we use the blocks to smoke our meat.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you sell your meat?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, we sell it directly from the farm. We are not allowed to slaughter our sheep here. They are slaughtered in the next town, because a license is required for every step. I don’t believe any farm in Iceland slaughters at home, except for what the farmers consume themselves. So we send our sheep about forty miles away and then bring the meat back here, where we prepare it in our restaurant and also sell it to the public. We do run out of meat each year toward the end of the season, which is frustrating because we would like to serve and sell our own meat year-round. But we just can’t keep up with the demand.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page213"/>What are some of your biggest challenges?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The regulations imposed on us can be very frustrating, because so often they do not make sense and are in place only because of some bureaucratic system. I am not concerned about sheep farming in Iceland disappearing, because Icelanders appreciate what the sheep farmers do. But I am concerned that the regulations imposed on small family farms like ours will change the traditions that have been in place since the beginning.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What do you enjoy most about living on the farm?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">People come to this area because it is so remote. What I like most of all is guiding our visitors in <a id="ind307a"/>The Highlands. When I moved here, I discovered I did not always like being in the café. I don’t like to be inside. I’m a true Icelander at heart. When I’m in the kitchen, I’m happy, but I am always yearning to be outside, too. I love showing people this beautiful region of Iceland, I love seeing Iceland through their eyes. It affirms for me again and again just how special this place is.</p>

<div class="headnote1">Lamb has been smoked in Iceland since the arrival of the first settlers. It’s dirt smoked in the same manner as <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass1">arctic char</a> and is a beloved tradition at <a id="ind251a"/>Fjalladyrd, in spite of the government regulations and expense that deter many farmers less determined than <a id="ind210a"/>Elisabet Kristjánsdóttir to keep old practices alive.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Icelandic smoked lamb is available at some specialty food shops outside of the country, but if it is impossible to source where you live, prosciutto makes a respectable substitute. The natural earthiness of the skyr is treated to a tangy sweetness with the addition of sour cream, honey, and vinegar.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>SMOKED LAMB</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>3½ ounces (100 g) boneless smoked lamb from leg</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>SKYR</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (70 g) <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-s49">Skyr</a></strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>3 tablespoons sour cream</strong></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Cider vinegar, for seasoning</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Freshly grated nutmeg, for seasoning</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the lamb, wrap it securely in plastic wrap and freeze it solid. Preheat a dehydrator to 147°F (64°C). Let the lamb sit for a few minutes at room temperature, then cut it into paper-thin slices on a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note15">see notes</a>) or a meat slicer.</div>
<div class="method">Arrange the slices in a single layer on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate for 12 to 14 hours, until completely dry and crisp (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-note39">see note</a>). Store the slices between sheets of parchment paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to serve. The lamb will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</div>
<div class="method">To make the skyr, whisk together the skyr, sour cream, and honey until well mixed. Season with salt, vinegar, and nutmeg. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the smoked lamb chips in a bowl and accompany with the skyr for dipping.</div>

<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">If you are substituting prosciutto for the lamb, it may take longer to dehydrate because of its higher fat content. The humidity level of where you live will also affect the dehydrating time.</span></p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 2½ HOURS (PLUS 24 HOURS TO REFRIGERATE AND DEHYDRATE THE LAMB AND TO PICKLE THE ONIONS)</div>
<div class="headnote1">In the United States, pig trotters are the most common source of “foot cheese,” as Gunnar refers to the preparation here, but in Iceland, lamb trotters are more commonly used. Trotters are a chef’s secret weapon, and you have likely enjoyed them tucked into other elements of a dish and marveled at their taste without even knowing what you were eating. Their tightly wound bits of sinew, meat, and fat, along with a healthy dose of gelatin, deliver deep, intense flavors that bring you back again and again for another bite.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">For this recipe, Gunnar first cooks the trotters, bones them, weights the meat overnight in the refrigerator, and then dehydrates the meat. The result is a flavor-packed drier version of the standard trotter. The hay-smoked mayonnaise adds moisture and creaminess and connects the palate to the pasture in which the sheep once roamed, and the pickled onions deliver a nice acidic note.</div>

</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page219"/>To make the dried trotters, torch any remaining hair on the trotters and scrape the hair away (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-note40">see notes</a>). Rinse well under cold running water and place in a large saucepan. Add water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm), place over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 to 1½ hours, until completely tender and the meat is falling from the bones. Drain the trotters, reserving the liquid. When the trotters are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and bones and discard. Shred the meat into small pieces.</div>
<div class="method">In a bowl, mix together the meat, reduced stock, and ¼ cup (60 ml) of the reserved cooking liquid. Season with salt and vinegar. Wrap the meat mixture in a double layer of cheesecloth and secure with butcher’s twine. Place the bundle on a baking sheet, or preferably a terrine mold, top with a second baking sheet (or terrine mold), and top with weights that provide considerable pressure (heavy cans work well). Refrigerate for 12 hours.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat a dehydrator to 149°F (65°C). Unwrap the trotter mixture, or foot cheese, and, using a sharp knife, slice it thinly. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate for 12 hours, until completely dry and golden brown (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-note40">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled onions, place the onions in a small heatproof glass jar.

Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours before using.</div>
<div class="method">To make the smoked mayonnaise, in a bowl, whisk the egg yolk until blended. Then, whisking constantly, slowly add the smoked oil, drop by drop, until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously to form a mayonnaise. Season with salt and vinegar. Cover and refrigerate until serving.</div>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 TO 6 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1½ HOURS (PLUS 14 HOURS IF THE SWEETBREADS ARE SOAKED IN MILK BEFORE COOKING)</div>
<div class="headnote1">Lamb sweetbreads, which are the thymus glands of the animal, are most easily sourced in spring, as they disappear as the lamb ages. They can be difficult to source in the United States, but veal sweetbreads, which are more commonly available, can be substituted here. The best way to prep sweetbreads for cooking is to soak them in milk in the refrigerator overnight to leach out some of their blood, and then carefully remove the tissue that surrounds them while they are still moist from the milk.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Blood sausage is also called for in this recipe, and while the thought may send some diners running for the door, others appreciate its heady flavor. In Iceland, it is called <em>slátur</em>, and it is prepared much as it is elsewhere in the world. The combination of sweetbreads and blood sausage packs an earthy punch that could prove overwhelming if it were not for the sweet caramelized celery root and heady dill puree that accompany them.</div>

<div class="method">To make the celery root and skyr, preheat an immersion circulator to 183°F (84°C). Place the celery root, milk, and cream in a vacuum bag and seal on the medium setting. Cook in the circulator for about 8 minutes, or until tender. The timing will depend on how fine the cut is. Remove the bag from the circulator and drain the celery root, reserving the celery root and liquid separately. Transfer the celery root to a blender, add the butter, and process on high speed to a puree, adding a little of the cooking liquid if necessary to achieve a smooth consistency. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Spread the milk powder in an even layer on a baking sheet and bake, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until light brown. Let cool to room temperature, then, in a small bowl, combine the toasted milk powder and skyr and mix well with the caramelized celery root. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page222"/>To make the blood sausage, in a small bowl, toss the sausage with the sugar. Melt a little butter in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and fry, stirring often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until cooked through and crispy on the outside. Remove from the heat. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the dill puree, combine the dill and water in the blender and process on high speed to a puree, adding more water, if necessary, to achieve a smooth consistency. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then season with salt. Add the xanthan gum and whisk until thickened (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-note41">see note</a>). It should have a glossy finish. Add additional xanthan gum if needed to achieve the desired consistency.</div>
<div class="method">To make the lamb sweetbreads, pour the stock into a saucepan and bring to a low simmer. Add the sweetbreads and cook for about 15 minutes, until cooked through. Drain the sweetbreads with a slotted spoon and let cool just until they can be handled, then carefully peel off and discard the membrane surrounding them. Let cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">Pour oil to a depth of about 6 inches (15 cm) into a deep, heavy pot and heat to 325°F (165°C). Line a large plate with paper towels. While the oil is heating, crack the eggs into a shallow bowl and beat just until blended. Put the flour in a second shallow bowl, and then put the bread crumbs in a third shallow bowl. When the oil is hot, using one hand for the dry coatings, coat a sweetbread evenly with the flour, shaking off the excess. Switch hands and dip the sweetbread in the eggs, allowing the excess to drip off. Finally, switch back to the original hand and coat the sweetbread evenly with the bread crumbs, shaking off the excess. Add the sweetbread to the hot oil and fry for about 6 minutes, until golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the paper towel–lined plate. Repeat with the remaining sweetbreads.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the sweetbreads and the blood sausage on plates. Spoon some of the celery root and skyr and dill purees alongside.</div>

<p class="Essays_nonindent">No visit to Iceland is complete without trying a local hot dog. The country is mad for hot dogs, and they are served at virtually every roadside stop throughout the nation. Perhaps the most popular hot dog stand is directly across from the marina in <a id="ind502a"/>Reykjavík. There, in the summer months, people line up by the dozens to purchase the classic combination of a bun, a hot dog, some mustard, and a tangle of crispy fried onions. Even <a id="ind149a"/>Bill Clinton could not resist a hot dog from this famous stand during a visit to Iceland in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">A hot dog might not sound that special, but Icelandic hot dogs are no ordinary dogs. They are made from the meat of free-range lambs stuffed in natural lamb casings that give each bite a pleasant snap. The bread is typically handmade and the perfect doughy counterpoint to the crispy onions and peppery mustard. But be warned, eating an Icelandic hot dog means your hot dogs back home will never taste as good.</p>

<div class="headnote1">Sunchokes, also known as Jerusalem artichokes, are a relatively new addition to the root vegetable repertoire of Iceland, and Gunnar celebrates their virtues in a variety of ways at Dill. They flourish in even relatively poor soil, which makes them well suited to Iceland’s often unwelcoming planting conditions.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent0">In this recipe, they are both pureed and fried to showcase them in two ways that pair well with lamb fillet and with a side of baked lamb fat. This latter element might leave some diners afraid to step on a scale, but a moderate sized slice baked to bubbling perfection is a rare and enticing treat.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Crowberries complement the other elements on the plate, but since they are difficult to source, blueberries are a good substitute, as are cranberries or cherries.</div>

<div class="method"><a id="page225"/>To make the lamb fillet, preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Season the lamb on both sides with salt. Melt enough butter with oil in an ovenproof sauté pan over medium-high heat to coat the pan bottom lightly. Add the crowberries and then the lamb and sauté the lamb, turning once, for about 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown on both sides. Slip the pan in the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the fillet registers 129°F (54°C), about 12 minutes. Let the fillet rest, flipping it at the halfway point to distribute the internal juices evenly, for 7 minutes before slicing to serve. Reserve the lamb and the berries separately.</div>
<div class="method">To make the baked lamb fat, sprinkle the reserved fat with sea salt and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to leach out some of the internal liquids. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the fat in a small roasting pan and roast for 30 to 40 minutes, until brown and crispy. Remove from the oven, let the fat cool until it can be handled, then chop coarsely. Just before serving, fry the chopped fat and the reserved crowberries in a small sauté pan over medium heat for about 2 minutes, until the fat softens and is warmed through and coated in the berry juice.</div>
<div class="method">To make the sunchoke puree, preheat an immersion circulator to 185°F (85°C). Place the sunchokes, milk, cream, salt, and sugar in a vacuum bag and seal on the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for 18 minutes, until tender. Transfer the contents of the bag to a blender, add the butter, and begin processing on low speed to prevent the hot mixture from splattering. Once the elements are incorporated, increase the speed to high and continue to process until smooth, adding additional milk if necessary to achieve a smooth consistency. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the fried sunchokes, melt enough butter with oil in a sauté pan over high heat to coat the pan bottom lightly. Add the sunchokes and fry, stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy on the outside. Turn down the heat to medium and fry for about 8 minutes longer, until tender. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the lamb fillet and fat on a plate, spoon the sunchoke puree and fried sunchokes alongside, and drizzle the lamb fillet with the reserved crowberries.</div>

<div class="headnote">Gunnar originally created this dish with lamb in mind, but he had extra duck breasts on hand and substituted them for the lamb. The result, when served with a silky carrot puree and a vibrant herb emulsion, was a pleasing spring or summer dish with a whisper of the farm delivered by the hay smoking. If you do not use duck fat regularly, now is the time to add it to your list of essential pantry items. Here, it is toasted with semidried herbs to coax out its virtues.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the duck breasts, score the fat on the breasts and season the breasts on both sides with salt. Line a large plate with paper towels. Melt enough butter with oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat to coat the pan bottom lightly. Turn down the heat to medium-low, add the breasts, skin side down, and sauté, turning once, for 7 to 8 minutes. Turn over, raise the heat to high and cook until medium-rare, about 2 minutes. Transfer the breasts to the paper towel–lined plate and let rest, flipping them once at the midway point to distribute the internal juices evenly, for 7 minutes. Season with more salt if needed.</div>
<div class="method">To make the toasted duck fat, return the pan with the duck fat to medium heat. Add the angelica and thyme and heat for about 2 minutes, until aromatic. Reserve for serving.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page229"/>To make the carrot puree, put the carrots and water in a <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass2">pressure cooker</a>, lock the lid in place, bring to medium pressure, and cook for 15 minutes, until golden brown. Let the pressure release naturally. Remove the lid, drain the carrots, and transfer them to a blender. Add the oil and process with on high speed until smooth, adding more oil, if necessary, to form a smooth puree. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the carrots, melt enough butter with oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat to coat the pan bottom lightly. Add the carrots and sauté for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the herb emulsion, combine the mustard, vinegar, garlic, shallot, dill, parsley, and water in a blender and process on high speed to a puree, adding more water as necessary to form a smooth consistency. Add the oil in a slow, steady stream and continue to process until smooth. Season with salt and more vinegar, if desired.</div>
<div class="method">To smoke the duck breasts, fill a deep hotel pan or similar vessel with hay. Arrange the duck breasts on a perforated hotel pan and place over high heat. Ignite the hay with a kitchen torch and let burn for about 5 minutes, until almost completely incinerated. Place the perforated pan on top and cover securely with aluminum foil (or a lid). Allow the smoke to smolder out completely, about 10 minutes, before removing the foil or lid. Remove the duck breasts. Crumble the residual ashes to use as a garnish.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, slice the duck breasts and arrange the slices on plates. Arrange the carrots and carrot puree alongside. Dot duck and carrots with the herb emulsion and garnish with the ashes.</div>

<div class="headnote">Like most chefs, Gunnar appreciates cuts of meat that prove a bit more of a challenge to cook than your standard tenderloin. The lamb shoulder in this recipe is a good example. It’s a tougher cut of meat and requires a longer cooking time and a bit more culinary magic to roast it to its full potential. In this recipe, Gunnar pairs the lamb shoulder with cabbage, adds a generous amount of duck fat, sprinkles it with pickled onions, slathers leek butter over it, and drizzles it with chervil oil, resulting in a fall or wintertime dish your guests will want to tuck into and linger over for hours.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the cabbage, place the cabbage, cider vinegar, salt, sugar, and duck fat in a vacuum bag and seal on the medium setting. Refrigerate for 1 week. Transfer the contents of the bag to a sauté pan over medium heat and sauté until warmed through.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled onions, bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the onions, blanch for 20 seconds, drain, and transfer to a small heatproof glass jar. Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the onions, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 1 week before using.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page232"/>To make the lamb shoulder, using a paring knife, cut a crisscross pattern all over the exterior of the shoulder. Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, combine the salt and thyme and grind together until finely crushed. Rub the mixture over the shoulder, then place the shoulder in a roasting pan. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Roast the shoulder for about 1½ hours, until tender. Remove from the oven and let rest, flipping the shoulder over once at the midway point to distribute the internal juices evenly, for about 30 minutes. Then, shred the meat.</div>
<div class="method">To make the leek butter, heat the oil and 2 teaspoons of the butter over low heat. Add the leek and sauté for about 6 minutes, until tender but not golden brown. Transfer the leek and the cooking juices to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled. In a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the remaining butter on high speed until light and fluffy. Still on high speed, add the buttermilk in a slow, steady stream and beat until combined. Using a spatula or spoon, fold in the leeks and their cooking liquid until incorporated. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the leek butter evenly in a thin layer on the parchment. Refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">To make the chervil syrup, combine the vinegar and butter in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the sugar and cook until the mixture is thick and syrupy. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Just before serving, stir together the chervil oil and one-fourth of the syrup for a sweet-and-sour flavor. Reserve the rest for another use.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the shoulder, braised cabbage, and pickled onions on a plate. Drizzle with a generous amount of the chervil syrup.</div>
