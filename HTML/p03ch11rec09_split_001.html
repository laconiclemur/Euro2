<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">In their splendid</span> The Heritage of Spanish Cooking, <span class="italic">Alicia Ríos and Lourdes March say that in the Valencian mountain interior, rice dishes are based on the broth of a</span> cocido<span class="italic">—a dish of boiled meats (see page 498). The recipe is adapted from one in their book. In Spain today you can buy good</span> cocido <span class="italic">broth, but here, use beef or chicken stock. Use a</span> cazuela <span class="italic">or a large shallow casserole that will go both on the stove and in the oven. If you do not have one, start the dish in a deep saucepan, then transfer it to a baking dish. A head of garlic (Valencians call it a “partridge”) is placed in the center. Serve it with meatballs or with fried pork ribs and sausages or blood sausages.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked (see Soaking Beans, page 487)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">A head of garlic, not peeled</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dried currants or raisins, soaked in water for 20 minutes and drained</p>
<p class="qun">1 large tomato, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="qun">5 cups meat or chicken stock (or 5 cups water plus 1½ to 2 bouillon cubes)</p>
<p class="qun1">2½ cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="recsum">Drain the chickpeas, put them in a saucepan with fresh water to cover, and simmer for 1 hour, or until they are soft; add some salt once they have begun to soften. Drain.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the oil in a large <span class="italic">cazuela</span> or casserole that goes in the oven. Add the garlic and half the currants or raisins and stir over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato and <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (or paprika) and stir well, then add the chickpeas, stock, and some salt. Bring to a boil, add the rice, and stir well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Place the head of garlic in the center of the rice and sprinkle the remaining currants or raisins over the top. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When serving, give everyone a garlic clove for them to squeeze out the soft inside.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> If you do not have a large casserole or a <span class="italic">cazuela,</span> start the cooking in a large saucepan and just bring to a boil, then pour everything into a large round baking dish, about 14 inches in diameter. Put the garlic head in the center and bake as above.</p>
