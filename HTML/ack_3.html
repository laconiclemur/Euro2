<h2 class="h2" id="ack">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are so many people I want to thank—those who have been instrumental in one way or another in helping give birth to <em>Kitchen of Light.</em> I must ask forgiveness from anyone whom I may have left out.</p>
<p class="indent">I would first like to thank my good friend Andrea Clurfeld for convincing me that it was possible for me to write this book and have it published in the United States, and Jim Eber at Workman Publishing for his help and encouragement while the book was still just an idea. And I would like to thank my agent, Lisa Ekus, and her staff for their hard work and enthusiasm. “You’re the top. …”</p>
<p class="indent">I would also like to thank everyone at Artisan for their skills in making the book, especially Ann Bramson, my publisher, for believing in it; Pamela Cannon, my editor, for her comments, humor, and insistence that there is always room for improvement; and Vivian Ghazarian for making the book so beautiful. Thanks also to Deborah Weiss Geline, Judith Sutton, Nancy Murray, Amy Corley, Emma Straub, and Barbara Peragine.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to my foodie friends Jeffrey Steingarten and Herve This for inspirational conversations, Scott McKay for useful comments on the recipes, and Sally King for testing the food.</p>
<p class="indent">My family and friends in Norway gave me great support and inspiration. Thank you to all, especially my grandparents and parents for teaching me that everything is possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to my partners at Nett-tv: my producers, Anders Sæther, Morten Ottesen, and Alexander Wisting, for making the series <em>New Scandinavian Cooking with Andreas Viestad</em> a reality; and the crew, Kaare Skard, Angela Amorosa, Knut Kollandsrud, Erik Røed, Monica Viken, Lotte Vikant, and Merete Steen, for making all the traveling and work so much fun. And thanks to all the people we met along the way, especially Ola Aukrust, Lars Tyssebotn, Conrad Johansen, and Leif Kristiansen. Thank you, too, to everyone at American Public Television in Boston and Wellspring in New York.</p>
<p class="indent">I would also like to thank my editors at my newspaper, <em>Dagbladet,</em> for being so understanding: John Olav Egeland, Gunnar Bleness, Hege Duckert, Jo Randen, and Lillian Vambheim.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks to Magnus Castracane and Henrik Henriksen for their help in styling the food for photography.</p>
<p class="indent">And finally, thanks to Mette Randem for being such a fantastic photographer, and being so inspiring to work with year after year.</p>
