<p class="running_top">There are now a number of specialty Spanish shops and cookware retailers with (in most cases) storefront locations as well as online and phone ordering. As well, many Spanish products can be found at better supermarkets like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s; purveyors of fine foods such as Dean &amp; DeLuca; and at specialty international import shops. Italian or Portuguese grocery shops often have similar ingredients (like salt cod and squid ink), Latino markets also have some overlap, and Asian markets are often a good source for squid ink and seafood. A good butcher should have, or be able to order, tripe, kidneys, pig’s feet, rabbit, and the like, and a good fishmonger will be able to get hold of monkfish, sardines, bones for stock, cuttlefish, and so on. For cookware, Sur la Table and Williams-Sonoma often carry paella pans and other specialty pieces. <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> offers a wide variety of options and suppliers.</p>
