<p class="noindent"><span class="stickup">I</span> would like to thank all those who helped in bringing this book to fruition for a second time. My indefatigable, creative, and devoted parents, Joan and Stan; the talented Gianni Scappin; and the diligent and patient Mimi Taft. They are the real authors here. I would also like to thank Francesco Tonelli and his team for the stunning photos, and the folks at Simon &amp; Schuster—Trish Boczkowski, Jennifer Bergstrom, Louise Burke, Jennifer Robinson, Alexandra Lewis, Lisa Litwack, and Jaime Putorti—for producing and publishing a book that means so much to us with such care and attention. I am most grateful to Deborah Schneider of Gelfman Schneider for introducing us. In particular, I would like to thank the lovely and tenacious Felicity Blunt of Curtis Brown (my fiancée, so there is a bit of a bias), for leading the charge and putting the pieces and people together that allowed us to create a book that we could all be proud of.</p>
