<p class="tx2"><b>I have a theory that people who hate greens just haven’t had them cooked by Italians! Tender cooked green leaves dressed with nothing but a slick of very good oil and a squeeze of lemon is our comfort food and a bowlful will be fought over at the kitchen table. Traditionally, Tuscans collected wild greens such as chicory, cress, nettle and dandelion leaves from the fields, which are used raw in a salad called a <i>misticanza</i> or cooked such as in the <i><a href="9781784881757_Split52.html#page_86">erbolata</a></i> recipe. Depending on the time of year, the greens that are available vary, and each need to be treated differently. After cooking they can be finished according to the <a href="9781784881757_Split130.html#page_227">Sautéed Leaves with Chilli &amp; Garlic</a> recipe.</b></p>

<p class="tx1"><b>Weights of leaves</b></p>
<p class="tx1">Leaves are typically sold with their stems intact, which weigh more than the leaves and you generally end up throwing them away. To end up with enough cooked leaves for a recipe you need to start with a lot of leaves!</p>
<p class="tx">Soft leaves such as spinach and Swiss chard, once stripped from their stems, usually cook down to half their raw weight. Tougher leaves such as cavolo nero or curly kale cook down to around two thirds of their raw weight once stripped on their stems depending on the density of the leaves.</p>
<p class="tx3"><b>How to prepare spinach</b></p>
<p class="tx1">Baby spinach leaves should be washed and drained well. Then they need a mere flash of heat in the pan, stirred through with a little salt and extra-virgin olive oil. Larger leaves are best washed; then, without completely draining them, put them into a deep saucepan, cover and leave it to steam in the residual water with a little salt for 5–7 minutes until tender and wilted. Drain and leave to cool down. Squeeze the water out well, ideally with your hands.</p>
<p class="tx3"><b>How to prepare Swiss chard</b></p>
<p class="tx1">Giancarlo’s mother Marietta would never have thrown away the thick white or rainbow-coloured Swiss chard stems, but they do have a strong minerally flavour so they are not to everyone’s taste. They have to be cooked separately to the leaves. Cut the stems from just under the leaf and chop them finely. Boil in salted water for 10–15 minutes, until tender. Prepare the leaves of Swiss chard as the larger spinach leaves above.</p>
<p class="tx3"><b>How to prepare cavolo nero</b></p>
<p class="tx1">Pinch the rib around the middle of the leaf and pull the leaves away by running your fingers up and down the hard stalk. Discard the stalks. Wash the leaves under cold running water. Roughly shred the leaves and cook them in salted boiling water for up to 10 minutes, until soft and tender. Drain, then squeeze out the water when cool to the touch.</p>
