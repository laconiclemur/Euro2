<h3 class="h3"><em>Provençal Jams</em></h3>
<p class="normala"><em>Here are four of my favourite and slightly more unusual fruit jams. I make them with preserving sugar to get a fresher flavour as you only need to cook them for 5–6 minutes. The method for all of them is essentially the same. I like to make them with the fruit chopped in large chunks, but if you like a more purée-like jam, feel free to chop them smaller. When I use berries, rather than mix and break them up, I prefer to give them a gentle toss with the sugar. Once the jams are cooked it is important to leave them in a bowl and to gently stir the fruit through from time to time so that it is evenly distributed before you bottle the jam</em>.</p>
