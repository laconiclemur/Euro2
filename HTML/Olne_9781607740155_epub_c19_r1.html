  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page288"></a>All the elements of the crayfish salad may be prepared ahead of time. The vegetables for the stew may be cleaned, peeled, etc., and kept fresh in a damp towel in the refrigerator, the chicken may be boned a day in advance, if one likes, and the forcemeat, but for the final mounting with cream, must be prepared in advance. The crusts may be browned ahead of time.</p>

  <p class="indent">The chicken should be stuffed and put to poach about 1¼ hours before going to table. The vegetable stew should be put to cook just before the crayfish salad is assembled (a question of a minute’s time), and the morels only well after the vegetable stew has been served.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cream occurs in three different preparations in this menu, but these are so different in nature and the cream in each so different in effect that there is no risk of monotony, and the actual quantity of cream allotted per person throughout the entire meal (½ cup) is not excessive.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE CRAYFISH SALAD WITH FRESH DILL</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A slight elaboration on <em>écrevisses à la nage</em> (the simplest of all crayfish preparations, cooked in <em>court-bouillon</em>, then served—a dish to be shared with unfastidious friends and accompanied by bibs and finger bowls), this salad throws the subtle, delicately sweet flavor into cleaner relief than perhaps any other preparation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fresh dill marries particularly well with crustaceans, and in northern European countries it is a usual ingredient. In France it is practically unknown, and if one has the good luck to find it on the market, it is most often mislabeled “fennel” (<em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> contents itself with calling it <em>fenouil bâtard</em> and referring the reader to the word <em>fenouil</em>). The appearance of the young plants is indeed practically identical; the savor is totally different. Should fresh, tender shoots of dill not be available, the dried and bottled dill weed, commonly found in American markets, may be substituted as it retains a great deal of the <a id="page289"></a>natural dill taste. Use only a teaspoonful of dill weed, leave it to macerate for a while in the lemon juice before preparing the sauce, and sprinkle the crayfish, finally, with chopped parsley instead of the dried dill.</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em>court-bouillon</em> may be saved to moisten a bisque or other soup, or used as a poaching liquid for other fish.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c19-s72"><em><span class="color">Crayfish Salad with Fresh Dill</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Salade d’Ecrevisses à l’Aneth</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Court-bouillon:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful coarse salt (sea salt, preferably)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch Cayenne</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ teaspoon <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bouquet parsley and fresh dill</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large onion, peeled and sliced thinly into rings</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium carrot, peeled and thinly sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8–10 whole peppercorns</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>36 large live crayfish (something over 2 ounces each), or, if unavailable, 5 pounds smaller crayfish</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon finely chopped young, tender, feathery dill leaves (no stems), or chopped parsley if fresh dill is not available</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium-size head tender-leafed lettuce (Boston type)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE COURT-BOUILLON</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the white wine and the water to a boil in a large saucepan and add all the ingredients except the peppercorns (which, with extended cooking, lose their savor and instead lend a bitter taste). Simmer, covered, for ½ hour, ad ding the peppercorns after 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">The crayfish, because of their quantity, will be cooked in relays. This not only prevents a loss of their valuable liquids, once the intestines <a id="page290"></a>have been drawn, but economizes on <em>court-bouillon</em>, which is that much more flavorful for having been used for the second batch of crayfish as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Starting with the largest, rinse the crayfish (the easiest way is simply to dump them into the sink and let them crawl around while picking up one at a time and holding it for a second beneath the tap before drawing it), and remove the intestine of each, grasping the animal just above the point at which the pincers join the body, to avoid being pinched—or holding it with a towel for protection, and, with an abrupt motion to either side, tear loose the central fin from the tail fan, then pull gently in order to slip out the attached intestinal tract without breaking it. Toss each into the simmering <em>court-bouillon</em> the moment it is drawn. When half the crayfish have been added, cover the saucepan and leave to cook over a medium flame, holding the lid tightly and “tossing” the contents of the saucepan (abrupt forward, upward, and backward motion) from time to time, for about 8 minutes. Remove the crayfish to a bowl with the help of a wire skimming spoon and proceed in the same way for the others. Combine the two batches and leave to cool in the <em>court-bouillon</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Put aside 6 of the largest and most perfectly formed crayfish to be used as garnish, keeping them moistened in some <em>court-bouillon</em> until the moment of presentation. Tear off the tails of all the others, remove and discard the tail shells, and put the flesh aside, covered with <em>court-bouillon</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pound the carapaces (heads, claws, legs, coral), 4 or 5 at a time, in a stone mortar, pass each pounded batch through the medium blade of a <em>moulinette</em> (vegetable mill) and, once all the juices are thoroughly extracted, discard the debris of shells. When all have been pounded and puréed, pass this coarse purée, in small quantities at a time, through a fine drum sieve, using the plastic disk (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf3_r1.htm#prf3.5">this page</a>).</p>

  <p class="indent">Put aside ⅓ of the chopped dill for the décor and mix together the remainder with salt, pepper and lemon juice (the juice of one medium-size juicy lemon should be just right, but it is wiser to begin with too little and rectify the acidity later), add the cream, mix well, and whisk in the crayfish purée. Taste for salt and lemon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pick over the lettuce, keeping the leaves whole, wash them and sponge them dry between two towels. Arrange them on the bottom <a id="page291"></a>and around the sides of a large, deep serving platter, distribute the drained crayfish tails on top, mask the entire surface with the sauce, place the unshelled crayfish, trussed (pull the tail slowly upward, in an arc, toward the head, ease each pincer under and backward to meet it, and pierce the tail shell near the base, on either side, with the stable prong of each pincer), symmetrically around the border, and sprinkle with the remaining dill.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE SPRING STEW</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">In Provençal homes, a vegetable preparation is an automatic precedent to the roast, which most often is served ungarnished. The tradition is unknown to the rest of France, and Provençal restaurants do not maintain it—no doubt because a large part of their clientele is foreign to the region. It is a pity that it is not more widespread, if only as an occasional habit, for, not only is one obliged to treat the vegetables in a manner interesting enough for them to stand alone, but, unattended by meat, the palate not distracted by unrelated sauces, their purity and fragrance is thrown into relief, and because of their lightness, the course is an automatic relaxation point in a meal (perhaps more attractive to many modern-day gourmets than the archaic mid-menu sherbet or the somewhat barbaric <em>trou normand</em>, a straight shot of powerful Calvados thrown down halfway through a meal).</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the vegetable trinity presented here, such ragoûts may be prepared from spring carrots, unpeeled garlic cloves, shredded lettuce, tender young peas, baby zucchini, celery hearts, the tender hearts of young bulb fennel, tiny turnips, cauliflower flowerets, etc., taking into consideration different cooking times and adding each accordingly at its right time). Onions should be omitted from none.</p>

  <p class="indent">The savory finds its place in this recipe because of its particular affinity with broad beans, which in themselves are among the most delicate of all vegetables, but always gain by this marriage. In the past, broad beans figured, probably more often than any other vegetable, as an element in formal spring menus; the only possible explanation for their decline in popularity lies in their interminable <a id="page292"></a>preliminary preparation, for which there is no shortcut. Do not confuse broad beans and lima beans. Their only resemblance lies in a vague similarity of appearance.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c19-s73"><em><span class="color">Spring Stew</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Ragoût Printanier</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 pounds freshly picked young broad beans (Italian fave)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>12 tiny artichokes (or 6 medium Artichokes, precooked—see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>30 peeled whole new white onions, each about the size of a small walnut</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 ounces butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon chopped fresh savory leaves, or a large pinch of dried savory</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The broad beans must not only be shelled (pods removed), but, with the exception of the tiniest, whose skins remain a bright and tender green, the skin of each bean must be removed. This is a simple but tedious task: tear off a “cap” of skin with a thumbnail and press the other extremity of the bean between thumb and forefinger—the bean will slip out. Once skinned, any whose flesh is not tender and fresh green, but yellowing and pale of color, should be discarded or put aside for a soup.</p>

  <p class="indent">Young artichokes, whose “chokes” remain undeveloped, should not be precooked, but simply “turned” (stems and outer leaves torn off, the upper half of the remaining leaves cut off, and the remainder pared slightly with a stainless steel knife to remove dark-green parts or tough extremities from the outer leaves), and plunged immediately into a bowl of water acidulated with the juice of a lemon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use an earthenware casserole or <em>poêlon</em> to ensure slow, even cooking and to avoid any metallic contact with the artichokes. Put the artichokes (whole, if chokeless, otherwise halved or quartered, depending <a id="page293"></a>on their size) and the onions, lightly salted, to cook, covered, in 1 ounce of butter (separate from direct flame by an asbestos pad), over low heat, shaking the receptacle from time to time. The vegetables should not color. After about 10 minutes, add the water (just enough to moisten the bottom), the broad beans and the savory. Dot the beans with about 2 ounces of butter cut into small pieces, sprinkle with salt, and continue to cook, tightly covered, over a tiny flame, for about 20 minutes, shaking and tossing the receptacle from time to time—avoid stirring so as not to break or crush the vegetables. At this point, the broad beans should remain intact, but crush easily beneath the slightest pressure, and no more than a couple of tablespoonfuls of slightly syrupy cooking liquid should remain. Should there be more, turn the flame high for a few moments, shaking the casserole gently. Remove from the heat and add the remaining butter cut into small pieces, tossing and swirling the contents until it is absorbed. Serve directly from the cooking utensil (if it is presentable), sprinkled with chopped parsley.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE MOUSSELINE CHICKEN</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">In France, chickens are bled by thrusting a sharp instrument down the bird’s throat. As a result, when bought at the market, the skin is absolutely intact. Chickens are kept in cold storage, but not directly on ice, so that the skin is dry and the flesh has not been drained of its flavor while being permeated with ice water. Happily, it is still practically impossible to find frozen chickens on the French market, although many, thanks to modern raising methods, have little quality other than that of freshness.</p>

  <p class="indent">A chicken, to be prepared in the following manner, need not be killed <em>à la française</em>, but the skin from the base of the head down must be intact.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the morels were not creamed, a sauce might accompany the chicken. Such a sauce would be based on the poaching liquid, reduced somewhat with some stiff <em>velouté</em> (stock thickened with <em>roux</em> and simmered and skimmed for at least ½ hour to give it body. Lightly tomatoed, or colored by the addition of good sweet red Hungarian paprika, the base becomes <em>sauce Aurore</em> (because of the “rose of dawn” <a id="page294"></a>hue); finished with egg yolks and cream, it is <em>suprème</em>; reduced with cream and meat glaze and finished with cream, it is <em>ivoire</em>. All these sauces are delicious—and rich. They are perfect with a garnish of rice or egg noodles, but would detract from the delicate purity of the morels, and the finesse of the mousseline would be masked as well. But there is no doubt that a poached chicken coated in a sauce affords a more impressive presentation.</p>

  <p class="indent">The forcemeat, were the sauce not based on morels, might be enriched by the addition of chopped truffles, <em>duxelles</em>, or chopped morels first stewed in butter. A particularly pretty, clean-tasting and delicate variation involves the addition of tiny raw garden peas and broad beans and cubed, parboiled spring carrots. The preparation is then poetically termed “renaissance,” an alternate appellation to <em>printanière</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chilled, either simply left in its terrine, embedded in its jelly, or decorated and coated with jelly (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c27_r1.htm#c27-s105">Jellied Chicken</a>), it is a perfect principal course for a summer luncheon.</p>

  <p class="indent">The cooking utensil should be oval and as nearly as possible just the right size to hold the chicken comfortably, thus permitting it to be completely submerged in a minimum quantity of rich gelatinous stock.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c19-s74"><em><span class="color">Poached Chicken Mousseline</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Poularde Pochée Mousseline</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large tender (4–6 months) roasting chicken</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Forcemeat:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>breasts from a large chicken</em> (<em>or</em> 3 <em>small chicken breasts</em>)<em>—about</em> 10 <em>ounces, skin and bones removed</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg white</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground white pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a tiny bit of freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lemon (juice)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page295"></a><em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#prf5_01">Veal Stock</a>, enriched by the addition of giblets, and carcass, etc., resulting from the boning of the chicken and chicken breasts</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">BONING THE CHICKEN</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">But for the legs and wings, the chicken will be completely boned and the skin pierced at no point except for the slit down the back of the neck.</p>

  <p class="indent">Singe the chicken, pass the feet, up to the drumstick joint, through an open flame, and remove the skin from the feet, grasping with a towel and pulling downward toward the claws, cut off the extremity of each central “toe” and remove the others. Cut off the wing tips at the second joint (leaving nothing but the small drumstick-like shoulder joint). If the head has not been removed, cut through the neck at the base of the head, slit the length of the neck skin down the back, carefully pull the skin, trachea and esophagus clear of the neck, and sever it at the first vertebra of the spinal column, cutting halfway through and twisting the neck off.</p>

  <p class="indent">For the principal part of the boning, use a small, pointed, very sharp knife. The bulk of it will be done feeling one’s way with fingertips, forcing the flesh away from the bones as one goes. The tip of the knife will serve in the face of resistance and, above all, for severing tendons at bone joints.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pull the esophagus and trachea loose from the neck skin and loosen them, along with the connecting crop, from the throat entrance to the body cavity. There are 3 bones attached to each wing joint: one tip of the V-shaped “wishbone,” the bone corresponding to the clavicle or collarbone, and that bone, the other end of which is free-floating in the flesh of the back, which corresponds to the shoulder blade. Remove, first, the wishbone; making a V-shaped incision with the point of the knife and touching the bone along its entire contour, cut through the tendons or ligaments that connect its pointed end to the skeletal structure, force the flesh loose from the 2 prongs with fingertips and fingernails, and pull it backward, tearing it loose from the wing joints. Remove the clavicles in the reverse sense, first slicing through the tendons connecting them to the wing joints, loosening <a id="page296"></a>adhering flesh, and pulling each upward and away from your person (the chicken is, automatically, on its back, legs pointed away from you, as you work) to tear it loose from its connection inside the body. Sever the attachment of each shoulder blade at the wing joint and, holding it firmly between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, pull it out of the flesh with the other hand, thus forcing it clean of any clinging flesh. Reach inside the body cavity with the index finger, working all around the cavity walls in order to loosen the internal organs completely, then, gently pulling at crop and trachea, remove them by the throat orifice in one mass, taking care not to injure the gallbladder. Force the flesh loose from the breastbone, working along the crest with the point of the knife and forcing that at the sides loose with fingertips. With fingertips, loosen all the way around the rib cage, and finally, at the highest point of the breastbone, cut through the cartilage connecting it to the skin, being careful not to pierce the skin. Remove, in a single piece, the rib cage and connected breastbone.</p>

  <p class="indent">With the aid of the knife tip, separate the spinal column from surrounding flesh until about the halfway point in the back. Force the flesh and skin loose from the wide, pelvis-like flat backbones to either side of the spinal column, being careful to work down into the shallow cavity to each side, forcing with the index fingernail, to separate the cushions of flesh known as “oysters,” leaving them attached to the body of flesh and skin. Slice through the ligaments connecting the pelvic construction to the thigh joints (directly behind each “oyster”) and force them loose. From mid-back to the tail, the spinal column is directly attached to the skin by a series of tiny tendons with no intervention of flesh. Pull the skin gently away from the spinal bones while, at the same time, slicing through the tendons, keeping the knife tip as close as possible to the bones so as to avoid piercing the skin. Having arrived at the base of the tail, cut through the spinal column, leaving the last couple of tiny vertebrae in the tail, and remove the remaining part of the carcass, still forcing with fingertips and knife point if there is any resistance. The chicken, at this point, is turned completely inside out. Turn it skin side out again, and put it aside until needed for stuffing.</p>

  <p class="extract1"><span class="small">NOTE</span>: For a less elaborate boning method, see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c27_r1.htm#c27.4">this page</a>.</p>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page297"></a><span class="small">THE FORCEMEAT</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare the Mousseline Forcemeat as explained on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page79">this page</a>, adding the pistachio nuts, skinned (dip them into boiling water for a minute, drain them, and rub them between two layers of towel to loosen the skins) and coarsely chopped, at the same time as the whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Stuff the chicken without forcing (the forcemeat swells during the poaching and the flesh and skin contract somewhat), place it, breast down, neck skin spread out wide, fold the neck skin neatly and tightly over the back, and sew the chicken up, running the needle through the upper part of the wing, near the joint, next to and above the bone, then down through the neck-skin flap and the back, up through again on the other side, and back through the other wing. Return the needle in the same way, lower down toward the wing tips, and tie and clip the string ends. Turn the chicken onto its back and, with another length of string, transpierce the body, just beneath the joints connecting thighs and drumsticks, then return the needle, through the body and just beneath the bones toward the lower ends of the drumsticks; tie and clip the string ends.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rub the entire surface with lemon juice, re-form the chicken, molding it in your hands, to its original shape, and place it, breast up, in its cooking utensil. Pour in enough veal stock, warmed only enough to be melted, to completely, but only just, submerge the chicken, bring it to a simmer over a medium heat, reduce the heat, and cook, covered, at just under a simmer, for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove it from the broth with the help of a wire skimming spoon (or 2) and present it on a large, preheated oval platter. When sprinkled with a ribbon of chopped parsley along the crest of the bird’s breast and surrounded by the morel crusts, the presentation is much the prettiest, but the crusts should, in this case, be served out before the chicken is carved.</p>

  <p class="indent">It may be carved in the traditional way or, wings and legs first removed, cut into cross-sectional slices about ⅔ inch thick. Serve a sauceboat of the cooking liquid separately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><a id="page298"></a>THE CRUSTS WITH FRESH MORELS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">There are different schools of thought concerning the superiority of the “white” (beige) or the “black” (dark brown) morel. Both are exquisite. The latter I have never encountered in the United States, but, during its short season (from 3 to 6 weeks depending on the year, the extreme limits being mid-March and mid-May), the white morel abounds, at least in certain areas of the Midwest, and, no doubt, in many other parts of the country. Novice collectors need not fear making a mistake—the spongelike shape of the morel is unique—but it should be remembered that raw, they are toxic. Fancy-food dealers in New York claim to have attempted their commercialization, but have been forced, through lack of interest, to abandon it. On the other hand fresh morels have been known to appear in neat cellophane packages in Des Moines supermarkets, so there is still hope for the future.</p>

  <p class="indent">Morels share, with <em>cèpes</em> and the rare, orange-colored, egg-shaped “amanita of the Caesars,” the distinction of being far finer than any other mushroom. Their delicacy of flavor permits of no complicated preparations. They are best simply stewed gently in butter and served just that way, or else creamed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although certain qualities are lost, the deep-freeze is nonetheless a boon to morel collectors. Stem ends should be trimmed and the morels should be split and washed rapidly but thoroughly beneath a jet of water to rid them of clinging earth or sand before being frozen. They should be put directly to stew in fresh, unsalted butter while still frozen.</p>

  <p class="indent">The imported, dried morels, like dried <em>cèpes</em>, are useful as flavoring agents in sauces, terrines, etc., but resemble in no way the fresh product.</p>

  <p class="indent">Crusts have mysteriously fallen from favor and are universally replaced today by the rich little <em>vol-au-vent</em> puff-pastry shells. It is a pity, for the texture, flavor and appearance of these nutty, brown-butter-flavored, crisp golden bread-crumb shells are all beautiful. They may be garnished with any number of preparations—scrambled eggs, <a id="page299"></a>sautéed kidneys, livers, etc.—and sometimes gain by being caressed with a clove of garlic, notably, when filled with a ragoût of fresh black truffles, prepared initially like those with fresh Noodles—<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-s41">this page</a>—a bit of Madeira added, bound by the addition of some meat glaze, and lightly buttered at the last minute. “Lids” of bread slices, crusts removed and treated like croutons, may be fitted over the tops.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is possible, in certain American homes, where even bread is deepfrozen, to prepare good crusts from loaves of otherwise unmanageable light-as-a-feather American bread, by cutting it and putting it to cook in butter while still frozen.</p>

  <p class="indent">Morels in crusts also provide a distinguished luncheon first course.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c19-s75"><em><span class="color">Crusts with Fresh Morels</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Croûtes aux Morilles Fraîches</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Crusts:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>enough heavy, close-textured stale white bread in uncut loaves, crusts removed, to be cut into</em> 6 <em>sections, each about</em> 2 <em>inches thick</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4–6 ounces softened butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound fresh morels</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground white pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon finely chopped chervil (or if unavailable, parsley)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Hollow out each section of bread, leaving ½-inch-thick walls and bottom: Using a small, sharp, pointed knife, cut down, all around the sides, ½ inch in from the edge, without penetrating all the way to the bottom, then, ½ inch from the bottom, pierce one side and cut through the inside crumb in a swivel fashion, the point of entry serving as axis, without widening the slit. The inside section of crumb may then easily be lifted out, any uncut extremities tearing loose without damaging the shell. Spread hollowed-out slices generously, inside and out, with butter and put them to color in a slow oven, keeping an eye on them and turning them regularly to ensure their being evenly colored on all sides and no darker than a rich gold at any point. They <a id="page300"></a>may, if necessary, be prepared somewhat ahead of time and rewarmed in the oven.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trim the stem tips of the morels, split each in two and rinse it rapidly beneath a strong jet of water. Sponge them dry between two towels and in a heavy saucepan over a low flame stew gently in butter, seasoned with salt, for about 10 minutes, regularly tossing and stirring with a wooden spoon. Add about ⅔ of the cream, reduce over a high dame, stirring, until it thickens and clings to the mushrooms, remove from the flame, taste for salt, sprinkle with pepper, and stir in remaining cream. Fill the crusts and serve, a pinch of chopped chervil topping each.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_6">THE PINEAPPLE SURPRISE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A surprise anything, culinarily speaking, is, of course, something whose exterior does not prepare one’s guests for its contents.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pineapple marries well with other acid fruits, and in particular with strawberries, raspberries, and orange juice (which may, if one likes, replace the raspberry purée in this recipe). Kirsch or other liqueurs are often added to the maceration liquid, but for many, this sophistication destroys the purity of the fruit.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c19-s76"><em><span class="color">Pineapple Surprise</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Ananas en Surprise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large, ripe pineapple</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pint small, ripe strawberries (or wild strawberries)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup of sugar (or to taste)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pint fresh (or frozen) raspberries, puréed</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut in and downward at an angle around the top of the pineapple to remove a lid, cut out the flesh from the lid, and discard the core. Cut deeply down and circularly around the core in the main body of the pineapple, and as far down as possible without piercing the shell, all <a id="page301"></a>the way around, about ½ to ⅔ inch in from the outside. Cut a series of “spokes” between the two circular incisions and force the sections loose with your fingers, emptying out the remaining flesh with a spoon, crushing it as little as possible. Cut inward all around the base of the core (because of its awkward position, it is not possible to slice it cleanly across), break it off at its base and discard it. Scrape the inside of the shell clean with a tablespoon and put the lid and the shell to chill (if the shell has accidentally been pierced, freeze it. This will prevent leakage during the serving). Put aside any mashed pineapple and the juice for another use.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the pineapple flesh into cubes, pick over the strawberries, wash them rapidly, drain them, add them to the pineapple cubes, sprinkle with sugar, and store, covered, in the refrigerator until just before serving. Fill the shell, without packing, with the macerated fruits and pour the raspberry purée over. The pineapple may be served half embedded in cracked ice, which is attractive, ensures its remaining chilled for a second service, and facilitates the service by stabilizing the fruit.</p>
