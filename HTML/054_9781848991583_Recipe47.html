<p class="normal"><b>When you are making chocolate cookies, the choice of chocolate is very important. Here, I have chosen chocolate with 60% pure cocoa—not overbitter, as a lot of people don’t like that, but instead one that is a touch richer, with hint of tobacco leaf, bark and spices coming through to give a thoroughly modern twist. The cookies have a soft, cakelike texture.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup less 1 tablespoon coconut milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons toasted shredded coconut</p>
<p class="acktxta">1¾ cups heavy cream</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CHOCOLATE COOKIES</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 ounces dark chocolate, 60% cocoa solids, broken into pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup superfinesugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup plus 1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch salt</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the ice cream, first make a sabayon (see <a href="140_9781848991583_KitchenTerminology.html#pageid_218">page 218</a>). Whisk together the egg yolks and coconut milk in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk 5 to 8 minutes until it thickens. Remove the pan from the heat, add the shredded coconut and whisk continuously until the mixture cools completely.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Whip the cream, using an electric mixer, until soft peaks form, then fold it into the sabayon. Pour into a 1-pint freezerproof container. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the freezer at least 3 hours until firm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To make the cookies, heat the oven to 425°F. Lightly grease two 12-hole mini tart pans. Melt the chocolate and butter in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Meanwhile, beat together the egg yolks and sugar in a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, about 5 minutes until pale, thick and double in volume.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> As soon as the chocolate melts, fold in the flour with a wooden spoon or spatula until they are combined. You must be very careful when doing this and work quite quickly. Pour the chocolate mixture slowly into the egg mixture and fold together.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Whisk the egg whites with the salt in a large, clean bowl until soft peaks form, then fold them into the chocolate mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared tart pans, half-filling each hole, to make 12 to 18 cookies. Bake 5 to 6 minutes until they are risen and slightly firm to the touch. Remove the pan from the oven and turn out the cookies onto a wire rack to cool until just lukewarm, then serve with the coconut ice cream.</p>
