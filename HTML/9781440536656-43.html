				<p class="recipe-message"><span>Homemade gnocchi is truly a treat — and it’s much easier than it seems! This version is sweeter than its regular russet counterpart.</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-yield"><span>Serves 4</span></p>
				<p class="centered-art"><img alt="" height="11" src="images/ornament_leaf.gif" width="35"/></p>
				<p class="recipe-ing-head"><span>Ingredients</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>1 baked sweet potato, 1 pound</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span><span class="fractions"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cup flour</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span><span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> teaspoon salt</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>1 egg, beaten</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span><span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cup melted and browned butter</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>1 teaspoon chopped sage</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span><span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cup grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
				<ol class="recipe">
					<li><p class="recipestep">Scoop the cooked sweet-potato flesh out of the skin and mash it with a fork, or put it through a potato ricer or food mill. Toss the potatoes with the flour and salt in a bowl with your hands. Use a light touch.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Make a well in the center of the sweet potato mixture and put the egg in it. Gradually incorporate the potato mixture into the egg to make a dough that comes together. Roll dough into 1-inch-thick logs and cut 1-inch pieces off the logs.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">For the traditional indentations, roll each piece down the tines of a floured fork and flick it off with your thumb.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the gnocchi, stir, and then cook until they float to the top, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Drain the gnocchi and put them in a serving dish. Toss the gnocchi with the melted browned butter and sage to coat. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over them and serve immediately.</p></li>

				<p class="recipesidebar">Gnocchi can be made with other things besides potatoes and sweet potatoes. Butternut squash is a good one. Spinach can be added to regular potato gnocchi, and ricotta cheese is another delish gnocchi.</p></div>
