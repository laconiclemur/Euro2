<p class="summary"><span class="italic">They eat a lot of game in Extremadura, where every village has its own wild boar recipe. Some of the most sophisticated recipes, with wine and spirits, originated in the monasteries. When I went to buy wild boar for this stew at Borough Market in London, the young Italian butcher who waited on me said, “Use shoulder, because it has some fat—otherwise the meat will get stringy if you cook it for two and a half hours.” He removed the thick outer layer of fat and cut the meat into large pieces for me.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Wild boar is common in Spain, where the animals run free in parts of the countryside. I have found recipes from various regions. Sometimes port is used, sometimes a spirit such as Calvados. This recipe was sent to me by Pepe Iglesias (see page 328). Serve it with slices of good bread to soak up the sauce or with mashed or boiled potatoes, or with chestnuts boiled in milk (page 408), or with whole roasted apples.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds boneless wild boar shoulder, excess fat removed, cut into large pieces</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 large carrots, diced</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">A head of garlic, cloves separated and peeled</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups dry red wine</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">2 thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="recsum">Brown the meat lightly all over in the oil in a wide casserole; remove it. Put in the carrots, onion, and garlic and sauté, stirring, until they are soft and just beginning to color. Add the meat, pour in the wine, and add just enough water to cover the meat. Add the bay leaves, thyme, cinnamon, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for about 2½ hours, until the meat is extremely tender, adding water to keep the meat covered and turning the pieces occasionally.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Add 2 to 3 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Remove the meat and blend the sauce with an immersion blender, then return the meat and heat through.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• For a Catalan version, omit the carrots, and add 2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped, to the onion and garlic once they’ve softened. Add ¼ cup brandy or port and about 3 tablespoons grated bittersweet chocolate about 10 minutes before the meat is done.</p>
