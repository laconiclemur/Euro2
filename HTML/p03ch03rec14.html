<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">croquetas de jamón</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Different types of croquettes—made with ham, chicken, salt cod, and seafood, or even cheese—are served in every tapas bar and restaurant. The one with ham is the</span> reina de las croquetas<span class="italic">, the queen of croquettes. I tried many different recipes that were very elaborate and difficult; this one is extremely simple and works perfectly well. It is creamy inside with a good strong flavor.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Angelita García de Paredes, a Franciscan missionary nun in a convent in Seville (see page 214), gave me the recipe. She makes the béchamel in a particular way, and it is thicker than in other</span> croqueta <span class="italic">recipes. When the batter is chilled, it firms quite a bit, making it easier to shape, and when it is fried, it becomes creamy inside with a thick crisp crust. You can prepare the</span> croquetas <span class="italic">for frying the day before and keep them in the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES ABOUT 30</span> <span class="italic">CROQUETAS</span></p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons (¾ stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">7 ounces sliced jamón serrano or prosciutto, finely chopped (in the food processor if you like)</p>
<p class="qun">Pinch of nutmeg</p>
<p class="qun">3 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">Salt if necessary</p>
<p class="qun">Fine matzo meal or fine dry bread crumbs</p>
<p class="qun">Medium matzo meal or dry bread crumbs</p>
<p class="qun">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun1">Sunflower or olive oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="recsum">Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat and gently sauté the onion until it is soft. Add the ham and cook, stirring, for a minute or so. Stir in the nutmeg and 1½ cups of the milk and bring to a boil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">With an electric mixer, beat the flour with the remaining 1½ cups milk in a bowl until any lumps have disappeared. Pour into the pan, stirring vigorously, and cook, stirring constantly, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the béchamel is a thick paste that comes away from the bottom of the pan. Add salt if necessary—it may not need it because the ham is salty. Scrape into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To make the <span class="italic">croquetas,</span> cover a large plate with plenty of fine matzo meal or bread crumbs and a second plate with medium matzo meal or bread crumbs. Beat the eggs lightly in a soup plate.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Most Spanish cooks use two large spoons greased with oil to shape the <span class="italic">croquetas</span> into ovals; Angelita uses a pastry bag to squeeze out tubular pieces. But you may find it easier, as I do, to take lumps of the béchamel paste the size of a walnut and roll them into balls between the palms of your hands. You can rub your hands in oil to keep the paste from sticking. Drop the <span class="italic">croquetas</span> as you make them, in batches, into the fine matzo meal or bread crumbs. Roll the balls in the fine matzo meal to cover them well all over, then roll them in the beaten egg and then in the medium matzo meal. This will give them a nice thick crust.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the oil in a deep skillet until it is only medium hot (until a piece of bread dropped in sizzles immediately but does not turn dark quickly). Lower the <span class="italic">croquetas</span> into the oil, in batches, and fry over medium-low heat for 5 to 6 minutes, until lightly browned, turning them once. (If the oil is too hot, they will burst.) Lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. They are best eaten right away, but they can be reheated in the oven.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">For <span class="italic">croquetas de bacalao,</span> with salt cod, or for <span class="italic">croquetas</span> with fresh cod, boil 7 ounces desalted salt cod (see <span class="italic">Bacalao,</span> page 338) or fresh cod fillets for 3 to 5 minutes in water or milk, until the flesh begins to flake when you cut into it, then drain. When the cod is cool enough to handle, remove and discard any skin or bones and shred the flesh with your fingers, then mix it into the hot béchamel. Add salt to taste, a pinch of nutmeg, and some finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, and proceed as above.</p>
