Green salads contain important vitamins, minerals and trace elements, but no fat. This is why salads are ideal for healthy low-calorie nutrition.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Buying and storage</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">• Always use fresh, crisp green salads and vegetables when making any kind of salad.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Vegetables grown outdoors and available at markets are preferable to those sold in supermarkets because the leaves are firmer and also contain more nutrients and fewer nitrates.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Do not crush lettuces when transporting them.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Fresh lettuce leaves should be wrapped in a damp cloth or in a large plastic bag into which a little air has been blown, then close the bag carefully and store in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator. In this way the salad will not get crushed and the air in the bag will ensure that it remains fresh for longer.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Green salads should not be stored for a long time but consumed as soon as possible after they have been purchased.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Only some varieties, such as iceberg lettuce, can be stored for several days in the refrigerator if wrapped in clingfilm.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Preparation</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">• Remove the outer, unsightly leaves.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Separate the leaves and remove any bad parts. Wash the leaves thoroughly but gently in cold water (this process should be repeated several times if the lettuce is very dirty). Do not crush the leaves or let them soak too long in the water because this makes the leaves wilt and valuable nutrients may be lost in the water.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Drain the leaves thoroughly in a colander or sieve, or spin dry in a salad spinner.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Thick stems and hard central ribs should be removed and the leaves torn onto pieces of the required size (varieties with tougher leaves can be cut up with a knife if necessary).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • For vegetable salads, grate the prepared vegetables finely or coarsely as required, or cut into wavy or smooth slices or strips with a non-ferrous knife.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Put all the salad ingredients in a large enough bowl so that the salad dressing can be stirred in easily.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Only stir in the salad dressing just before serving.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Salad dressings</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">A salad dressing should enhance and complement the taste of the salad ingredients and not dominate them. A basic recipe on which many others are based is the oil and vinegar dressing (vinaigrette). It is made with 1 part vinegar and 1–2 parts vegetable oil, seasoned with pepper, salt, sugar and further enhanced with the addition of fresh herbs, chopped onions and a little mustard if desired. First add the seasoning to the vinegar and stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved, then stir in the mustard and whisk in the oil. Finally, add the herbs and chopped onion.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Creamy dressings</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To make creamy dressings, lemon juice or vinegar is added to sour or whipping cream. The mixture is then seasoned to taste and flavoured with herbs.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Mayonnaise </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> When making mayonnaise, only use very fresh eggs (check the sell-by date). Store the ready-prepared salad in the fridge and consume within 24 hours. The calorie content of mayonnaise can be reduced by replacing part of it with curd cheese, fromage blanc or yogurt.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Oil and vinegar </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The choice of oil and vinegar can strongly influence the taste of a salad. Wine and herb vinegars are very versatile and can be used in many dressings, while a dark balsamic vinegar would not suit every salad. Sunflower oil, cornflower oil and rapeseed oil have a relatively neutral taste. Olive oil and walnut oil, on the other hand, have a much stronger taste. Only use high quality oil for salad dressings.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Garlic</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Garlic adds a special aroma to salads. Those who only like a hint of garlic should rub the bowl with a clove a garlic cut in half. Those who prefer a stronger taste can crush the garlic in a garlic press or cut the cloves into slices and add directly to the salad.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Salad leaf information</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Batavia lettuce</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This is considered a cross between the iceberg and head lettuce because of the appearance of the leaves. But the varieties do differ both in the colour and texture of the leaves. The taste varies from spicy to mildly sweet.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cabbage or head lettuce</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> One of the most popular lettuce varieties with a more or less closed head with floppy leaves. The inner leaves are pale yellow.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Chicory</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A sturdy, white herbaceous perennial with pale yellow pointed leaves and a slightly bitter taste. It must be stored in a dark place; otherwise the tips turn green and become very bitter.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Chinese cabbage </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> More a vegetable used in salads than a lettuce, this is an extremely popular salad ingredient. It has an oval cabbage head with pale green, slightly curly leaves and a mild cabbage taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cos (romaine)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Firm green head with long, narrow crunchy leaves. Slightly bitter taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Curly endive </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Curly-leaved endive variety with delicate, pinnate, pale green outer leaves and yellow inner leaves. Crunchy texture and slightly bitter taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Dandelion </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A rediscovered variety in the range of green salads with narrow, toothed leaves. Cultivated dandelion has a milder flavour than that growing in the wild.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Endive </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Firm head with green outer leaves and pale yellow inner leaves. Broad, smooth leaves with coarse serrations.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Iceberg lettuce </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Crisp, pale green leaves with very little taste of their own. This very crunchy lettuce will keep for several days in the fridge if wrapped in clingfilm.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Lamb’s lettuce</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Small florets of small, darkgreen leaves with a firm texture. Rich in vitamins and minerals (potassium and iron). Pleasant nutty aroma.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Lollo Rossa, Lollo Bionda </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> These are part of the endive family. Crunchy red or pale green leaves with a slightly bitter, nutty flavour.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Oak-leaf lettuce</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Slightly lacerated leaves resembling oak leaves, they are green with red tips and a slightly nutty taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Purslane</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This has delicate, smooth, long-stemmed fleshy leaves grouped in a floret. It is prepared like lamb’s lettuce but can also be cooked like spinach.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Radicchio </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Fist-size, very firm heads with violet-red to pink-red leaves, marked with white veins. Slightly bitter taste.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Rocket</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Narrow serrated leaves with a spicy-nutty, peppery flavour. Sold as a bunch or in a bag.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_126"></div>
