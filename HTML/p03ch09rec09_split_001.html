<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Capons, geese, guinea fowl, and turkeys are Christmas specials in Spain. Capons are especially popular in the north. Every year on December 21, there is a capon fair at Villalba in Galicia, where the birds are raised on a diet of boiled cornmeal and potatoes or chestnuts soaked in milk or white wine. Capons from Villalba also appear in other Spanish markets. Capons are roosters that are castrated by hormone injection and fattened to reach enormous weights. Their meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than chicken. Catalans make glorious stuffings with different combinations of dried fruit, nuts, sausage, and brandy (see the variations), which they also use for turkey.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This recipe is based on one from an archive of recipes of the Fundació Institut Català de la Cuina (see page 105). You can also use it for turkey and for very fat chickens. I always cook the stuffing separately. Take the bird out of the fridge 2 hours before you want to start cooking it.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 capon (about 7 pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 Golden Delicious or Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut in half</p>
<p class="qun">2 onions, quartered</p>
<p class="qun">1 head of garlic, cut horizontally in half</p>
<p class="qun">2 ripe tomatoes, peeled and quartered</p>
<p class="qun">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup sweet white wine, such as Moscatel</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup brandy</p>
<p class="qun">Pepper</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE STUFFING</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound soft pitted prunes</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound soft dried peaches or apricots</p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup brandy</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound ground pork</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound thin pork sausages or Italian pork sausages, skinned and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup pine nuts</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="qun1">1 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="recsum">Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the capon, if there are any, and remove any string or trussing. Rinse the bird inside and out in cold running water. Season generously with salt and rub with the olive oil. Push the apples into the cavity and place the bird breast side down in a roasting pan. Put the onions, garlic, tomatoes, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves around it and pour in the wine. Cover loosely with a foil tent. Place the roasting pan in the middle of a preheated 375°F oven and cook for 1 hour and 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1"><span>Meanwhile, for the stuffing, coarsely chop the prunes and dried peaches or apricots. Put them in a bowl with the brandy to soak for at least 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p class="summary">Fry the onion in the oil in a large skillet until soft. Add the pork, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up the meat and turning it, until it changes color. Make space for the sausages, put them in, and turn them until they change color. Add the pine nuts and stir for a minute or two, then stir in the ground almonds and cinnamon. Mix the pork mixture with the dried fruits and their brandy and place in the middle of a large double sheet of foil. Bring the sides up making a parcel. Alternatively, put the stuffing in a deep baking dish, press down firmly, and cover with foil. Place on a rack below the capon.</p>
<p class="summary">Take the roasting pan out, remove the foil, turn the capon breast side up, and roast, uncovered, for another 35 to 50 minutes, until well cooked and golden brown: it is done if you pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a pointed knife and the juices run clear. (For different-sized birds, allow 17 minutes per pound plus 30 minutes.)</p>
<p class="summary">Transfer the capon to a serving platter. Remove most of the fat from the pan juices, and place the roasting pan over medium heat. Stir in the brandy and deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper, and pour into a jug.</p>
<p class="summary">Carve the bird and serve accompanied by the sauce and stuffing.</p>
