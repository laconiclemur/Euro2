ice and dried pulses are considered little more than padding in much of the western world, accompaniments to the more highly prized meat or fish. Not so in Spain, where top quality beans, chickpeas, lentils and rice command high prices and play a key role in many celebrated regional dishes.</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Paella</em>
 is, without a doubt, Spain’s most famous dish, the stereotypical holiday feast served along with a jug of <em>sangría</em>
. But, when tourists expect heaps of shellfish, chicken or meat with a little tasty rice to soak up the juices they are missing the point. The rice is the star of the show here. It must be well flavoured, firm and yet moist, but on no account sticky, and ideally a little crunchy and caramelized on the bottom of the pan. Cooking the <em>paella</em>
 is often male territory with plenty of testosterone fuelled competition but, magic touches and family secrets apart, what every cook will agree on is the need for the right rice. Many market stalls, particularly those of Mediterranean Spain, stock a few different varieties of the short-grain <em>paella</em>
 rice – <em>Bahía</em>
 rice from the Ebro delta, the <em>Senia</em>
 variety from Valencia and the more expensive <em>Bomba</em>
 grain from Calasparra, grown increasingly in the other regions too. Locals are typically vehement about the superiority of their own local grain but even a <em>Valenciano</em>
 will concede that <em>Bomba</em>
 rice is more forgiving and less likely to end up as a stodgy mess in the hands of a novice. Smaller quantities of long-grain rice are sold too; ideal for salads, a quick supper topped with tomato sauce and fried egg or the festive dish of <em>Moros y Cristianos</em>
 (see page 96).</p>
<p class="indent">Beans are given cult status in the maritime regions of the North, where many of the varieties first arrived from the Americas. The legume stall in Santander’s covered market resembles a pick-and-mix sweet counter with over 30 varieties of legume on offer. Discerning shoppers run their hands through the beans; they should feel shiny and soft with no hint of a wrinkle. ‘<em>Son todas nuevas</em>
’, they are all new season, the labels reassure, since contrary to popular belief a bean does have a shelf life. Bean lovers check for any signs of discoloration around the eye or hilum of the bean, a sign of oxidization and poor quality. Green beans from Llanes, red beans from Guerníka, black beans from Tolosa – each region has its bean and each bean a specific dish. Beans and pulses were once known as the ‘<em>carne de los pobres</em>
’, the meat of the poor. Today nothing could be further from the truth, with the buttery, white <em>Fabes de la Granja</em>
 of Asturias fetching well over 10 Euros a kilo.</p>
<p class="indent">Chickpeas and lentils, the cornerstones of the old Spanish kitchen, are also subject to much predilection, particularly in Castille and Andalucia. Keen cooks will certainly expect a good selection for their precious <em>Cocidos</em>
, or stews (see page 88). Who would believe you could be choosy about a chickpea? Well, a southerner will probably plump for his local <em>Garbanzo Andaluz</em>
, a monster of a chickpea with plenty of flavour. Meanwhile, in Castille the more subtle qualities of the <em>Garbanzo Castellano</em>
, with its almost indiscernible skin, are preferred. Certain lentils enjoy celebrity status too, the green <em>Lenteja de la Armuña</em>
 with its buttery texture and the smaller, brown <em>Pardina</em>
 renowned for its delicate taste.</p>
<p class="indent">Freshly cooked beans and pulses are available in larger city markets too, ideal for their fast-lane customers with no time for all that soaking and slow cooking – a boon for the more forgetful among us, who always seem to remember tonight’s beans over breakfast.</p>

cocido madrileño</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_4">madrid’s feast in a pot</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Many foreigners mistakenly consider Valencia’s <em>paella</em>
 as Spain’s signature dish, but ask a local and he will almost certainly herald the <em>cocido</em>
 as the nation’s most traditional feast; a meal of chickpeas, meat and vegetables cooked in a flavoursome broth – three courses in one pot. Every area of Spain has its own local rendition (see opposite) but the king of the castle is undoubtedly the <em>Cocido Madrileño</em>
.</p>
<p class="indent">Until recent times the <em>cocido</em>
 was an everyday dish, sometimes little more than chickpeas flavoured with a ham bone, an old boiling chicken and a few vegetables with meatier versions confined to the more affluent households. Nowadays time is precious, we are all on the run and the notion of the lady of the house taking a day to source and prepare the family meal is long gone. The <em>cocido</em>
 has risen to new heights, a dish for high days and holidays.</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to soak your chickpeas overnight.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 6–8</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 litres/5 pints water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>750 g/1½ lb beef or veal shin or 500 g/1 lb 2 oz chuck steak, in one piece, and a beef bone</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 knuckle of <strong>
<em>jamón Serrano</em>

, or any unsmoked ham, with a little meat still attached</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz <strong>

<strong>200 g/7 oz of bacon or belly pork, in 1 piece</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7 oz cooking <strong>
<em>chorizo</em>
</strong>
 (see page 49), left in whole links</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 medium potatoes, peeled and cut in half</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7 oz <strong>
<em>morcilla</em>
</strong>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7oz swiss chard, spinach or cabbage</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7 oz <strong>
<em>fideos</em>
</strong>
, <strong>
<em>vermicelli</em>
</strong>
, or other tiny pasta</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the water into a large pot, add the beef, the ham bone, the ham, the bacon, the head of garlic and the bay leaves, then bring to the boil, skimming off any of the grey foam as it comes to the surface.</p>
<p class="extract">Drain the chickpeas and add to the pot together with the carrots, leeks, celery and onion. Purists will add the chickpeas in a muslin bag or net so that they can be removed easily and served separately from the vegetables. I have never felt the need to. Ensure that all the ingredients are submerged in the water, then bring to the boil and skim the foam away again. Continue to cook, covered, at a steady simmer. Topping up with hot water as necessary.</p>
<p class="extract">After an hour add the chicken and the <em>chorizo</em>
, and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the chickpeas are almost tender.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the potatoes and <em>morcilla</em>
 or black pudding and then after another 10 minutes the chard or cabbage. Once the potatoes are tender then your <em>cocido</em>
 is ready. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as necessary.</p>
<p class="extract">After an hour add the chicken and the chorizo, andNext strain off most of the stock and boil the <em>fideos</em>
, or pasta until tender. This soup will be served as the starter.</p>
<p class="extract">Chop the beef, bacon, ham, <em>chorizo</em>
 and <em>morcilla</em>
 into serving pieces and arrange them on a platter with the chicken. Pile the chickpeas and vegetables on another dish and serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Optional trimmings</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiny unlaid eggs of a boiling fowl are sometimes tossed into the pot at the last minute to poach gently in the broth. These are often available in the market at the poultry stall if you are feeling adventurous.</p>
<p class="extract">On special occasions the <em>cocido</em>
 may be served with meatballs, or <em>pelotas</em>
. A selection of the meat is taken from the pot, about 200 g/7 oz in total, and minced meticulously by hand or whizzed in a food processor. The mixture is seasoned with a little garlic, parsley, salt and pepper and then bound together with a couple of beaten eggs and some breadcrumbs. The <em>pelotas</em>
 are fried in olive oil and added to the pot for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Regional variations</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">The <em>cocido</em>
 appears, in one guise or another, all over the country – a pot of chickpeas or beans, ham bones and whatever the local larder has to offer.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">The famous <em>Cocido Maragato</em>
 of León is a carnivore’s delight packed with lamb, cured beef and pork. It is topped with dumplings made from breadcrumbs and stock.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Andalucia’s <em>Puchero</em>
 replaces much of the meat with more economical vegetables such as pumpkin, courgettes and beans.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Mallorca’s <em>Sopa i Bullit</em>

arroz a la cubana</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_6">cuban rice</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This combination of white rice, tomato sauce, fried eggs and banana is suprisingly good. It makes a simple and satisfying lunch dish and is an absolute winner with children. This dish is particularly popular in Catalonia a region where flaming spiced rum and the sound of lilting sea shanties, named <em>Habaneras</em>
, hark back to the days when local <em>émigrés</em>
 returned from Cuba.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 x recipe tomato sauce (see page 69 with meatballs)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 g/9 oz long-grain white rice</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 small bananas</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp butter</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp olive or vegetable oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 large eggs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>pinch of sweet or hot paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by making the tomato sauce. If you are in a hurry you could even cheat and use a jar of good quality <em>tomate frito</em>
, a pre-made tomato sauce available in Spain, obviously not as good as the real thing but an absolute boon when you are rushing.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, cook the white rice using the foolproof method right.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the bananas in half lengthways and fry in the butter at once, otherwise they will oxidize and brown. Once the bananas have coloured slightly set them aside and keep warm.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the oil to the pan and fry the eggs over a high heat until the yolks have just set and the whites are crisp around the edges.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve the rice in a mound topped with the egg and bananas and surrounded with the tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper and paprika.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Perfect rice everytime</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Place the required quantity of long-grain white rice in a measuring jug and calculate double its volume of water or stock.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Take a heavy saucepan with a tightly fitting lid and bring the liquid up to the boil with 1 tsp salt for each 250 g/9 oz of rice.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Add the rice and stir just once (frequent stirring equals sticky rice). Turn down the heat, cover and simmer gently for 12 minutes. Do not be tempted to remove the lid or, worse still, stir the rice at this stage.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Leave the rice, lid on, to rest for at least 5 minutes and up to 20 minutes so that it absorbs the steam. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</span>

potaje de alubias rojas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_8">basque red bean stew</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Guernika’s vibrant weekly market is packed with fabulous produce. Stalls are hung with strings of the dried red <em>choricero</em>
 peppers that play a vital role in many classic dishes of the Basque kitchen. There are baskets heaped with the local red beans too, which I was of course assured, are infinitely superior to the equally famous black beans of Tolosa up the road.</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to soak the red beans overnight.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4–6</p>

<p class="extract">After about an hour add half the olive oil, the meat, the leek and the onion quarters and continue to simmer and ‘shock’ the beans until they are tender.</p>

<p class="extract">Once the beans are almost ready remove the leek and onion together with a couple of ladles of beans. Transfer to a blender and process until smooth. Alternatively, chop, then mash to a paste.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the <em>chorizo</em>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_10">beans with shellfish</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This is a fabulous combination from the bean-loving province of Asturias in the North. Although locals are capable of scoffing this as a starter I would happily serve it as a one-course lunch accompanied by good bread and maybe a simple green salad. You will need to soak the beans overnight.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4–6</p>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>large pinch of saffron strands</strong>

<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by making a prawn stock with the shells and heads (see page 20).</p>
<p class="extract">Drain the beans and place them in a large pan with the onion quarters, bay leaf, prawn stock and enough water to cover them. Bring to the boil and skim off any froth, then reduce the heat and simmer gently. Pour in a little cold water every 20 minutes to ‘shock’ the beans, making sure that they are just covered with liquid.</p>
<p class="extract">After about an hour add 2 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp salt and continue to cook the beans until they are tender, about 10–40 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the beans are ready, it’s time to cook the shellfish.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat about 3 tbsp olive oil in a pan, add the diced onions and fry until translucent. Next add the garlic and, once it has turned golden, add the prawns. Cook for a matter of moments until they firm up, then remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the wine into a large pan with a lid and bring to the boil. Add the clams and cover the pan. Give it a little shake from time to time, until the shells all open. Discard any that remain closed.</p>
<p class="extract">Shuck half of the clams and leave the rest in their shells. If the pan juices look gritty, and some clams can be very sandy, then you will need to strain the liquid.</p>
<p class="extract">Now it is time to put the dish together. Add the clam liquid to the bean pot. Grind the saffron and a pinch of salt in a mortar with a pestle, then add to the beans together with half of the parsley. Stir in the prawns, onions and garlic together with all the clams and simmer the beans for a minute. Check the seasoning, sprinkle with the remaining parsley and leave to stand for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<strong>Soaking and cooking beans</strong>

<span class="gray">The Spanish take their beans seriously; buying the best quality they can get their hands on. Try to get hold of this year’s beans if possible.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Soak beans in 5 litres/9 pints of cold water per kilo of beans for 8 hours. It is best not to add salt, or salty pork products, to the beans until at least halfway through the cooking time otherwise they will toughen.</span>

lentejas con alcachofas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_12">lentils with artichokes</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This is comfort food at its best. Lentils are quick and easy to prepare with none of the soaking time required by other pulses, and they also make an immensely satisfying dish when combined with a touch of pork fat, be it bacon or <em>chorizo</em>
, or in this case both.</p>
<p class="indent">The addition of artichokes gives an everyday supper dish a bit of pizzazz. Some cooks will add the artichokes directly to the pot but, since lentils are famously unpredictable, their cooking time ranging from 20 minutes to an hour, this could be a recipe for disappointingly soggy artichokes. I would rather cook the artichokes and potato apart.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4–6</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 onions, diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 carrot, peeled and finely diced</strong>

<strong>1 potato, cut into bite-sized pieces</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>splash of extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the onions and carrot and cook until soft. Next add the tomatoes, garlic, <em>chorizo</em>
 and <em>panceta</em>
 or bacon and continue to cook until the pan is swirling with the red <em>chorizo</em>
 fat.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the lentils and cumin, stirring to coat in the oil, then add enough water to completely cover the lentils. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook stirring from time to time until the lentils are soft and cooked through. You may need to add a little water to the pan from time to time to keep the lentils covered.</p>
<p class="extract">The idea is to finish up with something that can be spooned rather than poured.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, place the prepared artichoke quarters and the potatoes in a separate saucepan of boiling salted water and boil for 15–20 minutes until they are tender.</p>
<p class="extract">Stir the artichokes into the cooked lentils, season with salt and pepper and serve with a good splash of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a quicker option the lentils are fabulous without the artichokes too.</p>
<p class="extract">Simply boiled artichokes and potatoes make a fabulous starter, especially using tiny, new potatoes. Serve with lashings of extra virgin olive oil, salt, plenty of black pepper and a sprig of fresh parsley or thyme.</p>

<strong>Lentil know-how</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Look out for the tiny, dark <em>pardinas</em>
 or larger <em>lentejas de Armuña</em>
 from Castilla y León.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Brown or green lentils will hold their shape and so are ideal for stews, salads and side dishes while red lentils break down to a soft soupy consistency.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Lentils require no soaking unless you wish to reduce their cooking time, about 3 hours immersed in cold water will give you an approximately 15-minute lentil.</span>

<span class="gray">Do not salt lentils until they are cooked, or the skins may toughen.</span>

olla gitana</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_14">gypsy stew</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Having driven for hours through the Andalucian Sierras to reach Cádiar, we were greeted by a Women’s Institute-style jam and chutney stall. The British expats had moved in big time. Now, I have nothing against a few Brits abroad, but I was on a quest for local flavour. Thankfully, after a lively chat at the vegetable stall, a very generous Señora Lopez shared this wonderful recipe with me. The dish is in fact from the neighbouring province of Murcia, but different renditions of this vegetarian hotpot are common all over the south. You may like to substitute the pears with parsnips, as they do in Murcia when ripe pears are unavailable. You will need to soak your pulses overnight.</p>

moros y cristianos</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_16">rice and beans</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Once a year grown men reach into the dressing up box for gaudy turbans, shiny helmets, swords and blunderbusses. Gunpowder and cigar smoke fill the air. It is April, and towns all over Valencia’s Levante region stage mock battles to commemorate the Christian re-conquest of Spain: the festival of <em>Moros y Cristianos</em>
. The black beans and white rice supposedly represent the opposing factions. In fact they complement each other very well, just as the Moors and Christians had done for many centuries before the Catholic purging of Spain. You will need to soak your beans overnight.</p>

<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 large sprig of fresh parsley, chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 orange, peeled, cut into segments</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin with the Moors. Place the beans in a large pan with the bay leaf, cover with water and boil for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat and continue to simmer for about 1½ hours, or until the beans are tender. You may need to top up the water from time to time. Once cooked, drain the beans and stir in the orange juice, zest and paprika.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and green pepper and fry until soft. Add the garlic and when you can smell the garlic cooking add the tomatoes and cook for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Stir the onion mixture in with the beans and season with salt and pepper to taste. Reheat over a medium heat once you are ready to serve.</p>
<p class="extract">Now for the Christians. It is time to cook the rice. Heat the olive oil or butter in a pan, add the onion and fry until soft. Add the rice and stir well to coat the grains with the oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Boil the stock or water and wine in another saucepan, and add to the rice with the thyme and a pinch of salt. Cook, covered, until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. If the rice seems a little firm just add another 100 ml/ 3 ½ fl oz water and return to the heat until it is absorbed..</p>
<p class="extract">Garnish the beans with chopped parsley and a few orange segments. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve with the rice (see above for presentation tips).</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Presentation</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">To serve, you could just mound the beans in the centre of a platter and tip the rice around the edge. However, many households favour a more fancy presentation for this <em>fiesta</em>
 dish. You will need to grease a ring mould and pack the rice into it. It may be worth cooking 400 g/14 oz of rice in 1 litre/ 1<strong>¾</strong>
 pints stock to ensure you have enough rice to fill the mould. Next invert the rice onto a large platter and place the beans in the centre.</span>
</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">This is a very satisfying vegetarian dish although you could add <em>jamón</em>
 to the beans to pacify more resolute carnivores.</span>

paella valenciana</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_18">the original paella</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Where better to glean an authentic recipe for the traditional <em>paella</em>
, than Valencia’s <em>Mercat Central</em>
? After a full scale debate, all I could conclude was that fish and shellfish are absolutely out of the question, pork and duck had a large question mark hanging over them and snails, artichokes and asparagus were optional extras. Read the tips on the right before you start.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 6</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3–4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 red pepper, cut into strips</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 small chicken, jointed into bite sized pieces, or better 4 chicken legs, jointed</strong>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a few sprigs of fresh rosemary</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the red pepper strips and fry until they have softened. Set aside for the garnish later.</p>
<p class="extract">Season the chicken and rabbit pieces with a pinch of salt and fry in the same oil until golden brown. This browning is vital to the taste of the <em>paella</em>
 so you will need to be patient and put up with the spitting olive oil. A pair of long kitchen tongs come in handy.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the garlic and, once it begins to colour, sprinkle in the paprika. Now give everything a quick stir before adding the tomato. Cook for 5 minutes until its juices have evaporated.</p>
<p class="extract">Add about half of the water together with the snails, if using, and all the beans. Simmer for about 15 minutes until the chicken and rabbit are cooked through and the beans are tender.</p>
<p class="extract">Stir in the saffron, the rice and a pinch of salt. Next pour in the remaining water. The ingredients should be completely submerged, so you may have to add a little extra water. Now, without stirring, cook over a high heat for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat and simmer for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Check that the rice is just about cooked, if it is still firm you may need to add a splash more water and continue to cook for a couple more minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Garnish with the reserved pepper strips and rosemary sprigs and cover with foil or a cloth, some still swear by a newspaper. Leave to stand for 10 minutes and then serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Paella know-how</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">The right texture will only be achieved using short-grain rice. Look out for the high quality Spanish rice from Calasparra.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">A large flat pan is imperative to cook a successful <em>paella</em>
. The rice should be in an even, shallow layer before the stock is added. A <em>paella</em>
 pan with a 40 cm/16 inch base will feed 6–8 people.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Your pan must be completely flat (I have witnessed pedantic cooks use spirit levels) and cooked over an even heat; ideally the coals of a fire or barbecue, a griddle or very large gas ring. If you are using 2 smaller rings you will need to turn the <em>paella</em>
 regularly to cook evenly.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">As a general rule just over double the volume of stock to rice will give a good result. The rice should be almost cooked through when you leave it to rest. If the rice seems very firm just add a few tablespoons of stock and simmer for a couple of minutes longer.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Do not stir the rice – this is not a risotto, and the crispy browned, rather than burnt crust on the bottom of the pan, the <em>socarrat</em>
, is absolutely delicious.</span>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_20">seafood paella</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Although the <em>paella</em>
 originated as a peasant dish inland, flavoured with whatever the household could muster (see <em>Paella Valenciana</em>
, page 97), for most of us its mere mention conjures up a mouth-watering vision of exotic shellfish atop saffron rice.</p>
<p class="indent">Purists would name any rice dish, bar the true Valenciana, an <em>arroz</em>
, while most Spaniards happily use the term <em>paella</em>
 for any of the traditional rice dishes cooked in the flat, two handled pan of the same name.</p>
<p class="indent">Do include any of the steaming juices from the molluscs in your fish stock, the rice will only ever be as good as the stock it is cooked in.</p>

 pan, or the widest pan you own, add the prawns and langoustines and fry briefly until they colour. Set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the squid to the pan and fry briefly, until it turns opaque, then add the onion and continue cooking until it softens. Next stir in the garlic and once you can smell the garlic, add the tomatoes. When the moisture has evaporated add the rice together with the paprika.</p>
<p class="extract">Grind the saffron, salt and pepper together in a mortar with a pestle and add to the rice. Pour in the stock, give everything a last stir and bring to the boil. Cook over a high heat for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat and simmer for a further 5 minutes before adding the prawns, langoustines, mussels and clams. Simmer for a further 5 minutes, then cover lightly with foil or a cloth.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the rice to stand for at least 10 minutes before serving. The grains of rice on the surface may seem a little firm but they will plump up while the rice is resting.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a seafood <em>fideuà</em>
, a kind of pasta <em>paella</em>
, substitute the rice with 500 g/1 lb 2 oz <em>fideos</em>
, a short pasta about the thickness of Italian <em>vermicelli</em>
 or thin spaghetti, broken into small pieces. You will require a little more stock about 1.5 litres/2½ pints in total. The pasta will only take half the time to cook, so add your shellfish to the pan after about 5 minutes. Once the pasta is cooked and has absorbed all the stock leave the pan to rest for 5–10 minutes before serving.</p>
