  <h3 class="h3a">Everyday beef and vegetable stew</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This is the family stew my wife Liz normally makes at home – nothing fancy or complicated, just good old-fashioned comfort food. It is delicious, nutritious and good value for money, using economical pieces of stewing beef and root vegetables. If you don’t have red wine to hand or don’t want to open a new bottle, simply replace with more stock. Serve with mashed potatoes for a satisfying meal.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">800g/1lb 12oz stewing beef, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large carrots, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 parsnips, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing1">50ml/2fl oz/3 tbsp red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups <a href="part0007_split_005.html#pg21" class="calibre1">beef stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing2">2 tsp tomato purée (paste)</p>

  <p class="para">Rub salt and pepper all over the chunks of beef and dust lightly with flour. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the beef and brown well all over on a high heat. Remove the meat and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">In the same pan, heat the remaining olive oil and sweat the onions on a medium heat for a couple of minutes. Add the carrots, parsnips and thyme and sweat for another 2 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Return the meat to the pan, increase the heat to high, add the wine and allow to evaporate. Add the stock and tomato purée, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook gently for 1 hour 45 minutes, stirring from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove from the heat and serve immediately with mashed potatoes or with some good crusty bread.</p>
