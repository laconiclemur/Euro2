</h1>
<p class="pf">In the poem “Ulysses,” Alfred, Lord Tennyson said, “I am a part of all that I have met.” This statement implies that all encounters, whether positive or negative, are a part of our psyche. It might even mean that we should avoid the negative. In my mind anyway, negative encounters have a reflective reaction within us that brings out positive images.</p>
<p>The farmerly tasks that were assigned to me at a tender age would be unthinkable today. I shoveled cow manure in the barn, raked poop in the chicken coop. I learned to drive the “joker”—a converted Ford, I think it was a Model A, without floorboards, a cab, or fenders. I was twelve years old at the time. We used the joker to pull the hay mower, hay rake, and wagon. When I was sixteen, my parents took a road trip to Oregon to visit my aunt Elma. Two of my sisters went along on the trip, and the rest of the kids were left behind for me to care for along with the routine farm chores, with which I was very familiar by then. There were cows to be fed and milked morning and evening; the milk had to be strained, chilled, and stored in ten-gallon containers, then lifted into a cooling tank to chill before the milkman came to pick them up. The chickens had to be cared for, eggs gathered, and the garden vegetables picked, cleaned, and put away.</p>
<p>The cows were my confidants. I knew each one by name and personality. I was feeding and milking them at the age of ten. By the time the sun came up in the winter, I had milked my share, gulped down a bowl of hot oatmeal, changed from barn clothes to school clothes, grabbed my books and homework, and torn down the quarter-mile road to catch the big, yellow school bus at the corner of what is now named Benson Road.</p>
<p>Many years later, I wondered if my classmates could smell barn on me in school. I asked that question just last week. The reply? “We all smelled like barn!”</p>
<p>We had round, galvanized tubs that usually were used in the sauna building when Mummy washed clothes. In the summertime on hot days, we would fill the tubs with water and set them out to be heated by the sun. We would run out and swish the water around until we determined that the water was warm enough to go “swimming.” I would wear a sunsuit and my younger brother Leonard would wear a pair of shorts. Or nothing. We never worried about sunburn and I don’t recall being burned.</p>

<p>When the Rural Electric Association moved into our area in 1940, my parents were the first to sign up. I was six years old at the time. A Westinghouse stove and refrigerator found a place in the kitchen. Even though we could now cook anything with the turn of a knob, we still fired up the woodstove for baking crusty rye bread and for its “coziness.” I still believe you can’t get the same kind of crust on bread as you can when it is baked in a wood-fired oven.</p>
<p>The Westinghouse refrigerator had smooth rounded corners and hummed away in the kitchen; it took the place of the old oak icebox and was most exciting. The refrigerator came with a cookbook and directions for making ice cream. We always had plenty of milk, cream, and eggs on hand, and in the summertime I could add fresh berries from the woods and fields. I would skim the cream that rose to the top of the ten-gallon containers and mix and churn the cream into ice cream and butter.</p>
<p>It was in about the fourth grade, when we were asked to write what was on our minds, that I truly discovered the joy of writing. From that day on, whenever we were told that part of the curriculum for whatever class we were taking was to write an essay, it excited me. My classmates groaned. This was the beginning of my quest to learn how to write, and that hasn’t been easy. My language was peppered with Finnish words and though I was good at spelling, I wasn’t sure of my grammar. I loved to do research in the library at school, no matter what the topic.</p>
<p>Further, all my routine tasks around the farm gave me ample time to dream about writing. I was too self-conscious to tell anybody, so I wrote secret stories and hid them. My parents gave me a used black Smith Corona typewriter one year for Christmas, and it became my prized possession. I could hack out stories and when I was brave enough, I sent them, secretly, to magazines like <i>Calling All Girls</i>
 and <i>Seventeen.</i>
 I collected a pile of rejection slips.</p>
<p>Much as I loved to cook, I hated the mandatory home economics classes at school. They were nothing new to me. The home economics teacher was short, fat, always wore black dresses, and had dandruff on her shoulders. The classes she taught were a series of endless repetition. Biscuits, muffins, cocoa brownies, and tiring talks about aprons, tying one’s hair back, and washing hands. I wanted more. I wanted to write and I wanted to explore the traditional foods of the world. At the time I felt that I didn’t know enough about anything to actually write about anything. I was a sponge ready to learn, and in addition I had an imagination that had plenty of freedom to roam.</p>
<p>Mr. Riley, the science teacher, was a true inspiration. He was a tough disciplinarian, and the physics and chemistry he taught all made sense to me. I learned the difference between baking soda and baking powder in chemistry class. Soda is a base that reacts with an acid to make a cake rise. Baking powder, on the other hand, has both a base and an acid in its makeup, and all it requires is a liquid to spur the action. I figured the reason that we used one combination or another was merely a matter of taste.</p>
<p>English classes weren’t quite as easy to figure out, although I did enjoy reading the classics that were assigned to us. I couldn’t relate to the characters because I thought they lived in such exotic places. I couldn’t picture the March girls in <i>Little Women</i>
 in barn clothes! But still I thought the farm we lived on was the most beautiful place in the world.</p>
<p>I would walk through the woods and over the fields and hold my fingers to shape a square and imagine a “calendar picture” right in front of me. I’d name the scenes for the topic and season. It was many years later that I had a camera of my own, and when I got it, I was always behind it—so I was in the pictures only in spirit.</p>
<p>It has always been fascinating to me to ponder the idea of inherited traits. Today with DNA testing I may learn the answers to many questions I have about my heritage. Following that thinking, we are also made up of our ancestors’ personalities, whether we knew them personally or not. I have traced back certain traits to my grandparents and note their qualities in myself and my brothers and sisters. That is why I know that the stories about all of my grandparents are important. I thank God for their gifts and their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="psec">In northern Minnesota, a small farm in the mid-1900s required multiple incomes to survive. Springtime brought outside chores. There was the preparation of the fields for planting potatoes, wheat, and oats as well as plowing the “kitchen” garden. There were newborn calves to be nursed and cows with large, heavy bags to be milked twice a day.</p>
<p>We had to wean calves as soon as possible so that they would not be dependent on their mothers’ milk. To do that, we had to teach the newborn calf to drink milk from a pail. Baby calves have an instinct to suck, so we had to let the calf suck our fingers as we gradually immersed our hand into the warm, sweet-smelling, frothy milk. There is a special aroma to the colostrum milk—it was sweet, a deep yellow, and a bit sticky. Once the calf learned to drink from a pail, we switched the feeding to a mixture of powdered milk and water and no longer had to pretend our fingers were nipples.</p>
<p>I have always loved the sights, sounds, and smells of springtime. The first sign was always from the song sparrows, which would sing their songs early in the morning, going from an A down to a D many octaves higher than I can identify on the piano. Sometimes it is just a lilting A–D and sometimes an A–DD, and I would listen for the answer from somewhere. I have always wondered what these birds were saying to each other. “Stay out of my territory”? Or “Welcome to my territory”? Then there is the sweet aroma in the air as the evergreens would awaken and the poplar trees started circulating their juices and the buds that eventually burst into leaves started to get sticky. There would be a white weblike film on the ground that needed to be raked away so that the tender grass could burst into life.</p>
<p>The chill in the springtime air, the slight crunch of the early-morning frozen mud on the driveway that slowly softened as the sun rose high enough to bake the surface dry by noon. These are the delights of spring, I’d think—a sure sign that the freezing cold of winter is behind. Springtime, I have always thought, holds such promise.</p>
