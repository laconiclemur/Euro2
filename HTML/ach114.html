<p class="author1"><span class="txit">purè di patate ai carciofini</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Fresh artichokes are very popular in Italy, and at many farm stands you will see older women making quick work of stripping away the spiky leaves, rubbing the hearts with lemon juice, and packing them into small bags for those without the time or inclination to start from scratch. I have rarely seen freshly peeled artichoke bottoms for sale in the United States, so you may need to purchase whole artichokes for this recipe and peel them down to the heart yourself. Reserve some of the tender leaves to use as a garnish. Canned artichoke bottoms or frozen artichoke hearts may be substituted for the fresh. The artichokes may be prepared several hours ahead and mixed into the mashed potatoes just before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds Idaho potatoes, peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup milk, warmed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 tablespoons (<sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> stick) butter, softened</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a small sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, chopped garlic, and parsley and cook, stirring, until the shallots soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the artichokes and thyme, then season with salt and pepper. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until all of the liquid has been absorbed and the artichokes are tender, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_225"/><span class="red">2.</span> Place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Add the whole garlic clove and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer the potatoes until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, discard the garlic, and return the potatoes to the pot. Heat over low heat to remove any excess moisture, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the milk and butter. Use a potato masher or electric mixer set on low to incorporate all of the ingredients, leaving the mixture slightly chunky. Stir in the artichokes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
