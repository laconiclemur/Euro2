    <p class="nonindent">The Doria family is the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of <strong class="calibre13">Genova.</strong> A bold Genovese nobleman, Andrea Doria (1466–1560), established the Republic of Genova in 1520. The four Doria family palaces are all embellished with a very distinct architectural feature of gray and white bands of decorative marble. Genova has one of the largest historic centers in Italy. Interwoven among the medieval buildings, there are innumerable traditional shops with farm-fresh foods, delicious Ligurian fish, and pastry shops that bake such delights as the sweet bread <em class="calibre4">pandolce Genovese.</em> As you stroll through the historic center and soak in the rich architecture, savor some of the traditional baked goods. You can take a funicular to the hill above Genova and look down. But, to my mind, the best view of Genova is seen after climbing to the top of the lighthouse, La Lanterna (1543). A walk down Strada Nuova, lined with sixteenth-century palaces belonging to the most powerful Genovese families, allows you glimpses of grand staircases, atriums, and courtyards, taking you back over five centuries.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Palazzo del Principe</strong>, built by Andrea Doria, is an estate outside the city of Genova with its own port and magnificent terraced gardens. Inside, I particularly like the Loggia of the Heroes, where Doria ancestors are portrayed as gorgeous, muscular warriors. The most impressive room is the Salon of the Fall of the Giants, with its enormous frescoed figures of giants on their backs, struck by Jupiter’s thunderbolts.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">The Staglieno Cemetery</strong> of Genova is my second-favorite place—it’s like an open-air museum. There are stone figures reaching out as if to hold on to life. Marble effigies lounge longingly on the steps in front of a sarcophagus, as if waiting for a loved one to return. The sculptures of saints and angels, portraits in marble, stone, and bronze, are executed to perfection.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Imperia</strong>, on the Riviera di Ponente, extending toward France from Genova, is actually two separate towns: the charming Porto Maurizio and the more industrial Oneglia. I have spent lovely evenings sipping an apéritif along the water in Porto Maurizio against a backdrop of pastel palazzos, listening to the soft splashing of fishing boats bobbing up and down in the port. I love the sandy beach here, and the picturesque alleyways.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Cinque Terre</strong> is a great place for hiking. As the train taking you there barrels through tunnels and hugs the earth’s ridges, the sparkling sea complements the hills that rise steeply from the coast. The hiking trail of the Cinque Terre leads to the five small villages Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. Sheltered coves with beaches and lush vegetation-filled terraces are all a part of the Riviera di Levante, which extends from Genova to La Spezia.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><a class="calibre8" id="page119"></a><strong class="calibre13">Portofino</strong> is a small port town that is lovely to stroll through, perhaps with an ice cream, or to stop at for a sunset drink. Leave lots of time to visit the nearby Abbey of San Fruttuoso. Originally built to house the remains of the bishop of Tarragon, San Fruttuoso, the abbey has a double row of galleries that look right out to the sea. The dead center of the religious complex is the tenth-century cloister, with its thick columns and zoomorphic carvings. If you’re a scuba diver (I’m not), you can come face-to-face with the underwater <em class="calibre4">Christ of the Chasms</em> statue, his arms outstretched in thanks for the riches of the sea and in supplication for protection from ancient pirates and stormy seas.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
