<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">I</span></span><span class="italic">n Emilia-Romagna the first course is the one not-to-be-missed part of a meal. When not eating pasta, everyone has soup, risotto or a vegetable dish. Italians sometimes skip an antipasto or forego a second dish, but rarely will they give up their first course</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Many of these dishes make much of little and come from peasant beginnings. For instance, Reggio has a tart made with greens gathered from the hillsides. Modenese laborers had a soup of beans, potatoes and cabbage to celebrate Christmas Eve. Out on the Po plain a risotto of locally grown rice was cooked with more local red wine than meat-based broth</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Today in Emilia-Romagna these dishes often become meals unto themselves because of hectic lives and lighter eating. A century ago for the poor, many of these dishes were one-dish meals because there was nothing more to eat</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">At the other end of the spectrum are the first courses of the wealthy. These were and still are taste-teasers. Light soups like Almond Spice Broth and “Little” Spring Soup from the 17th Century were the palate fresheners on tables laden with more elaborate banquet food than anyone could finish. Rice of the Princes, Domed Rice with Pigeon, and Nino Bergese’s Risotto all began on those same banquet tables</span>.</p>
<a id="page200"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">For the farmers of the time a feast was a bowl of beans and pasta. Today these crosses between soups and stews are still enthusiastically eaten in the region. They are included in this chapter because they are more about vegetables than pasta. Flour for pasta was expensive and used sparingly. Beans and legumes grew in the garden and could be cooked any number of ways</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Another outgrowth of the peasant tradition are dishes centering on one vegetable. Oven-Glazed Porcini and Paola Cavazzini’s Eggplant Torte are elegant dishes today, but they come from a time when a single vegetable in its seasonal prime was used not only for its good taste, but because it was easily had</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Eat these dishes as in Emilia-Romagna, serving several, one after the other. Or let them stand on their own, eaten after an antipasto and followed by fruit or dessert</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I<span class="italic">t is mesmerizing to watch women create this risotto with the instincts that come from years of practice. The finish is the best part, when big handfuls of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are folded into the risotto. Nothing happens for a few moments. Then, as the cheese warms, its fragrance fills the room</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The white in the title comes not only from the color of the rice but also from the dish’s classic simplicity. No saffron, tomatoes, vegetables, or meats are used. The risotto depends on a homemade stock and a good Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Renditions of this risotto are made throughout Emilia-Romagna. They illustrate the innate restraint of the region’s foods, in the seamless blending of subtle but distinctive ingredients</span>.</p>

Then start stirring in the stock, 1 cup at a time. <a id="page202"/>Each cup must be absorbed before the next is added. Stir the risotto to prevent sticking, pulling it down from the pot’s sides and folding the top to the bottom as you go.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Once 6 cups have been absorbed, add the stock in ½-cup portions and start tasting the rice. A good risotto is tender but still a little firm to the bite—never mushy. Some prefer risotto creamier than others, but it is never soupy or dry.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing and Serving:</span> Take the risotto off the heat when the rice still has a little more resistance than you would like. Season with salt and pepper. The next step not only finishes seasoning the rice but completes its cooking. Fold in the butter or cream and the cheese, keeping the mixture light. Taste again for salt and pepper, adding more if necessary. Once everything is blended in, let the risotto rest a moment or two. The rice will swell a little as it absorbs the final flavorings. Spoon the risotto into heated soup dishes, and serve immediately.</p>

<div class="box"><hr/>
<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Rice in Parma</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Many believe Emilia-Romagna’s rice dishes were always made with rice imported from neighboring Lombardy and the Piedmont. But Parma food historian Guglielmo Capacchi explains that rice was grown in what is now Parma province as far back as the 1400s. After city dwellers claimed their water supply was ruined by the rice’s standing water, and local millers objected to the diversion of water from their mills to the rice fields, rice growing was banned on Parma’s plain in 1542.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent: 5%;">Rice’s availability from nearby areas and the strong Spanish connections of the Farnese dukes (Parma’s ruling family from 1545 to 1731), made rice dishes a permanent part of Parma’s repertoire. Rice still grows in Emilia-Romagna around the village of Rolo in Reggio province, with the fields stretching into neighboring Modena province. The baked Modena Rice Pudding found in Desserts is from that area. In Parma, the Superfino Roma rice of Reggio and Modena is often used in risottos instead of Arborio.</p>

The risotto was created by the now-deceased Nino Bergese, chef to Italian nobility and co-founder of Imola’s Ristorante San Domenico.

Season the Meat Essences about 1 hour before serving; set aside, covered, at room temperature</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Onion Base:</span> This slow cooking must be done over very low heat. Use a flame-tamer if necessary. Combine the butter, olive oil, onion, and salt in a heavy medium-size skillet. Cover and cook over low heat 3 hours, stirring occasionally and making sure the onions are not coloring. They go from white and crisp to moist and almost transparent. Do not rush or shortcut this step; it gives the onions the deep sweetness important to the risotto’s foundation.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Uncover and continue cooking the onions over low heat another 2 hours, or until caramelized to the color of a copper penny. They will have a rich aroma and taste <a id="page204"/>almost sugary. Run a wooden spatula under the onions frequently to keep them from sticking and to bring up the brown glaze from the bottom of the skillet. Let the onions cool. Then transfer them to a blender or food processor, and purée until smooth. Add a few spoonfuls of water if necessary.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Sauce:</span> Combine the Meat Essences and red wine in a 1½-quart heavy nonaluminum saucepan. Simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes, or until reduced to about ¾ cup. Add ¼ cup Marsala, and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. The sauce should be deeply flavored, robust, with a touch of sweetness. Add more Marsala if necessary. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Risotto:</span> Have shallow soup dishes heating in a low oven. Heat the 7 to 9 cups of stock to a gentle simmer. Heat the 1½ tablespoons butter in a 5-quart heavy casserole over medium heat. Stir in the onion base and heat through. Stir in the rice with a wooden spatula, and cook a few minutes, or until it looks chalky. Keeping the heat at medium, stir in the wine. Keep stirring to prevent sticking as it is absorbed. Then start blending in the stock, 1 cup at a time. Each cup must be absorbed before the next is added. Stir the risotto to keep it from sticking, pulling it down from the pot’s sides and folding the top to the bottom as you go. Once 6 cups have been absorbed, add the stock in ½-cup portions and start tasting the rice. Risotto is tender but still firm to the bite, never mushy. The ideal consistency differs slightly from one cook to the next—some prefer their risotto creamier than others—but it always has flow and movement. It is never soupy or dry. Bergese’s risotto needs enough substance to be mounded on a soupspoon.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing and Serving:</span> Take the risotto off the heat when the rice still has a little more resistance than you would like. Fold in the 2 tablespoons butter and the cheese, keeping the mixture light. Taste for salt and pepper. Once everything is blended in, let the risotto rest a moment or two. Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Mound the risotto in the center of the heated soup plates. Using the side of a wooden spoon, make five grooves, like the spokes of a wheel, down the sides of each mound. Drizzle each serving with about 1½ tablespoons of the sauce. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">How a Chef’s Mind Works</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Bergese fine-tuned the elements of each ingredient in this risotto. He used essentially the same components as Classic White Risotto, but each is pushed to its limits. The onions’ sweetness is concentrated into a caramelized marmalade by hours of cooking. Meaty stock is simmered with even more meat into the complex meat essence. Red wine and Marsala season the essence before it sauces the finished risotto. Poultry/Meat Stock’s full flavor is cooked into the rice, while the white wine’s acidity takes on new importance, giving needed contrast to the mellow flavors. <span class="italic">Mantecato</span> (from <span class="italic">mantecare</span>, to pound into a paste or to make creamy) in a risotto means the folding in of butter and cheese at the end of cooking to give the rice an extra creaminess. In Bergese’s dish it is another element, building up like a musical crescendo to the final moment when a spoonful of the Marsala-flavored sauce is spooned over the mound of risotto.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">W<span class="italic">e rarely think of ragù with risotto, yet it is a favorite combination throughout much of northern Italy. Often the ragù is prepared as the flavor base of the risotto and cooked into it. But in this Piacenza dish the ragù is made separately and layered into the finished risotto on its serving platter. I prefer this approach, since the ragù can be prepared well in advance. And it is particularly colorful, with the rice tinted golden by saffron and set off by the deep russets of the ragù. No doubt the saffron is evidence of influence from Piacenza’s neighbor to the north, Milan.

</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing the Artichokes:</span> Break off the dark green outer leaves until you reach leaves that are yellow-green at their base. With a small sharp knife, trim away any dark green stubs around the base of the artichokes. Keep rubbing the cut areas with the lemon half to avoid darkening. Then cut off and discard the top half of the remaining leaves. You now have artichoke hearts. Cut half the artichoke hearts into quarters. Thinly slice the other half. Drop both into separate bowls of lemon water created by combining the lemon juice and cold water.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Base:</span> In a heavy 5- to 6-quart pot, heat the 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Stir in the onions with a wooden spatula. Soften and sweeten them by turning the heat to medium-low, covering the pot, and cooking 10 minutes. Meanwhile, pat dry the sliced artichokes. Uncover the pot and add the sliced <a id="page210"/>artichoke hearts. If you are using fresh peas, add 1 cup now. Sprinkle the mixture lightly with salt and pepper, turn the heat up to medium, and cook about 5 minutes, stirring frequently with the wooden spatula. The artichoke pieces will be tinged with gold.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If you are using frozen peas, add 1 cup now. Then stir in the garlic and ½ cup of the stock. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot securely, and cook over medium-low heat 10 minutes, or until the artichokes are soft. Stir to keep from sticking. While the artichokes are cooking, bring the remaining stock to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to medium-low so the stock bubbles occasionally, and keep partially covered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Risotto:</span> Warm soup plates in a low oven. Pat dry the quartered artichokes. Once the artichokes have softened, stir in the quartered pieces and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, 2 minutes, or until it looks chalky and you can see a white dot in the center of each grain. Now add about 1 cup of the simmering stock to the pot, along with the pea pods if you are using them. Stir over medium heat until the stock is absorbed. The stock should bubble gently once it has settled into the rice. Add another cup of stock and repeat the process, stirring with the spatula to prevent sticking. Lower the heat if necessary.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If you are using fresh peas, stir in the remaining 1½ cups after you have added about 3 or 4 cups of stock. Once the rice has absorbed about 6 cups of stock, start adding the stock in ½-cup increments. Perfect risotto is moist, creamy, and pleasantly tender, but is still firm enough to resist a little when bitten. A dry risotto can be moistened with a little extra stock.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing and Serving:</span> When the rice is tender but still a little firm, fold in the remaining frozen peas if you are using them. Taste the rice for salt and pepper. Then remove the pot from the heat (pluck out the pea pods at this point), and fold in the 1½ tablespoons butter and the cheese. Keep the risotto light and avoid crushing the rice by scooping down to the bottom of the pot and up with a big circular motion. Keep folding until the butter has melted and is thoroughly blended, about 1 minute. Spoon the creamy risotto into the heated soup dishes, and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">At Table with the Princes</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In 1988 Ferrara celebrated her golden age in an exposition, “At Table with the Princes,” which centered on the court of the Este dukes from the 14th through the 16th centuries. Chef Sergio Ferrarini re-created the foods of the period in a restaurant set up within the walls of the Este Castle. Most of the dishes were inspired by Christofaro di Messisbugo, the 16th-century cookbook author. This was not simply a matter of developing recipes with modern ingredients. Ferrarini worked with a team of scholars. Agricultural historians, botanists, and farmers strived to re-create foodstuffs of the 16th century. Researchers discovered how food was cooked, served, and eaten in the period, detailing the original utensils, table settings, and decorations.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Thanks to their work, it is now possible to stand in the frescoed halls of Ferrara’s Este Castle and bring to life a court banquet of the era. At the head table, the Este and honored guests could have been scooping up a rice dish similar to this one, with spoons made of lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Sweet wine was sipped from tall Venetian glasses, so fragile and blown into such delicate shapes, it is remarkable how the ones exhibited at the exposition could have survived to this day. Everyone probably remarked on the novelty of rice, this exotic food from Spain and the East.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Messisbugo’s many recipes reveal few rice dishes. Most of them suggest using rice or <span class="italic">farro</span> (spelt or emmer), a word used to describe the several ancient wheat grains known to the Romans and still used in central Italy. No doubt these dishes were made with farro until the Arab invasion of Sicily and Spain introduced the cultivation of rice to Europe during the Middle Ages. By the mid-15th century, rice paddies were flooding the Po plain northwest of Ferrara. Still, rice seems to have been more an exotic than a staple in the dukes’ kitchens. This recipe blends ingredients and techniques from three of Messisbugo’s dishes: Turkish Rice, Sicilian Rice, and Rice with Egg Yolks and Cheese. He never mentions risotto, nor the risotto technique of cooking rice by first sautéing it and then stirring in small quantities of liquid until the rice is creamy and tender. Instead, rice is added to a sauté of flavorings along with all the liquid. Chef Ferrarini’s touch of roasted greens gives a tart balance to the rice’s sweet overtones and stays true to the flavor combinations of the period. However, he eliminated the pound or more of sugar required by the original recipes (even though these were savory, not dessert dishes). Duplicating the cultures and airborne microbes that produced the cheeses of centuries ago is a study in frustration, but mascarpone may come close to the fresh fat cheese Messisbugo calls for.</p>

Return the poultry pieces to the pot, and add half the reserved marinade with the crushed garlic. Bring it to a slow bubble and cook, uncovered, 15 minutes, or until the wine has totally evaporated. Turn the pieces occasionally as the wine cooks away. Repeat with the remaining wine and cook another 15 minutes, or until it is gone.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Stir in the tomatoes and cook another 10 minutes, stirring often. Then add the stock. Bring it to a very gentle bubble, partially cover the pot, and cook about 40 minutes for squab, 1¼ hours for pigeon, and 1½ hours for duck. Whichever poultry is used, the meat must be tender and succulent, but not overcooked or stringy. Cool the poultry in its sauce and discard the bay leaf. Remove the meat from the bones.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Skim as much fat as possible from the sauce, and taste for intensity. Boil the sauce down until it is deeply flavored, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the meat pieces, cool, cover, and refrigerate. Reheat before filling the rice mold.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Rice:</span> Set a strainer over a large bowl. Bring the stock and the ¼ cup wine to a boil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over high heat. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in the rice, cover, and cook 10 minutes over high heat. Strain the rice, reserving the stock for another use. Turn the rice into a bowl, and once it has cooled to warm, blend in the eggs and cheese.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling the Bomba:</span> Slather a 9½-cup stainless steel bowl or dome mold with the 2 tablespoons butter, and then coat it with the bread crumbs.

Build the rice up to the bowl’s edge. Spoon in the remaining pigeon. Cover it with the rest of the rice, sealing and patting it with the back of a large spoon or metal spatula so that the rice is compact. Cover the top with a piece of aluminum foil.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking and Serving:</span> Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake the mold 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until heated through.

Unmold the rice by setting a large round platter atop the bowl and then, using pot holders, flipping it over so the mold rests on the plate. Tap the bowl’s sides and top, and gently lift it off the rice. Garnish the mold with shiny lemon leaves or small clusters of fresh bay leaves, if desired. Cut into wedges at the table.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Parma Consulates and the Bomb Scare</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Parma is more than a geographic location; it is a state of being. To be a Parmesan is to know you live in the best possible place on earth. Other parts of Italy and even the world may attract, but only Parma nourishes your soul. You are a Parmesan first, then an Italian. Other Italians concede that Parma’s reputation for elegance and refinement, won over the centuries as a center of court, is well founded. Strong links with the courts of Spain, France, and Austria during their respective heydays only add luster to Parma’s aura. With this powerful provincial identity, it is not surprising to discover that Parmesans felt displaced when, after unification, they took up official positions in Italy’s central government in Rome.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">According to Dr. Mario Zannoni, Parma scholar and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese expert, it was during the 1890s that the homesick Parmesans in Rome made an important decision: They would create a permanent meeting place where their countrymen could gather, carry on Parma traditions, and share their love of homeland—a Parma consulate. Today Parma consulates exist in many foreign places, among them Romagna and Bologna, both no more than 3 hours away, as well as London and Caracas. A short time after the first Parma consulate opened in Rome, its members found themselves longing for one of their favorite dishes, the <span class="italic">Bomba di Riso</span>. This savory rice dish molded into a dome and stuffed with braised pigeon is traditional winter food. By good luck, a friend coming to Rome from Parma was delighted to bring the dish. It was agreed that he would telegraph just before he stepped onto the train so that all the necessary preparations for the feast would be completed when he arrived.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">As the train pulled out of the Parma station a message was wired to Rome: “The bomb is on the train. Stop.” Rome’s telegraph office immediately relayed the message to the police. They, in turn, telegraphed Parma’s police: “Stop train, find out what bomb. Stop.” While they waited for a reply, other trains were cleared from the Parma train’s route, Rome’s station was surrounded, and incoming tracks were cordoned off. Armed police waited for the order to close in.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Finally a message came from the Parma police: “Bomb: A typical Parma dish of rice and pigeon. Stop.” I do not know if they ever got to eat the <span class="italic">Bomba di Riso</span> that year.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough by Hand:</span> Bring the 1 cup water to a boil. Pour the bread crumbs into a bowl and add the boiling water. Let stand 10 minutes. Mound the flour on a work surface. Using a wooden spoon, make a well in the mound that looks like a volcano crater. Add the eggs, 10 tablespoons water, and soaked bread crumbs to the well. Blend them together with a wooden spoon. Then gradually stir in the flour by making shallow scrapings along the walls of the well and incorporating the flour into the liquids. Use a pastry scraper to catch any liquids that might escape from the flour crater. Once the mixture becomes a rough dough, knead it by hand 10 minutes, or until elastic. It should be quite stiff and not very sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it stand at room temperature 30 minutes to 2 hours.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough in a Food Processor:</span> Bring the 1 cup water to a boil. Pour the bread crumbs into a bowl and add the boiling water. Let stand 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the eggs, 10 tablespoons water, and the soaked bread crumbs. Blend about 10 seconds. With the machine running, pour in the flour through the feed tube. Process about 30 seconds. The dough should be stiff and just a little sticky. Let the dough rest about 30 seconds, and then process again 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a board and knead 5 minutes, or until elastic. Wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest 30 minutes to 2 hours at room temperature.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Shaping the Pisaréi:</span> These little pasta curls are shaped by taking a pea-size piece of dough, pressing it with the tip of the thumb, then pulling the thumb back and up in a quick motion. The dough thins and curls, forming a “C” shape in profile. After you’ve made several pieces, a rhythm will develop and shaping the pisaréi will become automatic. Have handy several large flat baskets lined with kitchen towels for drying the pasta. Take one quarter of the dough (keep the rest wrapped in plastic wrap) and divide it into 10 pieces. Roll out each piece with the flat of your palms to form a long cord ¼ to ½ inch in diameter. Keep the cords covered with plastic wrap. Take out one cord and cut it into pea-size pieces. Use the tip of your thumb to press each piece into the work surface and then pull back and up. It is a flicking motion. Some cooks prefer pushing forward and up. Either way, the pasta will curl. Pisaréi are not elegant-looking. Although every piece should be about the same thickness, they look handmade, with slightly uneven shapes and rough edges. They should be about the same size as the beans they are to be served with. Continue making pisaréi with the remaining dough. Spread them on the baskets without letting the pieces touch.</p>
<a id="page231"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Beans:</span> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Pour the dried beans into a bowl, cover them with boiling water, and let stand about 2 hours. Drain the beans and turn them into a 5-quart pot. Sprinkle with the sage and rosemary. Add enough cold water to cover by about 3 inches. Cover and bring to a very slow bubble over medium heat. Adjust the heat so the water bubbles slowly. Cook, covered, 1 hour, or until the beans are just tender enough to eat but not at all mushy. Drain the beans in a colander, and return them to the pot.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Tomato Sauce:</span> While the beans are cooking, heat the olive oil and pancetta or prosciutto fat in a heavy 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and parsley. Sauté the onions to a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir often. Blend in the garlic, basil, and tomato paste, and cook about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and their liquid, breaking them up as they go into the pan. Bring to a lively bubble and cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing the Beans:</span> Add the tomato sauce and the 3 cups water, and bring the bean/tomato mixture to a gentle bubble. The mixture should bubble very slowly. Partially cover and cook 1½ hours, or until the beans are very tender (but not falling apart), and have the consistency of a thick soup. Stir frequently to check for sticking. Add more water if the mixture threatens to burn.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta and Serving:</span> Have a serving bowl and soup dishes warming in a low oven. If necessary, reheat the beans to a slow bubble. Bring the salted water to a boil. Drop in the dried pisaréi and boil 5 to 15 minutes, depending upon how dry they are. Taste for tender yet firm texture with no suggestion of raw flour. Drain in a colander. Pour the beans into the heated serving bowl. Turn the colander full of pisaréi into the bowl and fold the two together, taking care not to break up the pasta. Sprinkle with a few spoonfuls of the cheese, and serve. Pass the rest of the Parmigiano-Reggiano separately.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Seasoning the Stock:</span> Pour the stock into a 3-quart saucepan and bring to a slow bubble. Season with salt and pepper, and grate in enough nutmeg to give a hint of its taste. Keep the stock at a slow bubble.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing the Vegetables:</span> While the broth is heating, trim the tough ends from the asparagus. Cut off the tips on the diagonal, then continue cutting the stalks on the diagonal into ¼-inch-thick slices. Prepare one of the artichokes by trimming away any part of the stem that seems tough. Peel the rest of the stem and rub it with one of the lemon halves. Break off all the outer leaves around the base of the artichoke. Using a sharp thin-bladed knife, trim away the dark green leaf stubs until you can see the pale green of the artichoke bottom. Now hold the artichoke upside down, and cut away any dark green around the base. Rub the surface with the lemon. Cut away the top two thirds of the leaves, and scoop out the choke with a spoon. Rub every surface with the lemon. Repeat with the second artichoke. Then cut each <a id="page233"/>bottom into quarters and thinly slice into small chips. Toss with the juice from the lemon half you’ve been using.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Soup:</span> Warm soup dishes, and a tureen if desired, in a low oven. Extract 1 to 1½ tablespoons juice from the other lemon half. Bring the stock to a boil, drop in the artichoke slices, and boil, uncovered, 1½ minutes, or until barely tender. Add the asparagus and boil, uncovered, 2 to 3 minutes, or until barely tender. Turn down the heat so the soup simmers gently. Add the yolks to the stock and stir slowly until firm threads are formed. This happens in a matter of seconds. Season with the lemon juice. There should be a distinctive lemony flavor. Ladle the soup into the soup dishes or tureen. Sprinkle with the lettuce and pistachios, and serve immediately.</p>

Serve it as the beginning to a meal built around the Domed Maccheroni Pie of Ferrara or An Unusual Tortellini Pie.

The cheese is a magical addition to soups, especially broth-based ones. Stir the cheese into a bowl of plain broth, and you will experience an explosion of taste. In soups like Nascia’s, Parmigiano-Reggiano accentuates each ingredient without overwhelming any of them. Add 1 tablespoon to each serving.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Zuppa di Cavolo Nero</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I <span class="italic">first heard of this from Modenese Americans originally from the Modena mountains, now living in Highwood, Illinois. According to Maria Picchietti, Anna Mardini and Sue Bernardi, the soup, a cross between a soup of winter greens and a stew thickened with garlic-scented country bread, had to contain at least seven vegetables. On Christmas Eve there was no meat in the pot, but at other times a little pancetta, some meat broth or a prosciutto bone would find its way into this recipe</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The croutons and olive oil seasoning come from an old recipe from Modena, and hint at Tuscan origins (Tuscany lies on the other side of those high mountains). The region’s unusual black cabbage originally gave the soup its name. Tuscans love sprinkling thick soups with olive oil instead of cheese as a final seasoning at the table, just as this one is seasoned. And thickening dishes with bread is another hallmark of the Tuscan kitchen</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When I asked the Highwood women if they thought the soup might come from Tuscany, they were puzzled. One replied, “It is our cooking, of our home. My mother and her mother made the soup this way, and now I do.” Perhaps only outlanders need labels and borders</span>.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Almond Milk</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The foundation of this soup used to be called almond milk. Medieval and Renaissance recipes called for the ground almonds to be infused in hot broth, water, or milk. The naturally sweet liquid held its popularity in many court kitchens well into the 18th century, saucing meats, moistening stews, becoming desserts, or, as in this dish, standing on its own as soup. In Italy during the mid-1600s, soup was not served as it is today. It often appeared in the middle of the meal, presented at the same time as the meats, savory/sweet pies, and sweet tidbits. In recording the banquets he prepared for the Duke of Parma, Carlo Nascia reports menus where soups like this one follow two other courses of over fifteen dishes each.</p>

When a stranger arrived and tied his or her horse to a ring, that family became responsible for the stranger’s care and well-being.

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Will the Real Eggplant Parmesan Please Stand?</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">No, that great Italian standby, known to most Americans, did not originate in Parma. The casserole of fried eggplant slices baked with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan was born in the southern Italian region of Campania. There it is called <span class="italic">Parmigiana di Melanzane</span> (Parmesan of Eggplant), no doubt because expensive Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese imported from the north figures so importantly in its flavorings. I say “no doubt” but must include a fascinating note from Mary Taylor Simeti. In <span class="italic">Pomp and Sustenance: 25 Centuries of Sicilian Food</span>, she explains <span class="italic">melanzane alla parmigiana</span> is really a mispronunciation. Most Sicilians believe their dish of sliced eggplant layered with tomato sauce and local caciocavallo cheese was originally <span class="italic">Melanzane alla Palmigiana. Palmigiana</span> means shutter in Sicilian, and reflects the layered louver-like pattern of eggplant slices. Sicilians have difficulty pronouncing “<span class="italic">l</span>,” and so the dish became <span class="italic">alla parmigiana</span>.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The Parma dish is <span class="italic">Melanzane alla Parmigiana</span> (Eggplant Parmesan), but in the four renditions I have found from Parma, only one calls for the area’s famous cheese. Obviously the name means eggplant as cooked in Parma, not eggplant with Parmesan cheese. Parma food historian Guglielmo Capacchi dashes a local theory that eggplant made its debut in Parma during the 1600s, when ducal cook Carlo Nascia brought it from southern Italy. According to Capacchi, old records tell of eggplant being eaten in Emilia during the 13th century. But the proof gets even better, claims Capacchi. It was recorded in the 14th century that a medical teacher in Bologna, Master Taddeo, stated emphatically to his students the accepted medical fact of the day: Eat eggplant for nine days straight and you will go mad. (Some etymologists believe <span class="italic">melanzane</span> derives from “apple [<span class="italic">mela</span>] of madness [<span class="italic">insano</span>].”) True to the spirit of inquiry, one student performed the experiment. At the end of the ninth day, convinced Taddeo would be amazed, he announced to his teacher and fellow students that he was not mad. Taddeo remained unperturbed, simply commanding his class to write down a new margin note: “The eggplant theory has been tested and is not true.”</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">One last note on origins: Many assume the purple vegetable came by its English name solely because of shape. But in India, where many historians believe eggplant originated, one species grows as a small oval white vegetable. Small white eggplants are found in Southeast Asian markets, and large white eggplants are often seen in the vegetable stalls of Emilia-Romagna.</p>

<div class="bibliography"><p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Method</span></span> <span class="bold">Working Ahead:</span> <span class="italic">The pastry can be made up to 3 months ahead and frozen. It can be rolled out 24 hours before baking the tart. The filling keeps, covered, in the refrigerator 2 days, but the tart is at its prime when baked and eaten within a day. Rewarm it before serving if possible</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Pastry:</span> Grease a 9- to 10-inch fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Combine the flours, salt, and pepper in a food processor or mixing bowl and blend. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles small peas. Either process a few seconds in the machine, or use a hand-held pastry cutter or two knives. Sprinkle the cold water over the dough. In a processor, use the on/off pulse to blend the dough just until it forms clumps. By hand, toss with a fork to moisten. Do not mix so much that the dough forms a ball—that will toughen it. Using your hands, gather the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill about 30 minutes. Roll out half the dough to less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick, and fit it into the tart pan, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll out the remaining dough to form a large circle of the same thickness. Spread it on a foil-covered baking sheet. Chill both pastry pieces 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing Artichoke Bottoms:</span> Halve both lemons and squeeze the juice of three halves into a medium bowl. Add the water. As you cut the artichokes, keep rubbing the surface with the remaining lemon half to keep them from darkening. Begin by cutting away the stem. Then pull off the leaves, starting at the base and going up halfway. Trim away the leaf stubs around the base until you see the pale green bottom. Turn the artichoke upside down and cut away the dark green from its base. Then cut away the leaves from the top of the artichoke, and scoop out the fuzzy choke with a spoon. Immediately immerse the bottom in the lemon water.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Filling:</span> Drain the artichoke bottoms, pat them dry, and cut into bite-size chunks. Heat the pancetta and oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Sauté pancetta 2 to 3 minutes to give up its fat. Then turn the heat to medium-high. Add the artichoke pieces and sauté, uncovered, 4 minutes, or until they begin to color. Stir in the onion, carrot, and a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spatula, 4 minutes, or until the onion has browned and the artichokes are golden.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Reduce the heat to medium, add the lemon zest, garlic, and basil, and cook 30 seconds. Add the water and bring to a boil, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cover and simmer over low heat 3 to 4 minutes, or until the artichokes are slightly softened. Uncover and cook down the juices 1 minute, or until they form a moist glaze on the bottom of the skillet. The artichokes should still be a bit crisp. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. When they are cool, season them to taste with lemon juice.</p>
<a id="page247"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling and Baking the Tart:</span> Preheat the oven to 425°F. Remove the pastry from the refrigerator. Spread the filling in the tart pan. Sprinkle it liberally with the cheese, and top with the sheet of dough, pressing the edges together. Fold the overhanging pastry over toward the tart’s center, and crimp into a zigzag shape. Brush the crust with the beaten egg, and pierce with a fork. Bake in the lower third of the oven 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 375°F and bake another 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot or warm.</p>

Follow it with Espresso and Mascarpone Semi-Freddo or Strawberries in Red Wine. For picnics, serve the tart, then pieces of cold Erminia’s Pan-Crisped Chicken with Paola Bini’s Potato Salad.

Working with your fingertips or a pastry cutter, blend the fat and flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle with 7 tablespoons of the water, and toss with a fork until the dough begins to form clumps. If it is dry, add more water.

Then add the fat(s), processing until the pastry looks like coarse meal. Sprinkle about 7 tablespoons of the cold water over the dough, and process just until the mixture begins to gather into clumps (add more water if necessary). Wrap and chill 30 minutes. Roll out a generous half of the dough very thin, and lay it over a greased 14-inch pizza pan, leaving about a 1-inch overhang. Roll out the remaining dough to form a 15-inch round, and set it on a foil-covered baking sheet. Refrigerate both pieces at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> Combine about ¼ cup of the minced pancetta with a little of the garlic, about ¼ cup of the onion, and a generous amount of black pepper. Set aside. Heat the remaining pancetta with the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook about 5 minutes, or until the pancetta has given off much of its fat. Add the remaining onion and cook, covered, 15 minutes, or until softened. Uncover, raise the heat to high, and cook another 6 minutes, or until a rich golden brown. Add the <a id="page249"/>spinach or chard, and sauté 3 to 5 minutes, adjusting the heat to prevent burning.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Stir in the remainder of the 3 garlic cloves, and cook another 30 seconds or so. If a brown glaze forms on the skillet bottom, add a little water and simmer, scraping it up with a spatula to incorporate the glaze into the filling. Cook a minute or so until the liquid evaporates. Turn the filling into a bowl and cool. Blend in 1½ cups of the cheese and reserved pancetta mixture. Taste for seasoning and for enough cheese, and then blend in the eggs.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking the Erbazzone:</span> Preheat the oven to about 400°F. Set the rack as close to the bottom of the oven as possible. Combine the lard and garlic in a small pan, and heat over medium heat only 2 minutes, or until the lard is melted.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Spread the filling over the pastry-lined pizza pan, leaving about a 2-inch border. Dampen the edges with water, top with the remaining dough, and pinch the edges together. Fold the edges over toward the center of the tart, and crimp. Make slashes in the top of the crust. Bake 20 minutes. Then brush the crust with the melted lard and garlic mixture, and bake another 20 minutes, or until pale gold and very crisp. The edges of the tart will be golden brown. Cut in narrow wedges to serve.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">This dough is found in old peasant recipes. Rather than tender and melting, this pastry is lean, thin, and crisp. Nothing but flour, water, and a little lard makes the crazy dough <span class="italic">(pasta matta)</span>, as it was called years ago. Even lard (called the butter of the poor) must have been scarce for many, because the trick in this dish was to stretch the lard’s goodness. The melted lard brushed on the crust (an amount too small to have any effect as an ingredient <span class="italic">in</span> the crust) makes it very crisp. Without this finishing touch, the crust’s lean qualities are all too evident. Today many cooks gentrify and tenderize the crust with generous amounts of butter and olive oil. But I am still in awe of the skill of those grandmothers and great-grandmothers who could create such elegantly satisfying food from so little.</p>
