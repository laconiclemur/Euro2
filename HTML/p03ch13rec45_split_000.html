<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">These famous sweets are named after the mystic Carmelite nun of Ávila, who was canonized in 1622. They are made in monasteries all over Spain. According to legend, in the early seventeenth century, King Philip III obliged wineries, which used egg whites to clarify their wines, to give their yolks to the nuns, and that remained the custom for centuries. This recipe is from</span> Los Dulces del Convento—Recetas del Monasterio de Santa María del Soccoro <span class="italic">(</span>Convent Sweets: Recipes from the Santa María del Soccoro Monastery<span class="italic">), written by the nuns at the convent where I stayed in Seville. They say that</span> yemas <span class="italic">are their favorite sweets and warn you that they do not always come out right when you first attempt to make them. They encourage you to try again, since “hens are not about to die out and there are plenty of eggs.” Sor Jesús María, the</span> maestra repostera <span class="italic">(head pastry chef), said the secret is to arrive at a thick enough syrup, so that the sweets are firm. Making them is a fiddly matter of rolling the very soft, slightly sticky mass into small balls on a bed of fine sugar.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES ABOUT 9 SWEETS</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup water</p>
<p class="qun">6 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun1">Superfine or confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">Bring the sugar and water to a boil in a small nonstick pan (if the corners at the base are rounded, it will be easier to work the paste without leaving some behind), then simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, until the syrup is thick enough to coat a spoon. (If it is not thick enough, the sweets will not firm up.) Let cool a little.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Beat the egg yolks vigorously with a whisk or a fork, then pour them into the syrup, beating with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula. Put the pan back over low heat and keep stirring vigorously until the mass thickens to a paste that comes away from the sides of the pan. This will take about 10 minutes. Let cool, then chill in the refrigerator, preferably overnight.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cover a large plate with superfine or confectioners’ sugar. Using a teaspoon, drop small lumps of the chilled paste, the size of a large quail’s egg, one at a time in the sugar and roll them into balls about 1 inch in diameter, covering them lightly all over with the sugar. Dampen your hands slightly so that the paste does not stick. Put the balls into little paper candy cases.</p>
