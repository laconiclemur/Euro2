 GARLIC &amp; PARSLEY EGG CUPS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0001956">
<em>There’s a growing trend online for recipes that involve edible containers, so you can eat whatever’s on the inside and enjoy the outside too. I’m talking cookie cups filled with milk, fondue served in its own edible bread bowl, and so much more. Not only does the edible exterior help things feel that bit more fun, it also makes you look so much more accomplished in the kitchen! And let’s not forget – if the casing is edible, think of all the washing-up you don’t have to do. So I’ve joined the trend, and used delicious garlic bread as a carrier for some beautifully cooked eggs.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001964">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Cut all 4 crusts off the bread (don’t be alarmed – don’t throw them away, put them on a baking tray ready to dry out in the oven, then blitz and make into breadcrumbs).</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001965">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Using a rolling pin, roll each slice of bread until it is completely flat. This makes it much easier to work with later and gives you a crispier cup.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001966">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Melt the garlic butter (if you don’t have any at home, just take unsalted butter and add a minced clove of garlic to it).</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001967">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Brush the inside of a 12-hole muffin tray with some of the melted garlic butter.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001968">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Line the inside of each hole with a slice of flattened bread, making sure to push the bread right into the base and edges. Don’t worry about being exact, as they are not meant to look identical.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001969">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Brush the inside of the bread with the remainder of the melted garlic butter.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001970">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Drop an egg into each cavity, then season them all with a pinch of salt and top with a parsley sprig.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001971">
<span class="red">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 18–20 minutes if you like a runny yolk. If, however, you prefer a firm yolk, leave to bake in the oven for 35 minutes.</p>

<span class="tip_head_red">Tip:</span>
 <em>Be sure to get small to medium eggs or there could be a serious case of egg spillage.</em>
