<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">I loved a delicate dish of cardoon stalks in an almond sauce that I ate in Navarre. At home, I had trouble finding cardoons, so I was happy to hear that artichokes are also cooked in the same way in Spain, as are ribs of Swiss chard. You may be able to find cardoons preserved in jars; in Spain, you can buy them frozen. If you have fresh cardoons, see the variation. I use frozen artichoke bottoms. It is a dish you can easily make for a lot of people if you have frozen artichokes.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups milk</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups chicken stock (or 2¼ cups water plus 1 bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun1">Two 14-ounce packages frozen artichoke bottoms or three 9-ounce packages frozen artichoke hearts, defrosted</p>
<p class="recsum">Bring the milk and stock (or water and bouillon cube) to a boil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon over low heat for about 30 seconds, without letting it brown. Stir in the garlic, then stir in the milk and stock mixture a little at a time, stirring vigorously to prevent lumps. Continue to stir until the sauce thickens, then stir in the ground almonds and add salt to taste. Add the artichokes and cook for about 15 minutes, until they are tender. Serve hot.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Use cardoons instead of artichokes, fresh or preserved in jars. Fresh cardoons are sometimes sold with the prickly outer parts of the stems removed. Only the inner part of the stalks are eaten. If the cardoons have not already been trimmed, you will need about 4 pounds. Tear off the leaves and cut the stalks into 3- to 4-inch lengths. Cook in boiling salted water acidulated with the juice of ½ lemon for about 20 minutes. Drain and refresh in a bowl of cold water, then peel off the tough skin and strings from the stems and discard. Drop stalks into the sauce and cook for 15 to 25 minutes, until tender. (If using jarred cardoons, just heat through in the sauce.)</p>
