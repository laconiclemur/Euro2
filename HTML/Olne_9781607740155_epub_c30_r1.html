  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2">FRESH SARDINES IN VINE LEAVES</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">None of the many recipes for sardines, to my way of thinking, can compare with the following preparation, radical in its simplicity. Some, indeed, are far from simple. A particularly fanciful recipe imprisons the rolled fillets of sardines, stuffed with a <em>duxelles</em>, in squash blossoms, which are then poached in fish stock, and the reduced sauce finished with anchovy butter. Sardines in vine leaves may, in themselves, constitute the principal preparation for a light luncheon, in which case, 6 or 8 would be served per person. In the context of this menu, they should be served sparingly, for in small quantity they may whet the appetite, but their strong flavor, after a certain point, has the opposite effect.</p>

  <p class="indent">Any small fish may be prepared in this way, but those of lighter or more delicately flavored flesh should be perfumed with an herb less pungent than rosemary—fennel, oregano, or simply <em>fines herbes</em>.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c30-s114"><em><span class="color">Fresh Sardines in Vine Leaves</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Sardines Fraîches dans les Feuilles de Vigne</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 absolutely fresh sardines per person</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>rosemary</em> (<em>fresh, if possible</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>large grapevine leaves, picked with their stems</em> (<em>1 for each person</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>lemon</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean the sardines but do not scale them; as they have very soft flesh, it is only necessary to hold the fish in one hand while opening the length of the abdomen with the index finger of the other. Empty the fish, pull out the gills and rinse fish out. Sponge them dry with paper towels, insert a small sprig of rosemary in the abdomen of each, sprinkle them with a few chopped rosemary leaves and enough olive oil so <a id="page407"></a>that, after being turned around in it, they are well coated inside and out with oil, salt and pepper them and leave them to marinate for an hour or so.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the tips of the grape-leaf stems so that they are pointed. Lay each on a flat surface and roll a fish into it, beginning at the pointed extremity of the leaf; pierce the rolled leaf with the stem as if it were a pin. Place them on a large, double-faced grill in two rows and grill them over a very hot bed of embers. When the leaves are charred beneath (after a couple of minutes), turn the grill over and count another couple of minutes; for such a rapid process, a large armful of branches, preferably fruit-tree or grapevine branches, will produce a vivid but short-lived bed of coals. The branches should be all of approximately the same size so that some do not remain flaming while others are completely reduced to ashes. Serve fish directly from the grill. Each guest unwraps his own, the blackened leaf lifting off skin and scales with it, exposing the moist and delicate fillets, not a drop of whose natural juices has been lost. Serve lemon and a small pitcher of olive oil apart.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">LAMBS’ TRIPES A LA MARSEILLAISE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Although the elements of this preparation may be difficult to find in America (I questioned a number of New York butchers, some of whom told me that the stomachs were often available, but only one, on Bleecker Street, claimed to be able to get the feet), I could not resist giving the recipe, simply because the dish is so marvelous. If you should have the luck to find the stomachs, but not the feet, substitute calves’ feet split in 2 (1 calf’s foot for 4 lambs’ feet). In Iowa, where lambs’ tripes are out of the question, I have sometimes substituted chitterlings (whose form does not permit a stuffing) and pigs’ feet. The dish is no longer the same, but the result is altogether satisfactory.</p>

  <p class="indent">The success of the dish, although it demands little surveillance, depends on a long and very slow, even cooking process, and an ideal pot for cooking it is a 4-quart-capacity earthenware utensil with a close-fitting lid. It may profitably be prepared a day or two in advance, for in the slow cooling and reheating the sauce reduces and gains in body <a id="page408"></a>(it is never very thick, for its only binding element is the natural gelatin, derived mostly from the feet). Like all dishes in a tomato-flavored sauce, its peak of perfection may only be reached during the months of July and August when the vine-ripened tomatoes are full of the sweet, rich flavor of the sun. Out of season, use canned, rather than “fresh,” tomatoes. It may be accompanied by steamed potatoes, but good, heavy, rough-textured sourdough bread with which to mop up the sauce is all that is really necessary.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c30-s115"><em><span class="color">Lambs’ Tripes à la Marseillaise</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pieds et Paquets à la Marseillaise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>feet and stomachs of 2 lambs</em> (<em>about 4 pounds</em>)</p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Stuffing:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>7 ounces lean salt pork (substitute fresh side pork if salt pork seems not fresh)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 handful chopped parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Mirepoix:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium carrots</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>oregano</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound firm, well-ripened tomatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, Cayenne</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>thyme</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>bouquet of parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bottle of good dry white wine</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The tripe should be properly cleaned when bought, but, to ensure its being in impeccable condition, you may soak it for ½ hour in a pan of <a id="page409"></a>warm water to which has been added ½ cup of vinegar. Rub it together between your hands and brush it with a soft-bristled brush, then rinse it well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the side pork into small pieces or chop it coarsely. If it is salted, cut it first into larger pieces, parboil it for a couple of minutes, drain it, and then cut it into smaller pieces. Peel the garlic cloves, pound them into a purée in a mortar, add the pork, the chopped parsley, a healthy amount of pepper, and salt (depending on the saltiness of the pork), and mix well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the tripe into elongated diamond shapes measuring approximately 3½ inches on each side. Assuming the diamonds to be divided into 2 triangles by an invisible line drawn between the 2 oblique corners, a teaspoon of the stuffing should be placed in the lower triangle and, with a small, sharply pointed knife, a ¾-inch “buttonhole” cut at a diagonal in the upper corner. The side flaps, terminating in the oblique angles, are folded in, one over the other, partially covering the stuffing, and the lower corner is folded up over the stuffing and the side flaps. The “package” is then rolled up toward the slitted tip, and that corner is gently pulled to one side in order to encircle the package within the slit (which, because of the elasticity of the substance, will stretch to encompass it). The process is extremely simple. If this explanation seems inadequate, simply make a package and tie it with a thread.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare the <em>Mirepoix</em> with listed ingredients (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page75">this page</a> for method) in the utensil that will be used for cooking the <em>pieds et paquets</em> (an asbestos pad will protect earthenware from the direct gas flame and at the same time disperse the heat). Allow it to cook for from 20 to 30 minutes over a low flame without browning, then add the tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped (the liquid from the squeezed tomatoes, passed through a strainer to eliminate the seeds, may be added at the same time as the white wine) and the garlic, finely chopped, sprinkle with salt, Cayenne, and thyme leaves. Stir well and arrange the feet on this bed. Place the bay leaf and bouquet of parsley, tied together, in the middle, and the packages on top, so that all the elements are touching without being packed in. They must be “at ease,” but arranged in such a way that they are completely covered by a minimum of liquid. Pour in the white wine and, if necessary, a little water to cover. Bring to a <a id="page410"></a>boil over a medium flame. Never stir, but when the boil is reached, gently reach down the sides of the cooking vessel with a wooden spoon to slightly displace anything that may stick to the bottom; repeat this procedure every couple of hours. Adjust the flame so that only the slightest movement is produced on the surface of the liquid—a near-simmer. (Unless you are accustomed to doing this kind of cooking in that particular vessel over the same flame, the adjustment may take a good half hour of lifting the lid at regular intervals and turning the flame slightly up or down. The dish may equally well be done in an oven heated to approximately 250° F., but the adjustment is still necessary, and cooking time may take even longer.) It should cook like this for 8 hours. Halfway through, carefully skim the fat from the surface, taste for seasoning, and continue, every hour or so, to skim. Skim thoroughly before serving, or, if it is to be cooled and reheated the next day, skim it while cold. Count a good 2 hours for reheating (in earthenware at a very low heat). Discard the parsley and bay leaf before serving.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c30-s116"><em><span class="color">Strawberries in Orange Juice</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Fraises à l’Orange</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart of strawberries</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of</em> 3 <em>oranges</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash the strawberries rapidly without letting them soak, and remove the stems. Place them, whole, in the bowl or deep dish in which they are to be served, sprinkle them generously with sugar, pour the orange juice over, and leave them to macerate, covered, in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before serving. Simple, delicious and refreshing.</p>
