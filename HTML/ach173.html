<p class="author1"><span class="txit">tortine di cioccolato caldo</span></p>
<p class="noindent">These individual chocolate soufflés, or tortes, were a favorite among the patrons of Le Madri, the restaurant where I cooked with Gianni while researching <span class="txit">Big Night</span>. He devised this recipe so the soufflés could be prepared in advance and frozen. Just pop the frozen soufflés into the oven twenty minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="indentb">It is important that the chocolate used to prepare these soufflés contain a high percentage of cocoa butter—at least 52 percent. Bittersweet chocolate produced by Lindt, Valrhona, Callebaut, or Ghirardelli, all widely available in grocery stores, is recommended.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 ounces bittersweet chocolate</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups (3 sticks) butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">7 large eggs, separated</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons sugar</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Grease 8 individual disposable aluminum tart pans (about 4 inches in diameter, 1<sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> inches deep, capable of holding 1 cup of liquid) with canola oil. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Fill the bottom of a double boiler with water to a depth just below but not touching the bottom of the insert. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Place the chocolate in the top of the double broiler and fit the top into the bottom of the pot. Melt the chocolate, stirring frequently. Add the butter, stirring it into the chocolate as it melts. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. Allow to cool almost to room temperature, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Whisk the egg yolks, one at a time, into the chocolate mixture. Whisk in the vanilla, then the flour. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_343"/><span class="red">5.</span> In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. With the mixer set on low, gradually blend in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Use a rubber spatula to fold half of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture. When they are fully incorporated, fold in the remaining egg whites.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Divide the batter evenly among the prepared aluminum pans, filling each one to within <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch of the top. Bake immediately, until a slight crack appears in the top of each soufflé, 10 to 12 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">8.</span> After a small crack has appeared on top, remove one soufflé from the oven. Gently run a thin, sharp knife around the edge of the soufflé. Turn the soufflé upside down over a plate. A fully cooked soufflé will come out easily. If it does not come out easily, return the pans to the oven and let them bake for an additional 2 minutes. Allow the soufflés to rest for 1 minute before serving.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— MAKES 8 SOUFFLÉS —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Greasing the tart pans with walnut oil (or any nut oil of your choice) before baking or freezing will subtly change the flavor of the soufflés. Chocolate soufflés are delicious served alone, accompanied by a dollop of whipped cream or a small portion of raspberry or strawberry sorbet. In summer, decorate each plate with a few fresh berries and a sprig of mint.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> To freeze the soufflés for baking at a later time, place the unbaked soufflé-filled tart pans on a baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Cover the firm soufflés in plastic wrap and transfer to an airtight container and store in the freezer for up to 1 month. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake until a slight crack appears in the top of each soufflé, 20 to 25 minutes, and unmold as described above.</p>
