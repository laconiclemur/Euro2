  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Cauliflower Soup (Blomk</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">lsuppe)</span></p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Today we buy cauliflower all year round. Yet this vegetable reminds me of summer. I can still feel the late summer breezes as they rustled mamma’s pretty kitchen curtains while her delicious cauliflower soup simmered on the stove.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/25-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cauliflower, large, or 2 small heads</p>

  <p class="ing">1 qt. (1 l.) meat broth</p>

  <p class="ing">1 egg yolk</p>

  <p class="ing">Water and salt</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) cream</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">Nutmeg to taste</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. onion, minced</p>

  <p class="ing">White pepper</p>

  <p class="ingl">2 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="noindent">Remove green leaves from the cauliflower, wash, and place the cauliflower in cold water, with a little salt added, and simmer for a few minutes. Add the cauliflower to a soup pot. Add 1 teaspoon salt to each quart of water. When tender, about 10–15 minutes, remove one half and brake into florets. Continue to cook the remaining cauliflower until mushy. Cool slightly, place in a food processor with some of the water, and run on high speed for 30 seconds or until it has turned to a smooth sauce. In a frying pan sauté the onion until glossy, being careful not to brown. Stir in flour, and add the broth and the “sauce” all at once. Stir continually while bringing the soup to a boil. Let simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Beat the egg yolk with the cream, a touch of grated nutmeg, and white pepper, and add to the soup in a thin stream and under constant stirring. Add florets and place soup pot back on the burner. Heat through, but do not let it boil. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 6–8</p>

  <p class="h3">Pollock Party Soup (Selskapssei i gryte)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/25-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1"><a id="page_26"/>Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 oz. bacon</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅔ cups (1 ¾ dl) leeks, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 celery root, small</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) pollack</p>

  <p class="ing">3 potatoes, medium</p>

  <p class="ing">5 oz. (140 g.) lox</p>

  <p class="ing">2 onions, small</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and white pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ¾ cups (6 ¾ dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing">Parsley</p>

  <p class="ingl">⅞ cup (2 ¼ dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="noindent">Dice bacon, celery root, and potatoes. Peel and cut onions in wedges, and add all to a heavy bottomed saucepan. Add water. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and let simmer approximately 30 minutes. Pour off most of the water (save it) and place the remaining mixture in the pan in a food processor or blender, and combine on high setting. Remove sauce to a casserole dish and add the saved water and cream. Bring to a boil. Add sliced leek (save some for decoration) and let simmer 3–4 minutes. Add pollack cut in chunks. Remove from heat and let fish steep 4–5 minutes. Thinly slice lox (save some for decoration), add to saucepan, and steep for another 2–3 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. If soup is too thick, add a little more water or cream. Pour into soup bowls, decorate with parsley, leek rings, and thin strips of lox. Serve with crisp bread.</p>

  <p class="h3">Appetizing Fish Soup (Appetittvekkende fiskesuppe)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Making the broth from salmon and trout heads is what gives this soup its superb flavor. Save your leftover salmon or trout heads, bones, tails, etc. in the freezer until you have enough to make a broth. Your fishmonger may even have a few extra to give you.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tsp. potato starch flour</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ¼ cups (5 ½ dl) salmon/trout broth</p>

  <p class="ing">Pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">⅞ cup (2 dl) creme fraiche or sour cream</p>

  <p class="ingl">¼ cup (½ dl) chives, chopped</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a saucepan add enough cold water to cover bones, skin, tails, and fish heads. To get a clear broth remove the eyes from the heads before cooking. Simmer no more than 30 minutes, and strain. Add 1 tbsp. salt to each quart (liter) of broth.</p>

  <p class="indent">Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed pan. Cool slightly. Stir in the potato flour, and add the broth a little at a time. Bring to a boil. Thoroughly whisk the egg yolks into the creme fraiche. Remove the pan from the heat and fully stir in the egg mixture. Salt and pepper to taste. Pour into soup bowls and sprinkle with chopped chives. Hard rolls or french bread makes a good accompaniment.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 4 as a first course or 2 for dinner</p>

  <p class="h3">Oxtail Soup (Oksehalesuppe)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 lbs. oxtails</p>

  <p class="ing">1 parsnip</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tbsp. margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">Half a celery stalk</p>

  <p class="ing">2 strips of bacon</p>

  <p class="ing">Boiling water</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">1 carrot</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. tomato purée (not paste)</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. marjoram</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. soy sauce</p>

  <p class="ing">1 leek, chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">Cayenne pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion, chopped</p>

  <p class="ingl">Parsley, chopped</p>

  <p class="noindent">Ask your butcher to cut the tail apart in the joints. Wash. Brown the margarine and add the oxtails and bacon. Brown well. Transfer to a large soup pot. Add salt, peppercorns, marjoram, green tops of the leek, and onion. Dice half of the parsnip and celery root. Pour boiling water over ingredients to cover, approximately 2 quarts. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer about 2 ½–3 hours. The longer the oxtail simmers, the richer the flavor.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Strain. Pour the broth back in the soup pot. Julienne the carrot, the other half of the parsnip and celery root, and the remainder of the leek. Let simmer 5–10 minutes. Remove the meat from the bones and add <a id="page_27"/>to broth. Flavor the soup with tomato purée, soy sauce, and cayenne pepper to taste. Pour into a soup tureen, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and enjoy the aroma. Serve with hot onion bread, some Jarlsberg or Gouda cheese, and a salad.</p>

  <p class="h3">Beef Stew (Lapskaus)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ lbs. (675 g.) meat<a href="#Bfn_1" id="Afn_1">*</a></p>

  <p class="ing">1 leek, small</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ lb. (340 g.) carrots</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion, small</p>

  <p class="ing">1 celery root</p>

  <p class="ing">3 cups (7 ½ dl) broth</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (2 dl) rutabagas</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingl">4 potatoes</p>

  <p class="noindent">Use leftover boiled or baked meat, fresh or salted, or a mixture. Cut meat into even, not too large, pieces and set aside. Wash and peel carrots, celery root, and rutabagas, and dice. In a soup pot bring broth to a boil and add vegetables. Cook 15 minutes. Peel and dice potatoes. Cut leek lengthwise and wash thoroughly and slice, add with peeled, sliced onion and potatoes to the soup pot. Cook until almost tender. Add meat. Any leftover gravy may be added to the stew. Add salt and pepper to taste. Meat, vegetables, and potatoes should all be tender but not mushy. Stir as little as possible while cooking, but be careful that it does not burn.</p>

  <p class="hang"><a href="#Afn_1" id="Bfn_1">*</a>If fresh meat is used, cook separately. When nearly tender remove meat. Skim and add vegetables. Proceed as above.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/27-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Browned Beef Stew (Brun lapskaus)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Many like the vegetables and potatoes in a beef stew to be tender, not mushy. Others prefer the stew to be of a thick consistency. This recipe has the thick consistency.</span></p>

  <p class="ing2">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 onions, thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">4–5 potatoes, medium to large</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter</p>

  <p class="ing">3 carrots, diced</p>

  <p class="ing">2 lbs. (900 g.) beef stew meat</p>

  <p class="ingl">Salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a heated skillet fry onion in a little butter until glossy but not browned, and transfer to a large saucepan. Cut meat into ½–1-inch (1 ¼–2 ½-cm) cubes, and potatoes into 1-inch (2 ½-cm) cubes. Dice the carrots. Brown meat quickly in the butter the onions were fried in, add more butter if necessary, and get it nicely browned before adding meat. Add potatoes, carrots, and water to cover. Cook slowly until it thickens, about 2 hours, stirring once in awhile to prevent sticking. Add more water if necessary, but it should be of a rather thick consistency. This is another dish that tastes even better warmed the next day.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 6–8</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_28"/>Spinach Soup (Spinatsuppe)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Not too many people are nostalgic about spinach soup. But it is a great way to get this nourishing food into growing bodies. Even guests will enjoy it. Float a half of a hard boiled egg in the center of the bowl, and sprinkle with paprika. You may also serve this soup with a deviled egg half in the center.</span></p>

  <p class="ing2">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ lb. (340 g.) spinach, or use frozen spinach</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ tsp. nutmeg, grated fresh</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 qt. (liter) chicken or beef stock</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">3 hard-boiled eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. chives, chopped</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Wash the fresh spinach thoroughly under running water and drain well. Defrost and drain frozen spinach if using. Bring stock to a boil. Chop spinach and add to the boiling stock. Simmer, uncovered, for 6 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and place spinach and broth in a food processor and process on high speed about 30 seconds. Do not add more than maximum capacity to your machine at a time, or it could froth over. Set aside. Melt the butter in a frying pan, stir in the flour; when well mixed pour in the spinach broth all at once, and stir continually while bringing the soup to a boil. Allow to simmer 6–8 minutes. Add chives, spices, salt and pepper, and stir in whipping cream. Heat through. Place a half of a hard boiled egg in the center of each soup bowl, and sprinkle with paprika.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Yellow Pea Soup with Ham (Ertesuppe med flesk)</span></p>

  <p class="leftpara"><span class="italic">Whenever I think of</span> ertesuppe med flesk <span class="italic">nostalgia floods my mind. Our family spent many a Thursday evening around this hearty dish. It actually tastes even better the day after. It is an excellent cold-weather meal that can be prepared well in advance.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) yellow peas, dried</p>

  <p class="ing">2 large leeks</p>

  <p class="ing">1 smoked picnic, or 1 smoked butt plus ham bone</p>

  <p class="ing">Small baking potatoes</p>

  <p class="ing">Rutabagas</p>

  <p class="ingl">Salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">Soak peas in water at least 3 hours or overnight. Put picnic (or butt and ham bone) in large pot with enough water to cover. Add sliced leeks and the peas. Cover and cook slowly until peas are tender and meat is done, 2–2½ hours. If the ham being used is small, do not add until the last hour or so, or it will overcook. Salt to taste. The size of the ham and the amount of water used determine the strength of the soup. If too thin, cook uncovered until it becomes more concentrated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Following the soup, serve the sliced ham with a mild-type mustard, boiled/steamed potatoes, and sliced, cooked rutabaga.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Vegetable and Barley Soup (Grynsodd)</span></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">This inexpensive, nourishing soup is a well established winter-time soup in Norway.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 6-8</p>

  <p class="h3">Lamb and Vegetable Soup (Betasuppe)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">A marvelous winter treat that should be served piping hot. A classic loved by most. Recipe varies somewhat from district to district.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Some cooks use lightly-salted mutton or ham, others use fresh beef or mutton. A combination of salt and fresh meat is my favorite. Remember to soak salted meat in cold water overnight.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) pearl barley</p>

  <p class="ing">1 parsley root, diced</p>

  <p class="ing">2 qts. (2 liters) water</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ leek, sliced thin</p>

  <p class="ingl">2 slices lamb or ham, cured</p>

  <p class="noindent">Soak barley overnight. Simmer in the soaking water about 1 hour. In a separate saucepan cook the lamb until tender, about 30 minutes. Skim thoroughly. Set meat aside, strain the meat broth, and add to the barley. Add evenly diced vegetables, except peas and potatoes, and cook 15–30 minutes. Add potatoes and cook another 15 minutes. Add diced, fresh, and cured meat (preferably cured leg of lamb), and peas. Bring to a boil and let simmer until peas are tender.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_30"/>Vegetable Soup with Tiny Lamb Balls (Sodd)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">In the county of Trøndelag sodd has been served for generations and at all festive occasions, and especially at Christmas buffets. The tiny meatballs can be served in their broth with or without vegetable.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ qts. (1 ½ liters) water</p>

  <p class="ing">1 piece of ginger, small</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) lamb, boneless</p>

  <p class="ing">1 carrot</p>

  <p class="ing">1 leek, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 parsnip</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">Tiny lamb balls</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ingl">Parsley</p>

  <p class="noindent">Cover the meat with water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and skim well. Add leek, salt, pepper, and ginger and simmer 40 minutes. Add remainder of vegetables whole and cook until meat and vegetables are tender. Remove meat and vegetables and dice separately. Strain the broth and pour back into the soup pot. Add lamb, <span class="italic">soddboller</span> (recipe follows), and vegetables and bring to a quick boil. Pour into heated soup tureen and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve piping hot with boiled potatoes.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 8–10</p>

  <p class="h3">Tiny Lamb Balls (Soddboller)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Once when we sailed out of Trollfjord in the Lofoten Islands, on the express boat, we were served these tiny (and savory) lamb-balls in broth. They called it Trollbroth and they played Edvard Grieg’s music, “In the Hall of the Mountain King,” but in reality they were <span class="italic">soddboller.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fit for guests and often in times past they were served during the slaughtering season. You may serve them as an appetizer in the broth, or add to the vegetable soup in previous recipe. This recipe calls for 1 cup (2 ½ dl) cream and you want to use all of it, a tablespoon at a time. If the lamb balls are to be used for Vegetable Soup with Tiny Lamb Balls (<a href="../Text/011_Chapter003.html#page_29">p. 29</a>), cook them in the soup and eliminate the broth.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">10 oz. (285 g.) ground lamb</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) coffee cream</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tbsp. potato starch flour</p>

  <p class="ing">Nutmeg</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 qt. (liter) lamb or beef broth</p>

  <p class="ingl">½ tbsp. salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">The old recipes called for meat to be ground with the spices and flour 10–12 times! In other words grind it well. Add coffee cream a spoonful or two at a time, and beat well after each addition. Add nutmeg to taste. Bring the broth to a boil. With a teaspoon make ½–¾-inch (1 ¼–1 ¾ cm) lamb balls and drop into the boiling broth. Reduce heat and simmer until done. Serve piping hot with flatbread, or homemade bread.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 6</p>
