  <p class="chap-para">This is similar to a tea loaf but round and plaited (braided) in traditional Italian <em class="calibre4">ciambella</em> style. Italian housewives often made a cake just like this one to use leftover bread dough. Not very sweet but with the subtle taste of almonds, this is a perfect tea time treat or delicious for breakfast with a cappuccino.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 6–8</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup lukewarm milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">600g/1lb 5oz/5 cups strong (bread) flour, plus extra to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/½ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/1 cup ground almonds 100g/3½oz/¾ cup sultanas (golden raisins)</p>

  <p class="ing1">125g/4½oz/generous ½ cup butter, melted</p>

  <p class="ing1">60g/2¼oz/½ cup flaked (slivered) almonds</p>

  <p class="ing2">a little icing (confectioners’) sugar, sifted, to dust</p>

  <p class="para">Check the instructions on the packet of yeast; if necessary, dissolve the yeast in the milk.</p>

  <p class="para">In a large bowl, combine the flour, vanilla seeds, sugar, ground almonds and sultanas. Make a well in the centre and gradually add the yeast and milk followed by 100g/3½oz/7 tbsp of the butter, mixing with your hands to form a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Divide the dough into three equal parts and roll each into a long sausage shape, roughly 55cm/22 inches in length. Plait the dough and join at the end to make a round cake. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment, put the ciambella on top, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para1">Bake the ciambella for 35 minutes. Remove from the oven, brush the top with the remaining melted butter, sprinkle with flaked almonds and return to the oven for 10 minutes. Leave on a wire rack to cool slightly and dust with icing sugar before serving.</p>
