<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">ROASTED VEGETABLES WITH PEPPER AND NUT DIP</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">Traditionally these roasted vegetables would be cooked over a charcoal grill – ‘escalivar’ means to cook in hot ashes. But, barbecues aside, not many of us have a charcoal grill at home so here’s how to recreate this dish using an oven.</p>

<p class="recipe-list">3 PIMIENTOS CHORICEROS, OPTIONAL [SEE <a href="#note8">HERE</a>]</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Start by roasting the vegetables for the dip. Place the red pepper, tomatoes and garlic head in a roasting tin, drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle with some salt. Place in a cold oven, turn the temperature to 200°C/gas mark 6 and roast for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables for the escalivada. If you have a gas hob, use tongs to hold the peppers and aubergines over the flame for a few minutes, turning them so that they start to blister all over. When they are nicely charred put them in a separate roasting tin with a drizzle of olive oil and some rock salt, then place in the oven. Char the spring onions in the same way and add them to the roasting pan after about 10 minutes, along with the almonds and hazelnuts for the dip (they are smaller and so take less time to cook). Roast for a further 10 minutes, then remove the nuts from the tin so that they don’t continue to cook and burn.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg119"/><span class="no">3</span> Place the roasted vegetables in a container or shallow dish and cover tightly, ideally with clingfilm. This will make them much easier to peel. When cool enough to handle, peel away the skins and discard, along with the seeds from the peppers. Cut or break the peppers and aubergines into long strips and arrange in a serving dish with the spring onions and all the juices from the vegetables. Sprinkle over the sherry vinegar.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> To make the romesco dip, peel the roasted vegetables, removing the seeds from the pepper and then just blend all of the ingredients together, using a hand blender, food processor or pestle and mortar. You should end up with a smooth paste. For a more refined texture, you can pass the sauce the sauce through a sieve.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Serve the roasted vegetables with the romesco dip on the side and let your guests take as much or as little as they want.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1" id="note8">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Pimientos choriceros are Spanish dried peppers – they can be left out if you prefer. If you do get hold of them, you’ll need to remove the seeds and stalk and then soak them in hot water. After 30 minutes, remove from the water and scrape the pulp from the inside (discarding the skin).</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">PEAS WITH SERRANO HAM AND EGGS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">When people just boil peas and serve them with a knob of butter, it seems like a very boring part of a meal. To me, peas are better than caviar, full of flavour and sweetness.

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the frozen peas and eggs (wash them first) at the same time. Cook for no longer than 5 minutes. Don’t worry that the water goes cold and it takes a while to come back to the boil, both the eggs and peas will cook to perfection. Drain in a colander and rinse the eggs under cold running water to cool down a little.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Meanwhile, place a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the sliced garlic and a drizzle of olive oil. After a minute, add the chopped jamón and fry quickly until it goes crisp (take care not to let the garlic go too brown). Add the sherry and then quickly light it with a lighter or some long matches to flambé the pan. Add the chicken stock, seasoning, fresh mint and drained peas and cook for 1 minute before transferring to warmed plates.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Peel the warm eggs carefully and cut in half – they should be quite soft, not hard-boiled. Place on top of the peas and sprinkle with a few flakes of sea salt. At this point I can’t resist drizzling over a little more olive oil.</p>

If you ever come across fresh Spanish white asparagus, buy it – but if it’s from some far-flung corner of the world, don’t bother – there are plenty of other things you can cook! White asparagus does need to be very fresh or it can be tough and bitter. If you do find white asparagus, just cook for an extra 10 minutes, adding a tablespoon of sugar and a knob of butter to the water.</p>

Place over a high heat, bring to the boil and cook for 20 minutes or until soft (depending on the size).</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Meanwhile make the mojos. You can do this the old-fashioned way, by pounding everything together with a pestle and mortar or by using a hand blender. If you are using a pestle and mortar start by grinding the dry ingredients first, then add the vinegar and then the oil in a steady stream, pounding as you go. This is so that the ingredients emulsify properly.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Use the lid of the pot or a plate to drain most of the water from the potatoes, retaining about a wine glassful. Place the potatoes (now with just a tiny bit of water) back on a low heat and reduce the water down while gently stirring the potatoes so that they don’t catch. As the water evaporates a crust of salt should form on the bottom of the pot and surrounding the potatoes. Keep stirring the potatoes for a couple of minutes over a low heat until they start to wrinkle. Remove from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes before serving with the mojos.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Both these mojo sauces are really versatile and can be used as a dip or sauce with many other dishes. It’s traditional to use the mojo verde with fish dishes and the mojo picón with meat. Mojo picón will keep for several days in an airtight container in the fridge but mojo verde will only last a couple of days because of the fresh herbs.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">ROASTED RED PEPPERS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">It may sound strange but this simple tapa of roasted red peppers is one of the top three that my mum cooks and always reminds me of home whenever I eat it. It’s one of my favourite and is best enjoyed with other dishes. Many years ago while working for Ferran Adriá, Ramón the head chef – and now a very good friend of mine – told me something I will never forget: fine dining does not mean building a complex dish with different flavours, garnishes and sauces; fine dining means that when you roast a pepper, you roast it to perfection.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 6 AS A TAPA</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 10 MINUTES, PLUS RESTING</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Place the peppers in a roasting tray, drizzle with some of the olive oil and sprinkle with salt, using your hands to rub them all over. Roast them in the oven for 25 minutes, turning them over halfway through the cooking time.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Remove from the oven; the skin of the peppers should be charred and blackened in places. Cover the entire tray in clingfilm and let them rest for 15 minutes; the steam will make them easier to peel. To peel them, first pull the stalk with the seed from the middle, keeping all the juices on the tray. Peel the skin away with your fingers and set the skinned peppers aside on a plate. Slice the peppers into strips; if they release more juice, add it to the juices in the tray.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg135"/><span class="no">4</span> Put the remaining olive oil in a wide frying pan over a medium to high heat and add the sliced garlic (you do not need to heat the oil first as you will be frying from cold). When the garlic is light golden add the pepper strips and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the sugar and vinegar, season with salt and pepper, then sauté for a further 2 minutes. Strain all the saved juices from the skins and seeds into the pan and let them reduce for a further 5 minutes. If everything has gone right, you should have one of my favourite foods in front of you. <i>Buen provecho</i>!</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">If you are unfazed by peeling large amounts of peppers, triple the quantities, allow to cool and store in an airtight preserving jar; the peppers will keep for months.</p>

People tend to add all sorts of things like sugar, salt, balsamic vinegar or red wine but at Ferran Adrià’s restaurant we caramelized onions this way and I can tell you that after trying many other methods, this one is simply the best.</p>
