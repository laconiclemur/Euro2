<p class="normal"><b>At home, I often make casseroles and it is very much the way my mother likes to cook. It is not by accident I have chosen pears and ceps; not only do I love them but they bring so much to this casserole with their superb flavor and texture.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups peeled carrots cut into ¾-inch chunks</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups peeled rutabaga cut into ¾-inch chunks</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 firm pears, peeled, cored and cut into 8 wedges</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 large shallots, cut into thick rings</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ ounces dried ceps or porcini, soaked in ⅔ cup warm water</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups peeled celery root cut into ¾-inch chunks</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 garlic cloves, unpeeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups peeled butternut squash cut into ¾-inch chunks</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 small new potatoes, such as Charlotte or Ratte, scrubbed and each cut into 3 pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup Chicken Stock or Vegetable Stock (see pages <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">16–17</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Melt 1½ tablespoons of the butter with the sunflower oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the carrots and immediately turn the heat down to medium. Partially cover the pot and cook 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the carrots just start to soften around the edges but not color. Add the rutabaga, cover the pot again with the lid and cook 10 to 12 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, melt 1½ tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the pears and shallots and cook 8 to 10 minutes until just they are tender and starting to caramelize.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Using a small slotted spoon, remove the ceps from their soaking water, taking care not to stir the bowl, then put them on paper towels and pat them dry. Strain the soaking water though a fine strainer. Add the ceps to the pan with the pears and shallots, then stir in the thyme sprigs and sauté over medium-low heat 3 to 4 minutes longer until the ceps become soft. Season well with salt and pepper, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Add another 1½ tablespoons of the butter to the Dutch oven with the celery root and garlic, partially cover and cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are slightly soft. Add the butternut squash and potatoes and cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to high, remove the lid and add the remaining butter, the stock and reserved cep water, making sure there is not any sediment from the ceps in the water. Cook 5 to 8 minutes until the liquid reduces enough to just coat the vegetables; do this quickly so the vegetables don’t overcook. Remove the pot from the heat, add the pear mixture and parsley, stir gently to combine and heat through, then serve hot.</p>
