<h2 class="h2b">SOUPE DE FEVES ET PETITS POIS</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Pea and Broad Bean Soup</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Perhaps because of their colour, perhaps for their sweetness, youth and vibrant sense of spring, these two vegetables are eagerly awaited. This soup, simply made with water rather than stock, which would only serve to confuse and distract from the bright fresh flavours, uses some of the pods as well. The pods should be added only if young, tender and unsprayed; if they’re not, just add a third again of peas and beans. You absolutely must cook the soup as quickly as possible, adding more water if necessary, or you’ll lose all that is so appealing about the flavour. A little mint, just added at the end, is the perfect finishing touch to the freshest of soups which bursts with the flavour of Provençal springtime</em>.</p>
<div class="hangg">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
400g (14oz) fresh peas in their pods<br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) fresh young broad beans in their pods<br/>
1 small onion, peeled and chopped<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) olive oil<br/>
Approx. 1 litre (1¾ pints) water<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) whipping cream<br/>
1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Shell the peas and broad beans, keeping the pods. Wash the latter well, then chop them into small pieces.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the chopped onion and garlic in the olive oil for about 2 minutes. Add the pea and bean pods, then sweat for a further 3 minutes until they are soft. Cover with the water then bring to the boil. Simmer rapidly for about 5 minutes, then add half of the peas and beans. Boil for a further 5 minutes, then purée and strain through a fine sieve.</p>
<p class="normala">Blanch the remainder of the peas and beans for 1 minute in boiling water, then add to the puréed soup along with the cream. Bring back to the boil, add the sliced mint, and serve.</p>
