<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span><small>VERY SUMMER WHEN</small> I was growing up, my dad would take my cousins and me fishing on the waters off Long Island. We’d catch fluke, bluefish, tuna, and striped bass, and then we’d take them back to my cousin’s beach house to clean them and cook them. I have really fond memories of the smell of fish on the grill mixed with the salt air, and fresh summer salads on the table. Whether we ate it grilled with lemon juice or whole roasted with juicy, ripe tomatoes, fish was a staple every summer and something that always reminds me of family.</p>
<p class="indent">When <i>Top Chef All-Stars</i> had us go out fishing in those same waters, I had a blast. Being in a boat with Richie, Fabio, and Angelo was a lot of fun—it felt like being home. And, landing in the winners’ circle that night made it all the more special. Even though I didn’t ultimately win, I felt like I really showed who I am with my food that night.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, I make a point of going fishing out on the Chesapeake Bay whenever I can. I like to take my sous chefs and line cooks with me so they can have a feel for where our ingredients come from.</p>
<p class="indent">I encourage you to take the time to find a fishmonger or an excellent seafood market near you where you can get your hands on fish the day it’s caught, or the day after. That’s when it’s best. Some fish is flash-frozen immediately after it’s caught, and that’s great to use, too. Good fish shouldn’t smell fishy at all; it should smell fresh.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Bluefish has an undeserved bad rap—it’s often referred to as “trash fish,” which it’s not. When it’s fresh, bluefish is phenomenal. It’s clean, it’s white, it’s solid—in fact, it’s one of my favorite fish. The key to using bluefish is to cook it the day or day after it’s caught. This dish is based on a traditional escabeche in that it combines the fish with a flavorful marinade.</i></p>
