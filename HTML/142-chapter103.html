<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Chocolate made a not-infrequent appearance as an ingredient in Catalan cooking during the nineteenth century, a time when many from coastal Catalunya were going to the Antilles for business. While something of a specialty dish these days, recipes for lobster in chocolate that I have found in traditional Catalan cookbooks are strikingly similar. This one is adapted from their comparable versions. The chocolate here is treated like a spice and goes into the pounded picada stirred into the sauce. The outcome is baroque, tasty, and highly original.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Clean and cut the lobsters in half lengthwise down the middle. (If female, reserve the roe for the picada.) Crack the large claws slightly or “mark” them with a knife so they remain intact but the meat will be easily accessible when served. Season the lobster generously with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, or large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the lobsters and cook for 2 minutes, meat-side down, then for another 2 minutes shell-side down. Transfer to a platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Add the garlic to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until golden and fragrant, about 1 minute; remove and reserve. Add the onions, and cook until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Cut away and discard the antennae and small legs on the lobsters.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Return the lobsters and any juices to the pan, add the pimentón and saffron, and then pour in the brandy. Let the alcohol burn off for 1 minute, and then pour in the stock. Simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Meanwhile, prepare a picada with the reserved garlic and lobster roe (if there was any), the chocolate, almonds, parsley, cookies, and 2 tablespoons of simmering stock from the pan, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Stir the picada into the sauce and simmer for a final 10 minutes. The sauce should be loose but not watery. Remove the lobsters and reduce the sauce over high heat if needed. Serve from the cazuela.</p>
