<p class="pf">It was 1950. I was one month short of my sixteenth birthday when my parents planned to take a road trip “out west” to visit Elma and Mal Berg, my mother’s oldest sister and her husband, who lived in Eugene, Oregon. Isä had bought a brand-new 1950 Ford for the trip. I was left at home to take care of the farm. Alvin and Nancy went to stay with Aunt Esther and Uncle John. Rudy and Eugene went to stay with Aunt Helen. That left Marion, age thirteen, Leonard, age fourteen, and me to take care of the farm.</p>
<p>They left on June 6, and mid-June was about the best time to leave for two weeks. School was out. The crops had been planted and the weather was nice. The cows were in full milk, and they had arranged for Vesala (our bachelor neighbor who lived on the next forty) to come and help out with the milking. I don’t remember, but another neighbor, Lloyd Fagre, might have been on our call list for help if we needed it.</p>
<p>I knew the drill. Up and into the barn by 5:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 after a quick cup of coffee. The cows entered the barn, each filing into her favorite spot. (I often think how much like a cow I am—always selecting the same chair in choir today.) We scooped a measure of feed—“middlings,” a combination of coarsely ground grains—into the trough in front of each cow. Once a week they got a portion of soybean meal as well, to keep their coats shiny. The soybean meal was finely ground and I thought it was delicious too. We kept it in a large bin in the barn and I’d grab a handful as a personal treat. I thought it tasted a little like peanut butter.</p>
<p>We didn’t have milking machines at the time, so Marion, Leonard, and I milked our share of the cows by hand, four or five cows each. The fresh milk had to be strained into ten-gallon cans, after which the full cans were lifted into the cooling tank in the milk house. A full ten-gallon can weighed about a hundred pounds, so it was a two-person job to lift each one into the cooling tank that was in the milk house, separate from the barn. The cooling tank was a rectangular box made of cement and filled with cold water that we hand-pumped from the well. We usually filled two ten-gallon cans with each milking.</p>
<p>As each cow was relieved of her milk, she was turned out of the barn into the pasture behind the barn to drink from the creek and graze in the field. When the milking was done—usually at seven in the morning and seven at night—I felt free until the cows would come home again, their heavy bags swinging as they entered the barn.</p>
<p>Later in the morning the “milk man” drove into the farm with a big truck and picked up the cans that he then delivered to the creamery in Floodwood.</p>
<p>I have on my dresser to this day a little wooden box with the picture of the four presidents on Mount Rushmore. It was the gift Mummy and Isä brought home for me from their trip out west. I don’t remember what the gifts were for the others, but I have kept that little box all these years. In it I have stored my recognition pins from 4-H, the National Honor Society, and from my years in the Floodwood High School band—these were the pins that we would traditionally attach to our high school sweaters down along the neckband. I need to use a magnifying glass now to read the labels on them.</p>
