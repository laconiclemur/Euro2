  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page388"></a>In most parts of America, Parma ham may have to be replaced by <em>prosciutto</em>, and the Charentais melon by the local cantaloupe.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Charentais melon—that most raised in France—is a smooth-skinned variety of cantaloupe. It is often served chilled, macerated in port wine, but, except for a slight sprinkling of salt and freshly ground pepper, its natural qualities are best thrown into relief when it is unadorned. (Colette, whose palate was as fine as her pen, was horrified at the idea of chilling melon, for it kills “the taste of the sun.”) Melon requires a fairly rich, though not necessarily delicate, wine. It can be nicely accompanied by a semi-dry port or Banyuls, but a wine of this sort lends an unwelcome reception to the following white wine. The reasonable solution is to serve a single white wine that has the necessary body to flatter the melon while remaining sufficiently dry to accompany the following course (melon and raw ham are an Italian marriage and, in fact, are easily washed down by a good Frascati, which could serve as well for the artichokes).</p>

  <p class="indent">The meal requires a minimum of preparation and, with the exception of the actual cooking of the artichokes, potatoes, and kidneys, everything may be done in advance. The artichokes may be put to cook 15 minutes before the diners go to table, the potatoes at the same time as the artichokes are served, and the kidneys only after the second course is finished.</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The methods of preparation for <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">Artichoke Bottoms</a>, <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh6"><em>Duxelles</em></a> and <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#mire">Mirepoix</a></em> are given. If the latter two are already made up, count about 8 tablespoons of <em>duxelles</em> (enough to stuff each artichoke bottom, well packed but not heaped up) and 2 heaping tablespoons of <em>mirepoix</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is rare, on the American market, to find artichokes sufficiently young and tender not to require precooking. Should they be available, they need only be turned, the chokes removed, and the artichokes then rubbed with lemon and seasoned with salt and thyme before being stuffed and put to cook.</p>

  <p class="indent">The nature of the preparation is such that in a more elaborate menu it might perfectly serve to garnish a braised or roasted meat. Served as a course apart, its qualities will be better appreciated. For a less delicate version, one may reduce the cooking liquid without removing the <em>mirepoix</em>, and buttering the reduction as needed. The result is more rustic in spirit, but still very good.</p>

  <p class="indent">A good gelatinous veal stock will lend a great deal of support to the sauce, but if you have no natural essences on hand, don’t try to “improve” the flavor by the addition of bouillon cubes or other commercial products.</p>

  <p class="indent">Choose a <em>sauteuse</em> or casserole of the exact dimensions, as nearly as possible, to just hold the artichoke bottoms without their being packed <a id="page390"></a>in. Line the bottom with the <em>mirepoix</em> (which may be prepared in the same pan if it is not enameled).</p>

  <p class="indent">If the side pork is either salted or smoked, parboil the slices in simmering water for a couple of minutes and drain them. Season the inside of each artichoke bottom with a bit of salt and pepper and place a small piece of butter in each. Stuff them with <em>duxelles</em>, with the help of a teaspoon, packing the stuffing in firmly and smoothing the surface. Wrap a slice of side pork around each, tying it in place with a string, cut each of the 2 remaining strips into 4 sections and press 1 over each surface of <em>duxelles</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the prepared artichoke bottoms, side by side, on the bed of <em>mirepoix</em>, pour in the liquids and bring to a boil. Cook, covered, at a bare bubble for about 40 minutes. Remove the artichoke bottoms to a preheated serving dish, discarding the strips and pieces of side pork (or saving them to put into a soup). Pass the cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a small, heavy saucepan, pressing well without rubbing (in order to extract all the juices, without at the same time passing the solids through in purée). Reduce the liquid over a high flame, stirring constantly. The moment it begins to turn syrupy in consistency, remove the pan from the heat and whip in the remaining butter, cut into small pieces. Spoon the sauce over the artichoke bottoms, sprinkle each with a pinch of chopped parsley, and serve.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c28-s108"><em><span class="color">Grilled Lambs’ Kidneys with Herb Butter</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Rognons d’Agneau Grillés Chivry</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8–12 (depending on appetites) fresh lambs’ kidneys</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>olive oil or melted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">American butchers are prepared to argue the virtue of frozen kidneys. They should be absolutely refused, for there is no comparison between the fresh and the frozen. If the kidneys are not to be used immediately after their purchase, ask your butcher not to remove the protective covering of fat. To remove it yourself, use a sharp paring knife and cut <a id="page391"></a>lengthwise across the part corresponding to the top of the kidney, only just touching the surface of the kidney itself. Carefully peel off the heavy layer of fat and the thin transparent skin covering the kidney. Remove the skin, cutting it as closely as possible to its attachment at the base without cutting into the kidney. Beginning at the top, slit the kidneys lengthwise, being careful not to cut them completely in two. Open them out, butterfly-fashion, and, using either sharpened branches of rosemary or small skewers, skewer them across—this prevents their folding up as the flesh becomes firmer through contact with heat. Turn them around in the olive oil or melted butter and, just before putting them to cook, season both sides with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sear the cut surface first (face up beneath a broiler or face down over hot coals). Grilled over hot coals, they are much better, but the essential thing to remember, no matter what the method of grilling, is that, to remain moist, flavorful, and tender, the kidneys must remain pink inside. Once having been turned, the moment a rose-tinged tiny drop of liquid appears on the surface, they are done. Count approximately 2 minutes on each side (more or less depending on the intensity of the heat).</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve them immediately on a large, round, preheated serving platter, arranged face up in a circle around the potato cake, a teaspoonful of Herb Butter (below) in the center of each kidney, and a tablespoonful on the potato cake. Serve the remaining butter separately.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">HERB BUTTER</span></p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 chopped gray shallots (or 1 small onion)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large handful (about 3 ounces) parsley and chervil leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon chopped chives</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping teaspoon fresh tarragon leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound (1 stick) butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Blanch the chopped shallots (or onion) for a couple of minutes in boiling water and drain. Plunge all the herbs into boiling water and, after ½ minute, drain and press in a cloth to rid them of excess moisture. Pound the herbs and shallots together in a mortar until reduced to a purée, mix together with the butter (removed ahead of time from the refrigerator and allowed to soften) and pass through a drum sieve, using a plastic disk (or, lacking that, through an ordinary fine sieve, using a <a id="page392"></a>wooden pestle). Stir the resultant purée so that the greener parts (the last to pass through the sieve) are thoroughly mixed into the butter. If not used immediately, keep covered and chilled, but remove from the refrigerator ahead of time so that the herb butter will be soft—otherwise it will chill the kidneys on contact.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE POTATO STRAW CAKE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Simplicity itself to make, this preparation is a splendid standby. It can be whipped together in a few minutes and is a perfect accompaniment to any grilled or roasted meat or fowl. It may be enriched or rendered more fanciful by the addition of another ingredient hidden in a layer between the sealed surfaces of golden crisp potato (a julienne of carrots, stewed first in butter, sliced artichoke hearts sautéed in butter, etc. A julienne of fresh truffles spread in a central layer will lend a penetrating and luxuriant perfume that marries particularly well with roast game birds). For a perfect execution, one must use the little vegetable mill known as <em>mouli-julienne</em>. Otherwise, one may simply grate the potatoes. The result is satisfactory, but the interior texture is more compact and less delicate.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c28-s109"><em><span class="color">Potato Straw Cake</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Paillasson de Pommes de Terre</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 1¼ pounds potatoes, preferably of the nonmealy variety</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound (1 stick) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the potatoes, cut them into sections so that they fit into the <em>mouli-julienne</em>, and grind them directly into a large saucepan filled with cold water. Drain, wash again, and leave to drain for a few minutes in a sieve. Spread them out on paper towels and rub them well with another towel; it is essential that all the surface starch be washed <a id="page393"></a>from them, both to ensure the lightness of the interior texture and to prevent their sticking to the pan, and they must be equally well dried to avoid the risk of their turning into a messy soup. If desired, the potatoes may be prepared an hour or so ahead of time and kept, wrapped in a towel, until ready for use.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use a good heavy iron omelet pan about 9 inches across—it will not suffer from this use and may simply be wiped out with a dry cloth afterwards, exactly as after making an omelet. The flame should be low to medium; every stove is different, and one must judge by experience. It is better that the flame be too low to start with than too high—it can always be turned up if the browning process seems to go too slowly, but once the potatoes are burnt, the damage is irreparable. Melt 3 ounces of the butter in the pan, roll it around so that the bottom and sides are well coated with butter, and empty in the potatoes (don’t wait for the butter to bubble or turn brown). Pack them down with a fork, gently and unhurriedly, until the mass is firm and the surface formed in a smooth, shallow dome with no straggly, loose strands around the edges. Sprinkle evenly with salt and freshly ground pepper and place the remaining butter, cut into several pieces, around the edges, against the sides of the pan. Leave to cook, covered, for approximately 18 to 20 minutes. It should not be touched until ready to be turned, but if it is being prepared for the first time, take a look at it from time to time. It is ready to turn when the delicate, nutty odor of the cooked butter fills the kitchen and the very edge of the cake begins to be golden and frizzled. Before turning, make certain that the edges are loose all the way round, then jerk the pan slightly to be assured that the entire cake slides loosely in the pan. Slip a wide spatula or pancake turner beneath it and, with a single, deft movement, turn it over; nothing is easier, but if the idea makes you nervous, it is very simple to slip the half-cooked cake onto a plate, hold the pan upside down over the plate, then turn plate and pan back over (a bit of butter will no doubt be lost in this process and should be replaced with fresh around the edges). Season the cooked side and leave to cook, this time uncovered, for another 15 minutes. Slip the cake from the pan directly onto the heated serving dish.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c28-s110"><a id="page394"></a><em><span class="color">Peaches in Red Wine</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pêches à la Vigneronne</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound peaches</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sugar to taste</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ bottle good red wine (the same as served with the main course, preferably)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">In wine-making areas, this is one of the commonest summer desserts, peaches replacing the springtime strawberries. Each person prepares his own portion, adding the sliced peaches to his wineglass and sugaring to taste. However, in case some of your guests might be taken aback at the notion of mixing peaches and red wine, they should be prepared in advance, to be certain that the joy is shared by all.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel the peaches, slice them, sprinkle with sugar and leave to macerate. Shortly before serving, pour the wine over.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page395"></a><em><span class="color">Four Simple Summer Luncheons à la Provençale</span></em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Meridional French cooking is a world apart. Although certain typically Provençal dishes have been adopted by classical French cooking, the general spirit remains distinctly different. What it lacks in delicacy and nuance, it largely makes up for in robust vitality, high-spiritedness and color. Its affinities with the food of other Mediterranean countries, and in particular with that of Italy, are obvious, but the refinement is greater. Olive oil, olives, garlic, tomatoes, anchovies, saffron, Cayenne, basil and all those herbs that grow wild in profusion—thyme, rosemary, fennel, savory, oregano and serpolet—are the characteristic elements (with little exception, the only herbs used in France outside of Provence are thyme, bay leaf and <em>fines herbes</em>—parsley, tarragon, chervil and chives). Lamb and mutton are more often used in Provençal cooking than veal and beef, for good reason—the flocks are shepherded on mountainsides covered with herbs, with which their flesh is exquisitely perfumed. The little veal and beef produced in this part of the country is mediocre in quality. Rabbit and guinea fowl take precedence over chicken, and eggplant, zucchini, sweet peppers, broad beans and artichokes are typical vegetables.</p>

  <p class="indent">The wines in themselves are not remarkable, but they accompany perfectly the food, whose aggressive qualities would mask the subtlety of a finer product. This is the only section of France where more <em>vin rosé</em> is drunk than either red or white wine (elsewhere rosé is rather looked down on), and logically, Provençal food is probably the only food that is best accompanied by rosé wine.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Mediterranean verve that typifies most of the favorite specialties of Provence defies any attempt to compose them into elaborate menus, for other dishes in juxtaposition would inevitably suffer. Depending on the dish, it should form the entire body of the meal, with <a id="page396"></a>a bit of green salad and fresh fruit to finish, or, at most, it should be preceded by a simple hors d’oeuvre and the salad followed by a fresh cheese. There are few traditional desserts in Provençal cooking and those few are extremely simple in nature. These are dishes that seem to go with the sun, the summer, and the out-of-doors (brightly colored tablecloths and ceramic dishes are in the spirit) and are probably better eaten at lunchtime than at dinner. To properly enjoy them, they should perhaps be reserved for vacation time, for a true, old-fashioned Provençal siesta can be useful after such a luncheon. The following menus are conceived in these terms, and, with each, a light, dry, well-chilled rosé (Bandol, Cassis, La Palette, Tavel, Lirac, Chusclan) would be ideal.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is not possible to include every characteristic dish here, but I particularly regret the omission of <em>aïoli</em> (a garlic-flavored mayonnaise accompanied, in its simplest form, by boiled salt cod, boiled potatoes, and boiled carrots, and in its most elaborate—<em>le grand aïoli</em>—by artichokes, cauliflower, beets, green beans, chickpeas, mushrooms, hard-boiled eggs, land snails cooked in white-wine <em>court-bouillon</em>, sea snails cooked in herb-flavored sea water, squid <em>à l’américaine</em>, black olives, raw celery, etc.), and <em>bourride</em> (a simplified <em>soupe aux poissons</em> containing slices of two or three varieties of large, white-fleshed fish, the bouillon of which is thickened by the addition of an <em>aïoli</em>). Good recipes for both are to be found in all books on Provençal cooking.</p>
