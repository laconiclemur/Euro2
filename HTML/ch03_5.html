<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">CRASHED EGGS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">No visit to Madrid is complete without eating these crashed or broken eggs, as we call them. We eat them for lunch or dinner but you could also have them for breakfast or brunch. A crashed egg is somewhere between a fried and a scrambled egg – it ‘crashes’ because you crack open the egg some distance from the pan.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 2</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 5 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 15 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">200 ML OLIVE OIL</p>
<p class="recipe-list">½ SPANISH ONION, THINLY SLICED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">2 MEDIUM POTATOES, PEELED AND THINLY SLICED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">2 GARLIC CLOVES, THINLY SLICED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">4 EGGS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium to high heat and add the onion and potatoes. Fry for about 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the pan and set aside. Drain the oil from the pan, leaving just enough to fry the garlic. Add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds before returning the potatoes and onions to the pan.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Break the eggs one by one into the pan. You need to do this from a distance – at least 30 cm – so that the eggs crash into the mix. Season with salt and pepper and let them cook for a minute or so without stirring. They should still be very runny. Use a wooden spoon to carefully mix them in – remember you are not trying to make scrambled eggs! Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="recipe-head">SUGGESTIONS</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Huevos estrellados is one of my favourite things to eat – onion, garlic potato and egg – pure comfort food. However, there are endless flavour combinations. Here are some of my favourites:</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Morcilla de Burgos and chocolate – add one chopped morcilla sausage to the pan with the garlic and cook as above. Stir in 30 g grated dark chocolate just before adding the eggs.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Prawns and chorizo – add a handful of cooked peeled prawns and some chopped chorizo to the pan with the garlic.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><img alt="image" class="middle" src="../images/star.jpg"/> Pimientos de Padrón and jamón serrano – add a handful Padrón peppers to the pan with the garlic and cook as above. Stir in some chopped jamón serrano (cured ham) just before adding the eggs.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">FRIED EGGS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This simple fried egg dish is probably one of my top three dinners – I’ve eaten more of this than anything else. However, it’s important to get the cooking technique right, as it’s not as simple as it sounds. There are just three ingredients: oil, eggs and salt, so the success of the dish depends on the quality of the ingredients – use organic eggs, if possible. When you fry an egg at this high temperature the white becomes brown and crispy in parts – we call these crispy bits ‘puntillas’.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 1</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 1 MINUTE</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 1 MINUTE</p>
<p class="recipe-list">200 ML EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</p>
<p class="recipe-list">2 EGGS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">SEA SALT FLAKES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">BREAD, TO SERVE</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Start by pouring the olive oil into a small frying pan (just slightly bigger than a fried egg). Ideally you want the oil to be the depth of two fingers. Place the pan over a high heat; the oil needs to reach a temperature of about 220°C. Take extra care and close the kitchen door if you want to avoid smoke in the rest of the house.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Break your egg into a glass first to check that there are no bits of shell. Quickly tip the egg into the super hot oil – do not drop it in from a height, as you will splash your hand with hot oil. You only need to cook the egg for 8 seconds so be ready with your slotted spoon. While it is cooking spoon a little oil over the top of the yolk. Remove from the pan quickly and move to a plate while you cook the second egg.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Sprinkle over some sea salt flakes and eat immediately with some good bread.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">‘The simplest is not always the easiest’. This sentence is written on a board in all my restaurant kitchens – I can’t think of a better recipe to illustrate this point than this one.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list29"><a id="pg70"/>TORTILLA DE PATATAS</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">SPANISH OMELETTE</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">As you may well guess, I have cooked thousands of tortillas in my life. There are about 25 different ways to cook tortilla and I have cooked them all: onion first, onion after, caramelized or not, no onion, potato slow-cooked or fried… the mind boggles. But after all my research, I believe this is the best recipe.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 6 AS A TAPA</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 10 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 25 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">2 LARGE OR 3–4 MEDIUM WAXY POTATOES [CHARLOTTE IS IDEAL], PEELED AND HALVED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 SPANISH ONION, PEELED AND HALVED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">8 EGGS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">SALT</p>
<p class="recipe-list">400 ML OLIVE OIL</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Thinly slice the potato halves, cut side down, so that you end up with half-circle shaped slices. Do the same with the onion.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Pour the olive oil into a deep frying pan and add the thinly sliced onion. Place over a high heat so you are cooking the onion from cold. Once the onion starts to sizzle (this should take about 5 minutes), add the sliced potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until they are soft and cooked throughout. The potatoes and onions should have browned in some corners because of the contact with the bottom of the pan. If this hasn’t happened drain away some of the oil and caramelize them a bit in the pan. Remove the potatoes and onions from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Break the eggs into a large bowl but don’t whisk them; check there are no pieces of shell. Add the hot potatoes and onions to the eggs and season with salt while the potatoes are sitting on the top. Carefully mix through; use a fork to break up the eggs but don’t over-mix – just give the mixture a few loops with a fork. If you can, leave the mixture to rest for half an hour to allow the flavours to develop.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg73"/><span class="no">4</span> To make the tortilla place a non-stick pan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. When the pan is hot add the egg mixture. If you don’t have a non-stick pan add the mixture to a very hot pan but reduce the heat to its lowest setting straight away; this will stop the tortilla sticking to the pan. Do not stir the contents of the pan!</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Depending on the depth of your pan and the amount of heat from your stove, the cooking time will vary so you will need to use your judgement. After about 3 minutes you should be able to ease the tortilla from the edge of the pan using a fork or spatula. At this point, cover the pan with a plate (which should obviously be wider than the pan). Hold firmly with both hands and flip the pan over on to the plate. Slide the tortilla back into the pan for the other side to cook. Place back on the heat for another 2 minutes (I like it when the middle is still soft and a little runny).</p>
<p class="recipe-head">VARIATION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">For an ‘instant’ potato tortilla, let me introduce you to the best cheat I know: replace the fried potatoes in the recipe with a bag of good-quality plain crisps. Let them soak for a few minutes in the egg mixture and proceed as with the traditional tortilla. Don’t be ashamed – we all need a shortcut sometimes, and the result is just so good!</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">If this is the first time you have made a tortilla you might want to practise the flipping action with a plate and an empty pan first!</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">VARIATIONS</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">You can add all manner of flavourings to your tortilla if you like. Simply add to the egg mixture along with the potatoes and onions. Try small cubes of jamón serrano or chorizo, cooked petits pois or strips of tinned red pimientos.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH YOUNG GARLIC</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">For most people in the UK, scrambled eggs are what you have for your Sunday breakfast, cooked with a little salt and pepper. In Spain we hardly ever eat eggs for breakfast, preferring to make them into something more special, such as these eggs with young garlic and oyster mushrooms. If you can’t find young garlic, which is harvested before the cloves have matured, use spring onions instead.</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Season with salt and pepper and then break the eggs into the pan (never whisk or season the eggs before adding to the pan). Scramble the eggs gently – don’t over-mix as you still want to be able to make out the yolk from the white – this should take about 1–2 minutes if, like me, you like your eggs soft; cook for longer if you prefer. Enjoy with lots of good bread.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">OMAR’S NOTE</p>

<p class="recipe-head1" id="note5"><a id="pg77"/>A NOTE ON SHERRY</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">I’m often amazed that sherry has such a bad reputation outside of Spain so let me try to put you straight. Sherry is special for many reasons and there is a whole world of different styles, depending on the grape, the climate and how it is aged. However, apart from the flavour, there is one characteristic of sherry that really plays on our side when it comes to cooking. The result is that, fino aside, sherry doesn’t go off once the bottle is opened – the flavour actually develops, matures and tastes great for a long time. So, I would say you can afford to keep at least two varieties of sherry in your cupboard. I’m a firm believer in buying the best you can afford but at the same time you shouldn’t need to break the bank to eat well. I’ve tried and tested pretty much every supermarket ingredient and when it comes to wine for cooking – and particularly sherry – don’t use the cheapest one available. The difference in taste, particularly in a dish like this one, will be worth every penny.</p>

If you like a bit more sauce, add a chopped onion along with the garlic and a small glass of water and reduce until you have the right amount of sauce – perfect for dipping fresh bread into!</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Place a large heavy-based pan over a high heat and add the olive oil. Brown the chicken thighs all over, placing them skin-side down first as they will release a bit of fat, which will turn the chicken a lovely golden brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and onion and fry until it starts to colour. Now sprinkle over the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring all the time. Add the rosemary sprigs and then quickly flambé by setting light to the pan with a lighter or some long matches. Add the wine and stir into the flour until there are no lumps. Return the chicken thighs to the pan and simmer for a couple of minutes until the wine has reduced by half and some of the alcohol has evaporated.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Stir in the water or stock, add the olives and some black pepper, cover and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the chicken is tender and you have a juicy and rich sauce. Taste for seasoning – <i>buen provecho</i>!</p>

<p class="chap-opener">This particular chicken dish uses fresh chestnuts so it’s one to save for when they are in season. As soon as I see chestnuts in the shops (from November to February) this dish pops straight into my head.</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Cut the chestnuts in half with a sharp knife and throw them into the boiling water; cook for 10 minutes. Drain and leave to cool. Use a pair of pliers to squeeze the chestnut halves – the skin and shell should come clean away. If you are using a whole chicken, joint it into 8 pieces and then cut any large joints in half to give you about 10–12 pieces. Season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium to high heat and add the chicken pieces. Fry on all sides until golden, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and peeled chestnuts; after 1 minute add the chopped onion and celery. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes until the onion and celery have softened and turned golden.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Add the sage leaves, brandy and red wine and flambé the pan: use a lighter or long matches to set light to the alcohol as soon as you add it to the pan. Reduce until there is no liquid left and then add the water. Taste and add more seasoning and then add the grapes. Reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 20 minutes.</p>
