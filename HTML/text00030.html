</h1>
<p class="pf">All the time I was growing up I had naturally stick-straight hair. Thick, stubborn, and hard to curl. For special occasions—like the monthly “services” at Uncle Frank’s—Mummy used a curling iron to coax my hair into curls. We heated the curling iron in the chimney of our kerosene lamp. One had to be very careful not to touch the scalp with the hot iron, as that could result in serious burns. It was a touchy and time-consuming operation.</p>
<p>The style when I was in school was curly hair, and so a couple of times a year I would get a permanent. It wasn’t anything I really looked forward to because it hurt. It hurt a lot. Anne Brown had set up a beauty parlor in her house that faced downtown Floodwood.</p>

<p>After a shampoo, when Anne would scrub the daylights out of my scalp, she would take a strand of hair at a time and wipe a stinky solution onto the strand. Then she would wrap it tightly around a curler. It would feel like all of my hair strands were being pulled out of my head at once.</p>
<p>Anne twisted about fifty curlers onto my head, all wrapped with my hair, and clamp onto each curler something that had a long cord that extended to a heater and applied heat to my hair. I had to tell her if something got too hot, and she would use a blower to cool off that spot. There often were spots on my scalp that suffered burns. The process required stamina—almost like going to the dentist’s office—but I really wanted curly hair, so I made myself withstand the torture.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to complain to Anne because I knew what she was doing was necessary for the outcome. But it did hurt. Then she would calmly say, “You have to suffer to be beautiful!” My hair would be really frizzy curly at first, but after about two weeks it would tame down to be a nice, smooth wave. It was all worth it!</p>
<p>I have always thought it would be great to learn how to use makeup—especially to make my little eyes bigger. First, I thought you had to be old enough to use makeup. Then I wondered at what point would I be old enough? I still haven’t felt old enough to put on eye shadow, eyeliner, and eyebrow pencil. When I tried it once, a friend looked at me, shocked, and asked, “What happened to your eyes?” I guess I looked like I had been in a fight and lost.</p>
