    <p class="nonindent"><strong class="calibre13">Spoleto</strong> is a magnificent city filled with Roman artifacts—the Roman theater, the gorgeous house of Vespasian’s mother (Vespasia Polla), and the ancient city gates. The elegant façade and portico of the cathedral only hint at the beauty inside: it was Fra Filippo Lippi who worked on the frescoes depicting the Life of the Virgin. In the central scene, Lippi painted a self-portrait (dressed in a white monk’s tunic) as well as a portrait of his son. The title “Fra” signifies a cleric or monk, but Fra Filippo Lippi fell in love with a nun and had a son, Filippino Lippi.</p>

    <p class="extract">I first visited Spoleto with my husband and was impressed by the Ponte delle Torri, a graceful bridge built on the remains of a Roman aqueduct, consisting of long, slender arches that look like a delicate piece of lace hung out to dry between the mountain and the city of Spoleto. The city slowly tumbles down a slope and ends at the Via Flaminia, beyond which are rolling hills. In these hills, I experienced my first wild-boar hunt. It was thrilling to look through night-vision binoculars, making sure that I was downwind (boar have a very sensitive sense of smell), and although we didn’t bring any boar home that night, the hunt was exciting.</p>

    <p class="extract">Follow in the footsteps of Saint Francis and visit the <strong class="calibre13">Assisi</strong> basilica which houses his tomb and some of the most important frescoes of the Renaissance, by such artists as Giotto, Cimabue, and Simone Martini. It is an imposing structure to honor a man who lived so simply and owned nothing. But the simplicity is felt deep inside the basilica, in the burial chamber, where there is absolute stillness, echoing on the barren rock.</p>

    <p class="extract">As you walk through the Roman arch, Porta Consolare, up the stone roads of <strong class="calibre13">Spello</strong> (actually made for horses to walk up), each balcony or set of small steps is bursting with geraniums of all colors. Flowers in Spello are not only a matter of personal pride, but at the end of May, for the Feast of Corpus Domini, there is a town-wide festival, the Infiorata, for which flowers are used to make elaborate pictures and designs along the streets. There are also spectacular frescoes by Pinturicchio to be found in the Baglioni Chapel.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Foligno</strong> holds a special place for me in particular—the Palazzo Trinci, built and decorated by the Trinci family, Renaissance rulers of Foligno. The palazzo itself is a shining example of the Renaissance residence, and the frescoes inside reflect the interests of the family: the planets, the ages of man, and other Neoplatonic subject matter.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Bevagna</strong> is charming and welcoming to tired legs that have walked many hill towns; it is located on a low, fertile plain surrounded by waterways. One of the most splendid experiences I have had in Umbria was the medieval festival in Bevagna in June, when the whole town dresses up in medieval garb. <a class="calibre8" id="page219"></a>Plays are performed in the streets, stalls sell wares, and even blacksmiths display their trades on every corner of the town. The main square, Piazza Silvestri, is one of the most charming in Italy. There the medieval buildings are placed asymmetrically, quite different from the usual “square” square.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Montefalco</strong> is well known for the wonderful wine Sagrantino and for its ancient walls, still largely intact. Seek out the town hall with its graceful portico. I also enjoy the fourteenth-century Church of St. Francis, which now serves as a <em class="calibre4">pinacoteca</em>, or art gallery.</p>

    <p class="extract">They say that all Egubini—the people of <strong class="calibre13">Gubbio</strong>—are a bit crazy. My husband’s paternal relatives were all born in Gubbio, and I cannot say that I disagree; they are crazy in a jovial kind of way. It is the best Umbrian city to visit with children. Mine have gone there several times. Each time, we have our ritual: We park down at the bottom, and complain as we walk up the steep hill, but once we’re in the Piazza dei Consoli, the long haul is rewarded with a balcony looking onto the Umbrian landscape. The square is enormous and reminds me of an outdoor dance hall, with a long balustrade to admire the view. We then venture into the town hall and walk through the secret passageways and never miss the lower rooms, which my children like to call the dungeon, and the medieval toilets, where we enjoy bathroom humor. We then venture down to the “crazy fountain,” as the kids like to call it. Legend has it that if you walk around the fountain three times, splashing yourself with its water, you, too, will become as crazy as the Egubini. Needless to say, we do it every time, just to make sure no craziness has worn off from our last visit. Throw all caution to the wind, and get in a tiny round cage on the funicular that takes you to the mount above Gubbio. My children also enjoy staying in the nearby Capuchin monastery, which has been converted to a hotel, Park Hotel ai Cappuccini. Rooms in the older part of the hotel were monk cells.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
