  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page173"></a>THE FENNEL A LA GRECQUE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Artichoke hearts, small onions, the whites of leeks cut into 1½-inch lengths, celery hearts split in two, or cauliflower, the “flowers” removed from the main stalk, may all be prepared in identically the same way.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c08-s30"><em><span class="color">Fennel à la Grecque</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Fenouil à la Grecque</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ pounds fennel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 cups water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 2 lemons</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 onion, finely sliced into rings</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves of garlic, mashed and peeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8–10 coriander seeds</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8–10 whole peppercorns</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pinch fennel seeds</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large pinch thyme</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Garden fennel (sometimes known as Florentine or bulb fennel) has a light, refreshing anise flavor, much less pronounced than that of the wild fennel that enters so often into the seasoning of Provençal cooking. Unless the bulbs are tiny and tender, the outer stalks should be removed and the “strings” pulled from the remaining surface stalks (exactly as with celery stalks). The bulbs should be cut vertically into halves or quarters, depending on their size, and parboiled for from 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring the water to a boil, add all the ingredients except the chopped parsley, and simmer, covered, until the fennel is tender. Arrange the <a id="page174"></a>fennel in a deep serving dish, pour over the contents of the saucepan and leave to cool. Serve chilled, sprinkled with chopped parsley.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE MOUSSAKA</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A very pretty presentation and a savory manner of using up leftover roast or braised lamb or mutton, <em>moussaka</em> may also be prepared by cooking the eggplant halves in oil, incorporating the flesh into the mixture, and lining the mold with the skins. Transposed to the needs of classic French cooking, it would certainly be unrecognizable to the people who created it (though the taste is suspiciously similar). The Greek version is basically a hash of leftover meats, onions and eggplant, spread into a large baking dish, covered with white sauce and baked until a gratin is formed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dishes based on leftovers cannot depend on precise measurements, and those given here should not be taken too seriously. The tomato purée may be made from fresh or canned tomatoes—or leftover tomato sauce will serve perfectly well. Canned tomato juice is also possible, although it requires rather more drastic reduction. The use of tomato paste is to be discouraged, for it has an unpleasantly bitter, metallic taste which neither baking nor the addition of sugar can disguise.</p>

  <p class="indent">The small, elongated violet eggplant is far better than the large, nearly black variety, which is always pithy and seedy.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c08-s31"><em><span class="color">French Moussaka, Watercress</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Moussaka à la Française, Vert-pré</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound eggplant</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound lean, leftover cooked lamb</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup prepared <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh6">Duxelles</a> (if not already prepared, use 1 medium onion and ¼ pound mushrooms. The butter may be replaced by olive oil)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page175"></a>1 clove garlic, mashed, peeled, and chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup tomato purée</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a healthy pinch of <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a> reduced to powder in a mortar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 handful bread crumbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>watercress for garnish</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The eggplant will be used to line the mold. The small elongated variety should be sliced lengthwise into ⅓-inch-thick strips. A large eggplant should be peeled, two ⅓-inch-thick disks taken from it to line the bottom of the mold and close the top, and the rest cut into strips approximately 4 inches high by 1½ to 2 inches wide. Salt and pepper the slices, heat about ½ inch of olive oil in a skillet, and fry (in 2 or 3 batches) until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slice and cube the lamb as minutely as possible, then chop it fine, using a large, well-sharpened knife and a rapid, loose-wristed motion. Sprinkle with salt and cook in olive oil over a medium to high flame, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes; add the <em>duxelles</em> and continue cooking and stirring for a couple of minutes. Add the garlic, the tomato purée and the powdered herbs, turn the flame up as high as possible and stir constantly until the mixture is well blended. Stir in the bread crumbs and leave to cool slightly while preparing the mold.</p>

  <p class="indent">Line the bottom of a standard charlotte mold (approximately of 3-pint capacity, slightly over 3 inches high) with eggplant strips (or the circular section) and line the sides with strips, vertically placed and slightly overlapping. Press them gently against the sides to be certain that they are firmly in place.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sprinkle the meat mixture with pepper, mix in the egg, and add it to the mold, a spoonful at a time, being careful not to displace any portions of the lining. Tap the bottom of the mold firmly several times against a wooden table surface or on the chopping board to be certain that the stuffing is well settled and that no air pockets remain. Press down more strips (or the other round of eggplant) on the surface, carefully fold the overlapping ends of the side strips inward, one at a time, and press a buttered or oiled round of kitchen paper over the surface.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the mold in a larger pan, pour in enough boiling water to immerse it by two-thirds and poach in a slow oven (or tightly covered <a id="page176"></a>over a low flame) for 40 minutes. Remove the mold from the <em>bain-marie</em> and leave it to settle for 7 or 8 minutes before unmolding.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the round of paper, place a round serving platter upside down over the mold and, firmly holding a handle of the mold and the edge of the platter between the thumb and fingers of each hand, turn the mold and the platter over together. Wait a few seconds to be certain that the <em>moussaka</em> has unmolded and settled onto the platter, and gently lift off the mold. Surround with bouquets of washed and well-dried watercress, the stem ends tucked underneath the edge of the <em>moussaka</em>.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c08-s32"><em><span class="color">Orange Cream</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Crème à l’Orange</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>5 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup freshly squeezed, strained orange juice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 1 lemon, strained</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup white wine</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat the sugar and egg yolks together until the yellow color turns pale. Slowly add the liquids, stirring all the while, and cook over a low flame in a heavy saucepan, continuing to stir. The mixture will never coat the spoon, and it must not boil. When it assumes something more than a liquid consistency and begins to adhere to the sides of the saucepan, remove it from the heat, immerse the saucepan in cold water, and continue stirring until the cream has completely cooled. Pour it into individual serving dishes, chill thoroughly for several hours at least, and serve accompanied by <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh7"><em>Tuiles</em></a> or other simple cookies.</p>
