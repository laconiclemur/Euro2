<p class="normal"><b>I have included a few recipes with raspberries in this chapter, and with herbs too, but I can assure you they are totally different. Here, for example, the touch of grated lime, the crème fraîche and rosemary bring a unique balance to the dessert with its crunchy Breton sablé crust.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">36 raspberries (about 2⅓ cups)</p>
<p class="acktxt">confectioner’s sugar, to decorate</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest of ½ lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves</p>
<p class="acktxta">2 tablespoons crème fraîche</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE SABLÉ PASTRY DOUGH</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup plus 2 teaspoons confectioner’s sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxta">grated zest of ½ lime</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CRÈME PÁTISSIÈRE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup plus 2 tablesooons whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ vanilla bean, split lengthwise</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup cornstarch</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">juice of ½ lime</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 325°C. To make the <i>sablé</i> pastry dough, sift together the flour and baking powder in a bowl. Beat together the sugar, butter, salt and egg yolks, using an electric mixer, until light and fluffy. Fold in the flour mixture and lime zest to make a soft dough. Flatten the dough between two sheets of wax paper to about ½ inch thick, then transfer to a cookie sheet, lifting off the top sheet of paper. Bake 12 to 18 minutes until it is light golden brown. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and cut the pastry immediately into a 7-inch square while it is still pliable, but then leave it to cool completely before lifting it off the cookie sheet.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> To make the crème pâtissière, put the milk in a saucepan over low heat. Use a sharp knife to scrape the vanilla seeds into the milk, then whisk the milk and add the vanilla bean as well. Heat the milk until it is almost simmering, then remove the pan from the heat, cover with plastic wrap and leave the milk to infuse about 20 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean from the milk, rinse and dry on paper towels, as you can use it again.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light, thick and creamy. Gradually add the cornstarch, a spoonful at a time, whisking well after each addition to avoid any lumps forming. Slowly pour half the infused milk into the egg mixture, whisking as you pour, then transfer the mixture back to the pan with the remaining milk. Put over medium-low heat and stir continuously and quickly 10 minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the pan from the heat, whisk in the butter and lime juice and continue whisking until the mixture cools down and is smooth, thick and slightly trembling.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Spread the crème pâtissière about ¼ inch thick over the pastry, leaving a small margin clear around the edges. Arrange the raspberries in rows over the top of the crème pâtissière to cover it completely. Dust with a little sifted confectioner’s sugar and sprinkle with the lime zest and a little of the chopped rosemary. Mix the remaining rosemary with the crème fraîche and spoon into a pastry bag, then pipe a small dot of crème fraîche on top of every other raspberry all over the tart. Add a small piece of rosemary to each crème fraîche dot, then it’s ready to serve,</p>
