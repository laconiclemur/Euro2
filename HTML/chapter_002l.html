<h2 class="h2b">GAMBAS AU BEURRE DE TOMATE ET BASILIC</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Grilled Prawns with Tomato and Basil Butter</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Prawns are sold in different sizes. I prefer their flesh to that of lobster or</em> langouste <em>as they are the easiest to use, cut and make bisque with. This is a recipe for seafood lovers who enjoy eating with their hands. I tried it first using olive oil, which is also lovely, but butter just gave that little extra decadence. Have some bread handy that you can pull the middle out of to dip in whatever is left of the butter</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 large raw tiger prawns, shells on<br/>
2 large garlic cloves, peeled and chopped<br/>
2 strips Dried Orange Zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>), crushed<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
½ tsp tomato concentrate<br/>
2 very ripe Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped<br/>
4 sprigs fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, chopped<br/>
100g (3½oz) unsalted butter, softened</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your grill to high.</p>
<p class="normala">Split the tiger prawns down the centre of their backs, remove the intestinal cord and discard. If they have any coral, spoon this out and reserve it for the butter. Lay them out, cut flesh side up, on a tray that will fit under your grill.</p>
<p class="normala">Mix the garlic and orange zest with a little salt, add the tomato concentrate, tomatoes, basil and butter. Add as much spice as you like with the cayenne pepper and smear over the prawns.</p>
<p class="normala">Grill them for about 6–8 minutes. Check that they are ready by lifting up the thickest part of the prawn near the head: it should be pinkish white and no longer transparent. Serve as hot as possible and make sure there are plenty of finger bowls and napkins.</p>
