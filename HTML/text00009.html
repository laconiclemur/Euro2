<h2 class="h2a">-LAMB KEBABS-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Wrapped in soft pillowy</strong>
 <em>lavash</em>
 <strong>(flatbread), these delicious lamb kebabs make a great portable snack, so they’re ideal for cooking at a barbecue or to make ahead as part of a picnic or packed lunch. I like to serve these open with the various toppings and garnishes on the side for people to assemble themselves.</strong>

<strong>Cooking time: 20 minutes</strong>

<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the kebabi:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 tbsp plus 1 tsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side">2 medium onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz minced (ground) lamb</p>
<p class="side">2 garlic cloves, crushed, then minced to a paste using a pestle and mortar</p>
<p class="side">1 tbsp dried basil</p>
<p class="side">½ tbsp dried mint</p>
<p class="side">1 large handful coriander (cilantro) leaves, chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp finely ground black pepper</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp chilli powder</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp sea salt</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp tomato purée (paste), dissolved in 1 tbsp boiled and cooled water</p>
<p class="side1">¼ tsp ground caraway seeds</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>To serve:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">3 large round lavash (flatbreads) or tortillas, sliced in half</p>
<p class="side">3 tbsp pomegranate molasses or 3 tsp <em>Ajika</em>
 of your choice (Chilli Paste, see <a href="text00005.html#page_28">here</a>
 )</p>
<p class="side">1 large handful fresh parsley, chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 red onion, finely sliced</p>
<p class="side1">6 tbsp pomegranate seeds</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6 and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the <em>kebabi</em>
 , heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat, then add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft and just starting to colour. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the onions have cooled, place all of the other ingredients for the <em>kebabi</em>
 in a large bowl, then use your hands to mix through and ensure everything is thoroughly combined. Form the mixture into a ball, then pick it up with your hands and bring it back down into the bowl with some force; repeat this several times — I find this distributes the ingredients well throughout the mixture.</p>
<p class="para1">Wash and lightly oil your hands to prevent the mixture from sticking, then divide the mixture into 6 even-sized balls. Form the balls into fat sausage shapes with your hands, roughly the length of a halved <em>lavash</em>
 or tortilla.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat, then add the <em>kebabi</em>
 to the pan and turn until nicely coloured on all sides. Do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Once the <em>kebabi</em>
 are nicely coloured, transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and set aside while you finish the others. Transfer the <em>kebabi</em>
 to the preheated oven for 18–20 minutes to finish cooking.</p>
<p class="para">To serve the <em>kebabi</em>
 , divide the halved <em>lavash</em>
 or tortilla among 6 serving plates and spread each with your choice of pomegranate molasses or <em>Ajika</em>
 . Allow your guests to garnish their kebabs with fresh parsley, sliced red onion and pomegranate seeds before rolling and enjoying hot.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">-LAMB STEW WITH AUBERGINE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>This dish takes its name from the clay pot that it was traditionally cooked in. Though I have called it a stew, it actually starts off as a lamb-stuffed aubergine that breaks down and melds with the sauce on account of its long cooking time. It is a little fiddly to prepare, but well worth the effort and can be made ahead of time and left to bubble away in the oven for a couple of hours while you are getting on with other things.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 40 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 2 hours</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz aubergines (eggplants), approximately 3 medium aubergines</p>
<p class="side">6 onions</p>
<p class="side">6 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="side">3 fresh green chillies, finely chopped, or to taste</p>
<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz lamb shoulder, finely diced</p>
<p class="side">2 tbsp dried basil</p>
<p class="side">2 tbsp dried summer savory</p>
<p class="side">3 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side">2 red (bell) peppers, halved and sliced into half rings</p>
<p class="side">3 medium white potatoes, peeled and cut into 2.5-cm/1-inch cubes</p>
<p class="side">3 x 400-g/14-oz cans chopped tomatoes</p>
<p class="side">3 celery stalks, finely chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 small handful fresh parsley, leaves chopped</p>
<p class="side">plain boiled rice, to serve</p>
<p class="side1">sea salt and chilli powder, to taste</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="para1">Slice off the tops and bases of the aubergines (eggplants) and discard, then slice the aubergines in half horizontally to create squat cylinders. Use a spoon to hollow out the aubergine halves, retaining the flesh and being careful not to go all the way through the base of the aubergine. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Finely chop 3 of the onions and place in a bowl with the garlic, chilli and lamb and mix to combine. Finely chop the flesh from the centre of the aubergines along with the dried basil and summer savory, then season generously and mix again to combine. Spoon this mixture into the hollowed-out aubergines and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour the oil into the base of a large rectangular roasting pan. Halve and finely slice the remaining onions and lay over the base of the pan. Scatter over half of the red (bell) pepper and sit the filled aubergines on top, packing them in snugly so that they don’t fall over during cooking. Scatter over the potatoes, pressing them down between any gaps in the aubergines and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the tomatoes, celery and parsley in a bowl and mix to combine. Season with sea salt and chilli powder, then pour the mixture over the aubergines in the roasting pan.</p>
<p class="para">Cover the dish with foil and transfer to the oven to cook for 1½ –2 hours, until the lamb is tender and fragrant. Serve hot with plain boiled rice.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">-LAMB STEW WITH SOUR PLUMS-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Sour plums only have a short season and can be hard to find in the UK, although sometimes I am lucky enough to spot some at the specialist Middle Eastern grocers that are local to me. The plums melt into the sauce adding a beautifully rich sourness, so they are well worth seeking out. Otherwise, lime juice makes a great substitute and will still yield a rich, unctuous and pleasingly sour sauce.</strong>

<h2 class="h2a">-BEEF AND PORK DUMPLINGS-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>The boys that I grew up with used to take great pride in polishing off enormous platefuls of these moreish dumplings and, truth be told, so did I. When eating them, you pick them up by their stalks, bite off the meat-filled pocket and discard the doughy nubbin. The problem with this is that it is easy for people to keep track of how many you have eaten and, growing up, I had always eaten more than was deemed delicate or feminine! Not wanting to miss out on my favourite food, I remember going to great lengths to conceal the giveaway pieces of dough in my pockets when on dates as a teenager. Luckily times have moved on and I am now free to devour as many of these as I choose.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 45 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 10–15 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the dough:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz plain (all-purpose) flour</p>
<p class="side">1 egg, beaten</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp salt</p>
<p class="side1">200 ml/7 fl oz distilled water</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz coarsely minced (ground) beef</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz coarsely minced (ground) pork</p>
<p class="side">3 onions, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="side">¼ tsp ground caraway seeds</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp ground black pepper</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp fine sea salt</p>
<p class="side1">¼ tsp ground allspice</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>To serve:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
<p class="side1">chilli powder, sour cream or crème fraîche (optional)</p>
<p class="para1">To make the filling, place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use your hands to combine. Transfer to the fridge, covered, for 30 minutes to let the flavours develop. Once the meat has rested, you can quickly fry off a small spoonful of the filling to test the seasoning if you like.</p>
<p class="para1">While the filling is resting, make the dough. Sift the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the egg, salt and water to the well and then use your hands to form a rough dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until the dough is just smooth, then set aside to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Once rested, place the dough on a lightly-floured surface and roll out to a thickness of 5 mm/¼ inch. Using a 10 cm/4 in round pastry cutter, cut circles from the dough. Then reroll the offcuts and use up the remaining dough.</p>
<p class="para1">Working with one piece of dough at a time, place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the centre of each dough circle. To shape the dumplings, work around the circumference of the dough circle to bring the dough up around the filling. Pleat it like an accordion as you go – the pleats will eventually come together to encase the filling and leave a central stalk.</p>
<p class="para1">Once you have finished all the dumplings, bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer. Being careful not to overcrowd the pan, drop the dumplings into the water top-side down and leave to cook, covered, for 10–15 minutes, until the dumplings are floating on the surface of the water. Be careful not to cook them for too long as this can cause them to fall apart.</p>
<p class="para">Drain the dumplings and transfer to a serving dish, then season with salt and pepper. Traditionally these are served as they are with a little chilli powder sprinkled over the top, but they are also delicious with a generous spoonful of sour cream or crème fraîche served alongside.</p>

<p class="para1">
<strong>In Georgia these are traditionally made with pig’s heart, liver, kidneys and intestines, and the process of making them is very fiddly and time-consuming. As this is one of my favourite dishes, when I first opened Little Georgia, I was determined to serve them in the traditional way but, because people in the UK were less accustomed to eating offal than back home in Georgia, they did not sell well. In the restaurant, I now make them with minced (ground) pork loin and they are very popular. This is the recipe I am sharing with you here.</strong>

<em>Memories of spiced Georgian sausage</em>
</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>My love for</strong>
 <em>kupati</em>
 <strong>started when I was little. We had a large holiday house in Abkhazia, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. One summer, my grandmother took me to visit one of her friends who lived nearby, and while they were chatting and preparing food, I played outside with the neighbourhood children. Suddenly, my play was interrupted by a totally alien smell that was smoky, spicy and totally irresistible. Like a sniffing dog, I followed my nose and chased the delicious aroma all the way back to the kitchen, where I found the table set for lunch and my grandmother and her friend waiting for me. The anticipation caused by the incredible smell of the piping hot</strong>
 <em>kupati</em>
 <strong>and the sound of them sizzling in the pan had me drooling, and the taste was even more heavenly. This memory is forever imprinted on my senses and whenever I smell</strong>
 <em>kupati</em>
 <strong>cooking, I am a child once again.</strong>
