</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Because of its extraordinary geographic and ecological diversity</span> and its dramatic patchwork history, Spain is a land of breathtaking gastronomic diversity. Every region has its own special style of cooking, and every coastal region has three different styles—one of the sea, one of the plains, and one of the mountains. But unlike in Italy, for example, cooking styles and dishes are not strictly contained within regional boundaries.</p>
<p class="para">You can divide the country broadly into three gastronomic zones: wet and mountainous northern Spain, facing the Atlantic and the Cantabrian Sea; the dry central interior; and the Mediterranean coast and islands. But these are crisscrossed by other cultural zones. For instance, the great Ebro River and its fertile valley have brought Mediterranean crops and cooking from the coast deep into the northern interior, and the various regions that straddle the Pyrenees all have similar mountain dishes.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p082.png" class="calibre11"/></p>
<p class="para">You have to look into the past to understand Spain’s complex gastronomic map. Some dishes passed from one region to another through internal movements of populations. In the Middle Ages, as the Christian kings reconquered Muslim territories in the south, they gave them to aristocrats from the north who had helped them in battle, and northern peasants were encouraged to move south to repopulate the land. They brought with them their ways of making pork products, their beans, and their chestnuts trees. In the twelfth century, when the Berber Almohads tried to convert the Jews in Al-Andalus to Islam, they fled north en masse, with their Judeo-Moorish dishes. That is how their Passover almond cake (see page 30) came to be adopted as the iconic cake <span class="italic">tarta de Santiago de Compostela</span> (page 549). In the sixteenth century, Muslim converts to Christianity were forced to leave Andalusia and spread throughout the country. Many of them became vendors who sold their foods on the streets, and that is why <span class="italic">pinchos morunos</span>—marinated and spiced pork kebabs—are favorites on the tapas circuit. Clergy, who famously had a powerful influence on the diet of the peasantry, were moved around the country by their religious orders. They spread their ways of making brandy and cheese, and the nuns carried their famous pastry-making traditions from one convent to another.</p>

<p class="para">Certain foods, such as <span class="italic">migas</span> (see page 476) made with bread crumbs, and the lamb stews referred to as <span class="italic">del pastor</span> (of the shepherd), can be found across the country along the old migratory routes of the seasonal transhumance of sheep that crisscrossed the country. A dressing of fried garlic, vinegar, and <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (paprika) and dishes called <span class="italic">al ajo arriero</span> (<span class="italic">ajo</span> means “garlic” and <span class="italic">arriero</span> means “mule driver”) can be traced along the old routes traveled by the mules that transported salt cod between the seaports in the north and the interior. The muleteers also sold garlic, olive oil, and <span class="italic">pimentón.</span> Some dishes that appear in several different parts of the country arrived with Spanish returnees from colonies in the New World, Italy, and North Africa.</p>
<p class="para">In more recent times, Spaniards became familiar with the foods of regions other than their own, and there was a certain homogenization of cooking traditions. From the nineteenth century on, there was mass migration from the poorer south to the industrial north and from the countryside to the cities. The many migrants from all over Spain who went to Madrid made that city a center of culinary diffusion. Until just over a couple of decades ago, agricultural laborers, sometimes with their entire families, traveled during harvest time from region to region to pick grapes, olives, and fruit and to harvest wheat and corn. They needed feeding, and the landlords who provided their meals sometimes adopted their dishes. The Spanish Civil War made many orphans, and so many young peasant girls needed work and a roof over their heads. After the war, most middle- and upper-class families took on two maids, one to clean and look after the children and one to cook. The cooks learned the style of the house and also brought the ways of their <span class="italic">comarca</span> (<span class="italic">terroir</span>). Now markets throughout Spain sell products from all over the country, and television programs encourage people even in small villages to cook specialties from different regions. Everyone makes tortillas, paella, gazpacho, <span class="italic">croquetas,</span> <span class="italic">fabada,</span> empanadas, and flan. They have become national dishes.</p>
