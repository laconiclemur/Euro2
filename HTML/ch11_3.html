<p class="noindent">Rice has been grown on the Mediterranean shores for more than two millennia, having been introduced by soldiers returning from Alexander the Great’s expedition to India in 327 B.C. Yet Spain’s rice consumption truly took off only when Arabs conquered the country’s southeastern coast in the eighth century A.D. Applying their legendary agricultural skills to rice cultivation, the Muslim invaders planted the grain in the fertile soil around Valencia, irrigating the paddies with a brilliantly complex network of dikes and canals. These ingenious Arab watercourses still irrigate the picturesque wetlands around Albufera, a freshwater lagoon south of Valencia, where much of Spain’s rice production is concentrated. The Spanish word for rice, <em>arroz,</em> comes from the Arabic <em>al-ruzz</em>. “For Islam, agriculture had a religious sense,” notes paella authority Lourdes March. “Water was the symbol of life and the earth the symbol of fertility and every product extracted from it would multiply in Paradise.” Rice would flourish in this environment.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_332"/>Rice-based cuisine continues to thrive in the Levante—the land where the sun rises—a stretch of Spain’s eastern coast that encompasses the provinces of Castellón, Valencia, Alicante, and Murcia. Of these, Valencia is synonymous with Spain’s most famous rice dish: paella. “Paella is Valencia itself—the city’s symbolic representation,” declares Valencian food critic Antonio Vergara. And cooks there can be so fundamentalist on the subject that the issue of whether it’s permissible to add red pepper to paella was supposedly brought before the Valencian parliament.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the Valencian paella police recite to you the recipe for the one and only true <em>paella valenciana</em> with rabbit and snails, they usually relent and admit that there are as many paellas as there are cooks and that the definition, ingredients, and technique vary every five miles in Valencia province alone. Moving south to Alicante, you encounter truly creative and magnificent rice preparations not regulated by Valencian strictures. You also learn that paellas represent just a fraction of the Levante’s astonishingly varied rice cuisine. Three elements are usually spelled out when a rice dish is described: the ingredients flavoring it, the receptacle in which it’s cooked, and the consistency of the rice. Paella-style rices are <em>seco</em> (dry), cooked until the liquid is completely absorbed. Equally popular are <em>meloso</em> rices—a little creamy, with syrupy liquid still clinging to the grains. Wonderful too are <em>caldoso</em> (brothy) <em>arroces,</em> which are prepared in a pot and have a texture halfway between a rice soup and a risotto. In winter, nothing beats an <em>arroz al horno,</em> rice baked in an earthenware <em>cazuela.</em> Flavorings? The sky’s the limit.</p>
<p class="indent">I can spend weeks calling on all my favorite rice restaurants in the Levante, each of which specializes in a particular dish. Casa Carmina near Valencia draws crowds with its folksy <em>arròs amb fesols i naps.</em> A soupy rice full of rustic oomph, it teems with bits of braised wild Albufera duck, white beans, turnips, pork, and blood sausage. The stunningly picturesque lake-side Casa Salvador in Cullera is the place for lobster rice and a <em>meloso</em> rice with skate <a id="page_333"/>and wild garlic shoots. At the stylish Monastrell in the city of Alicante, my friend María José San Román prepares a succulent <em>arroz meloso</em> with morels and spring vegetables. Mari Carmen Vélez at La Sirena (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_217">page 217</a>) is the queen of <em>arroz a banda,</em> a fishermen’s rice cooked in an insanely powerful fish broth and traditionally served with fish on the side. At Ca’Sento in Valencia, superstar chef Raúl Aleixandre fashions an iconoclastic paella from puffed-up fried rice (imagine Rice Krispies from the fourth dimension).</p>
<p class="indent">And now about Casa Paco. The restaurant is located in Pinoso, an ugly hamlet set amid the achingly drab, arid countryside of inland Alicante, miles from civilization. The service is rude, the décor nonexistent. None of this stops paella fanatics from driving for hours to get there. Their prize? A rabbit and snail paella that qualifies as an existential eating experience. Prepared over live flames so high they seem to shoot straight up to the ceiling, the rice is almost crunchy in texture, as smoky as a good barbecue, and layered so thin in the pan that an eighteen-inch paella feeds only two. Or one, if you <em>really</em> love paella.</p>
<p class="indent">Nobody can reproduce Casa Paco’s paella, but the recipes in this chapter capture the regional spirit. Here you’ll find a true <em>paella valenciana</em> with rabbit that will please even the toughest Valencian critics, as well as a robust winter paella from Alicante with potatoes and pine nut–studded meatballs. With relatively little effort, you’ll be able to reproduce the coastal seafood paellas, such as dramatic jet-black paella made with squid ink, a Catalan seafood rice flavored with a delicious <em>romesco</em> broth, and the classic mixed seafood paella one enjoys at <em>chiringuitos,</em> the beloved beachside restaurants. There’s a sensational Basque smoked cheese risotto, too, and an intriguing couscous from Alicante.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the pasta recipes, they’ll be a revelation to anybody who thinks pasta belongs only to Italy. A seafood paella prepared with fideo noodles instead of rice is one of the world’s greatest and niftiest dishes. And from Barcelona, where Italian cuisine was fashionable in the eighteenth century, come luscious cannelloni and baked macaroni laced with pork and wild mushrooms that can compete with the best pasta creations from Italy.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">CLASSIC VALENCIAN PAELLA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PAELLA VALENCIANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is the classic <em>paella valenciana,</em> the only dish that, according to Valencian traditionalists, can be legitimately called paella. It consists of rice, rabbit (and sometimes chicken or duck), land snails, green beans, butter beans, perhaps artichokes, and a simple <em>sofrito</em> of tomatoes and garlic. A well-prepared paella is one of the world’s greatest dishes. For a simpler version, use only chicken—four or five skinless, boneless thighs. And, you can also legitimately add a few slices of sautéed pork sausage or chorizo. Snails lend an air of funky authenticity to the dish, but a sprig of rosemary is a traditionally acceptable substitute, although nobody is sure exactly why.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into 1</strong>½<strong>-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds rabbit, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 large garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 6 cups chicken stock or broth (more if using bomba rice)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup green beans (preferably Italian flat beans), trimmed and cut into 1½-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup frozen butter beans or baby lima beans, thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 package (9 ounces) frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and patted dry with paper towels</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large ripe tomatoes, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skins discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of cayenne, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups short- to medium-grain rice (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_338">page 338</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 snails (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11_note1">Note</a>), or 1 sprig fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 roasted red bell pepper (optional; see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut into strips, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the chicken and rabbit in a bowl and rub generously with salt, pepper,½ teaspoon of the paprika, and half of the garlic. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the chicken stock in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the saffron and keep the stock at a simmer until ready to use.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 15- or 16-inch paella pan set over a single burner and heat over medium until it starts to smoke. Add the chicken and rabbit and brown, turning several times, for 6 to 7 minutes. Add the green beans, butter beans, and artichokes and stir until the vegetables begin to brown, 2 to 8 minutes. Push everything to the edge of the pan, where it’s not as hot.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the center of the paella pan. Add the remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes to the center of the pan, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring the tomatoes several times, until they are thickened and reduced, 5 to 7 minutes. Using two wooden spoons, push the meat and the vegetables toward the center of the pan and mix them up with the tomatoes. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon paprika and the cayenne and stir for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Add the rice to the paella pan and stir it gently to coat with the pan mixture. Pour in 4 cups of the simmering stock (6 cups if you are using bomba rice), keeping the remaining stock simmering in case it is needed later. Set the paella pan over two burners, stir in the snails or the rosemary, and shake the pan gently to distribute the rice evenly. Cook over medium heat until the cooking liquid is almost level with the rice but the rice is still rather soupy, about 7 minutes. Periodically move and rotate the pan so that the liquid boils evenly. If the liquid is absorbed too fast and the rice still seems too raw, sprinkle on some more stock.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Transfer the paella pan to the oven and bake until the rice is tender but still a little al dente, about 15 minutes. Check the paella a few times and sprinkle more stock over the rice if it seems too al dente. Remove the paella from the oven, cover it with aluminum foil, and let stand for 5 minutes. Uncover the pan and let stand for another 10 minutes (the rice gets better as it stands). Garnish with the roasted peppers and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 AS A FIRST COURSE, 6 AS A MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_335"/>YES, BUT IS IT A REAL PAELLA VALENCIANA?</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">“Valencians,” remarks the famous Catalan writer Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, “believe that God himself revealed the paella recipe to them and to them alone.”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">And exactly what might that recipe be? Well, for starters, paella <em>must</em> be prepared with the squat local rice in the flat two-handled paella pan that both defines the dish and lends it the name. An authentic <em>paella valenciana</em> contains chicken, rabbit, sometimes duck, and the land snails called <em>vaquetes</em>, for which a rosemary sprig can be substituted. Seafood <em>and</em> chorizo? You’ve got to be kidding. The only permissible flourishes include flat green beans, artichokes, and <em>garrofón,</em> or butter beans. Rice and rice again is the true star of the dish.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The list of regulations continues. A true <em>paella valenciana</em> has to be cooked outdoors, over a fire fueled with vine branches or orange tree shoots, enhanced by an aromatic <em>sofrito</em> of tomatoes, garlic, saffron, and <em>pimentón.</em> Die-hard paella buffs may also tell you that paella is a man’s job because only men know how to handle fire . . . that the key to its success is the hard calcium-rich Valencian water . . . that paella is only for lunch, <em>never</em> for dinner . . . that tourist paellas that mix shellfish and meat are a crime punishable by imprisonment . . . that any dish that isn’t strictly speaking a <em>paella valenciana</em> with rabbit and chicken must be called simply <em>arroz con,</em> or “rice with.” And then they’ll wax lyrical about how paella is served</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In the nineteenth century, paella was a celebratory weekend feast cooked in <em>el campo</em> (the country) and eaten straight from the pan. The dish evolved from a range of simpler rices prepared by laborers in the Levantine rice paddies and <em>huertas</em> (vegetable plots) with whatever could be hunted and gathered: eel, wild duck, rabbit, artichokes, beans—even water rats—and yes, seafood in the fishing communities along the coast. A local newspaper first referred to it as <em>paella valenciana</em> in 1840.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The word <em>paella</em> continues to carry a ritualistic connotation. “Paella is an activity rather than a particular dish,” a rice farmer in Albufera said when I asked him to define the difference between a paella and an <em>arroz.</em> “It’s what you do on a Sunday, with the whole family gathered around an enormous paella pan set on the fire.”</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_336"/>PAELLA PANS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Strictly speaking, paella is not paella unless it’s prepared in the round, shallow, flat-bottomed, two-handled pan that gives it its name. Lourdes March, author of <em>El Libro de la Paella Arroces,</em> argues that Valencians got the name from <em>patella,</em> a Roman word originally describing ceremonial chalices, which later came to be used for all manner of cooking vessels. Paella pans are relatively thin, made from carbon or stainless steel, which reacts quickly to fluctuations in temperature. The wide, shallow shape allows the largest area of rice to come in contact with the bottom of the pan, where all the flavor is concentrated. It also helps liquid rapidly evaporate. (Because the rice cooks uncovered, there’s no steam to cook the top layer.)</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Paella pans expand in diameter rather than depth so that the layer of rice is always thin, ideally never more than a half inch thick. While you can use a huge skillet, nothing quite matches a proper paella pan, both for cooking and presentation. You should have no trouble finding paella pans at a good cookware shop or through mail order. The most useful size is fifteen to sixteen inches, which will make a main-course paella for four to six. Carbon-steel paella pans are more traditional and cook the rice better than fancier stainless-steel ones. However, they do tend to rust. After each use, scrub the pan gently with a soft brush, dry it completely, rub it thoroughly with an oiled paper towel, and keep it away from moisture. Like any good traditional pan, <em>la paella</em> gets better as it becomes seasoned from use.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_338"/>PAELLA PERFECTA</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Paella might just be the world’s most perfect company dish—from the drama of presenting the giant pan at the table, to the beautifully seasoned, addictively flavorful rice. Once you get the knack of it, the paella recipes in this chapter are not at all complicated or time-consuming and can be prepared with supermarket ingredients. They are also infinitely tastier and more authentic than anything you might have encountered as paella at American restaurants. This said, paella is a dish that relies on a specific technique that demands a wee bit of understanding and practice. Here’s some guidance.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>THE RICE</strong></span> Whether <em>biryani,</em> risotto, or sushi, a rice-based dish is only as good as the quality of the rice. For paellas and other traditional <em>arroces,</em> cooks in the Levante and Catalonia rely on short- to medium-grain local varieties that are valued for their ability to absorb other flavors and deliver a texture that’s miraculously spongy <em>and</em> firm all at once. A fashionable rice these days is the boutique <em>arroz bomba</em> that grows in the nitrogen-rich soil around Calasparra, a region in the province of Murcia. A low-yield heirloom variety, bomba is extremely dehydrated and absorbs more than three times its weight in liquid, expanding in width like an accordion, rather than in length. Despite its cachet, I’m not a huge fan of bomba, finding it tricky to work with, overly firm, and not as open to absorbing flavor as some other rices. Many Valencian rice cooks who initially embraced bomba share my feelings and are increasingly switching back to humbler but more flavorful strains, such as the smaller-grained senia and bahía. If you do use bomba, remember that it soaks up three to three and a half cups of liquid per cup of rice. I don’t recommend linen sacks of rice simply labeled Calasparra without the word <em>bomba</em> on the package; these contain the lesser balilla x sollana variety, expensive but unremarkable.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">My favorite rice for paella happens to be Italian: violone nano from the Veneto, traditionally used for risotto. Recommended to me by Raúl Aleixandre, the genius chef at Ca’Sento restaurant in Valencia, it soaks up a ton of flavor, has just the right texture, and cooks faster than bomba, requiring less liquid. (Genetically, vialone nano is almost identical to the traditional Valencian senia and bahía strains, which are unavailable in this country.) Among readily available brands, Beretta vialone nano is quite tasty. While less perfect, arborio risotto rice—preferably good-quality imported—is also acceptable for paella. As is Goya’s medium-grain rice, which, like risotto rices, requires about two cups of liquid for one cup of rice. Regular long-grain rice or Oriental short-grain are not suitable for paella.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">If you buy a short- to medium-grain Spanish or Italian rice you are not familiar with, start by adding two cups of liquid per cup of rice, then add more liquid later if the rice still feels raw when most of the liquid has been absorbed. Paella is not pilaf or risotto; the rice is never washed and barely stirred. See “The Spanish Pantry” (<a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>) for information on finding these rices.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>THE FLAVORINGS</strong></span> The boost of flavor in most paellas comes from <em>sofrito,</em> a mixture of aromatics cooked down until dark and intense. Catalans will use a jammy, long-cooked <em>sofregit</em> of onions and tomatoes. In Valencia, <em>sofritos</em> tend to be lighter, consisting of garlic and grated tomatoes. In Alicante, fleshy dried ñora peppers are often added. Other seasonings might include herbs, as well as saffron and paprika for color. While unsmoked paprika from Murcia is more traditional, a dash of smoked <em>pimentón de la Vera</em> is a great way to simulate the smokiness of a wood-fired grill, the classic way of cooking paella. And then there are the ingredients particular to each paella—rabbit, <a id="page_339"/>chicken, pork, artichokes, seafood—their flavors intensified and caramelized by the intense heat of the thin steel paella pan. Don’t neglect salt: If your meats, seafood, or vegetables aren’t amply seasoned, the paella will come out bland.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>THE LIQUID</strong></span> For cooking paellas, Valencians swear by their hard, lime-rich water. Obsessive cooks even carry water with them when planning to cook paella away from home. Well, the business about hardness or softness of water turns out to be a bit of an old wives’ tale. At least according to my friends the brilliant Michelin-starred Alicantine chef Quique Dacosta and the Valencian rice scientist Santos Ruiz, who are collaborating on an iconoclastic rice cookbook meant to debunk this and other rice-cooking myths.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The best liquid for flavoring the rice is a simple but tasty broth: chicken for poultry and meat paellas; and fish or shrimp shell stock for seafood rices. And I’ve seen many a paella cook crumble a bouillon cube into their liquid. It works!</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>THE TECHNIQUE</strong></span> Like risotto, paella is all about method. First, the ingredients that will flavor the rice are sautéed over lively heat in a paella pan. Once the rice and liquid are added, the grain cooks for a few minutes at a fast uninterrupted boil over high heat; this “opens up the pores” of the rice, as local cooks say. The heat is then reduced, and the rice continues to simmer until the kernels become plump and somewhat firm, though never fluffy or overtly al dente. The surface of a properly cooked paella should look compact and beautifully caramelized. The rice is fluffed only when the paella is served.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>HOW MUCH LIQUID TO ADD</strong></span> Ah, the million-dollar question. The accepted wisdom is two cups of liquid per one cup of rice. This ratio tends to be foolproof when the rice is covered and cooked by absorption. When the grain cooks uncovered in a shallow paella pan, liquid tends to evaporate more rapidly, at a rate that will vary slightly each time you cook. The exact amount of liquid also depends on the rice, how thickly it’s layered, and the diameter of the pan. For rices other than bomba, begin with the two-to-one ratio, setting aside an extra cup of liquid for each cup of rice. Before the rice goes into the oven, taste it. If it feels raw, sprinkle on about a half cup of liquid. As the rice bakes, check it a couple more times, splashing on more liquid if the rice still refuses to give. As you check for doneness, taste the bottom or middle layer of rice, not the top. And keep in mind that the rice should come out of the oven somewhat al dente, so it can finish cooking off the heat. As with the amount of liquid, cooking times may vary slightly depending on the variety of rice and the rate it absorbs liquid. Your best guides are feel, look, and taste. After a few trials and errors, you’ll get it perfect each time.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>SERVING</strong></span> Now, the fun stuff. Proudly carrying the paella pan to the table is definitely part of the drama, a climactic reward for your work. Set the pan in the middle of the table and let guests scoop the rice out onto their plates with a wooden spoon. Traditionally, you start at the edge of the pan, working your way toward the center. A good paella should be flavorful enough to eat on its own, but lemon wedges and/or <em>allioli</em> are always welcome, especially with seafood-flavored rices. Most authentic paellas come unadorned; if you’d like a splash of color, decorate the paella with roasted pepper strips.</p>

<p class="image"><a id="page_337"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0337_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Chiringuito Seafood Paella</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Come summer, the Spanish flock to the water with the determination of fish. Awaiting them on the beach are <em>chiringuitos,</em> humble seaside establishments that are to the Spanish coast what clam shacks are to New England. There is usually a pretty <em>terraza</em> with a view of the sea and a menu that revolves around salt-baked fish, lacy fried baby squid, clams in <em>salsa verde,</em> and, invariably, a simple but irresistible mixed seafood paella, such as this one. Feel free to play with the seafood assortment here, substituting mussels for the clams and small scallops for the monk-fish, but keeping the proportions pretty much constant.</p>
<p class="indent">A good seafood paella is a minimalist affair, with few other ingredients besides seafood and rice. As the flavor depends on a good rich fish stock, I strongly recommend using Shrimp Shell Stock or another well-reduced flavorful fish or seafood stock. And don’t skip the <em>allioli</em> for serving.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>About 5 cups Shrimp Shell Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_356">page 356</a>), or 3½ cups clam juice diluted with 1½ cups water (more if using bomba rice)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound monkfish or other firm-fleshed fish, cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 ounces cleaned squid, bodies and tentacles cut into 1-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 medium-size garlic cloves; 8 crushed with a garlic press, 2 minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large, ripe tomatoes, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skins discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¾ cups short- to medium-grain rice (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_338">page 338</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 small littleneck clams, scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 jumbo shrimp, shelled and deveined</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 lemons, cut into wedges, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the shrimp stock in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the saffron and keep the stock at a simmer until ready to use.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 15- or 16-inch paella pan set over a single burner and heat on medium until it starts to smoke. Add the monkfish and cook until barely seared, about 1 minute, seasoning it lightly with salt. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a bowl. Cook the squid, stirring, until just seared, about 2 minutes, seasoning it with salt.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Push the squid to the edge of the paella pan, where it’s not as hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the center of the pan. Add the crushed garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes to the center of the pan, reduce the heat to low, <a id="page_341"/>and cook, stirring the tomatoes several times, until they are thickened and reduced, 5 to 7 minutes. Using two wooden spoons, push the squid toward the center of the pan and mix it up with the tomatoes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Add the rice to the paella pan and stir it gently to coat with the pan mixture. Pour in 3½ cups of the simmering stock (5 cups if you are using bomba rice), keeping the remaining stock simmering in case it is needed later. Set the paella pan over two burners, stir in the parsley, and shake the pan gently to distribute the rice evenly. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Periodically move and rotate the pan so that the liquid boils evenly.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Press the clams and the monkfish into the top of the rice and cook until the cooking liquid is almost level with the rice but the rice is still rather soupy, another 2 to 3 minutes. If the liquid is absorbed too fast and the rice still seems too raw, sprinkle on some more stock.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Transfer the paella pan to the oven and bake until the clams open and the rice is tender but still a little al dente, about 15 minutes. Check the paella a few times and sprinkle more stock over the rice if it seems too al dente. Remove the paella from the oven and discard any clams that have not opened. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, and let stand for 5 minutes. Uncover the pan and let stand for another 5 minutes (the rice gets better as it stands).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> While the rice is standing, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Stir-fry the shrimp, a few at a time, adding some of the minced garlic to each batch, until the shrimp are bright pink and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per batch.

<h3 class="h3bro">BLACK PAELLA WITH SQUID, MUSSELS, AND PEAS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ARROS NEGRE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">For sheer drama, few dishes can beat the sensational Spanish seafood paellas tinted jet black with squid ink. Enjoyed along Spain’s eastern coast from Catalonia to Alicante, black paellas are pretty easy to make at home, provided you can get your hands on packets of squid ink, which will save you the trouble of extracting your own. As the intensity of the ink varies, you’ll need to use enough to color the broth completely black (otherwise the color of the finished dish will be gray). Serve the paella with either plain or Roasted Garlic Allioli.</p>

<p class="box-title">HAIL TO THE WATER COURT</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Visitors to Valencia who find themselves outside the city’s cathedral on a Thursday get to witness a curious spectacle. Promptly at noon, a crowd gathers around as eight elderly men dressed in black convene with great pomp outside the Gothic doorway of the cathedral. This is Valencia’s renowned <em>Tribunal de las Aguas,</em> or Water Court. Dating back to the tenth century, the tribunal is Europe’s oldest surviving court. Its purpose? To settle disputes concerning the distribution of water. Today, few serious disagreements are actually brought before the old men in black. Usually, they just meet, ask anyone with a water dispute to come forward, and when no one does, promptly disband. Yet the very presence of this archaic judicial body is symbolic of the importance of irrigation here in the epicenter of Spanish rice production.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">When the Arabs began planting rice in the rich agricultural hinterlands outside the city, they set up a complicated network of dikes and canals that channeled river water from the mountains into the rice paddies. They also established a system of communal government for water rights, a setup still intact today as rice growers administer the irrigation of each area on the principle of equal shares. These days the Comunidad de Regantes Acequia (Association of Water Users) is doing a pretty good job at settling their own disputes. But Valencia just wouldn’t be the same if the Water Court didn’t solemnly meet every Thursday at noon outside the cathedral.</p>

<h3 class="h3k">VALENCIAN PAELLA WITH VEGETABLES &amp; PORK</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ARROZ CON VERDURAS Y MAGRO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is a robustly flavored vegetable and pork paella from the inland <em>huertas</em> (vegetable plots) of Valencia and Alicante, a rice dish as delicious and classic as the seafood and chicken versions. The bouquet of vegetables here includes chard, cauliflower, artichokes, red peppers, and green beans. Feel free to add whatever else looks good and seasonal—peas, fava beans, small cubes of eggplant—while maintaining the same proportion of rice to vegetables, since a paella should never be overloaded with too many ingredients. If you know a place to get garlic shoots, they would be more than welcome here.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>12 ounces boneless pork loin or shoulder, cut into 1-inch pieces</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_344"/>PAELLA 101</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>1. Don’t experiment:</strong></span> Paella making is an art honed by decades, and like any great rice dish it loves continuity: same pan, same kind of rice, same stove, same proportions. When you’ve mastered the basic technique and can produce perfect rice in your sleep, start taking creative license. The only secret to a great paella is the same as how you get to Carnegie Hall: practice.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>2. Avoid overloading paella</strong></span> with extraneous stuff: Paella is about rice and rice again. The great Spanish gastronome Rafael García Santos decries paellas with too many ingredients as “pointless baroque exhibitionism.” Besides being an affront to tradition, too much food in the pan smothers the rice and prevents it from cooking evenly. While the recipes in this chapter are open to substitutions, try not to alter the proportion of rice to the other ingredients.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>3. Don’t attempt to double the serving size</strong></span> in a particular pan. Paella pans are designed for specific amounts of ingredients; the layer of rice should always be rather thin. If you’re planning on making paella often, get pans in two sizes: a 15-inch pan for four people and an 18-inch one to serve six to eight.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>4. Place a paella pan over two burners,</strong></span> if it’s more than 13 inches in diameter. As you cook, keep turning and moving the pan every few minutes, gently shaking it as you rotate it. If you’re really into paellas, consider getting the appropriate paraphernalia, such as a special gas burner and a tripod to help the paella cook evenly without baking. See “Sources” (<a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>) for where to find these.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>5. Have everything chopped, measured, and ready to go before you start cooking,</strong></span> just as you would with stir-frying. Because paella pans tend to get very hot, the ingredients cook quickly and organization is crucial. With a little advance prep, assembling and cooking paella is a relative breeze.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>6. If you see the rice cooking unevenly,</strong></span> sprinkle some water over the “raw” spots or gently stir the under-cooked bits in the bottom of the pan. Valencians insist that the rice should never be stirred—agitating the starches makes the rice gummy—but some gentle fiddling is perfectly fine. If the rice is getting soft before the liquid is absorbed, raise the heat to cook down the liquid. If the top of the rice is under-cooked while the bottom is soft and ready, remove the pan from the heat, cover it with a damp kitchen towel, and leave it for about ten minutes.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>7. Always let the paella rest after cooking,</strong></span> as the rice continues to absorb moisture away from the heat. Standing for ten to fifteen minutes, covered with a kitchen towel or aluminum foil, is standard. However, when tardy guests once forced me to leave the paella sitting for forty-five minutes, I was amazed at how much the texture improved upon standing. (Some Valencian paella junkies even suggest that paella is at its best at room temperature the following day!) If you’re letting paella stand for more than fifteen minutes, tent it very loosely with aluminum foil or cover it loosely with paper towels, so that it doesn’t continue steaming.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>8. The paella can be prepared ahead of time</strong></span> up to the point the liquid is added. Letting the rice stand once it’s been coated with the pan mixture is actually good for its flavor. Advance preparation can be done a few hours ahead, with the rice cooked right before the guests arrive. Figure on about forty minutes from the time you add water to the time you serve. Most of this is hands-off. (Note: If the paella contains artichokes, do not let them sit in the pan or they will blacken. Remove the artichokes from the pan while the paella sits and return them to it when you add the liquids.)</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><a id="page_345"/><span class="blue"><strong>9. Be sure the cooking liquid is at a simmer</strong></span> before adding it to the rice, but don’t allow it to boil. Besides affecting flavor, boiling liquid causes it to evaporate and you will lose track of the proportions.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>10. Leftover paella—</strong></span>in the utterly unlikely event you’ll have any—is delicious the following day. Just don’t leave the rice in the paella pan overnight, as it will take on a metallic flavor. Reheat the rice briefly in a microwave until it’s quite warm but not piping hot.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">PAELLA WITH PINE NUT MEATBALLS, SAUSAGE, AND POTATOES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ARROS AMB MANDONGUILLES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">On a chilly night, few things hit the spot better than this rib-sticking paella from Alicante, which teams rice with pine nut–studded meat-balls, potatoes, tomato quarters, chunks of chicken or pork, and slices of <em>morcilla</em> (blood sausage). If <em>morcilla</em> isn’t your thing, use another sausage, such as chorizo or fresh pork sausage. The meatballs take only minutes to prepare (make them before you start the paella), but feel free to omit them and increase the amount of chicken or pork.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_347"/><strong>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, or boned country-style pork ribs, cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>

Add the tomato quarters to the pan and sear quickly all over, about 1 minute. Transfer the tomato quarters to another bowl. Add the chicken, potatoes, and red pepper to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring, until nicely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Push everything to the edge of the pan, where it’s not as hot.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the center of the paella pan.

<p class="noindent">This wonderful recipe is adapted from the Catalan chef David Solé i Torné, the great <em>romesco</em> sauce specialist from the city of Tarragona.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ARROZ AL HORNO CON CONEJO Y SETAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Ampurdán is a Catalan region renowned for its lusty autumnal cuisine, which often combines wild mushrooms and game. They team up beautifully in this baked rice dish from the charmed Hotel La Plaça in Madremanya. If you don’t have rabbit, substitute chicken. The best dish to cook this in is an earthenware <em>cazuela</em> with straight sides—one that can be carried right to the table. Lacking a <em>cazuela,</em> use a wide, flameproof casserole. Much of the dish can easily be prepared ahead; cook the rice right before you’re ready to serve.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_351"/><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound fresh sweet pork link sausages (preferably without fennel)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound assorted wild mushrooms or a mixture of wild and cultivated mushrooms (chanterelles, cèpes, morels, oyster, cremini, and/or portobellos), wiped clean with a damp paper towel; larger mushrooms coarsely chopped, small ones left whole</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves; 4 crushed with a garlic press, 2 minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup best-quality canned tomato sauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups chicken stock or broth (more if using bomba rice)</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups short- to medium-grain rice (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_338">page 338</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a deep earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or a wide (12- to 14-inch diameter) flameproof casserole over low heat. Add the onions and red pepper and cook, stirring from time to time, until the pepper is very soft and the onions are beginning to reduce to a jamlike consistency, about 30 minutes (about as long as it takes to prepare the rabbit, sausages, and mushrooms in Step 2). As the vegetables cook, periodically add a little water to the pan when it looks dry.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the rabbit with salt and black pepper. Prick the sausages all over with a fork. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in two batches, cook the rabbit until nicely browned all over, about 10 minutes per batch, adding more olive oil if necessary. Transfer the rabbit to a large bowl, add the sausages to the skillet, and brown all over, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausages to the bowl with the rabbit. Cook the mushrooms in the fat from the sausages until they are lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to the bowl with the rabbit. (As you cook the meats and the mushrooms, keep an eye on the onion mixture.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Once the onions have cooked down, add the crushed garlic to them and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the wine, increase the heat to high, and cook until the liquid has reduced somewhat, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and sugar, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring, until the sauce is thickened, 5 to 7 minutes longer. (The onion mixture and the rabbit, sausages, and mushrooms can be prepared ahead up to this point and refrigerated, separately, for 6 hours.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ARROZ CREMOSO CON IDIAZABAL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Like the rest of the world, Spain has eagerly embraced Italian dishes, especially risotto, which is quite similar in texture to <em>caldoso</em>- or <em>meloso</em>-style soupy Spanish rice dishes. In the Basque Country, where tastes run to mild comfort food, a delicious risotto enriched with the local smoked Idiazábal cheese is one of the favorite restaurant staples. This recipe, from the Cuchara de San Telmo tapas bar in San Sebastián, is absolutely sensational—better than most of the risottos I have had in Italy. Sometimes, the chefs drizzle green herb oil and old balsamic vinegar on their tapas-scaled portions; on other occasions they add Catalan <em>allioli</em> for a garlicky kick. The dish is great as a first course or as a bed for seared scallops or other fish. If smoked Idiazábal cheese (see <a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_170">page 170</a>) is not available, substitute another smoked cheese, such as Gouda or mozzarella.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons syrupy aged balsamic vinegar, or ⅓ cup thin balsamic vinegar reduced over medium-high heat to 3 tablespoons</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a heavy wide 3-quart saucepan, over medium-low heat.

Increase the heat to medium, add the wine, and stir vigorously until the wine is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Add 3 cups of the simmering stock, about 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until each addition of liquid is absorbed.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the cream, smoked cheese, and Parmesan and stir vigorously until the cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.

This is one of my favorite pasta <em>cazuelas,</em> a dish I’ve been serving for years, always to raves. Once you’ve tried it, play around with the recipe, substituting diced potatoes for the beans, nuggets of pork sausage for the chorizo, mussels for the clams, and macaroni for the <em>fideos.</em> It tastes good every which way.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_354"/><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ROSSEJAT DE FIDEUS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever I ask Spanish friends for their favorite party recipe, they always mention a scrumptious Catalan and Valencian dish of toasted noodles cooked in a paella pan with some manner of seafood. This Catalan version gets a flavor boost from <em>sofregit</em>—a mixture of slowly cooked onions and tomatoes (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_357">page 357</a>). The dish uses small shrimp, which cook with the pasta until they’re very soft, and jumbo ones to decoratively top the noodles.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_355"/><strong>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1 pound fideo noodles or thin spaghetti, broken into 2-inch lengths</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely minced garlic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound small shrimp, shelled</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>Lemon wedges, for serving</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Toast the noodles: Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 15- or 16-inch paella pan or a very large skillet over medium heat. Add half the noodles and cook, stirring, until nicely browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Watch the noodles closely, as they tend to burn in no time. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the noodles to a large bowl, making sure none remain in the pan. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the pan and toast the remaining noodles in the same fashion, transferring them to the bowl when browned. Wipe the paella pan clean. (The noodles can also be toasted in a 425°F oven without oil: Just spread them on two large-rimmed baking sheets and toast them until nicely browned, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Either way, the noodles can be browned up to 1 day ahead and stored at room temperature, covered with aluminum foil.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the shrimp stock in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the saffron and keep at a simmer until ready to use.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in the paella pan over medium-high heat. Add half of the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the small shrimp and stir until they turn opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the <em>sofregit</em> and cook until it is warmed through. Add the toasted noodles and stir to coat with the pan mixture. Pour in 3 cups of the simmering stock, keeping the remaining stock simmering. Set the paella pan over two burners and stir in the parsley. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the noodles begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Periodically move and rotate the pan so that the liquid boils evenly. Add another 2 cups of the stock and continue cooking in the same fashion until most of the liquid is absorbed and the noodles are cooked but a little al dente, another 5 to 6 minutes. If the liquid is absorbed too fast and the noodles are still hard, add some or all of the remaining 1 cup stock. Transfer the paella pan to the oven and bake until the noodles are soft and the liquid in the pan is syrupy, 7 to 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> While the noodles are baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat.

Transfer the shrimp to a bowl and keep warm.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> When the noodles are done, change the oven setting to broil. Pass the noodles under the broiler until the noodles on top are lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Let the noodles stand for about 5 minutes. Arrange the jumbo shrimp decoratively over the noodles.

<p class="noindent"><em>Sofregit,</em> a Catalan <em>sofrito</em> of onions and tomatoes, is the perfect flavor base for many Spanish-Mediterranean dishes, especially rices. A real Catalan <em>sofregit</em> can be time-consuming, as the onions have to cook for hours to caramelize properly. After experimenting with various shortcuts, I arrived at a rather unconventional solution: adding a little dried onion flakes and sun-dried tomatoes to simulate the intense onion and tomato flavors without spending all day by the stove. The <em>sofregit</em> can be made ahead and will keep for up to a week. It will greatly enhance any paella recipe in this chapter.</p>

Add the tomato puree and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the <em>sofregit</em> is thickened and reduced, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.

<p class="sb-noindent">Could anything be more delicious than a seafood paella made with short-grained Valencian rice? Well, perhaps <em>fideuá,</em> the same dish prepared with noodles. Enjoyed all over the Levante and well beyond, <em>fideuá</em> is believed to have originated in the coastal resort of Gandía in Alicante. The myths of its invention are many. Some say that back in the 1960s, a fisherman aboard a trawler was getting ready to prepare a seafood paella and, upon discovering that he was out of rice, improvised with dried noodles. Others credit the creation of the dish to various chefs in Gandía, a city where <em>fideuá</em> is honored with an international competition each June. In truth, thin <em>fideo</em> noodles have been used along Spain’s Mediterranean coast since the Middle Ages, and the idea of combining them with local seafood is hardly original. In Catalonia and parts of Valencia, for example, one can feast on scrumptious pasta paellas prepared with toasted noodles and a strong flavorful <em>sofregit.</em> On Paseo Neptuno, a beach promenade in Valencia densely lined with seafood establishments, a restaurant called La Rosa prepares spectacular black <em>fideo</em> with squid and its ink. And on Spain’s northern Cantabrian coast, noodle and clam casseroles are a common treat. Just don’t mention this to folks in Gandía.</p>

<p class="noindent">This pasta dish combines three influences: the Spanish-Mediterranean pasta paella called <em>fideuá,</em> Italian spaghetti <em>alle vongole</em> (with clams), and superchef Ferran Adrià, who featured this recipe in his cookbook <em>Cocinar en Casa.</em> Adrià says that the clever idea of cooking pasta in a skillet with a flavorful liquid that it absorbs was suggested to him by Moreno Cedroni, a hyper-creative Italian chef (and himself an Adrià acolyte). Lightly toasted and full of marine flavors, the pasta is easy to make and compulsively edible.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_358"/><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 12 ounces fideo noodles or thin spaghetti, broken into large pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups bottled clam juice diluted with 1 cup water Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 dozen littleneck clams, scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="indentt">Heat the olive oil in a large deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add the noodles and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the diluted clam juice and bring to a boil. Season with salt to taste, cover the skillet, and cook until the pasta is barely al dente, about 8 minutes. Add the clams, nestling them into the pasta, cover the skillet, and cook until the pasta is al dente and the clams have opened, 4 to 7 minutes longer, adding a few tablespoons of water if the pasta looks dry. Discard any clams that haven’t opened, stir in the parsley, and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3k">INMA’S BAKED MACARONI</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MACARRONI CON SETAS Y MAGRO DE CERDO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Mercé Navarro and Inma Crosas are the chef-owners of Roig Robí, a great Barcelona restaurant and the source of several outstanding recipes in this book. Among other things, the restaurant is famous for Inma’s Monday special of baked macaroni laced with wild mushrooms and thin ribbons of pork. It’s a simple dish, but the bosky mushroom perfume makes it luxurious. The Italian pastas—macaroni and cannelloni—have been part of bourgeois Catalan cooking since the nineteenth century. Because it can be hard to find extremely aromatic wild mushrooms, I recommend adding dried porcini for depth of flavor. The dish can easily be prepared ahead and baked right before serving.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces boneless center-cut pork chops, cut into thin strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound assorted wild mushrooms or a mixture of wild and cultivated mushrooms (chanterelles, cèpes, morels, oyster, cremini, and/or portobellos), wiped clean with a damp paper towel; larger mushrooms coarsely chopped, small ones left whole</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large tomato, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skin discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup heavy (whipping) cream (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11_note4">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound penne pasta</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups grated Gruyère or Emmental cheese</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> If using the dried porcini mushrooms, soak them in 1 cup very hot water for 30 minutes. Drain, straining the soaking liquid through a sieve lined with a coffee filter or a paper towel, and set the liquid aside. Finely chop the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_359"/><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add half of the pork and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned pork to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and stir-fry the remaining pork the same way, then transfer it to the bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add 3 tablespoons olive oil and the chopped porcini, if using, to the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Add the fresh mushrooms, increase the heat to high, and cook until the mushrooms have released and reabsorbed their liquid and are lightly browned, about 7 minutes, adding a little more olive oil if the skillet looks dry. Add half of the garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer the mushrooms and garlic to the bowl with the pork. Wipe out the skillet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until very soft and light golden, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining garlic, stir for 1 minute, then add the tomato. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and ½ cup of the reserved mushroom soaking liquid, if using, or ½ cup more of cream and bring to a boil. Cook the sauce until it thickens a little, about 2 minutes. Add the sauce to the bowl with the mushrooms, stir to mix, and season generously with salt and pepper to taste. (The sauce can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead. Reheat it gently before tossing it with the pasta.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until tender but still slightly firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes less than the instructions on the package. Drain the pasta, then place it in a large mixing bowl. Add the mushroom sauce and half of the Gruyère and toss to coat evenly. Place the pasta in a lightly buttered 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish and sprinkle the remaining Gruyère and the Parmesan evenly over it. Bake until the top is browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes.

<h3 class="h3bro">CANNELLONI WITH SPINACH, RAISINS, AND PINE NUTS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CANELONS D’ESPINACS</strong></small></p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_360"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0361_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Cannelloni with Spinach, Raisins, and Pine Nuts</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Their origins might be Italian, but today cannelloni are something of a Catalan national dish. The cannelloni-eating tradition there goes back to the eighteenth century, when many restaurants in an increasingly worldly and bourgeois Barcelona hired Italian chefs. Eschewing the tomato sauce and ricotta of the Italian version, classic Catalan <em>canelons</em> can be filled with anything from seafood or salt cod, to ground roast meat, to the wildly popular spinach. Though I’ve used a touch of <em>jamón</em> in this recipe to enrich the filling, vegetarians can omit it. The best option for noodles is fresh egg pasta squares, which are available at many specialty food stores. Otherwise, you can use no-boil lasagna noodles; they will have somewhat different dimensions, but there won’t be that much difference in the overall shape of the cannelloni.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_361"/><strong>2 packages (each 10 ounces) fresh spinach, or 2 medium-size bunches spinach, coarse stems discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup pine nuts</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 to 8 tablespoons golden or dark raisins</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 ounces sliced serrano ham or prosciutto (optional), torn into slivers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3½ tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 squares (about 6 by 6 inches) fresh egg pasta, or 8 no-boil lasagna noodles (7 by 4 inches), without curly edges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rinse the spinach but do not drain it. Cook the spinach, covered, in a large saucepan over medium heat in the water clinging to its leaves until wilted, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring a few times. Transfer the spinach to a colander and drain. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the excess moisture by pressing small handfuls in your hands. Finely chop the spinach.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over low heat. Add the garlic, pine nuts, raisins, and ham, if using, and cook until the pine nuts and garlic are light golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chopped spinach and cook for about 1 minute, stirring to distribute all the ingredients evenly. Season the spinach with salt and pepper to taste, transfer it to a bowl, and set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Melt the butter with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy, medium-size saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking, for about 2 minutes. Add the milk in a steady stream, whisking, and bring to a boil over high heat, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Stir in the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set about ½ cup of the spinach mixture aside. To finish the filling, stir ⅔ cup of the sauce into the remaining spinach; set the rest of the sauce aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly butter a 12- by 9-inch gratin dish or a shallow ceramic baking dish.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Bring 5 to 6 quarts salted water to a boil over high heat. Place a large bowl of ice water next to the pot. Working in two batches, boil the sheets of pasta, stirring to separate them, until al dente, about 2 minutes for fresh pasta and about 6 minutes for no-boil lasagna noodles. Using tongs, transfer the noodles to the ice water to stop the cooking. Lift the noodles from the water, shaking off the excess, and lay them flat on dry linen kitchen towels. Repeat with the remaining pasta, bringing the water back to a rolling boil before adding the second batch. Pat the pasta dry with paper towels before filling it.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Place about ¼ cup of the spinach filling close to one end of a noodle (a long end, if you’re using lasagna noodles), shaping it into a compact log. Starting with a long end, roll up the noodle, then cut it in half crosswise. Place the filled noodles seam side down in the prepared gratin dish. Repeat with the remaining noodles and filling. The filled noodles should fit in the dish snugly and in a single layer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_362"/><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Stir the reserved ½ cup of spinach (and any of the filling that you might have leftover) into the reserved sauce and spread evenly over the cannelloni. Sprinkle the cheese evenly on top. Bake the cannelloni until they are hot and the top is browned and bubbly, about 25 minutes. If you’d like the top to be more browned, pass the dish under the broiler for a few minutes. Let the cannelloni cool for a few minutes, then serve them straight from the baking dish. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 AS A FIRST COURSE, 4 AS A MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3k">DAY-AFTER-CHRISTMAS CANNELLONI</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CANELONS DE CARN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">It’s December 26 and Catalans are still feasting, gathering around the table again for Sant Esteve. The centerpiece of the saint’s day meal are these luscious cannelloni, filled with the ground meat of the <em>rostit</em> (roast) and <em>escudella</em> (multimeat boiled dinner) left over from the festivities of the previous two days. Although I’ve given instructions for making the roast meat filling from scratch—it takes some time but not much work—you can certainly improvise with your own holiday leftovers. Use four to five cups of leftover roast or stewed pork, roast turkey, or skinned rotisserie chicken, mixed with one sautéed onion and a few sautéed chicken livers and some beef or chicken broth to moisten it. Grind everything together as directed in Step 3. When making the béchamel sauce, use two full cups of milk.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 medium-size bone-in, skinless chicken thighs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 to 10 ounces veal shoulder or beef chuck, cubed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 to 10 ounces pork shoulder, cubed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, peeled and lightly smashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size tomato, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup medium-dry sherry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 3 cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large chicken livers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1 cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3½ tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 squares (about 6 by 6 inches) fresh egg pasta, or 8 (7 by 4 inches) no-boil lasagna noodles without curly edges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Make the filling: Place the chicken, veal, and pork in a medium-size roasting pan, rub them with salt and pepper, and toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Roast until the meats begin to brown, about 45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Add the onion, garlic, and tomato and roast for another 15 minutes. Add the sherry and ½ cup of the chicken stock to the pan, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F, and continue roasting, stirring occasionally, until the meats are very tender, about 15 minutes longer for the chicken and about 1¼ hours for the veal and the pork (remove the chicken and set it aside while the veal and pork finish roasting). As the meats roast, periodically add a few tablespoons of stock to the pan. After the meats have roasted for a total of 1 hour and 55 minutes, stir in the <a id="page_363"/>chicken livers. (The chicken livers should roast during the last 20 minutes of the meats’ roasting time.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Remove the meat from the oven, add 1 cup of the chicken stock to the roasting pan, and scrape the brown bits off the bottom. Strain the meats, reserving the pan juices separately. When the meats are cool enough to handle, grind them medium-fine in a food processor together with the chicken thighs and ¼ cup of the chicken stock. Season the filling with salt and pepper to taste. (The filling can be prepared up to a day ahead to this point; refrigerate it, covered.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Measure the pan juices and add enough milk to make 2 cups total. Melt the butter with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy, medium-size saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking, for about 2 minutes. Add the pan juice and milk mixture in a steady stream, whisking, and bring to a boil over high heat, continuing to whisk. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then set the sauce aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly butter a 12-by 9-inch gratin dish or shallow ceramic baking dish.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Bring 5 to 6 quarts salted water to a boil. Place a large bowl of ice water next to the pot.

Repeat with the remaining pasta, bringing the water back to a rolling boil before adding the second batch. Pat the pasta dry with paper towels before filling it.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sauce to the meat filling, plus a couple of tablespoons of chicken stock if it doesn’t seem moist enough. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and/or pepper as necessary. Place about ¼ cup of the filling close to one end of a noodle, shaping it into a compact log. Starting with a long end, roll up the noodle, then cut it in half crosswise. Place the filled noodle seam side down in the prepared gratin dish. Repeat with the remaining noodles and filling.

<h3 class="h3bro">LAMB AND VEGETABLE COUSCOUS FROM POLOP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CUSCUS DE POLOP</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">From historic references we know that <em>al-cuzcuz</em> was quite common in Andalusia during the Muslim rule. After the Moors were expelled in the fifteenth century and the country was thoroughly Catholicized, couscous seems to have disappeared <a id="page_364"/>from Spanish cuisine. In a book dedicated to the cuisine of Alicante, my friend Angeles Ruiz includes the following couscous recipe from the town of Polop. In the early twentieth century, Angeles says, Polop’s inhabitants spent half the year working in Tunisia and Algiers (which are just a short ferry ride away), bringing recipes back and incorporating them into the cuisine—a delicious example of modern Spanish–North African fusion.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1</strong>½<strong>-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sweet (not smoked) paprika, plus more for rubbing on the lamb</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large onions, quartered and sliced</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size turnips or boiling potatoes, peeled and quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 fat celery ribs, cut into 2-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size artichokes, pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_370">page 370</a>) and quartered, or 1½ cups frozen artichoke hearts, thawed</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the lamb in a large bowl and rub it generously with salt, black pepper, and paprika. Heat the butter and olive oil in a large, heavy stockpot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the lamb and cook, stirring, until it is very lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, thyme, cumin, cayenne, saffron, parsley, and 10 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat, skimming. Season with salt and pepper to taste and more cayenne, if desired.

<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_365"/><small>STEAMED COUSCOUS</small></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CUSCUS TRADICIONAL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">To prepare couscous the authentic way, first you moisten the dried (long-cooking) semolina pellets with water, letting them swell. Then you rake and rub them with your fingers to get rid of lumps. The couscous is steamed, then the whole process is repeated. Although it sounds complicated and time-consuming, it isn’t. Making couscous is one of my favorite kitchen chores, and the results are so marvelous you’ll find it hard to go back to instant couscous again.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 cups (1½ pounds) fine or medium couscous (not instant), preferably sold loose at a Middle Eastern specialty food store</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, as needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the couscous in a fine sieve. Place the sieve under cold running water and thoroughly wet the couscous. Spread it out in a very large rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan and let stand until it absorbs the moisture, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Evenly sprinkle about 2 tablespoons olive oil over the couscous and work the oil into the grains with your fingers. Take a small handful of grains and rub them between your thumb and two middle fingers to get rid of all the little lumps. Let the grains drop back into the baking sheet, repeating with the remaining couscous. Alternatively, you can work over a bowl to give yourself more space and keep track of what’s been raked through.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Using an oiled paper towel, oil the perforated top of a large, wide steamer. Pour water to a depth of 4 to 5 inches in the steamer bottom and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. If there is a lot of steam escaping through the seam between the top and bottom of the steamer, wrap it with aluminum foil. When a good deal of steam starts rising, transfer the couscous to the top of the steamer (don’t worry, it won’t fall through the steamer holes). Steam the couscous, uncovered, for 15 to 18 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Return the couscous to the baking sheet and spread it out again, breaking up the lumps with a fork. Let the couscous cool just until you can handle it. Place 1½ cups water in a measuring cup and stir in the salt. Gradually sprinkle the salted water evenly over the couscous, working the water in with your fingers. Spread the couscous out again and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Oil your hands and repeat the raking procedure in Step 2 but don’t add any more olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Repeat the steaming process, letting the couscous cook for about 20 minutes. The grain will be fluffy and separated and taste slightly al dente compared to instant couscous. Turn off the heat, leaving the couscous in the steamer, and carefully stir in the butter, using a fork to break up any lumps that might have formed. (The couscous can be steamed once and raked up to 6 hours ahead. Let it sit, uncovered, at room temperature until continuing with Step 5.) <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">SLOW DOWN</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">If you are only familiar with quick-cooking couscous from a box, I urge you to try couscous made the traditional way: prepared with loose couscous, soaked, raked by hand, and steamed twice. The process is soothing and pleasurable, and the results are a hundred times lighter and fluffier than the instant kind. To time the dish properly, make sure to read the couscous recipe before you begin cooking. If you’re making instant couscous from a box, use two and a half cups and cook it according to the instructions on the package. To make it tastier, you can use half water and half broth from the stew for the liquid.</p>
