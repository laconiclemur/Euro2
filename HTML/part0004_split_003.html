			<p class="rec-intro">This is my take on dim sum and uses a different sort of pasta dough to the normal kind. You can make the ravioli any shape you like, but they must contain the filling effectively and be well sealed, as they are fried briefly before serving. </p>

			<p class="serves">serves 4</p>
			<p class="for-the">Pasta dough</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g plain white flour </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">75g free-range egg whites </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g warm water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp olive oil </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of salt</p>
			<p class="for-the">Filling</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 large scallops (white meat only)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 x 500g cooked lobster </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">Sauce</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 sprigs of marjoram </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">120ml dry white wine </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 sundried tomatoes (not in oil), chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500ml lobster stock (see <a href="part0010_split_009.html#Lobster-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cubed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">Garnish</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and diced </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">marjoram leaves</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">First make the pasta dough. Put the flour in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients and knead to make an elastic, but not sticky, dough. Leave the dough to rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes, then roll it out on the ‘0’ setting on a pasta machine. </p>
			<p class="body">Chop the scallops into 3mm dice. Break up the lobster, cutting the tail into quarters for the garnish. Extract all the rest of the lobster meat and cut into 5mm dice, then mix with the diced scallops and season with salt and a generous amount of pepper. </p>
			<p class="body">The shape of the ravioli is up to you, but the simplest method is to cut the pasta dough into 24 circles of about 6cm in diameter. Divide the scallop and lobster filling between 12 of the circles. Brush the borders with water to moisten, then top with the remaining circles and press down well around the edges to seal. </p>
			<p class="body">Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the ravioli and cook for 4 minutes. Remove the ravioli and plunge them into iced water to stop them cooking, then carefully drain and dry on a cloth and lightly drizzle them with olive oil. Keep the ravioli refrigerated until needed. </p>
			<p class="body">For the sauce, put the shallots, garlic and marjoram in a pan with the white wine and boil until the liquid has almost completely evaporated. Add the sundried tomatoes and lobster stock, then bring to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve, then pour it back into the pan, season and finish with the cold butter to thicken and shine. Keep the sauce warm while you finish the ravioli.</p>
			<p class="body">Pan-fry the ravioli in a hot non-stick pan until golden on both sides and hot inside. Serve in warm bowls with the piping hot sauce and garnish with diced tomatoes and lobster claws and a few marjoram leaves. </p>
