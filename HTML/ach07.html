<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pasta fritta</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Most people have never heard of fried pasta, but once you’ve tasted it, you’ll be addicted. It’s usually made with leftover plain pasta, but it may be prepared with freshly boiled pasta. The Tucci side of the family traditionally fried linguine, until Stan’s sister Rosalinda experimented with frying penne and ditalini and found that they were equally delicious. Now our new favorite pasta for frying is orecchiette. Fried pasta may be prepared as a lunch dish, served with a tossed green salad, or as an irresistible appetizer before dinner, accompanied by a glass of wine.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound linguine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil. Add salt and the linguine. Cook according to the package instructions. Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil in a large frying pan set over medium heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add enough pasta to form a thin layer, spreading it out to fill the pan. (When frying smaller quantities of pasta, reduce the amount of oil proportionately.) Fry the pasta until it is evenly browned and sticking together as a solid piece, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the pasta and continue cooking to evenly brown the other side, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a cutting board or serving dish. Season with salt. Cut the pasta into wedges with a pizza cutter or a sharp knife. Serve immediately. Repeat with any remaining pasta.</p>
