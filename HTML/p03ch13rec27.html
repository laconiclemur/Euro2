<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Thin pancakes like French crepes are a specialty of Asturias, as well as of Galicia, where they are called</span> filloas. <span class="italic">They are commonly served folded and dusted with confectioners’ sugar and cinnamon, or drizzled with honey or liqueur, or topped with whipped cream. This version, stuffed with apple puree, is absolutely delicious and elegant to serve. Reineta apples are used in Asturias, but Golden Delicious can be substituted. Calvados is equivalent to the apple brandy made in the region. I add rather a lot to the filling—you can use less. Another equally wonderful version of the same crepes stuffed with custard follows on page 545.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The crepes can be made in advance, even a day before, and kept, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE 7½-INCH CREPES</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CREPES</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups water</p>
<p class="qun">2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon olive or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="qun1">1 tablespoon Calvados or brandy</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds Golden Delicious apples</p>
<p class="qun">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup Calvados or other apple brandy, or to taste</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">TO FINISH</span></p>
<p class="qun">Sunflower or vegetable oil</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup Calvados or other apple brandy</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">For the crepes, put the flour in a large bowl. Gradually add the milk and water, beating vigorously with an electric mixer. Add the eggs, salt, oil, and Calvados or brandy and beat until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the filling, peel, core, and quarter the apples, dropping them in a bowl of water with lemon juice as you go, to prevent them from discoloring.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Drain the apples, put them in a saucepan with 4 to 5 tablespoons water, cover tightly, and cook over very low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until the apples fall apart. Then cook, uncovered, until much of the liquid has evaporated. Mash the apples with a potato masher, then add the sugar and Calvados or brandy and stir until the sugar has dissolved.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To cook the crepes, heat a nonstick skillet with a bottom diameter of about 7½ inches over medium heat, and grease with oil, using a folded paper towel. Stir the batter well and pour about 2 tablespoonfuls into the skillet, tilting the pan quickly until its entire bottom surface is covered; the crepe will be thin. When it releases from the pan and the bottom is lightly browned, turn it over with a large spatula (or with your fingers) and cook for a moment only on the other side, until it releases from the pan. Transfer to a plate. Continue this process until all the batter is used up, rubbing the pan with oil each time and stacking the crepes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To fill the crepes, put a slightly heaped tablespoon of filling in a line across the bottom of each crepe and roll it up. Place the stuffed crepes, seam side down, in two large buttered baking dishes. Finish by sprinkling a little Calvados and a little sugar over each.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat through in a preheated 400°F oven for 10 to 20 minutes. I like them when they are very slightly crisp.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">For large crepes, use a 9-inch nonstick skillet and pour in about ¼ cup batter for each one.</p>
