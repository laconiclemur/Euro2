    and Equipment</span></em></h1>

    <p class="nonindent">My kitchen I love, but would recommend to no one else. It contains more equipment and fewer conveniences than most home kitchens, and the organization of space is totally impractical. The largest room in the house, it is the one in which I live, work, cook and receive.</p>

    <p class="indent">Weather permitting, meals are served out of doors, but during a good half of the year the dining table automatically finds its place before the immense fireplace, which dominates the room and is the only source of heat. Before it, all roasts are turned on a spit; in it, meats, fish and vegetables are grilled. Buried in its ashes, such vegetables as potatoes, beets and eggplant are baked, and often an earthenware pot is half buried in the ashes to pass the night. From time to time, when intense heating is not necessary, I climb to the rooftop and suspend a marinated, rolled boar’s belly or other delicacy in the chimney to be smoked, and over a period of several days I regularly nourish the smoldering olive wood with bundles of rosemary.</p>

    <p class="indent">Beside the fireplace is a small professional cookstove. Its top is a cast-iron plate heated from beneath by a system of gas flames and refractory bricks, permitting one to move pans all over the surface, exactly as with old-fashioned wood- or coal-burning cookstoves, in order to find the precise degree of heat desired. To the side are two open gas flames, and the oven, deep, solid and hermetic, is also heated on the same principle as that of the old-fashioned cookstove. The flames are beneath, but the heat is circulated through hollow walls that encircle the oven.</p>

    <p class="center"><a id="page52"></a><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_004_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">MY KITCHEN FIREPLACE</span></p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page53"></a>The work table, chopping boards and refrigerator—alas—are at the other side of the room, the heart of which is blocked by the dining table and, worse still, beyond the table, by a huge and encumbering pillar that supports the main beam of the room. Despite the size of the room, space is lacking. Earthenware casseroles are piled seven or eight deep, the mantel of the fireplace is hung heavy with omelet and crêpe pans, the copper pans, for lack of a better place, are hung the length of the room, including above the stove (which prompts rapid tarnishing), the soup tureens and sauceboats are kept on shelves so high that a ladder is necessary to reach them, and the largest of the marble mortars, far too heavy to be easily displaced, has never found a permanent place and needs constantly to be shifted.</p>

    <p class="indent">The following suggestions, then, often represent, in terms of organization, that which my kitchen lacks and which I miss bitterly. As to small equipment, I have contented myself with describing a selection from my own kitchen, excluding those articles common to all kitchens.</p>

    <p class="indent">A kitchen should be as spacious and as light as circumstances permit. A basic work table or surface and a chopping board should ideally be placed between the sink and the stove, but should, in any case, be as near to the stove as possible. The surface of the chopping board should be at such a level that, standing before it, one may without either straining or bending one’s elbows easily place one’s hands flat on it (thus, the height of the table should be conditioned to the individual who will most often be working in the kitchen). Most table tops and chopping boards are too high, and one’s work is consequently less efficient and more tiring.</p>

    <p class="indent">Electric ovens, well regulated, are very good for pastries, slow gratins and so-called casserole dishes, and ideal for the many preparations that require a very slow cooking process over a period of many hours. They are suitable for roasts, though I prefer a spit before an open fire. For rapid gratins and grilled meats they are less than satisfactory. As to cooking on top of the stove, I personally find electricity impracticable. A naked gas flame is imperfect, but with the use of asbestos pads and other insulating devices one can arrive at a fairly delicate regulation. A small professional or semiprofessional gas cookstove, similar to that described above, is, to my way of thinking, the most satisfactory solution. A system, whether it be incorporated into the <a id="page54"></a>stove or apart, of intense overhead heat for rapid gratins and glazing is useful. The broiler common to most American household stoves never gives a sufficiently intense heat for glazing. There should be some arrangement for heating plates.</p>

    <p class="indent">In most home kitchens a fireplace such as mine is out of the question. Nevertheless, a small fireplace built into the wall at tabletop or stovetop level is altogether conceivable in a modern kitchen. Several of my friends have built such fireplaces in their kitchens, and others, impressed by the simplicity and the practicality of the arrangement, are in the process of doing so. They are people who are not city dwellers but live in comfortable, centrally heated houses equipped with small modern kitchens, and who, unlike myself, have no desire to recapture living patterns of the past with an of the attendant discomforts. They simply understand that the superiority of a roast on a turnspit before an open fire or of fish and meats grilled over fruitwood embers is pertinently real and not merely part of a past mythology.</p>

    <p class="indent">Such a fireplace should be large enough to contain a small grill or to permit a spitted chicken or leg of lamb to be turned before it. An opening 25 inches wide by 20 inches high with a depth of 20 inches is sufficient. A platform approximately 15 to 18 inches deep—large enough to easily support the turnspit (<em>tournebroche</em>) and dripping pan (<em>lèchefrite</em>)—should extend outward from the fireplace floor. The corresponding space beneath the fireplace is used for storing wood.</p>

    <p class="indent">Accompanying equipment (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf4_r1.htm#page67">Shopping Sources</a>) should include: a heavy <span class="small">WELDED-IRON GRILL</span> for meats and poultry, a large <span class="small">DOUBLE-FACED GRILL</span> of heavy hinged steel wire for small fish, and <a id="page55"></a><a id="page56"></a>a <span class="small">SPECIAL DOUBLE-FACED GRILL</span>, oval and swelled in shape, for large fish, a <span class="small">TURNSPIT</span> (the most practical are electrically operated), a selection of <span class="small">SPITS</span>, and a <span class="small">DRIPPING PAN</span> designed to be placed beneath the roast to collect the drippings with which it is basted and from which the sauce or juices are prepared. It should be of a heavy material—steel or cast iron rather than the flimsy, tinned affair most often found on the market. I have opted for a huge steel frying pan—a large skillet, propped slightly higher at the fire side with a fragment of brick or stone, will do.</p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">MODERN VERSION OF KITCHEN FIREPLACE</span></p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">SMALL EQUIPMENT</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">The <span class="small">CHOPPING BOARD</span> should be large (2½ by 3 feet is a good size), thick (1½ to 2 inches), absolutely flat, and unjointed. It should have its place near the stove and always be in place. It should be kept impeccably clean and occasionally scraped. A butcher’s chopping block is a handsome object but expensive, and must be bought new or its surface will not be flat. Small boards are impractical, except for serving cheese or cutting sausage, and frustrating.</p>

    <p class="indent">One should have at least six or seven good razor-sharp knives (the single most exasperating thing about most kitchens is that they almost never contain a single knife that cuts): a couple of small <span class="small">PARING KNIVES</span> (<em>couteaux d’office</em>), a <span class="small">BONING KNIFE</span> (<em>couteau à désosser</em>), a medium-sized knife for fine slicing (<em>couteau à émincer</em>), at least one of those knives commonly called <span class="small">FRENCH CHEF’S KNIVES</span> with a blade approximately 10 inches long (<em>couteau à hacher</em>), one larger of the same form, and a long, narrow <span class="small">CARVING KNIFE</span> (<em>couteau à trancher</em>). A <span class="small">SHARPENING STEEL</span> should be kept in place near the knives so that it becomes an automatic thing to sharpen knives regularly as one uses them. The most practical place to keep the knives is in a rack behind one’s work table so that they are constantly in view and at hand and do not risk being rubbed against. Magnetic knife racks are dangerous and impractical. Knives should be rinsed or merely wiped clean as one uses them, then replaced in the rack. Until recently, stainless steel knives were generally flimsy and impossible to sharpen, and most cookbooks rightly discouraged their use, but it is now possible to find <a id="page57"></a>good, solid stainless steel knives that take well to sharpening, are much easier than carbon steel to keep clean, and do not blacken certain foods (notably artichokes) on contact as do the carbon steel knives. Good professional knives under the brand “Sabatier-Trumpet” and described as “full-forged stainless steel” are available in America.</p>

    <p class="right1"><span class="color">SHARPENING STEEL</span></p>

    <p class="indent">A good, heavy pair of <span class="small">KITCHEN SHEARS</span> is necessary for preparing fish and often useful for cutting poultry.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page58"></a>Nothing can replace heavy tinned <span class="small">COPPERWARE</span> in a kitchen, and certain preparations can never be successfully realized without it. But note that copper should not be used on electric stove tops. The best—made for professional use—has heavy iron handles. The brass-handled articles are always lighter in weight and comparatively more expensive. A good selection would be: a <em>sauteuse</em> (sometimes called <em>plat à sauter</em>), a saucepan with low, straight sides, large enough to hold a cut-up chicken at ease (approximately 12 inches in diameter); a <em>sautoir</em>–to confuse things, this is sometimes also called a <em>sauteuse</em> (slanting sides, higher than a <em>sauteuse</em>), somewhat smaller; at least four more saucepans (casseroles) of varying sizes; and an oval <em>cocotte</em> with a tight-fitting lid, large enough to contain a trussed chicken. Copper is not difficult to clean (in any case it is the substance itself, <a id="page59"></a>and not its exterior appearance, that renders it useful). When copper utensils are rubbed on the outside with an abrasive cleaning pad and scouring powder each time they are washed, they retain their clean, mat copper color—it is only when copper is not used regularly that it becomes tarnished and unsightly. There are copper-cleaning products on the market that work rapidly and easily and do no harm to the utensils; for those interested, a home recipe, a paste made of a couple of cups of marble dust, an egg white, about <span class="frac_num">3</span>/<span class="frac_den">4</span> cup of flour, <span class="frac_num">1</span>/<span class="frac_den">3</span> cup vinegar, and a handful of salt, may be prepared and kept indefinitely in a sealed container. Copper occasionally must be retinned, although for rapid sautés tinning that has gone thin will do no harm. When a copper pot contains liquids, the flame may be quite high, but for frying or sautéing the heat must not be too intense or the tin will melt.</p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">HEAVY TIN-LINED COPPERWARE</span></p>

    <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_014_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">EARTHENWARE</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Though many serious cooks are able to do without <span class="small">EARTHENWARE</span>, and even disapprove of it on the grounds that it retains odors, I find it indispensable, particularly for the many rustic dishes that require many hours of slow, even cooking. These dishes are never quite so good prepared in anything else, for no other material takes the heat and holds the heat in quite the same way. Over a gas flame, earthenware <a id="page60"></a>should always be protected by an asbestos or other insulating pad. New earthenware should be rubbed inside and out with garlic, filled with water and left to boil for several hours. Earthen <em>poêlons</em>, low, wide, and round in form, with bulging sides, find many uses, and an oval <em>cocotte</em> of 4- to 5-quart capacity with a closely fitting lid is particularly valuable.</p>

    <p class="indent">Although hardly an article of daily use, a <span class="small">FISH COOKER</span> (<em>poissonière</em>) and its accompanying <span class="small">TRIVET</span> are essential to poach and properly pre-sent a large fish. It may be used as well for braising whole fish, whole stuffed rabbits, hares, etc. It need not be of copper.</p>

    <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_015_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">FISH COOKER</span></p>

    <p class="indent">A large <span class="small">IRON SKILLET</span> is useful, and heavy steel <span class="small">OMELET</span> and <span class="small">CREPE PANS</span> (the latter have very low, sharply slanting sides) are indispensable. When new, these should be seasoned by heating cooking oil in them over an intense heat until the metal darkens and turns bluish in color, then emptied and wiped with a dry cloth. Omelet and crêpe pans may be used interchangeably or for semi-deep-frys or any other preparation that involves no addition of liquid and does not risk sticking to the pan. After use, they should be wiped out with a dry cloth—never washed. Nothing will stick to them if they are properly treated, but should they suffer mistreatment, wash them in warm soapy water with an abrasive pad or fine steel wool, rinse well, dry them with a cloth, then heat over a high flame and rub well with an oiled cloth.</p>

    <p class="center"><a id="page61"></a><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_016_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Aluminum is all right for boiling water but will discolor certain vegetables—celeriac and artichoke hearts for instance—whereas stainless steel does not. Heavy <span class="small">CAST-IRON ENAMELWARE</span> is very serviceable but should never be used for sautéing or frying, for the surface does not allow the proper kind of caramelization. Terrines, oven casseroles and gratin dishes of enameled ironware are good, although porcelain or earthenware are more attractive. Nothing is more practical than a <em>marmite</em> or <em>pot-au-feu</em> in this material. A 10- or 12-quart vessel of this sort is necessary and a smaller one useful.</p>

    <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_017_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">CAST-IRON ENAMELWARE</span></p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page62"></a>One should have <span class="small">WOODEN BOARDS</span> cut to the dimensions of those terrines destined to be used for pâtés, so that the pâtés can cool under a weighted board.</p>

    <p class="indent">Two <span class="small">MARBLE MORTARS</span>, one with an interior diameter of approximately 12 inches for pounding forcemeats, and one about half that size which serves multiple purposes (reducing dried herbs to powder, making bread crumbs rapidly, preparing stuffings and forcemeats in small quantity, etc.). The pestle for the larger one has, classically, a head on either end.</p>

    <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_018_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">MARBLE MORTAR AND PESTLE</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Also essential are:</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="small">WOODEN SPOONS</span> and <span class="small">WOODEN PESTLES</span>, one of which, the <em>champignon</em> (mushroom-shaped), is particularly useful, for its form fits exactly to that of a rounded screen sieve.</p>

    <p class="indent">Several <span class="small">SCREEN SIEVES</span> (<em>passoires</em>) of different dimensions, rounded and conical (the latter are called <em>chinois</em>) and <span class="small">NYLON DRUM SIEVES</span> (<em>tamis</em>). These sieves were formerly woven of horsehair, but nylon is better, because horsehair had a tendency to shed fragments into the food. Nylon drum sieves are useful for passing raspberries and other acid fruits that suffer from contact with metal, and are essential for the passing of fine forcemeats. <a id="prf3.5"></a>A <span class="small">FLEXIBLE</span>, <span class="small">OVAL PLASTIC DISK</span> (<em>corne</em>, so called because in the past it was made of horn), about five inches across (to be held between the thumb and the four fingers and scraped <a id="page63"></a>firmly and flatly against the sieve) is needed for passing material through a drum sieve—pestles are not only ineffectual but hard on the sieve.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="small">WIRE WHISKS</span> for sauces and beating egg whites, and an <span class="small">UNTINNED COPPER BASIN</span>, in which egg whites mount more firmly and with greater volume.</p>

    <p class="indent">A <span class="small">VEGETABLE MILL</span> (<em>moulinette</em>) for passing soups, puréeing vegetables, and making rough purées to facilitate their final passage through the <em>tamis</em>, and a <em>mouli-julienne</em>, a small, simple and miraculous machine with several changeable blades for reducing raw vegetables into anything from thread-sized julienne strips to fine slices. It may also be used for grating cheese.</p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">VEGETABLE MILLS</span></p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page64"></a>A <span class="small">MEAT-GRINDER</span>.</p>

    <p class="indent">A selection of <span class="small">MOLDS</span> including <span class="small">SAVARIN</span> (a low, round mold with a thick central tube), <span class="small">JELLY</span> (small, high mold, generally with a geometric surface décor and a narrow central tube), <span class="small">CHARLOTTE</span> (a simple round, flat-bottomed mold, the bottom of which is slightly smaller in circumference than the top), and <span class="small">DOME</span> (or, lacking that, a <span class="small">ROUNDBOTTOMED</span>, <span class="small">TIN-LINED METAL BOWL</span>, <em>cul de poule</em>, designed for pastry cooks).</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page65"></a>A <span class="small">LARGE WIRE SKIMMING SPOON</span> (<em>araignée</em>), useful for lifting anything out of liquid and better than a wire basket for deep frying, for not only does the basket take up needed space in the frying basin, but articles dipped in batter often stick to it and their browned surfaces are torn open in turning them.</p>

    <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_022_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">WIRE SKIMMING SPOON</span></p>

    <p class="figure"><span class="color">LARDING NEEDLE</span></p>

    <p class="indent">A <span class="small">ROUND WIRE GRILL</span> for steamed vegetables and <span class="small">WIRE PASTRY GRILLS</span>.</p>

    <p class="indent" id="prf3.12"><em>Manche à gigot</em>, a handle designed to be screwed or clamped onto the leg bone of a leg of lamb (or venison). Without it, a leg of lamb cannot be correctly carved at table.</p>

    <p class="indent">A <span class="small">MARBLE SLAB</span> for rolling out pastry is attractive and useful in a large kitchen, but in this refrigerated age perhaps no longer indispensable.</p>

    <p class="center"><a id="page66"></a><img alt="" src="../Images/Olne_9781607740155_epub_024_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="indent">A classic pastry-cook’s <span class="small">ROLLING PIN</span>, without handles, which is longer and thinner than the standard American type and, once one is accustomed to it, more convenient.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="small">SALAD BASKET</span>, <span class="small">GRATERS</span> for cheese, nutmeg, etc., <span class="small">BRUSHES</span> for buttering, basting, brushing pastry with egg, etc., <span class="small">SKEWERS</span>, <span class="small">LADLES</span>, <span class="small">LONG-HANDLED FORKS</span>, <span class="small">COFFEE-GRINDER</span>, <span class="small">PEPPER GRINDERS</span>, and lots of <span class="small">TOWELS</span> and <span class="small">PAPER TOWELS</span>.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="small">ELECTRIC MIXERS</span> and <span class="small">BLENDERS</span> are certainly useful and energy-saving, but they cannot, as many people believe, do everything, and should be used only if the quality of the preparation will in no way suffer as a result.</p>
