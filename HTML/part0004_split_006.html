			<p class="serves">Serves 4 as a starter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2kg mussels</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 sprig of thyme</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250ml dry white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 free-range egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100ml lobster stock (see <a href="part0010_split_009.html#Lobster-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and deseeded</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Wash the mussels and scrub them well. Warm a little oil in a large pan, add the shallots and cook them gently for a few moments. Add the thyme and crushed garlic, then the mussels and pour in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and cook until all the mussels have opened, shaking the pan once or twice to toss them around. </p>
			<p class="body">Drain the mussels and set them aside, making sure you collect all the cooking juices – you should have about 300ml. Heat the cream and add the mussel cooking liquor, then take the pan off the heat and whisk in the whole eggs and the egg yolks. Pass this mixture through a fine sieve, check the seasoning, then pour it into 4 ramekins or similar heatproof dishes. Put these in a steamer over boiling water to cook for 10–15 minutes or until just set – they should be firm, like a crème brûlée. Alternatively, place the dishes in a roasting tin, pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up their sides and bake in a preheated oven, at 160°C/Fan 140°C/Gas 3, for about 20 minutes or until set. </p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, heat the lobster stock in a pan until reduced by half. Pick the mussels from the shells and cut the tomatoes into neat strips or petals. When the flans are cooked, arrange some mussels and pieces of tomato on the top of each dish and pour on the warm lobster stock. </p>
