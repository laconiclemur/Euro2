<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">In Catalonia the most common</span> coca, <span class="italic">which is sold in bakeries, has a thin bread-dough base and a topping of roasted peppers and eggplants (the region’s beloved</span> escalivada<span class="italic">; see page 243) and onions and tomatoes. They say this</span> coca <span class="italic">was born in the area of Lleida and Tarragona. It is eaten cold (I like it hot too).</span> De recapte <span class="italic">here means “what you have in stock,” because you can add the kind of things that are normally on hand in the Catalan kitchen—see the variations.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 8 AS A STARTER; 2 AS A MAIN DISH</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE DOUGH</span></p>
<p class="qun">2¾ cups bread flour, or as needed</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 teaspoons active dry yeast</p>
<p class="qun">About ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water</p>
<p class="qun">¼ teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE TOPPING</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 eggplants (about 1 to 1½ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun">3 red bell peppers</p>
<p class="qun">2 large onions, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the flour in a large bowl and sprinkle in the salt and oil. Put the yeast in a measuring cup with about ½ cup of the warm water and the sugar and stir well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When the yeast mixture begins to froth, pour it into the flour, then very gradually pour in the remaining warm water, adding only just enough to make a soft ball that sticks together, stirring it in first with a fork, then working it with your hands.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Knead the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes, adding more water by the tablespoon if it is too dry or a little flour if it is too sticky, until smooth and elastic. Grease the bowl with about ½ tablespoon oil, then turn the dough in it, coating it well with oil, so that a crust will not form when it rises. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled in volume.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the topping, put the eggplants and peppers on a sheet of foil on a baking sheet, and prick the eggplants in a few places with a pointed knife. Put the tray in a preheated 350°F oven and bake, turning once, until the peppers are soft and the skins have blistered and the eggplants are soft, 30 to 45 minutes (the eggplants will take quite a bit longer than the peppers).</p>
<p class="recsum1">While the peppers and eggplants are in the oven, fry the onions in 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet, covered to begin with, stirring often until soft. Add the tomatoes, sugar, and some salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When the peppers are soft, put them in 1 or 2 sturdy plastic bags, and twist to seal them. Leave them for about 10 minutes to steam and cool. Pull off the skin from the peppers, remove the stems and seeds, and cut the peppers into ½- to ¾-inch squares.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Peel the eggplants, put them in a colander, and press slightly to let the juices drain away. Then cut them into similar-size pieces. Mix the eggplants and peppers together and toss with salt to taste and the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil so that they are well coated.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Brush two large baking sheets with oil. Punch the risen dough down and knead for a couple of minutes. Divide it into 2 balls. Roll each one out on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin into an oblong or oval about 11 by 15 inches. Lift up each sheet of dough by wrapping it around the rolling pin and unwrapping it onto a baking sheet.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Spread the onion and tomato sauce evenly over the dough, then dot with the peppers and eggplants.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bake on the upper and lower racks of a preheated 350°F oven, switching the position of the baking sheets halfway through, for about 30 minutes, or until the edges of the crust are crisp and brown. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into 4 or 8 pieces.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Cut the vegetables into ¾-inch-wide strips instead of into squares or pieces.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Spread among the vegetables a can of anchovy fillets in oil, or of tuna or sardines, drained and broken into pieces, before baking.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Add 8 fresh pork sausages, lightly fried and cut into slices, to the topping.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Add about 12 slices bacon, cut into strips and lightly fried.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Add 1 pound mushrooms, sliced and briefly sautéed in oil.</p>
