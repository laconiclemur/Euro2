<h1 class="cs">Any Questions?</h1>
<p class="pf">I have just completed a cooking demonstration, maybe on holiday baking or on the many ways to use rhubarb or some other item of current interest. I’ve mixed, chopped, cleaned, sautéed, and measured, explaining the function of each ingredient and the techniques I find work best. I’ve led others through the process, we share ideas, and I end the presentation with a call for questions. While I’m expecting to answer inquiries about the product at hand and what we have just been discussing, instead the first question is almost always “How did you get into writing cookbooks?” Then, the familiar questions follow: “What was Julia like?” or “What is Martha really like?”</p>
<p>I like to start at the beginning. Ever since I was a young girl, growing up on a farm in northern Minnesota, I wanted to write. Books fascinated me, how they could transport the reader to another land by words alone. I wanted to write about all kinds of things. I wrote stories but knew little about how the outside world worked. Food eventually became an easy topic for me; I learned to cook and bake before I could read—and on a woodstove! A few years later (and concocting a way to get a few days of vacation in the summer) I officially began my foods career through the local 4-H, where I won trips to the State Fair through cooking demonstrations. It launched a whole new world for me.</p>
<p>To be honest, to think about writing my own memoir seems self-serving. I didn’t ever believe I would be noticed or that what I had to say would be held credible by anyone. I’ve always felt “hidden behind the bushes” because of where I live. Nobody seems to hear about northern Minnesota unless it is weather related. The icebox of the nation. The land of lakes, wolves, bears, swamps, and mosquitoes. Who could be interested in that?</p>
<p>And yet I have always had this overwhelming desire to talk—to write—to tell people about my life. Though it really wasn’t ever about <i>me</i>
: it is about what surrounds me. The beauty of this northern place, the love of friends and family, the funny and incredible things that have happened to me in the little bubble in which I dwell. And always, through everything, food. Growing up on the farm, I would talk to the animals, to the trees, even to a blade of grass. I found a piece of paper so beautiful I would become emotional and attribute to it a flavor, a color—and it became a thing of beauty. The best gift I could receive was a tablet with lines for writing.</p>
<p>The stories that follow are snippets of life growing up on a simple farm in northern Minnesota. I begin with stories about my grandparents, all four of whom immigrated from Finland and whose heritage has left a lasting impression on who I am and how I approach life and food. Throughout these stories, I usually refer to my mother as “Mummy” and my father as “Isä” (Finnish for father). There are stories of growing up on the farm, and then seeing a larger world unfold in front of my eyes through my love of food, from State Fair blue ribbons and national championship recipes to the Pillsbury Bake-Off, working for the wonderful California-based magazine <i>Sunset</i>
 in its food department, traveling to Finland to research cuisine and then returning to Duluth, where I helped invent the Jeno’s Pizza Roll. And there are stories of later adventures in cooking, of meeting Julia Child and Martha Stewart. To this day it all still grows from the simple approaches to food that became such an important part of who I was growing up on the farm.</p>
<p>I’m 100 percent Finnish. That means all of my ancestors came from Finland. I’m also 100 percent Minnesotan, if I can be 100 percent of two different things. In Minnesota, we’re trained to be what’s called “Minnesota nice,” and I’m not quite sure where that comes from. It could be that we’re plunked in the middle of “New Scandinavia,” but of course Finns aren’t really Scandinavians. We’re “Nordic,” and that’s what Scandinavians are, too. We’re taught to “get along” with non-Lutherans. Nobody is wrong, they’re just different. My mother made it very clear when I was growing up that regardless of skin color or personal differences, we are all equally loved. I am a child of God, as is everybody else. I was reminded later in life that when the Protestant Reformation was brought to Finland by Mikael Agricola, it was difficult to convince Finns that God could understand Finnish.</p>
<p>My husband is also 100 percent Finnish. That means our three kids are 100 percent Finnish. But our grandchildren are either 50 percent Finnish or 0 percent Finnish. Three of our eight grandchildren were adopted from Colombia. They are easy to spot in a crowd of Minnesotans because of their gorgeous, thick, dark hair and flashing dark eyes. The other five grandchildren are blond, fair-skinned, tall, and lanky, with soft brown or blue-green eyes.</p>
<p>“Who am I?” I have pondered this as I walk through our beautiful woods that are permeated with the aroma of poplar and evergreens. That’s the underlying question as I begin writing. The thought comes to me time after time, something I learned early: “I am a part of all I have met.” Just recently I took a course in which we were challenged to remember events both recent and past. The professor teaching the course commented that everything that has ever happened during a lifetime is recorded in the brain. What a remarkable fact! The happenings stored within my skull, then, add up to who I am.</p>
<p>Memories, both happy and sad, float to the top and create something beautiful, challenging, and heartbreaking. These memories strike a balance in my mind between thankfulness and opportunity.</p>
<p>Compassion for those less fortunate gives me pause. Stories about the difficulty my grandparents faced coming to this country and the struggles they experienced make my life seem like a total gift. Even within my own family I wonder why I have been so lucky, with a healthy body, sharp hearing, and clear sight while others endure deafness, blurred vision, muscular dystrophy, and other ailments. For these blessings I am thankful.</p>
<p>What follows are snippets from my life, memories of food and the farm and family, stories of the challenges I have faced and places I have traveled. And always: stories about food. These many ingredients create the recipe that makes me who I am.</p>
