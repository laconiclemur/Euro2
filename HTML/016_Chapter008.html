  <p class="h1">Shellfish (Skalldyr)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Shellfish such as lobster, shrimp, crab, and crayfish, although expensive, is by many considered a much-appreciated luxury food. Shellfish must be kept refrigerated and eaten as soon as possible after being cooked, as it does not keep well. Shrimp, lobster, and crayfish change color during the cooking process because the dye in the shell is destroyed when exposed to heat.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Shrimp Wok (Scamipwok)</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/52-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Prepare this simple and tasty dish on a busy day. If you only have cooked shrimp, add them to the dish at the end. The raw shrimp needs a little longer cooking and should be added with the vegetables. And remember that some chilies are hot and others mild.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (500 g.) shrimp</p>

  <p class="ing">2 green paprikas</p>

  <p class="ing">2 onions, medium</p>

  <p class="ing">⅔ cup (150 g.) sweet peas</p>

  <p class="ing">3 cloves garlic</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">2 red chilies</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp. soy sauce</p>

  <p class="ingl">4 red paprikas</p>

  <p class="noindent">Slice the onion, and dice the garlic and chili. Fry in a little oil until the onion is tender. Add chopped paprika and shrimp and cook until the shrimp turns pink. Add peas and soy sauce. If you use cooked shrimp, add now and let them heat through.</p>

  <p class="h3">Boiled Lobster (Kokt hummer)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place the live lobster in cold water and bring to a boil. Boil 5 minutes, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes more. (By this method the lobster becomes drugged at the lower temperatures.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Or, to drug the lobster before boiling, place it in heavily salted water (1 ½ cups (3½ dl) salt to each quart (liter) of water) for a couple of minutes. Then plunge into boiling water. Use high heat so the water does not stop boiling when the lobsters are added.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_53"/>Add ¼ cup (½ dl) salt for each quart of water and dill, if desired. Boil 5 minutes, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes. After the cooking period, plunge the lobster into cold water to stop the cooking action. When cooled, place the lobster on its back, and with a sharp knife cut it in half lengthwise from head to tail. Discard all organs. Remove the black vein that runs along the back and underside of the tail meat. Crack the claws with a nutcracker.</p>

  <p class="h3">Broiled Lobster (Ristet hummer)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Plunge a live lobster head first into rapidly boiling, salted water, enough to cover. Cook for two minutes. Remove. Follow the preceding recipe regarding cleaning. Head may be removed at this time. Place the lobster under a broiler with shell side up, about 5 inches (12 ½ cm) from the flame, and broil 7 minutes. Turn and flatten the lobster open to expose the meat. Brush with melted butter and broil another 7–8 minutes. Serve with melted butter and lemon.</p>

  <p class="h3">Oysters (Østers)</p>

  <p class="noindent">A few hundred years ago oysters were harvested in abundance on the west and south coast of Norway, but today this delicacy has become very scarce. Norway’s high-quality live oysters are now harvested in isolated bays. The shell of young oysters is white, whereas the older oysters have a yellow or brownish color. The shells of live oysters are tightly closed. If it is partly open and does not close when handled, the oyster is dead and must not be eaten. Oysters must be kept refrigerated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Wash and rinse oysters well in cold water. Place the oyster flat on a counter or table to open. Secure with the left hand and with the right hand force an oyster knife between the shell and the narrowest part (see illus. 2). Many prefer to hammer the edge of the shell first, which allows the knife to be inserted more easily (see illus. 1). Cut across the large constrictor muscle by sliding the knife close to the flat shell where the muscle is fastened (see illus. 3). Cut across the underside of the same muscle by cutting deep into the round part of the shell (see illus. 4) and leave the oyster lying loose in the shell. If oysters are to be served out of the shell, collect them in a bowl or pan until all the cleaning is completed. Then carefully check the oysters for any pieces of shell that may have been overlooked.</p>

  <p class="h3">Fried Oysters (Stekte østers)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">Oysters</p>

  <p class="ing">Crushed zwieback</p>

  <p class="ing">1 egg, beaten</p>

  <p class="ingl">Lemon</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/53-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Remove oysters from their shells and dry on a paper towel. Dip cleaned oysters in zwieback then in beaten egg and again in the crumbs. Melt butter in a heavy frying pan and fry oysters two to three minutes or until brown. Serve with lemon wedges and desired sauce.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Cauliflower with Shrimp Sauce (Blomk</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">l med rekesaus)</span></p>

  <p class="leftpara"><span class="italic">In late summer when cauliflower is rather inexpensive, this dish is much enjoyed in Norway. Served with French bread and a green salad it makes a tasty supper anytime of the year.</span></p>

  <p class="ing2">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 head of cauliflower, medium</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) cream</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">Pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (6 ¼ dl) whole milk or use part cauliflower broth</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 lbs. (900 g.) shrimp, cooked and shelled</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Remove leaves and trim base from the cauliflower. Boil or steam cauliflower in, or over, salted water until just tender. Do not overcook. Keep hot. Melt butter in a saucepan, add flour, and stir in milk or broth, bringing it to a boil. Stir in cream. Simmer over low heat 5–8 minutes. Add seasoning and shrimp, and simmer long enough for shrimp to heat through. <span class="italic">Do not boil.</span> <a id="page_54"/>Lift head of cauliflower carefully to a large heated platter or shallow bowl, and pour sauce over. Sprinkle with paprika, and add a tuft of parsley.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="h3">Crabs (Krabber)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">By whatever method you prepare the crabs, the buying and proper cooking of them is of utmost importance. They can be bought alive or boiled, but to be assured of their freshness it is advisable to buy live ones. Medium-sized crabs are the most sought after. Crabs should be well-filled, heavy, and firm, and should not gurgle when gently shaken. A gurgling sound indicates they are watery—do not buy!</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/54-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Use a large utensil and fill it with water. Salt as you would for potatoes and add a sprig of dill for exciting flavor. Sea water can be used for cooking crabs, but even then additional salt should be added. Bring water to a rapid boil and add crabs, only a couple at a time, so the water does not stop boiling. Depending on their size, they should be done in 15–20 minutes. Allow to cool in the same water. When cool, remove both large and small claws carefully. A nutcracker is a helpful tool for this.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the shell is hard use a hammer and tap carefully on the large claws to extricate the delicious meat in one piece. Pull off the top shell, remove the spongy parts such as the gills, stomach, and intestines; remove the semi-transparent membrane covering the body. Remove the small apron-shaped piece on bottom of crab and the projecting parts opposite. Break the body in two. Serve crab with melted butter, a little mayonnaise, or vinegar. Toasted French bread is excellent served with crab.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/54-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Crab Feast (Krabbelag)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Plan for one whole crab per person. Prepare and clean crab as in previous recipe. Give each person a nut cracker and a seafood fork. Set the table with lemon wedges, pepper, and mayonnaise, Serve with French bread and butter, or choose a delicious sauce, like Chili Sauce (<a href="../Text/013_Chapter005.html#page_34">p.34</a>) or Chive-Parsley Sauce (p.34).</p>

  <p class="h3">Sardines (Sardiner)</p>

  <p class="noindent">To my mind there are sardines and then there are Norway sardines. And there is no comparison. It is said that, “In Norway they catch the fish to fit the can. Elsewhere they <span class="italic">cut</span> the fish to fit the can.” You can tell a Norwegian sardine by its smoky, savory flavor. A sardine from Norway tastes different because of the smoking. Slow-burning oak fires—used to preserve the delicate flesh even before canning methods were perfected by Stavanger Hermetiske Fabrik in 1879—render a rich, mellow savoriness found in no other canned sardine. Laurels should be heaped on the two enterprising Norwegians, Martin Gabrielsen and John Mejlænder, whose inquiring minds, discovered how to preserve the sea’s bounty of small ocean fishes in the summer for enjoyment all year round.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">“Caught and canned in a day.”</span> First, a quick brine bath descales the sardines and makes them more receptive to the smoking. Then the fish are sorted to size automatically, threaded by machine onto thin steel rods where they are suspended individually by heads, and conveyed into the ovens to be lightly smoked for one hour over slow-burning selected oak wood that heightens the natural flavor and adds a special tang. After the smoking, mechanized knives cut off the heads.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_55"/>Trained packers carefully hand-layer the smoked fish into cans. Each can is checked by inspectors to insure uniform filling.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pure oil or sauce is added automatically by machine. (The olive oil, natural sardine oil, tomato, and mustard sauce must pass strict Norwegian and U.S. inspection.) Then the lids are put on and the can is hermetically sealed, washed, and placed in a steamer for one hour to cook and to thoroughly sterilize the contents.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">How to tell a Norway winter-caught brisling (or sprat) from a Norway summer caught:</span> Each can of sardines from Norway is required by Norwegian law to be labeled with a thorough description of contents, kind of oil, weight, packer, and so on.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Summer-caught brisling:</span> very tender flesh, often so juicy and plump it’s hard to remove the fish whole from the can. Ranges in size from 3 ½–4 ¾ inches (8 ⅝–12 cm) long. Packed only in pure virgin olive oil.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Winter-caught brisling:</span> firmer in flesh and texture, can be larger in size, ranging from 3 ¾–6 ¾ inches (7 ½–15 cm) long. Usually packed in light natural oil from the fish itself, highly refined, and specially developed by the test laboratories of the Norwegian Canning Industry.</p>

  <p class="indent">Today, medical researchers are discovering what seafaring Norwegians have known for centuries: Seafood is good for you! Saltwater fish are also an excellent source of iodine. Tiny Norwegian sardines are excellent as a source of bone-building calcium and vitamin D.</p>

  <p class="indent">Each 3-ounce (85 g.) serving contains 372 milligrams of calcium—more than an 8-ounce (2 ½ dl) glass of whole milk. Sardines also provide 10 percent of the U.S. RDA for energy important iron and riboflavin (vitamin B12).</p>

  <p class="indent">Fish are rich in omega-3. But not all fish are created equal. Fattier fish living in icy, northern waters—such as Norway sardines—seem to yield especially high levels of omega-3 oil. A 3 ½ oz. serving of drained Norway sardines contain 5.1 g. of omega-3. As one of the cold-water fish with the highest omega-3 counts, sardines offer a convenient way to incorporate the nutritional benefits of fish oils in a diet. (For recipes see Index.)</p>
