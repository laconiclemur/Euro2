<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">I</span></span><span class="italic">n Emilia-Romagna, where pasta reigns as queen, the ragù sauce is king. Although meat ragùs are made throughout Italy, I know of no other region where the sauce has gained such importance. Hardly a restaurant in Emilia-Romagna omits Tagliatelle with Ragù from its menu, and it is a rare home where some form of pasta sauced with some kind of ragù is not eaten at least once a week</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Ragù is a sauce of chopped meat(s) and sautéed vegetables cooked in liquid. The liquid can be stock, wine, water, tomato, milk or cream, or a combination of several of these. What a ragù is <span class="underline">not</span> is a tomato sauce with meat. It is a meat sauce sometimes flavored with tomato. In Emilia-Romagna and much of northern Italy, the meat is chopped into the sauce, while in southern Italy chunks of meat are frequently cooked into a ragù and served separately from it</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Such attention is lavished on ragùs in Emilia-Romagna, with each cook creating yet another interpretation, that their scope could never be reflected in only one recipe. I have gathered a diverse collection of favorites, each expressing another dimension of ragù or an important part of the sauce’s past. But was ragù always a sauce? Where did it <a id="page34"/>begin and how did it evolve? Researchers in Bologna came to one conclusion, which, in turn, led me to another</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The most famous ragù in Emilia-Romagna is <span class="underline">Ragù Bolognese</span>. For the people of Bologna, their meat sauce is a vital part of their culinary identity. They believe Bologna is a center of discerning taste, where the best of raw materials are combined to perfection by gifted cooks</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When Bologna’s chapter of one of Italy’s preeminent gastronomic societies, L’Accademia Italiana della Cucina, chose one recipe as the most typical example of <span class="underline">Ragù Bolognese</span>, it raised a furor of debate. For weeks afterward, the city’s newspapers documented heated exchanges over the validity of the sauce. Almost everyone had an opinion. Home cooks questioned every ingredient, its quantity, its tradition, its inclusion or exclusion. Bolognese restaurant cooks, who saw themselves as the keepers of Bologna’s culinary traditions, were angered over not being consulted. Historians and food experts argued over the origins of the ragù, and its legitimacy as an expression of Bologna’s kitchen</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The Academy stood its ground. For them, the recipe found in Essential Sauces and Stocks embodied the most important characteristics of the ragù. It verified their belief that <span class="underline">Ragù Bolognese</span> began as a humble dish in Bologna’s farm kitchens a century ago</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">According to Academy members, meat was expensive then, even for farmers. The beef in this sauce often came from a milk cow grown too old for milking. Skirt steak was a cut few people wanted because, in spite of its good flavor, it was lean and tough. Slow cooking tenderized the meat. The quantity of the sauce was stretched with generous amounts of vegetables and salt pork. Because the salt pork was the cheapest of meats and always available, often there was as much of it in the pot as beef</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The recipe’s reduced cream may appear an affectation, but in fact it nearly duplicates an original ingredient, cream skimmed from cooked milk. New milk, fresh from the cow, was preserved by long heating. Gradually the cream separated and coagulated on the milk’s surface. As the cooled milk stood by the kitchen door in a covered can, the cook would reach out with a shallow cup and skim off the top cream as it was needed</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">That cream, full of flavor, went a long way in enriching the sauce and eliminating the need for large quantities of broth. Although made from bones and scraps, broth was still a meat product and treasured. <a id="page35"/>Using cream created a sauce so rich and filling that only a little was needed for saucing enough tagliatelle to feed a large family</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">With this explanation, the Academy’s <span class="underline">Ragù Bolognese</span> became official by decree. After receiving more government seals, ribbons and stamps than an international peace treaty, the recipe was deposited in the town hall to stand for all time as the typical ragù of Bologna</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">My own research into the ragùs of Emilia-Romagna turned me in another direction. Much evidence points toward the oldest ancestors of today’s sauces being stews created in palaces, not on farms. I believe country-style ragùs came from working people emulating the sauces of the aristocracy. Since the mid-1800s ragù has been women’s food—the food of the home cook. But its birth could have been under the hands of men—the court cooks of the 16th and 17th centuries</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The region’s Renaissance cookbooks make no mention of ragù, nor of meat sauces for pasta. But they do give recipes for stews that sound like ragùs done in the fashion of the day, with an emphasis on spices and sugar. During the early 1500s, cookbook author Christofaro di Messisbugo served up ragù-like dishes to his master at Ferrara’s court banquets. Exotic, savory and sweet, these were chunky stews composed of cut-up meats. Sometimes fruits and nuts were added. Usually the stews were cooked in a strong broth and a tart or sweet wine. Seasonings seemed more Middle Eastern than Italian—rosewater, saffron, cinnamon, ginger, coriander, plenty of black pepper, and always sugar. These creations were eaten on their own or filled elaborate pies. They were not served over pasta, at least not yet. Through the 17th and 18th centuries the stews continued evolving. The quantities of sugar diminished and the spices were toned down</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Italy’s stews shared many characteristics with France’s ragoûts of the same period. (<span class="underline">Ragoût</span> was and is a stewlike dish of cut-up ingredients, cooked in liquid and eaten on its own. Italy’s <span class="underline">ragù</span> is always a sauce.) Considering the centuries of exchanges between the two countries, Italy’s stews and France’s ragoûts probably influenced each other. The important questions are: When did Italy’s stew become ragù? Did the name come from France? And when did Italian ragù first sauce pasta?</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">A combination of forces came into play toward the end of the 18th century that no doubt helped the word <span class="underline">ragoût</span> become <span class="underline">ragù</span> as it emigrated from France to Italy, and to Emilia-Romagna</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In the 1700s ragoûts became fashionable food for the well-to-do <a id="page36"/>French, and contained everything from meats to vegetables to nuts and even olives. At the same time, Emilia-Romagna’s affluent citizens were captivated by all things French. The French were everywhere. Parma was annexed to the court of Louis XV, and 10 percent of her population was French. Modenese nobility took French husbands and wives. Each wedding brought large entourages of French relatives and servants. Bologna traded and politicked with France. Finally, Napoleon took possession of northern Italy for France in 1796. Why not bow to the fashion of the day and call those stews ragù?</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The first record of someone doing just that was in the late 18th century when Alberto Alvisi, cook to the Cardinal of Imola, near Bologna, made a sauce called “ragù for maccheroni.” It tastes like a cross between classic Ragù Bolognese and a 20th-century French brown sauce. There were still remnants of those Renaissance flavorings. The sugar is gone, but the sauce’s flavors of deeply browned meat are set off by cinnamon and black pepper</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">After 1830, ragùs appear frequently in Emilia and Romagna cookbooks. By 1832, Napoleon’s widow. Marie Louise, the Duchess of Parma, was dining on a ragù of chicken and prosciutto cooked in wine and lemon. Another ragù of chicken cooked with sausage, beef and giblets was saucing a Bolognese tortellini pie (see Pastas). Merchants and landowners in Romagna were eating a variety of ragùs on their own as well as over pastas, including one much like the giblet ragù in Ragùs. In mid-century, Romagna cookbook author Pellegrino Artusi was eating maccheroni with a ragù of veal filet in a Bolognese tavern while his companions plotted the unification of Italy. Interestingly, only a few of these ragùs contain tomato</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">During the late 1800s, as white flour for pasta making became more affordable because of the Industrial Revolution, ragù crossed over class lines. The less affluent imitated the wealthy but used smaller portions of less expensive meats to make their ragù. Serving it over pasta stretched the sauce. An old saying states that tagliatelle with ragù becomes two courses in one: the pasta is the first and the ragù’s meat makes the second. Tagliatelle with ragù became a popular one-dish meal</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The recipes collected here are not historical curiosities. Each is a memorable dining experience in its own right. Ragù is still alive and well, and these recipes represent the best of the living tradition</span>.</p>
<a id="page37"/>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Building a Ragù</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The following technique creates ragùs full of flavor, rich without being heavy. It can do the same for stews, braisings, and non-ragù sauces. Making a ragù involves three simple steps: browning the vegetables and meats, reducing flavorful liquids over the browned foods to build up layers of taste, then covering them with liquid and simmering gently until the flavors have blended and the meats are tender.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Browning:</span> This is the taste foundation for the ragù. Browning slowly or quickly determines whether the foundation is mellow and sweet or robust and full-bodied. Slow browning over low heat brings out the sweetness of onion and carrot, while fast browning over high heat yields punchier, more robust flavors. Browning on medium heat strikes a balance between the two. I favor medium heat for most ragùs. Once the onion begins to color, the meats are added. After throwing off liquid, they begin browning. Some cooks like meats taken to a dark crisp brown, while others prefer lighter browning. Using a saucepan instead of a sauté pan ensures leisurely browning, building up rich caramelized flavors. As the foods cook, a brown glaze, packed with flavor, develops on the bottom of the pan. Protect it from burning by lowering the heat. Nonstick cookware discourages glazing and should not be used for ragùs, sauces, sautés, braisings, or stews.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Reductions:</span> Repeatedly pouring wine, stock, and/or water over the browned base and simmering down each addition to an essence achieves two things: First, the reductions blend the highly flavored brown glaze into the sauce. Without it, ragùs lack depth. Second, each reduction builds another stratum of flavor, giving the sauce more complexity. Adding all the liquids at the same time produces a one-dimensional ragù. Wine creates a round and tangy taste layer, providing a needed contrast to the big flavors of browned vegetables and meat. Stock reduced to almost nothing imparts more full meat flavor. Repeat the stock reduction again and again, and see how intensely aromatic the sauce becomes. Always add any tomatoes <span class="italic">after</span> the reductions, as they will make the ragù acid-tasting.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Simmering:</span> Flavors mellow and the ragù’s meats cook to tenderness when they are covered with liquid and left to bubble gently for an hour or more. Remove the sauce from the heat, let it settle a few moments, and then skim off all possible fat.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Ingredients</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Beef:</span> Often used by itself in Bologna, and blended with other meats in other parts of the region. The more flavorful the cut, the tastier the ragù. Best-tasting for ragù is the hanging tender, a small cut that literally hangs off the kidney inside the left hindquarter of the steer. Hanging tenders are not easy to come by (there is only one per steer) and must be ordered from a butcher. Skirt steak is my second choice. Cut from inside the rib cage in the forequarter, this, too, must be specially ordered <a id="page38"/>and is worth seeking out. More readily available and almost as good are cuts from the chuck, such as blade-cut chuck, center-cut chuck, and seven-bone chuck steak or roast.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Capon Breast:</span> Italy’s favorite domestic poultry gives the rich character to red meats and lightens ragùs. It is worth special ordering, but if unavailable, turkey breast comes close.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Chicken Giblets:</span> Chicken or turkey giblets are frequently the mystery ingredients used with other meats in a ragù. Although almost impossible to detect, they impart body and character to the sauce. Ragùs composed only of giblets are often balanced with the addition of porcini mushrooms.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Pork:</span> Cuts from the shoulder and sirloin are used in ragùs throughout Emilia-Romagna. Pork sweetens the sauce and balances particularly well in combination with veal.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Sausage:</span> Often used in the ragùs of Modena, much of Romagna, and occasionally in Reggio, the sausage is never seasoned with hot pepper. Blending small quantities of sausage with other meats adds zest and character. A ragù of only sausage is traditional with gramigna pasta.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Veal:</span> Usually blended with other meats for lightness. One exception is the Light Veal Ragù with Tomato, where the veal and tomato combination makes for a particularly fresh-tasting sauce. Seek out “kind” veal, from calves raised organically with space to move about.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Butter:</span> Gives sweet, rich undertones.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Pancetta and Prosciutto:</span> Their meat and fat are so suave that they give ragùs an elegance unequaled by butter or olive oil. Even when the fat is skimmed from the finished sauce, their flavors remain.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Lard:</span> This has always been the cheapest and most accessible fat, used in the ragùs of the less affluent. Fine lard tastes of good pork meat. Cholesterol concerns have removed it from favor.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Olive Oil:</span> Adds subtle fruitiness to ragùs. Traditionally Bologna and Romagna used more olive oil than the rest of Emilia-Romagna. Today, health concerns are causing its popularity to spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Wine:</span> Wine’s roundness and acidity bring balance to full-bodied ragùs. Always add it after the meat has browned, and slowly cook the wine away to nothing. Do not use cooking wine. Instead, cook with a wine you would drink, using either red or white—the choice is up to the cook. Red Sangiovese di Romagna and white Trebbiano are most favored in Emilia-Romagna.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Stock/Broth:</span> Heightens meatiness. Since reductions intensify the stock’s flavor, make sure it is saltless and, ideally, homemade.</p>
<a id="page39"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Water:</span> Used for clear, neutral flavor, letting other ingredients shine.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Milk:</span> For an especially mellow and sweet sauce with tender meats, use milk as the main cooking liquid, adding it after the reductions. For more subtle sweetness, add milk in small quantities during cooking. Skim milk does an admirable job.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Porcini Mushrooms:</span> Dried mushrooms used in small quantities give a wild, woodsy flavor to a ragù. For greater intensity, include their soaking liquid in the reductions. Do not overdo; porcini can easily dominate a sauce.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Herbs and Spices:</span> Used infrequently in ragùs and always with a careful hand.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Little History</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The Cardinal’s Ragù is one of the earliest of Emilia-Romagna’s ragùs to be served with pasta. The recipe was found in a small manuscript of fifty or so written by Alberto Alvisi. Between 1785 and 1800 Alvisi cooked for the Cardinal of Imola, Gregorio Chiaramonti. The cardinal went on to become Pope Pio VII, while Alvisi dropped into obscurity. Food historians Aureliano Bassani and Giancarlo Roversi discovered his manuscript in Bologna’s archives, and published it 180 years after the cardinal dined on this ragù.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Cook’s Notes</span></span> The original recipe offered the cook a choice of beef, veal shoulder, pork loin, or poultry giblets. Any of these could be substituted in equal amounts for the beef. Adding Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese overwhelms the sauce’s cinnamon and pepper, and its texture alters the ragù’s silkiness.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Remarkable Thigh</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Chunks of boned chicken thigh are an important aspect of Baroque Ragù. They became part of the recipe one day when veal was not to be had. They stayed in the dish because of their succulence and absence of fat. Thigh meat loses none of its moist goodness through long sautés and simmerings. When excellent veal is not available for stews or braisings, substitute chicken thigh. Yes, its taste is different, but it unfailingly complements the flavorings and ingredients usually cooked with veal.</p>

Sprinkle the meat lightly with salt and a few grindings of pepper. Add the rosemary sprig, cook another 5 minutes, then discard it.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Reducing:</span> Stir in the wine. Let it bubble down to nothing while you scrape up the brown glaze from the bottom of the pan. This takes 3 to 4 minutes. Blend in the tomato paste and water. Bring the ragù to a slow bubble over low heat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Simmering:</span> Partially cover and cook 1 to 1¼ hours, or until the meat is tender and the sauce is richly flavored. The consistency should be thick but still moist. If necessary, add a little more water during cooking. (If you are preparing the sauce ahead, stop at this point and allow it to cool; then cover and refrigerate. One of the keys to its fresh flavor is cooking the tomatoes only a short time.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing and Serving:</span> Stir in the tomatoes and cook slowly, uncovered, 5 to 10 minutes. The meat and tomato flavors will blend, but the tomato must retain its fresh, distinctive character. Toss the ragù with fresh or boxed tagliatelle. As befits a sauce from Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is delicious with the ragù.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">“Stretching the pot” is a phrase I often heard from the Tuscan side of my family. This expression came to life for me years ago in the mountains above Reggio and Modena. After talking with a farmer about his crops, I was invited to join his family and friends for dinner. A sauce very similar to Game Ragù had been made to dress pasta. With the arrival of five unexpected guests, stock and water were blended into the ragù. After about 20 minutes of simmering it appeared on the table as a filling and satisfying soup, with plenty for all.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Try adding 2 quarts of stock to this sauce (after refrigerating and defatting). Serve with a bowl of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for sprinkling over the soup and either Modena Mountain Bread or <span class="italic">Spianata</span>.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 5%;">O<span class="italic">ne of my favorite ragùs, this sauce has an ancient lineage, dating back at least 400 years. Giblets are the last thing most of us expect to taste like a blend of well-aged beef, fine old Barolo wine, and mature prosciutto. But they do, and this sauce is one of the most distinctive I know. Its character is full-blown and robust, yet elegant and perfectly balanced on the palate. There are several interpretations within Emilia-Romagna and many more in neighboring regions, where it is sometimes called “false game sauce.” Tagliatelle bring out the ragù’s elegant side, while small hollow macaroni like penne or sedani emphasize its earthiness</span>.</p>

Meat Ragù with Marsala</a></span></span></p>

<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">T<span class="italic">his ragù grew out of a taste memory and two old Ferrara family recipes. In test after test, trying to duplicate my favorite Domed Maccheroni Pie of Ferrara, I was haunted by an elusive element, a taste I could not quite single out. Finally Ferrarese linguist Riccardo Rimondi shared his family’s recipes, and there it was: a little Marsala, reduced into the pie’s ragù sauce to make the subtlest, but all-important, difference. Emerging from this ragù of several meats and savory liquids are flavors that constantly change on the palate. Certainly use this ragù in the domed pie, but savor it to the full all by itself over pasta—tagliatelle is my preference. The recipe doubles easily</span>.</p>
