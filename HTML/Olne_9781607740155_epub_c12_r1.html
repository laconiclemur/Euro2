  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page210"></a>Although by nineteenth-century standards this menu may be relatively simple, it is rare today to encounter one as elaborate. There are none other of its kind in the book, and though I may for one’s guests represent a marvelous experience, I feel uneasily almost as if I owed an apology to my readers, who may justly consider it an archaic curiosity but nearly impossible of execution, particularly in a servantless household. The presentation, singlehanded, of such a menu is perfectly possible, but the amount of work, the intricacy of the organization, and the final fatigue represent a heavy expenditure that may to many minds not justify the result, no matter how glorious. Each recipe may, in any case, find its place in a simpler context, and the rum sherbert, once a standard element in nearly every festive bourgeois menu, may serve equally well as a light, refreshing dessert.</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em>blanc-manager</em>, the <em>oursinade</em> and the chestnut purée, but for reheating and buttering, may be prepared the preceding day. The bird may be larded for roasting beforehand and the timbale mold lined with macaroni, and, except for the final addition of cream to the mousseline, its various elements prepared in advance. The final organization of the meal, then, depends essentially on putting things to cook at the right time: the fish, depending on their size, should be put to grill just before or during the service of the soup, the timbale should be put to poach just before the soup service, and the roast put in the oven at the end of the fish service.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c12-s43"><em><span class="color">Cream of Artichoke Soup with Hazelnuts</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Crème d’Artichauts aux Noisettes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>For 1 quart thin béchamel sauce:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>5 cups milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4–5 roasted hazelnuts</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 good-sized Artichoke Bottoms, precooked (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground white pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a handful of chervil leaves</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page211"></a><span class="small">THE BECHAMEL</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt the butter in a saucepan and cook it with the flour over a low flame for about 1 minute, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon. This <em>roux</em> should not be allowed to color. Heat the milk and, away from the fire, add it, at first in small quantities at a time, to the <em>roux</em>, stirring all the while to ensure a smooth, non-lumpy mixture. Return it to the heat, salt to taste, and when the boil is reached, lower the flame so that a bare simmer is maintained. Leave it to cook stirring occasionally, for about an hour (20 minutes is usually given as a minimum cooking time to rid it of its floury taste). A longer cooking, which depends in part on reduction as a thickening element, produces a better result. (In Lyonnaise cooking, <em>béchamel</em> is the basic element in nearly all sauces, and professional kitchens keep great pots of it gently cooking in slow ovens, often for hours on end.) If it is not to be used immediately, melt a lump of butter on the surface to prevent a skin’s forming. Ten minutes before removing it from the heat, add the hazelnuts, crushed; if it is made in advance, reheat it and cook the hazelnuts in it for 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slice 6 of the artichoke bottoms, leave the other two whole, and stew them all in the butter, stirring occasionally, over a low flame, without allowing them to brown, for a good ½ hour (use either earthenware or stainless steel—any other metal will discolor artichokes). Put the 2 whole bottoms aside and stir the rest into the <em>béchamel</em>. Pass the mixture through a nylon drum sieve, using either a mushroom pestle or one with a flat bottom, like the old-fashioned American potato masher. Reheat the purée, bring it to a light, creamy consistency by the addition of boiling milk, taste for salt, grind in the white pepper and stir in the cream. Add the two artichoke bottoms, cut into small cubes, pour into a heated soup tureen and sprinkle the surface with chervil leaves.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page212"></a>THE GRILLED FISH WITH SEA URCHIN PUREE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">An <em>oursinade</em> most often accompanies the Mediterranean red mullet. Sea bass or any fish with a firm, fairly moist, white flesh is a good substitute.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sea urchins (<em>oursins</em>) are common in American waters but rarely eaten. I have never seen them in an American fish market. The “tongues” of coral, forming a star against the inside wall of the shell, are slightly sweet in flavor with a trace of iodine and a strong memory of the sea. In the south of France, sea urchins are ranked among the greatest of delicacies and are most often eaten raw, alone, or as part of a mixture on a seafood platter along with raw oysters, mussels, clams, “violets,” etc. The puréed corals may also lend their fine color and unique savor to a fish mousseline forcemeat or a <em>béchamel</em> sauce to accompany poached fish. The corals are usually more fully developed in the winter and early spring months.</p>

  <p class="indent">If small fish (about 3 ounces each) are used, they may by wrapped in grape leaves (if these are in season) just before being grilled (out of season, grape leaves preserved in brine, much used in Greek and near-Oriental preparations, may be substituted) and need not be scaled, for the charred leaves, when removed, will take scales and skin with them.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c12-s44"><em><span class="color">Grilled Fish with Sea Urchin Purée</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Poissons Grillés à l’Oursinade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>fish—count 2 or 3 small</em> (<em>3 ounces</em>) <em>or one 6- or 7-ounce fish per person. Two or 3 larger fish, depending on their size, will serve 6</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Marinade:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon lemon juice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 scant teaspoon fennel seeds (in season, chopped fresh wild fennel leaves should be used and the cavities of the fish may be stuffed with a healthy bouquet of fennel branches)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page213"></a>2 tablespoons pastis or Pernod</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Oursinade:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>15–20 sea urchins (enough to make a good ½ cup of coral purée)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup olive oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean the fish, tear out the gills, rinse fish, and sponge them dry with a towel. Large fish should have diagonal and parallel slits cut into the flesh at approximately 1½-inch intervals on either side to permit a regular penetration of heat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mix the elements of the marinade and sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with the marinade. Leave them in a cool place for 1 or 2 hours, turning them from time to time.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE OURSINADE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">To open a sea urchin, hold it in one hand (in several thicknesses of cloth for protection against the spines), pierce the orifice with the pointed blade of a pair of scissors, cut outward through the shell about ¾ of an inch, then cut all the way around in order to be able to lift out a circular “lid.” Discard the lid and either rinse the interior out with sea water or give it a shake to rid it of the water and blackish, granular material inside. Remove the corals with the help of a teaspoon and pass them through a sieve. Mix the purée with the olive oil and store in a cool place until ready for use (if stored in the refrigerator, remove it an hour before using as the oil will have solidified through contact with extreme cold). The coral purée is too heavy to remain in emulsion in the oil and the mixture must be stirred well before each serving (it will, of course, remain in emulsion in an olive-oil mayonnaise, which makes a splendid sauce also for grilled fish).</p>

  <p class="indent">Small fish should be arranged in rows on a heavy steel-wire double-faced grill. Large fish can be dealt with easily only in the special, fish-shaped double grill. If the small fish are wrapped in vine leaves, the heat should be intense, and they need not be basted. Otherwise, grilled fish should be basted often with the marinating liquid, plus additional olive oil, if necessary, using little at a time to avoid its dropping into <a id="page214"></a>the hot coals and bursting into flame. The cooking time and the intensity of the heat both depend on the size of the fish, the smallest requiring a very lively bed of coals and only a couple of minutes’ exposure on each side. A large fish may take up to 15 minutes on each side, and the intensity of the heat should be proportionately less. The fish is done when the flesh is no longer resilient to the touch.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lacking a bed of coals, the fish may be prepared in the oven, smaller fish being grilled directly beneath the broiler, larger ones being first baked, repeatedly basted, and browned at the last minute beneath the open flame.</p>

  <p class="indent">Large fish should be filleted and served at table, the small fin bones being first removed, the fish slit lengthwise along the central line corresponding to the spinal column, and the fillets slipped loose. When the top fillets have been removed, the skeleton may easily be lifted, leaving the two other fillets clean. Serve the sauce separately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c12.5">TIMBALE OF SWEETBREADS AND MACARONI</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The possible elements in this type of preparation are unlimited. A “dome” mold lined spirally with macaroni, held firmly by an inner lining of mousseline forcemeat and filled with one of any number of thickly bound stews or garnish mixtures, the presentation, both initial and once served out, is of great beauty—and no less impressive on the palate. It may be prepared with a fish mousseline forcemeat and filled with some kind of firm-fleshed fish stew (lobster, scallops, shrimp, etc.), in which case, a sauce <em>à l’américaine</em> would be a happy accompaniment, or a game forcemeat (made from the fillets and back legs of wild rabbit, for instance), filled with a <em>salmis</em> type of preparation and accompanied by a <em>salmis</em> or civet sauce. The blandness of chicken-breast forcemeat allows it to serve with any kind of filling save fish (a personal prejudice, for, classically, chicken and crayfish are not an unusual marriage). In a less elaborate menu, this sort of preparation may form a perfect main course. It belongs, conceptually, to the realm of professional cooking. The time necessary for its preparation in a home kitchen is great, but the result is well worth while.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page215"></a>The forcemeat may be stretched and rendered firmer, if desired, by pounding 3 or 4 ounces of <em>panade</em> with the flesh before adding the egg white. The preparation stands well alone, but may be accompanied by a tomatoed <em>demi-glace</em> (stock reduced to a syrupy consistency with tomato purée to taste, lightly buttered at the last minute). If fresh truffles are out of the question, canned truffles may be substituted, their preserving liquid being added to the sauce, and the dish may be enriched by the addition of a small package of dried black morels, available in fancy-food shops (first soaked in cold water for an hour or so, or until tender, stem ends trimmed, each cut in 2 lengthwise, and well rinsed under a strong jet of water to rid it of any adherence of sand or earth, then gently stewed in butter for 10 or 12 minutes).</p>

  <p class="indent">An exquisite and less time-consuming preparation consists in braising the sweetbreads according to the instructions given, slicing them and arranging them in an earthenware <em>cocotte</em>, covering them generously with raw, sliced black truffles, masking the whole with the braising liquid and <em>mirepoix</em> passed into a purée, sealing the lid hermetically with a ribbon of flour paste, and heating the <em>cocotte</em> for 10 minutes in a very hot oven—just the time necessary to develop the perfume of the truffles. The flour-paste seal is broken at table and the emanations are spectacular.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c12-s45"><em><span class="color">Veal Sweetbreads and Macaroni Timbale</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Timbale de Macaroni aux Ris de Veau</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds veal sweetbreads</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>mirepoix made with</em> 2 <em>medium carrots, 1 medium onion,</em> 2 <em>tablespoons butter, crumbled bay leaf and thyme</em> (<em>see</em> <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#mire">this page</a> <em>for method</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 or 4 large fresh black truffles</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½-pound package of long macaroni</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 3 <em>tablespoons</em> (<em>1½ ounces</em>) <em>butter</em> (<em>to butter the mold</em>)</p>

    <p class="extract"><a id="page216"></a><em>Mousseline forcemeat:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>breast of a large roasting chicken</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg white</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1¼ cups heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE SWEETBREADS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Soak the sweetbreads in cold water for a good hour, put them into a large saucepan, well covered with cold water, bring to a boil, leave to simmer for a couple of minutes, drain, and plunge them into a basin of cold water. Peel them, carefully removing all fat and gristly or cartilaginous material and as much of the surface membrane as possible without disturbing the part that holds the many-sectioned sweetbread together. Place them, side by side, on a towel in such a way that they form a neat, evenly surfaced mass, place another towel over them and a board on top with approximately a 2-pound weight on the board (a medium-sized tin of preserves does well). Leave them under this weight until well cooled and firm (a couple of hours).</p>

  <p class="indent">Spread the <em>mirepoix</em> over the bottom of a heavy <em>sauteuse</em> or earthenware casserole of just the right size to hold the sweetbreads placed side by side on this bed. Pour in the white wine and over a high flame (using an asbestos pad for protection if heat resistance of earthenware is in question), reduce it almost completely, gently shaking the receptacle from time to time to discourage anything’s sticking to the bottom. Add the stock (enough to cover the sweetbreads generously), bring it to the boiling point, and lower the flame so that, covered, a near simmer is maintained. Count about 40 minutes’ braising time from the time the simmer is reached. Remove the sweetbreads from the sauce, slice them in regular ½-inch slices, and pass the cooking liquid and <em>mirepoix</em> through a fine sieve. If the sauce remains plentiful and liquid, reduce it over a high flame for a few minutes, stirring constantly. Taste for seasoning, add pepper and salt if necessary. Pour it over the sweetbreads, leave to cool, and stir in the truffles, thickly sliced.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the macaroni in a large pot of salted, boiling water and, when nearly cooked but still quite firm, remove from the heat and leave to swell for two or three minutes in the hot water. They should remain <a id="page217"></a>somewhat firm. Drain without rinsing and spread the strands of macaroni out, without touching one another, on a towel. Generously butter a 2-quart “dome” mold (dome molds are not easily found and may be replaced by any metal mixing bowl in the form of a half-sphere) and, beginning with a strand of macaroni which has been fashioned first into a compact, flatly spiraled circle or disk and pressed into the central point at the bottom of the mold, continue twining the strands of macaroni end to end in a close-fitting spiral until the entire mold is lined in this manner. Put the mold to chill in the refrigerator until the butter is set firmly enough to hold the macaroni in place. Cut the remaining macaroni into short lengths and stir it into the sweetbreads.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare the Mousseline Forcemeat as described on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh14">this page</a>, incorporating the cream only at the last moment and being certain to work directly over cracked ice. Spread three-quarters of the mixture evenly over the entire surface of macaroni lining, fill the mold with the sweetbread, truffle, and macaroni mixture, pressing it gently into place so as to leave no air pockets, and spread the remainder of the forcemeat over the surface. Press a round of buttered kitchen paper over the surface and put the mold to poach in a <em>bain-marie</em> in a slow to moderate oven for 45 minutes (a round metal cookie cutter or other object of support should be placed in the bottom of the larger utensil on which the round-bottomed mold may rest. The mold should be immersed by about three-quarters in nearly boiling water). If oven space does not permit, the poaching may equally well be operated on top of the stove in a large, covered saucepan or other receptacle. The flame should be kept very low to prevent the water’s returning to a boil.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the mold from the <em>bain-marie</em> and allow it to settle for 7 or 8 minutes before unmolding it onto a round, preheated platter. The bit of liquid that drains onto the platter should be sponged up with a paper towel. The timbale should be cut into pielike wedges at table; a small spatula or pie knife is useful for serving.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c12-s46"><a id="page218"></a><em><span class="color">Rum Sherbet</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Punch à la Romaine</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 strip each, orange and lemon peel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>strained juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon</em></p>

    <br /></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup rum</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Boil the sugar and water together, add the peels, juice, and white wine, leave to infuse until cool, remove the peels, and put to freeze, either in a mechanical freezer or an ice-cube tray—in the latter case, scrape frozen parts from the sides and bottom of the tray from time to time and stir them into the unfrozen mass.</p>

  <p class="indent">When consistently frozen without being too firm, prepare the meringue: Beat the egg white until stiff. In a small saucepan, add just enough water to the sugar to dissolve it, bring to a boil, and cook until a drop of the syrup, let fall into a cup of cold water, forms a soft ball, malleable in one’s fingers; then pour it evenly, in a tiny thread, into the egg white, beating all the while, until the syrup is completely absorbed. Turn out the frozen fruit-wine mixture into a chilled mixing bowl, stir and fold in the meringue, and return it to the freezer. Just before serving, stir in the rum. The sherbet should be only semisolid—“mushy” in consistency.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE ROAST GUINEA FOWL WITH BACON</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Although bacon is, in America, usually substituted for fresh or salt fat pork in French recipes, its aggressive smoky taste destroys or dis<a id="page219"></a>guises most other flavors. But the slightly gamy flesh of guinea fowl, flatter and less subtle than that of the pheasant (which, out of season, it often replaces), is enhanced by the smoky caress of bacon.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c12-s47"><em><span class="color">Roast Guinea Fowl with Bacon</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pintade Rôtie au Lard Fumé</p>

  <div class="block">

  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">In France the feet are generally left attached to roasting fowl (first dipped in boiling water or held over a flame, then skinned, the middle toe cut off at the first joint and the others removed). Those unaccustomed to this presentation do not always find it attractive. All roasting birds, if they have not already been badly mangled by the butcher, should be emptied by way of the throat (the intestines having already been drawn out with the aid of a hooked needlelike device), which prevents an important loss of natural juices. Pick and singe the bird, cut off the head at its base, slit the skin of the neck down the back, carefully loosen it, along with the trachea and the esophagus, from the neck, and sever the neck at its base. Gently pull the crop (the food sac attached to the esophagus) loose from the skin and flesh, being careful to tear neither, separate the flesh from the “wishbone” with the tip of a small, sharp knife, and force it loose with your fingers (a bird cannot be neatly carved at table unless the “wishbone” is removed). Reach as far as possible with the forefinger through the throat orifice, loosening heart, liver and gizzard from the cavity walls. It requires a bit of nudging, while gently pulling at the esophagus and trachea, and one must take care not to damage the gall bladder (a small blackish-green sac attached to the liver), for, if broken, its bitterness will ruin the bird. <a id="page220"></a>Once loosened, everything slips out in a coherent mass. Guineafowl liver tends to be strong in flavor; it may be put aside to be added to a terrine or pâté if one likes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sprinkle salt, freshly ground pepper and a pinch of oregano into the cavity, force in a piece of butter, and fold the neck skin over the back of the bird like an envelope. Fold the wings backward so that they “pin” the flap of skin in place and, using a large kitchen needle strung with about 2 feet of kitchen string, transpierce the bird, the needle entering just below the bone of one drumstick about an inch from the thigh, and coming out at a corresponding point through the other leg, leaving a generous length of string dangling from the place of entry. Run the needle through the upper joint of the wing on the same side as the leg through which it came out, send it into the body of the bird through the skin flap at that side, out through the skin flap to the other side, and through the other wing. Tie the two ends of string together, tightly but without forcing, and clip off the string tips. With another length of string, transpierce the bird toward the lower ends of the drumsticks and above the bone, then back through the carcass just above the point at which the thigh joins the body, and tie the string ends as before. This operation, once done, becomes simple and automatic. The 2 lengths of string, strung through the bird in this manner, firmly fix its shape, and no deformation is possible during the roasting process.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rub the bird with a few drops of oil, sprinkle it on all sides with salt, pepper and a bit of oregano, and press bacon strips, lengthwise, over the entire breast, tying around a couple of lengths of string to hold them in place. Roast the bird (or birds) in a fairly hot oven (375° F.), using a heavy, shallow pan (gratin dish, small skillet, etc.) as nearly as possible just the size to contain it, counting from 45 to 50 minutes for an adult bird and ½ hour for squabs. Remove the bacon strips for the last 8 to 10 minutes’ cooking time to permit the breast to brown lightly. Clip the strings and pull them out, transfer the bird to a heated platter, skim a few tablespoons of excess fat from the roasting pan, add the white wine and scrape and stir over a high flame until all adherent material is dissolved and the wine reduced by about half. Send this juice to table in a heated sauceboat and serve the chestnut purée at the same time.</p>

  <p class="center3">Purée de Marrons au Céleri</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds chestnuts</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 celery branch</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 fresh, crisp celery heart, cut into small dice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 6 <em>ounces butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Slice through the hull of the rounded surface of each chestnut, using a small, sharp knife; the hull is tough and resistant and care should be taken not to cut oneself. Plunge them into a pot of boiling water, and after a few minutes remove them, a few at a time, with a skimming spoon, and remove the hull from each as well as the inner, brownish skin. Holding them in a towel protects one’s fingers from the heat and rubbing with it helps remove the inner skin. Any which are particularly resistant may be returned for a couple of minutes to the hot water.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring the milk to a boil, add the chestnuts, salt, sugar and celery branch, and cook gently, covered, until they crush easily when pressed with the back of a spoon (they may have to cook as long as 1½ hours).</p>

  <p class="indent">Drain, saving the milk and discarding the celery branch. Pass the chestnuts through a vegetable mill (<em>moulinette</em>), using the finest blade and adding a bit of milk from time to time to facilitate their passage. Taste for salt, season with freshly ground pepper, and just before serving, rapidly reheat the purée in a heavy saucepan over a fairly high flame, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and, away from the flame, stir in the crisp celery dice and the butter, cut into small pieces. Don’t add all the butter at one time—just enough should be absorbed to permit the purée to be thickly poured. It should not be stiff, and a great quantity of butter is necessary to counteract its naturally dry texture and lend it a rich, velvety quality.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><a id="page222"></a>THE BLANC-MANGER</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A <em>blanc-manger</em> is a Bavarian cream made of almond milk (when it is not cornstarch pudding). Formed in an elegant old-fashioned jelly mold, trembling, opaque, creamy-white, its delicate purity should never be marred—visually or tastewise—by a sauce or any other garnish. Accompanied by a great Sauternes, both attain sublime heights.</p>

  <p class="indent">The preparation of the almond milk is hard work and I have often thought (but have never tried it) that the dreary task of pounding almonds with water might be painlessly achieved in a good blender.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c12-s49"><em><span class="color">Blanc-manger</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Blanc-manger</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound shelled almonds</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 bitter almonds</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1¼ cup light cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ tablespoons gelatin</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cups sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>almond oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Plunge all the almonds into boiling water for about 30 seconds, drain them and rub them in a towel to loosen the skins. Pick them over to be certain all skins are removed and put them to soak in cold water for ½ hour to whiten them. Drain them and pound in a stone mortar, adding a spoonful of water each time the paste becomes too resistant to work easily. When half the quantity of prescribed water has been used, put the rest aside and continue pounding and turning, adding the light cream in small quantities at a time, until it has an been added. This should be done slowly and thoroughly to produce the finest possible purée.</p>

  <p class="indent">Line a sieve, placed over a mixing bowl, with a strong linen towel, first dipped in cold water and well wrung out. Pour in the almond <a id="page223"></a>mixture, gather together the edges of the towel in one hand and begin twisting. Relax your hold from time to time to mix up the almond paste and then twist again, as tightly as possible, continuing until all the almond milk possible has been wrung from the paste.</p>

  <p class="indent">Soften the gelatin in a bit of cold water, then add the remaining water, first heated, bring to a boil and add the sugar. Leave until almost completely cooled, stir it into the almond milk, and place the mixing bowl in a larger container of cracked ice. Stir steadily with a wooden spoon until it begins to “take,” whip the heavy cream until fairly firm, but not stiff, fold it into the almond mixture, and pour into a mold that has been lightly oiled with almond oil (lacking that, use a tasteless vegetable oil). The jelly mold may be replaced by any other decorative quart mold, preferably with a central tube. Embed the mold in cracked ice, place a plate over the top and keep in the refrigerator for at least 4 or 5 hours. Unmold only just before serving, first dipping the mold for a couple of seconds into hot water and wiping it dry.</p>
