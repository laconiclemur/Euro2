<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0002728"><a id="pg66" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>PIG’S CHEEK <em class="calibre12">EMPANADOS</em></h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0002730">Iberian pig’s cheeks are ideal for this recipe, though you could also use ox cheeks (cut into pieces, as they are larger), or veal cheeks. Whatever you use, these <em class="calibre9">empanados</em> should be crispy on the outside (‘<em class="calibre9">empanados</em>’ refers to the breadcrumbed exterior) and juicy within. Served with the gravy-like sauce for dipping, they are a really good bite and an amazing start to any meal. If the frying seems like a bit too much effort, or you want to make this the main event, you can easily serve the braised cheeks as a stand-alone stew (this goes really well with the cauliflower with salted almonds, shallot and chilli <a href="part0090.html#pg126" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>.</p>

<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002748">Preheat the oven to 170–180°C.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002749">In a hot sauté pan or frying pan with a drizzle of oil, caramelize the cheeks, seasoning them, until browned all over, and remove to a plate. Add the vegetables and herbs to the pan and cook on a medium heat until really soft – they will deglaze the meat cooking juices. Add the red wine and reduce by almost three-quarters. Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil, then put the cheeks back into the pan – they should be swimming in the liquid. Turn off the heat, cover with foil and cook in the oven for 40–45 minutes, until the cheeks are very soft.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002750">Remove the cheeks to a tray or plate and leave to cool to room temperature (if they are still hot, they will break up when you touch them).</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002751">While the cheeks are cooling, pass their cooking liquid through a sieve – press the vegetables down in the sieve with the back of a spoon, then discard. Ladle off as much of the fat that has risen to the surface as possible. Return to the heat and reduce until you have a gravy-like consistency. Keep warm.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002752"><a id="pg67" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>Combine the salad leaves and red onion together so they are ready to dress at the last minute.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002753">Coat the cheeks first with the flour, then with the whisked egg, then with the panko crumbs. Heat some oil in a high-sided pan or sauté pan on a medium heat and, when hot, shallow-fry the pig’s cheeks until golden brown. Remove, and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0002754">When you are ready to serve, make a dressing for the salad by mixing the vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper together. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and serve with the pig’s cheeks, with the gravy in a little ramekin or bowl on the side for dipping.</p>
