<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Basques love leeks, and you find them in many of their dishes. This tart makes an elegant first course that can be served hot or cold.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE PASTRY</span></p>
<p class="qun">1⅔ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">¼ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="qun">1 large egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 tablespoons milk (if necessary)</p>
<p class="qun">½ egg white, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound leeks, trimmed, washed, and cut into 2-inch-long pieces</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">4 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="recsum">For the pastry, put the flour and salt in a bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture becomes like damp sand in texture. (You can also do this very well by putting them through the food processor, then transfer to a bowl.) Add the egg, mix well, and then work very briefly with your hands until the dough holds together in a soft ball, adding a little milk if necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Before using the dough, let it warm up and soften a little so that it becomes easier to work.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Grease an 11-inch tart pan or flan mold. Line the bottom and sides with the dough by flattening lumps in the palms of your hands and pressing them into place. Then smooth the seams. Brush the dough with the egg white and prick it in a few places with a fork.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is lightly colored. Remove from the oven and let cool.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the filling, cook the leeks in boiling salted water for about 10 minutes, until soft. Drain well and chop them, not too fine, in the food processor. Drain again to get rid of the water.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Lightly beat the eggs with a fork in a bowl, then beat in the cream. Stir in the leeks and add salt to taste. Pour into the baked crust and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top golden.</p>
