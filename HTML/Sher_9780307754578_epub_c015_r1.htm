  <p class="nonindent">Here I must begin by admitting defeat. I could never do justice to the variety of German cakes, tortes, pastries, cookies and sweet yeast-dough coffee cakes in a book this size, and in fact, those recipes deserve a volume all their own. There are the scores of baked items for which Germany is famous, plus dozens of other regional and holiday specialties that are equally good if less well known to the outside world. Dresden’s Stollen is the citron- and currant-studded sweet yeast bread we know, but there are at least six other kinds of Stollen in Germany. The same is true of the <span class="small">STRUDEL</span> varieties, the apple or crumb Kuchen, and the cream-filled honey-and-nut-encrusted beehive cake, the Bienenstich. There are even six different ways to make an authentic Nürnberger Lebkuchen, the spicy honey cookies that are sent all over the world at Christmas from the city of Albrecht Dürer the painter, Hans Sachs the Meistersinger, and Tannhäuser the Minnesinger.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many cakes and cookies that have different names are made of the same dough and taste identical, but the difference, and therefore the interest, is in their shapes and trimmings. I have tried to effect a compromise and have included some of the cakes, cookies and Christmas specialties that are German trademarks, plus a few you might not have come across before. I have also tried to give a sampling of the various types of German Gebäck.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Germans, along with their first cousins the Austrians, are unquestionably the world’s best bakers and their showcases are the Konditoreien. These attractive and comfortable shops are a cross between bakeries and coffee houses. You may buy their wares to take home, or they can be served to you with coffee (or other beverages) at tables. Newspapers and magazines hang on racks and you can read as you <a id="page410"></a>relax and enjoy whatever cake (or, more likely, cakes) you have selected. It is dazzling to step into one of these places and be greeted by spotless glass shelves and cases lined with scores of cream-filled, fruit-topped, nut-and-chocolate-encrusted, cinnamon- and sugar-rich cakes, tarts and cookies, large and small, crisp or fluffy, intricate or simple, and all lusciously, exquisitely fattening. Invariably eyes prove bigger than stomachs, but it’s easy to see why, for never has it been more difficult to make a choice. Trying to get a complete list of these cakes and cookies is even more impossible. I remember going into the wonderful Café Kranzler in Frankfurt and deciding that surely their cases must contain the complete German baking repertoire (excluding seasonal and holiday specialties of course), and so I made a list. Several days later in Baden-Baden I went into the equally wonderful and even more charming Café König, to be greeted by another huge array that repeated only about a dozen items I saw in Frankfurt. I had similar experiences in Munich, traveling between the Café Feldherrnhalle, the Glockenspiel and Germany’s most respected Konditorei, the Kreutzkamm, whose Christmas specialties are now boxed and flown to department stores all over this country by Lufthansa.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although every Konditorei has its own way of categorizing cakes on its menu (small cakes, large cakes, cream cakes, fruit tortes, yeast cakes, fruit yeast cakes, cheese yeast cakes, fruit tarts, cheese tarts, house specialties, dessert cakes and on and on and on), they are generally divided as follows:</p>

  <p class="indent">Schmalzgebäck, or “fat baked,” refers to deep-fried cakes such as doughnuts and crullers, that may or may not include yeast in the dough. Hefeteig is yeast dough. Blätterteig is puff pastry, or “leaf dough,” and Hefeblätterteig is yeast puff pastry. Backpulverteig is batter that contains baking powder; it is also known as Rührteig, or “stirred dough.” One of the best and best-known of German doughs is the sweet tart pastry Mürbteig that is the basis of many tarts, especially those that contain fruit. Brandteig is what we know as choux paste or cream puff dough. Torte is a little more difficult to define because its meaning has become obscured. At its broadest it is taken to mean any round cake; at its narrowest it is a cake that includes neither fat, starch nor leavening. It is commonly used to denote relatively flat, richly flavored, slightly chewy cakes as opposed to the high and fluffy raised cakes we see most often here. Biskuitteig, or biscuit dough, makes a dry, spongy cake. Cookies are, in German, “small baking,” or Kleingebäck, while the huge assortment of Christmas specialties are grouped under the heading of Weihnachtsgebäck or Weihnachtsbäckereien. The term Dessertgebäck cover scores of small pastries, individual tarts, tiny cake rolls filled with butter or whipped cream and crisp little lacy waffles sandwiched together with liqueur-flavored creams—all the sorts of things you might expect to find on the dessert pastry tray of a restaurant in heaven. There are more terms and categories, but these are the major ones and with them you should be able to find your way through a Konditorei menu—usually <a id="page411"></a>a sixteen- to thirty-two-page booklet complete with table of contents.</p>

  <p class="indent">Except for the small pastries, few of these cakes are ever served as desserts. Fruit, cold puddings and ice cream creations are usually taken after meals, while the cakes, tortes and tarts are reserved for between-meal snacks.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is one cake in Germany that cannot be made properly at home, but I feel you should know about it in case you happen to be near some good German Konditorei, such as Café Geiger in New York. It is called the tree cake—Baumkuchen—a sort of light poundcake with an almond flavor. This is made on a special horizontal revolving tube. Many layers of batter are poured on, each one baked before the next is added. The cakes stand on end and are anywhere from 2 to 5 feet tall. They may be iced with chocolate or white frosting and are sliced horizontally in thin half-round shavings. Each slice shows its rings of batter that look very much like the rings of age on a crosswise cut of a tree trunk. Baumkuchen is understandably expensive—about $4 or $5 a pound, but worth it. As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best cake in the world.</p>

  <p class="indent">None of this includes the breads—another craft for which the Germans have a real genius. The sour-dough ryes, the dark pumpernickels, either of the smooth, thinly sliced square Westphalian type or the big round loaves of coarse bread made in East Germany, the snowy white breads with golden crisp crusts and wonderful rolls made of rye flour and caraway seeds, these are just a few of the varieties you’ll find in Germany. Munich’s special “bricklayers’ loaves,” Maurerlaibe, are rye rolls that are just about the best I’ve ever tasted. Because bread baking is a rather specialized branch of baking, I have not included any bread recipes in this book. However, a few of what the Germans call Salzgebäck, or “salt baking” (as opposed to the sweet), follow here.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Salt baking covers all the crisp little twists and crackers the Germans make to go with soups as well as the small meat- vegetable- or onion-filled turnovers, similar to the English savories. The two crackers below <a id="page412"></a>are excellent with soup or can be served by themselves with drinks. The Swabian bacon, onion and sauerkraut cakes included are all fragrant, mouth-watering specialties to be eaten with wine or beer as light meals, in the manner of the Swiss onion tart, the Italian pizza or the French pissaladière, to which they are related. All of these can be cut in small slices, wedges or squares, to be served warm with cocktails. Salty Tart Pastry can also be served in similar ways.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 8 SERVINGS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons grated Cheddar or Parmesan cheese</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon paprika</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg yolk beaten with 1 teaspoon water</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Mix flour, cheese, salt and paprika together in a bowl and cut in butter with two knives or a pastry blender, as you would for pie crust. Mixture should have texture of coarse meal. Knead dough until it holds together and chill in refrigerator ½ hour. Roll dough out on a floured board, using a floured rolling pin. It should be about ¼″ thick. Cut into ovals, circles or strips, using a knife, a small glass or a cookie cutter. Brush with egg-yolk mixture and bake in 350° oven about 15 minutes, or until crackers are lightly browned.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="small">ABOUT 50 STICKS;</span><br />
  <span class="small">ENOUGH FOR ABOUT 6 PEOPLE</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large baking potato, ⅓ to ½ pound in weight, boiled and cooled</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ pound stick of butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>beaten egg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>coarse salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>caraway seeds</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 375°. Potato should be peeled and grated or very finely mashed. It should be completely cool. Cut butter into tiny pieces and <a id="page413"></a>blend with mashed potato on a floured pastry board. Add 1 cup flour, egg, a pinch of salt and mix well. Keep adding more flour, a little at a time, until mixture is not sticky and can be rolled. Roll out dough on a well-floured board, using a rolling pin that is also dusted with a little flour. Dough should be about ¼″ thick. Cut into long thin strips, about ⅓″ wide by 2″ long, or in any other shape you like. You can also then twist the flat strips corkscrew style. Brush strips or twists with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt and caraway seeds. Arrange on unbuttered cookie sheet and bake in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until sticks are a pleasant golden brown. Cool and serve.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">12 TO 16 POCKETS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 scant cup flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup butter (14 pound)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ pound pot cheese or well-drained cottage cheese</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups shredded, chopped or coarsely ground ham</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg, lightly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Place flour in a bowl or on a wooden board. Cut butter into small pieces and then cut into flour with two knives, a pastry blender or rub in with fingertips. Mixture should reach consistency of coarse meal. Mix in cheese and a little salt. Knead dough on a floured board until smooth enough to roll. Do not handle it so much that it becomes greasy-looking. <a id="page414"></a>Using a floured rolling pin, roll dough on a floured board until it is paper-thin. Cut in 3½″ to 4″ squares. Preheat oven to 400°.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place a mound of ham in the center of each square. Bring corners of square up toward center and pinch seams closed with your fingers or crimp with a fork. Arrange pockets on an ungreased baking sheet and brush with beaten egg. Bake in preheated oven about 20 minutes, or until pastry is crisp and golden. These are very good hot cocktail appetizers or excellent light entrees.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 recipe Basic Yeast Dough, without sugar or lemon peel and with 3 cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 pounds sauerkraut</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup lard, rendered bacon fat or butter, or 8 slices fat bacon, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons caraway seeds (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare dough. When it has risen once, punch it down and roll out to fit a cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan and let rise again in a warm place about 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°. Meanwhile prepare filling. If sauerkraut is salty or sour, rinse once or twice in a colander under running water. Press out as much water as possible. Chop kraut finely. Heat fat or fry diced bacon in a large enameled iron- or tin-lined copper skillet. When hot, add onion and sauté slowly until it begins to turn light golden brown. Add sauerkraut, salt, pepper and caraway seeds and toss until kraut is mixed with fat. Cover and steam 10 or 15 minutes, or until kraut is soft. Shake pan several times to prevent sticking and stir once or twice. Mix flour into milk to form a thin paste and stir into hot, not boiling, kraut. Simmer a minute or two until thickened, then stir in sour cream. Season to taste. Spread on top of the raised yeast dough and let rise another 15 minutes. Bake in 400° oven about 45 minutes, or until dough is crisp and brown and filling is baked into it.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Both Swabia and Stuttgart claim this onion tart. By either name it is delicious.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 recipe Basic Yeast Dough, without sugar or lemon peel and with 3 cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 large onions</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 slices bacon, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons caraway seeds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 small eggs, lightly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare dough. When it has risen once, punch it down and roll out to thickness of between ¼″ and ⅓″ to fit an oiled cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan. Set in a warm place to rise about 20 minutes. Meanwhile prepare filling. Chop onions finely and measure off 4 cupfuls. Heat butter and fry diced bacon in it slowly 3 or 4 minutes. Add onions, salt and caraway seeds; stir, cover and steam a few minutes, or until onions have melted and are soft and yellow, not brown. Shake pan and stir several times to prevent scorching. Sprinkle flour over onions and stir in until absorbed. Mix sour cream with eggs and stir into onion mixture. Cook slowly over very low heat, stirring, a minute or two, or until mixture is thick and well blended. Season to taste. Spread on top of dough and allow to rise another 15 minutes. Bake in 400° oven 30 minutes, or until dough is crisp and brown around edges and onion mixture has set into it.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Onion Tart is sometimes made with Salty Tart Pastry, instead of yeast dough. (You can even make it with your favorite pie crust or pie crust mix, but omit any sugar.) This is a little quicker, though the yeast dough tastes better. Prepare dough, set aside. Cook onions in butter and bacon, as described, and when they are soft and yellow, season with salt and caraway seeds and stir in flour. When it is absorbed, stir in 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk beaten into ½ cup sweet or sour cream. Simmer a few minutes until thick, then pour into two 9″ pie tins lined with dough. Bake in 400° oven 30 minutes, or until crust is done and crisp and top is golden brown.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 recipe Basic Yeast Dough, made without sugar or lemon peel</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>7 slices bacon, or ⅓ pound Canadian bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon breadcrumbs (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg white, beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg yolk, beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 or 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare dough. When it has risen, punch it down and cut off two-thirds. Roll this out to about ¼″ thickness, to fit an oiled cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan. Roll remainder of dough to fit same pan but leave it on the board and cover lightly with a kitchen towel. This second sheet will be much thinner than the first. To prepare filling, grind bacon once through fine blade of a food chopper, then put it through again with onion and parsley. Mix with breadcrumbs if you want mixture to be very dry and a little stiff; otherwise omit crumbs. Taste and add salt if necessary. Spread filling over dough on baking sheet and cover with the thinner sheet of dough. Seal edges by pinching together and moistening with egg white. Brush top with egg yolk and bake in preheated 350° oven about 30 minutes, or until dough is crisp and golden.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Individual tarts can easily be made with this recipe. Divide dough in half and roll out in two ¼″-thick sheets. Cut circles with a glass or cookie cutter; you may make these any size you wish, depending on whether they are to be served with cocktails, as appetizer at table or as entrees. Place a mound of filling in the center of half the circles, then cover with other circles. Pinch edges closed with a little egg white. Place on an oiled baking sheet and bake about 30 minutes in a preheated 350° oven. If you like, a little grated cheese can be sprinkled on top of each for last 10 minutes of baking time.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. If you happen to have any chicken, duck or goose cracklings (Grieben) left from fat you have rendered, crumble them and mix into filling for an especially savory touch.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This dry, light cake is the basis for all sorts of layer cakes, round and square, and is also cut and split to form many of the little iced, individually portioned petit-four-type cakes that line the shelves of Konditoreien. It can also be baked in a jelly-roll pan, filled with cream or jam and then rolled.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 eggs, separated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups fine granulated sugar grated rind of 1 lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅔ cup sifted flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅔ cup sifted cornstarch</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon baking powder (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 250°. Beat egg yolks with 2 cups sugar and lemon rind until mixture is very thick and pale yellow. Sift flour and cornstarch together. If you want to be doubly sure that your cake will rise, use baking powder, though you will have a better cake without it. If you do use it, sift it in with flour and cornstarch. Beat egg whites and as they begin to thicken beat in 1 tablespoon sugar. Continue beating until whites stand in stiff but glossy peaks. Turn egg-yolk mixture into whites and sprinkle with flour-cornstarch mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold together gently but thoroughly, until no traces of egg white or flour show. Butter and flour an 8″ to 9″ spring form or square pan. Turn batter into it and bake in preheated oven about 1 hour. Cake is done if it springs back to shape when you press it with your finger. Cool in pan 15 minutes, then turn cake out onto rack and cool completely. Split into two or three layers, which can be sprinkled with fruit juice, rum, arrack or lemon juice before they are filled and iced. Sandwich together with fruit marmalade or jelly, or any of the butter creams. Top with butter cream or icing.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Punch Torte (Punschtorte): Prepare torte in a round spring form a day before you want to serve it. Store, lightly covered, overnight. <a id="page418"></a>Cut cake in half to form 2 layers. Mix ½ cup rum with 1½ tablespoons sugar, ¼ cup water and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Moisten layers with this and sandwich together, after spreading apricot marmalade or currant, sour cherry, raspberry or strawberry jam or jelly between them. Coat sides and top with Punch Icing.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Butter Cream Torte (Buttercremetorte): Bake torte and after storing overnight, cut into layers. Flavor layers by moistening with fruit juice and/or arrack and sugar or maraschino. Prepare any of the butter creams and use between layers and on top of cake. Top with nuts, fruit or chopped praline (Krokant).</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Pineapple Torte (Ananastorte) : Prepare torte in round spring form and when cool, cut in two layers. Fill with gelatin-stiffened whipped cream, softening the gelatin in pineapple juice. Fold 1 cup drained, crushed or cubed canned pineapple into cream and spread between layers. Top with sweetened whipped cream and decorate with rings or half-rings of canned pineapple.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 eggs, separated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon vanilla extract or</em> 1 <em>tablespoon rum</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups shelled hazelnuts, walnuts or blanched almonds, coarsely grated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>rum- or vanilla-flavored whipped cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 350°. Beat yolks with 1½ cups sugar and vanilla or rum until mixture is pale yellow and thick enough to “ribbon.” Do not grate nuts too finely. If you prefer, they can be crushed by being placed in a paper bag and then rolled with a rolling pin. Turn bag over several times so nuts are evenly crushed. Walnuts and hazelnuts need not be blanched but almonds should. Beat egg whites and as they begin to thicken, add 1 tablespoon sugar; beat until whites stand in stiff but glossy peaks. Turn into a large wide bowl unless they are already in one. Stir 2 or 3 tablespoons of the beaten whites into the yolk mixture. Pour yolk mixture over whites and sprinkle with grated nuts. Using a rubber spatula, fold mixtures together, gently but thoroughly. There should be no traces of whites or nuts showing. Butter two 9″ layer cake pans or an 8″ or 9″ spring form and sprinkle lightly with flour, tapping out excess. Bake in 350° oven about 1 hour, or until cake springs back to shape when you press it down with your finger. Cool in pan until cake shrinks away from sides. Invert on rack to cool completely. If you have <a id="page419"></a>made cake in a spring form, cut into layers. Fill and top with rum- or vanilla-flavored whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Nut Roll (Nussrolle): Prepare batter but spread onto an 11″ by 16″ jelly-roll pan covered with a buttered sheet of paper. Bake until done and cool in pan. Cover with a slightly damp towel and chill for several hours or overnight. Place two large overlapping pieces of waxed paper (the seam should run lengthwise) on a pastry board and sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar. Turn cake over onto sugar and peel off waxed paper carefully. Spread with whipped cream flavored with vanilla or rum, or with Butter Cream, using nuts. Roll cake gently, jelly-roll style, using the waxed paper to lot it. Wrap paper snugly around roll and chill 1 to 2 hours before serving.

Butter a 9″ spring form or Kugelhupf mold and sprinkle with breadcrumbs on bottom and sides, tapping out excess. Turn batter into pan and bake in preheated oven about 1 hour. Cake is done when it springs back <a id="page420"></a>to shape if you press it with your finger. Cool 10 or 15 minutes, remove cake from pan and continue cooling on rack. Cut through middle to form two layers. Sprinkle top of each layer with rum or arrack. Spread a layer of jelly or marmalade between the two layers, sandwich together and cover tops and sides with icing. Decorate with candied fruit. If possible, store in refrigerator a day or two before serving, as the cake will ripen and taste better.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is the most elegant dessert torte served in Germany and Austria. Whether you make it with layers or a shell or meringue, it is filled with sweetened whipped cream and, usually, strawberries, though you could use any other fresh berries or fruit in season. If meringues are thoroughly dried in oven, they keep for several days to a week; cover them loosely with a kitchen towel or any airy cotton cloth. Add filling just before serving.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 egg whites (¾ cup)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons vinegar, or ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>teaspoon vanilla</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>cups fine granulated sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 cups sweetened whipped cream that has been mixed with sliced strawberries, whole raspberries or cut fresh fruit such as peaches, bananas or pineapple, in season</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Let egg whites stand at room temperature 20 minutes before beating, so they will not be too cold. Add vinegar or cream of tartar, salt and vanilla and beat until whites begin to form soft peaks. Gradually add sugar and continue beating until whites stand in stiff, dry peaks.</p>

  <p class="indent">This torte may be formed in either of two ways. The first is the simpler: two solid layers of meringue with the filling in between; if you like, the whipped-cream mixture can be divided in half and used as filling and topping. The second method—one solid bottom layer topped by rings to form a hollow shell—is showier if a little more intricate to assemble. To form the two solid layers, you will need either two 9″ layer-cake-pan bottoms, as from a spring form or flan ring, or one very large baking sheet. The pans may be buttered and lightly sprinkled with flour or covered with sheets of waxed paper. If you use a baking sheet, trace two 9″ circles on it. Using half the meringue for each, spread evenly to the edge of each circle. To form the fancier hollow shell, you will need two large baking sheets, buttered and floured or covered with waxed paper. Trace two 9″ circles on each baking sheet. Spread one solid layer of meringue to the edges of one circle. Put the remaining meringue in a pastry bag that is fitted with a large fluted or plain tube. <a id="page421"></a>Pipe rings of meringue, 1″ high and 1½″ wide, around the edges of two circles. Around the edge of the fourth circle, pipe a ring of kisses (small mounds) that touch each other to form a complete closed circle.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meringues should dry out rather than bake. They must remain snowy white and not brown at all. Bake in the slowest possible oven (200° to 250°) 40 minutes, or until crisp and dry. Cool and peel off waxed paper or slide off baking pans. If you have made two layers, spread half the whipped-cream filling between them. Cover top and sides with remaining filling and decorate with berries or fruit. To form the hollow shell, place the solid bottom layer on the serving dish and stack the two plain rings on it. Fill with sweetened cream and fruit and top with the circle of kisses. Garnish with whole berries or fruit slices.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Since I like very thin, crunchy cakes in preference to those that are very high and floury, this one is a great personal favorite. In addition to being absolutely delicious, it is one of the simplest to prepare, since it is more a matter of assembling than baking. It is made with layers of big, round crisp sugar wafers, similar to the French gaufrettes. These are called Carlsbad Leaves—Karlsbad Oblaten—and are sold in packages not only in German food stores but in the gourmet shops of department stores all over the country.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This cake is a favorite in Swabia as well as in neighboring French Alsace. Form is even more important than content with this cake, for it is shaped to imitate a saddle of venison—Rehrücken—a specialty in <a id="page422"></a>both of those game-loving regions. The cake itself is a chocolate torte, sometimes made with potato flour or potato, other times as an authentic butterless, flourless torte. What you must have is the correct Rehrücken pan—a long, ribbed, half-round aluminum form that looks like a miniature Quonset hut. After the cake is baked, cooled and iced it is studded with whole, halved or slivered blanched almonds that imitate the strips of lard that would spike real venison meat.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 eggs, separated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 whole eggs</em></p>

Using a rubber spatula, fold together gently but thoroughly until no whites show. Butter one 11″ Rehrücken pan, an 8″ loaf pan or an 8″ spring form, depending on the shape cake you want. Bake about 45 minutes, or until cake springs back to shape when you press it with your finger. Cool in pan 5 or 10 minutes then invert onto rack and cool completely.

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If possible, boil and peel potatoes a day ahead of time so they can dry out a little. If not, be sure they are thoroughly cold before you rice them <a id="page423"></a>or they will stick together and be difficult to blend evenly into batter. Purée potatoes through a food mill, sieve or ricer. Measure off 1¾ cupfuls and set aside. Preheat oven to 350°. Separate eggs so whites will not be too cold when you beat them. Melt chocolate over hot water. Add baking powder to flour and sift again, together, onto a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add nuts to flour and gently toss together with a fork until thoroughly blended. Cream butter with 1% cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks and when blended, beat in melted chocolate, potatoes and vanilla. Whip egg whites and as they begin to stiffen, beat in 1 tablespoon sugar. Continue beating until whites stand in stiff but glossy peaks. Beat 2 or 3 tablespoons of the stiffened egg whites into the chocolate batter to lighten it. Turn egg whites into a wide roomy bowl, unless they are already in one. Turn chocolate batter onto egg whites, and sprinkle with flour-nut mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold egg whites, chocolate batter and flour together, gently but thoroughly. There should be no traces of flour or egg white showing.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you would like to use this batter for Mock Saddle of Venison, bake in buttered Rehrücken form. Ice and decorate accordingly. Otherwise, bake in two unbuttered 9″ layer-cake pans or in an 8″ spring form. Cool in pan, invert onto rack until completely cold. If you have used spring form, cut cake into two layers. Layers may be filled with whipped cream, jam or chocolate butter cream.</p>

You do not need the sides. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons batter on each as evenly as possible. Try to avoid thinning batter near edges or they will burn. Bake in preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove to a board and cool while you bake the next batch. When all layers are baked and completely cold, spread on one side with butter cream filling and on the other with apricot marmalade. Stack them up so that there is marmalade and cream between each layer. There should be nothing on the bottom side of the bottom layer and marmalade should top the top layer.

  <p class="nonindent">Covered fruit pies as we know them are oddities in Germany. Instead, open tarts filled with fruit, fruit preserves or cheese are made in many varieties. The pastry for them is, perhaps, Germany’s greatest contribution to gastronomy. Mürbteig, literally, “mellow dough,” is tender and crisp, buttery and sweet, and good enough to be cut into cookie shapes and eaten without any topping or filling at all. In addition, it does not get soggy, a great advantage for tart shells that are to hold fruit. But perhaps its greatest claim to fame is its simplicity, for it is quick and easy to make and almost foolproof to handle. Because it is such an important and basic German baked specialty, I have given several versions of it, all of which can be used for your favorite pies. Each recipe will <a id="page427"></a>yield one 9″ pie shell, with some dough left over for lattice strips, if you want them. It is best to bake this tart in ungreased spring form or flan ring, since the loose bottom makes it easier to remove the finished pie. Leftover strips of dough, twisted together, are formed into a ring to edge the pie and prevent sides from shrinking.</p>

  <p class="indent">This tart shell is usually filled before being baked. It should be placed low in the oven so that it sets before it absorbs fruit juices and becomes soggy. When a custard or liquid is to be poured over the fruit, you can half-bake the crust in advance, but that is not strictly necessary. If you feel safer doing so, line the ungreased form with the pastry and prick the bottom with a fork. Fill the shell about halfway with dried beans, to keep it from buckling as it bakes. If edges shrink down, press them back into place with a fork or your finger. Place in the middle of a preheated 350° oven 10 minutes. Crust should just begin to turn golden but should not be crisp or brown. Discard beans and fill shell before or after it has cooled. Continue baking with filling 20 to 30 minutes, or according to specific recipes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mürbteig can be kept for several days in the refrigerator if it is wrapped in waxed paper; roll out and fill just before baking. A ring or pan lined with unbaked dough can be wrapped in foil and frozen. It is perhaps most convenient and practical to freeze the dough in disposable, inexpensive heavy-aluminum-foil pie tins. Fill and bake <em>without</em> thawing.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mürbteig made only with egg yolks is richer in color and flavor but more fragile than that made with whole eggs. Strictly speaking, baking powder is not used in this pastry, but some people add a little to make the dough flaky, especially if it is to be baked on a sheet instead of in a ring, thereby resulting in something closer to a Kuchen, or cake.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is a good idea to experiment with the various types of Mürbteig, to see which you like best and find most convenient to handle. Flavorings and sugar can be varied to suit the filling you want to use.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅓ cup finely grated unblanched almonds or other nuts (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The procedure is identical for all of these mixtures. Sift flour with salt and sugar onto a board or into a wide bowl. Cut very cold butter into small pieces and quickly work into flour mixture, using two knives, a pastry blender or, preferably, your fingertips, until mixture looks like fine meal. Combine all liquid ingredients and whichever flavorings you are using. Nuts can be mixed into dough or sprinkled on top of it before filling, or not used at all. Whether you use raw egg yolks or whites in the third version depends on the result you want. The yolks give a richer, more fragile crust; the whites produce one that is less brittle. Make a well in center of flour and gradually work flour and liquid together, using a fork or your fingers, until dough sticks together in a ball. Add a little extra flour if dough is too sticky to handle, a little more water, milk or wine if it is too dry and crumbly. Using the heel of your hand, and working very quickly, knead ball of dough on a lightly floured board. Do this twice, then reshape ball, wrap in waxed paper and chill. Do the kneading quickly so butter does not melt and give dough a dark, greasy look. When dough is well chilled and no longer sticky, it is ready for rolling. Place on a lightly floured board and roll with a floured rolling pin. Or roll between two sheets of waxed paper. Fit into ungreased spring form or flan ring (see sketch) and chill again 30 minutes to 1 hour before filling and baking.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page429"></a><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. To make flaky, slightly raised crust, sift 1 teaspoonful baking powder in with flour, sugar and salt.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. To make dough that can be baked on a sheet instead of in a round form, use the whole-egg recipe (I) with 3 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon in addition to the other ingredients. Topped with fruit or cheese and baked, this can be cut into portion strips or squares.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. The batter above is known as gebröselter, or crumbled, Mürbteig. If it seems easier, and if kneading seems a problem to you, the process can be changed a little. To do this, cream butter with sugar and mix in eggs (cooked and raw), flavorings, rind and nuts if you use them. When light and fluffy, place in well made in flour mixture and blend ingredients together, using a fork or your fingers, adding water, milk or wine only if needed to make dough stick together in a smooth ball. Wrap in waxed paper and chill 2 or 3 hours. Roll out and bake in the same way as crumbled Mürbteig. This latter method is called gerührter, or stirred, Mürbteig.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The only tricky part in making strudel is stretching the dough to a sheer pliable sheet. Practice several times before you plan to serve it to guests. Once you master the art, you’ll be able to serve one of the best and most famous desserts that ever came to Germany via Austria and Hungary. (Ideally, strudel dough should have no holes in it. As a precaution against them, it’s a good idea to remove all rings, especially those with stones that might cut through dough as your hands slip under to stretch it. I have even heard of people cutting their fingernails before making Strudel, but if you keep your hands clenched in a fist with your thumbs tucked in, this should not be necessary. If the dough does tear, ignore the holes; do not attempt to patch them.)</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons corn or peanut oil, or any other mildly flavored cooking oil but not olive oil</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg, beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup lukewarm water, approximately</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>cup melted butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>cups breadcrumbs, browned in butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>(for fillings, see recipes below)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift flour into a bowl or onto pastry board. Make a well in the center. Combine salt, oil, vinegar and beaten egg and pour into well. Using <a id="page436"></a>fingertips or a fork, work flour into liquid, gradually adding water as needed to make a soft, sticky dough. Knead vigorously on a lightly floured board, scraping dough off board as necessary with a knife. As you knead, keep lifting dough and slapping it against the table, raising it and bringing it down hard for about 15 minutes, or until the dough has been slapped down onto the board 100 or 115 times. By this time it should be elastic, smooth and no longer sticky. Rinse a bowl in very hot water, dry thoroughly and sprinkle lightly with flour. Shape dough into a ball, place it in bowl, brush top with oil and set to rest 30 minutes in a warm corner of the kitchen.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cover a large table with a pastry cloth or with a tablecloth that hangs over the edges. Sprinkle with flour, especially in center of cloth. Place dough in center, sprinkle top with flour, and with a floured rolling pin, roll into a large square, as thin as possible. Turn dough several times during rolling so it does not stick to cloth. Remove all jewelry and coat hands with flour. Slip tightly closed fists under dough, and working from center, begin to stretch it with a hand-over-hand motion. Work toward edges. Move around table so dough will be evenly stretched toward all sides. It should become as thin as tissue paper. Let sides of stretched dough hang down over edge of table. If dry spots appear in dough as you work, brush with oil to keep them supple. Trim off thick edges of dough with scissors and let sheet dry slightly 10 minutes. Do not let it become brittle. Before filling, brush melted butter onto entire surface of dough. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place filling in a row along one end of sheet of dough. Fold side flaps of dough over filling and brush with melted butter. Roll strudel, starting from filling end and using the cloth to help lift and turn dough, as you would for a jelly roll. The last roll of dough should flip the strudel onto a greased baking sheet or jelly-roll pan. Turn into a horseshoe if too long for pan. Bake in preheated 350° oven about 1 hour. Brush several times with melted butter. Strudel is done when dough is crisp as parchment and golden brown.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">To fry in deep fat correctly you need a deep saucepan, a slotted spoon for removing the cakes as they brown and, the most important piece of equipment of all, a fat thermometer. Without the latter, your cakes will be underdone or burned. If you have an electric deep fryer that is controlled by a thermostat you need no thermometer. Corn or peanut oil, lard or any of the canned white solid vegetable shortenings are best for deep frying.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The jelly doughnut may very well be the single most popular piece of pastry in the United States. It is a direct descendant of the Berliner Pfannkuchen. These cakes are usually made throughout Germany on Shrove Tuesday, or Fastnacht, and are called Fastnachtkuchen. They may be made with or without jam. They are also sometimes named after Bismarck, a favorite hero of the Prussian Berliners.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>oil or melted butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups apricot jam or Four-Fruit Marmalade</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>fat for deep frying</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Vanilla Sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page440"></a>Soften yeast in a little water according to instructions on package, adding a little sugar to speed the process, if you like. Let stand in a warm place until bubbly. Scald milk. Cream butter with sugar, salt and lemon rind. When blended, add scalded milk and stir until butter melts. When cooled to lukewarm, mix in egg yolks and 1 cup flour and dissolved yeast. Add remaining flour gradually until dough is soft and light but smooth and not sticky. Knead on floured board until elastic and smooth. Shape into ball and place in floured bowl. Brush top of dough with oil or melted butter, cover with thin kitchen towel and set to rise in a warm draft-free corner of kitchen. Let rise 1 hour, or until double in bulk. Punch down and roll on floured board to ¼″ thickness and cut rounds with a 3″ cookie cutter. Put a generous dab of marmalade or jam in center of half the circles, then top each with a plain circle of dough. Pinch edges together with a little water or egg white.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cover with towel and let rise about 45 minutes, or until again double in bulk. Heat fat to 365° and deep-fry doughnuts a few at a time, keeping fat temperature constant. Fry about 3 minutes on first side, then turn so second side can brown. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on absorbent paper. When cool, dredge with sugar.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. These are sometimes made without any filling. In that case it is not necessary to roll dough. After it has risen, punch down and pinch off pieces about the size of limes. Let rise again until double in bulk and fry.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Fill doughnuts with jelly after they have been fried. Either roll out dough to ½″ thickness or pinch off pieces, let rise and fry. When cool, fill by splitting and spooning jam into them, or squirt jam in through a long-necked pastry tube.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Bohemian Crullers (Böhmische Krapfen) are made just like unfilled doughnuts but in long narrow rolls instead of rounds. Shape by pinching off dough, then rolling between hands.</p>

When the butter has melted, stir in lemon peel, rum and almond extract if you are using it. Cool mixture <a id="page451"></a>to lukewarm. Add yeast and 2 cups flour. Mix well and set in warm draft-free corner about 15 to 30 minutes, or until dough blisters. Stir in lightly beaten eggs and gradually mix in 5 to 7 cups flour until dough is soft and light but not sticky. It should be smooth enough to be handled.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dry soaked fruit and dredge lightly with flour. Turn dough onto a floured board and knead, gradually working in fruit, almonds, and bitter almonds if you use them. Knead dough until it blisters and is smooth and elastic. Gather in a ball and place in a lightly floured bowl. Brush with melted butter. Cover loosely with a thin kitchen towel and set in warm draft-free corner about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in bulk. Punch dough down and cut into 3 equal pieces. Set aside to rest 10 minutes. Roll or flatten each third of dough into an oval ¾″ thick. Brush top of each with melted butter and sprinkle with a little sugar. Fold each lengthwise, not quite in half, so that edges are within ½″ to 1″ of meeting; pinch closed. Place loaves on a buttered baking sheet or jelly-roll pan.

They may be simple sand cakes like the one, marble cakes, poundcakes, such as the Napfkuchen (also called Health Cake, or Gesundheitskuchen), or they may be made of a rich yeast dough as the classic Kugelhupf. The Kugelhupf is the original cake to be baked in this high, round, fluted center-tube mold, a shape created after the Turks were defeated at the gates of Vienna in 1683. The Viennese bakers who helped defend their city during the siege created this victory cake, modeling it after the sultan’s turban.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Whether this is a torte or a cake is open to argument. By any name almost everyone agrees it is richly flavored poundcake that keeps for weeks. Its name is derived from its sandy texture, due mostly to the use of cornstarch. If you like a slightly less sandy texture, use half flour, half cornstarch. Although baking powder does not really belong in this cake and does make it dry out faster, many people use it to be sure the cake will rise enough and be light. I prefer it without baking powder, but you may use it if you want to be on the safe side.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page458"></a>Melt butter and chill until it has again become solid. Preheat oven to 375°. Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy, then gradually work in 5 whole eggs and 4 yolks. Add grated lemon rind, rum or arrack and vanilla and beat 30 to 40 minutes by hand, or about 10 with an electric mixer. Mixture should be very thick, almost white and about the consistency of frozen custard. Beat egg whites, and as they thicken, add 1 tablespoon sugar gradually and continue beating until whites stand in stiff but glossy peaks. Take 2 or 3 tablespoons beaten whites and stir into yolk mixture to lighten it. Turn yolks onto whites, or whites onto yolks. Put cornstarch and baking powder, if you use it, in a sifter and shake over whites or yolks. Using a rubber spatula, fold mixtures together gently but thoroughly until there are no traces of whites or flour.</p>

  <p class="indent">Butter and flour a 9″ or 10″ Kugelhupf form, or 2 small or 1 large loaf pan. Pour batter into pan and bake 1 to 1¼ hours, or until cake is done. To test, insert toothpick in center of cake; if it comes out clean, cake is done. Cool 15 minutes in pan, then invert onto rack and continue cooling. Sprinkle with Vanilla Sugar and serve thinly sliced. Keep cake 24 hours before cutting, as this improves its flavor. Store in refrigerator, lightly covered with foil or waxed paper.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Sand Cake with Almonds (Sandkuchen mit Mandeln) : When cake is half baked sprinkle with ¾ cup granulated sugar and ¾ cup slivered or coarsely chopped unblanched almonds. If you like, sugar can be mixed with a little cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Spice Sand Cake (Gewürzsandkuchen): When you are creaming butter, sugar and eggs, add a pinch each of powdered cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and grated rind of 1 lemon. Omit vanilla but use rum. If you like, you can add 2 or 3 tablespoons mixed citron, candied angelic and orange peel, in which case add a pinch of cream of tartar to egg whites as you beat them.</p>

They are among the dozens of little twists and curls and rolls with names such as snails (Schnecken), rose cakes (Rosenkuchen) and windmills (Windmühlen), made of Basic Yeast Dough, or, sometimes, Rich Tart Pastry. Prepare dough or pastry. Roll out to a thickness just under 14,” and with a pastry cutter, brush with melted butter and cut triangles. The fillings may be a little marmalade, a mixture of raisins or currants and cinnamon with sugar, or chopped hazelnuts with sugar and enough sour or sweet cream to bind the mixture. Place filling in a dab just below base side of triangle and roll toward point. Yeast dough horns should rise until double in bulk. Bake dough horns on buttered and floured baking sheet. Bake pastry horns on unbuttered sheet. Brush tops with beaten egg yolk. Bake in 350° oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until dough is crisp and golden. Cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Square or rectangular cookies with a design printed on them in relief are among Germany’s most famous Christmas cookies. It is said that these date back to pagan times when, during a winter festival, people had to sacrifice animals to the gods. The poor, having no animals they could afford to slaughter, made token sacrifices by way of cookies with animal forms on them. Eventually all sorts of designs were used besides animals: fruits, human figures in fancy dress, etc. Springerle, Spekulatius, Frankfurter Prenten, Albert Cakes, Nürnberg and Munich “marzipan” are a few of the better-known variations on this theme. For Springerle designs, impressions are made with a decorated board or a rolling pin that makes many cookies on a single sheet of dough. Spekulatius forms are smaller, individual designs, one to a wood block. You may use them interchangeably, and if you can find antique boards of this type, you should be able to get some beautifully sculptured cookies.</p>

  <p class="indent">To be authentic, these cookies must be made with a Prenten form. Unlike the Springerle forms and Spekulatius boards, these are designs that are completely outlined in silhouette, not set in square shapes. If you cannot get them, use a Springerle form, but try to follow the relief outline with a sharp pointed knife and remove the solid background <a id="page466"></a>around the design. If that seems like too much trouble, just bake the printed, unsilhouetted cookie. Flour whichever form you are using and press design into dough. Cut cookies apart.

  <p class="nonindent">This is Germany’s most outstanding contribution to the confectioners’ art. Finely ground almonds, bound with egg white and flavored with sugar, are shaped into all sorts of beautiful little fruits, vegetables and figures that are colored, frosted and decorated at Christmastime. Lübeck’s marzipan is the world’s best, though that of Odense in Denmark does run a close second. You can buy prepared marzipan in block form, in German food shops and gourment food departments, and mold it yourself. You can also buy some of the candies already formed and colored, but these are harder to get in good quality unless you are near a German confectioners’ shop, such as there are in New York’s Yorkville.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you cannot get the block marzipan, prepare your own according to the following recipe. Instructions follow for shaping forms and designs. Chocolate-covered marzipan is also available, but the uncoated almond paste is far better, in my opinion.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Confectioners’ and granulated sugar, flavored with vanilla bean, orange or lemon peel, are very useful to have on hand for baking. They lend a fragrant final touch to cakes, pies and cookies and can also be used in recipes calling for vanilla, lemon or orange flavoring, when you want to keep liquid ingredients to a minimum or for easier blending. Confectioners’ sugar is the most useful of the two, although certain German cakes, such as Berlin Jelly Doughnuts, are sometimes dusted with granulated sugar. It is very simple to prepare these in advance, to have them on hand when you need them.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">When whipping cream, be sure the cream and the mixing bowl are cold, especially in hot weather. Otherwise the mixture will turn to butter in a split second. On a very hot day, whip cream in a bowl that is set in a bed of ice. Use heavy sweet cream for whipping. If you want the cream sweetened, use 1 to 2 tablespoons fine, quick-dissolving granulated sugar to 1 cup cream. Start to beat cream and as it thickens, add sugar and continue beating until whipped. Use at once or store in refrigerator. Whipped cream can be made up to 3 hours ahead of time.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page476"></a>To make Vanilla Whipped Cream (Vanilleschlagrahm), add sugar plus 1 teaspoon vanilla extract after cream has begun to thicken.</p>

  <p class="indent">To make Rum, Brandy, Kirsch or Maraschino Whipped Cream, add 1 to 3 tablespoons of whichever flavor you are using to the cream as it thickens. Also add sugar, adjusting amount to suit sweetness of the liqueur you are using.</p>

  <p class="indent">To make Chocolate Whipped Cream (Schokoladenschlagrahm), add 2 tablespoons sifted cocoa or 3 tablespoons finely grated bittersweet chocolate. Adjust sugar to taste. Vanilla can be added along with the chocolate, or some rum or a little very strong black coffee if you prefer.</p>

  <p class="indent">To make Coffee Whipped Cream (Kaffeeschlagrahm), add 1 teaspoon powdered instant coffee or instant espresso coffee. Sweeten to taste. A little coffee liqueur is also good added to this, about 1 teaspoon to a cup of cream.</p>

Soften 1 scant teaspoonful powdered unflavored gelatin in 1 tablespoon of cold water, or in any liqueur you want to use to flavor the cream. Set over hot water until gelatin dissolves. Whip 1½ cups heavy sweet cream, adding sugar, dissolved gelatin and a little more liqueur or flavoring as needed when cream begins to thicken.

  <p class="nonindent">Dark bittersweet chocolate grated on the coarsest side of a metal grater can be used to decorate the tops and sides of cakes. For thicker curls of chocolate, melt 1 cup dark semi-sweet chocolate bits or 3 ounces semi-sweet baking chocolate (Baker’s German Chocolate is very good for this) over hot water. Butter a flat, rimmed 10″ dinner plate and pour chocolate onto it. When firm but not brittle, “shave” the surface with a knife; the chocolate will peel off in curls.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1¼ cups milk or half-and-half</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon vanilla or small piece of vanilla bean</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page481"></a>Beat egg yolks with sugar until thick and pale yellow. Mix flour in lightly-until blended. Scald milk with vanilla bean if you are using it. If you are using extract, add it later. Pour scalded milk into egg-yolk mixture, slowly in a thin stream, stirring as you do so. Turn mixture into a saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat as soon as cream reaches boiling point; do not boil. Add vanilla extract if you are using it, or remove bean. Cool and stir before using. Brush with a little melted butter to prevent skin from forming. This filling can be used for éclairs, Honey Bee Cake, or whenever you want an egg custard filling.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Chocolate Custard Filling: Stir 2 squares of melted dark baking chocolate into cream after it has cooked but before it has cooled. Use vanilla with the chocolate and 5 egg yolks instead of 6.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Rum Custard Filling: Instead of vanilla, stir 2 tablespoons rum into custard after it has cooked.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Almond Custard Filling: Add 1 teaspoon almond extract to custard, instead of vanilla. Crushed bitter macaroons (Italian amaretti) can also be added for interesting texture and an almond flavor. Use about 8 macaroons.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melted jam glazes are often used between layers or on sides and tops of cakes that may or may not be covered with additional icing. If you use a jam or preserves, rub through a sieve. That step is not necessary for jelly. Heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until jam or jelly is bubbling and thin. Flavor to taste with brandy, kirsch, rum, arrack, apple wine or any fruit liqueur. One cup of jam or jelly will be enough for three 9-inch layers. Apricot and orange jam or marmalade, currant jelly and strawberry and raspberry preserves are most commonly used in this way. Damson plum preserves are also very good flavored with rum.</p>
