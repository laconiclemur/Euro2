<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_66"/><b>Grapefruit Gratin</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Honey–Saffron Sabayon</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Nut Brittle</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I love all sorts of fruit—well, perhaps with the exception of durian. Here, I am using pink grapefruit, which is one of my favorites. I find it so refreshing with its own mix of sweet and sour. The combination of honey and saffron in the sabayon makes it seem really exotic, too, as well as light and frothy on top of the sharp grapefruit. It does seem as if they were all meant for each other.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE NUT BRITTLE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxta">⅓ cup blanched or unblanched hazelnuts, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE GRAPEFRUIT AND SABAYON</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch saffron strands, infused in</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons warm water</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 large pink grapefruit, scrubbed and patted dry</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the nut brittle, line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat the sugar in a dry, nonstick skillet over medium heat until the sugar melts and turns a light brown caramel and reaches 320°F on a candy thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the hazelnuts. Return the pan to the heat until the caramel becomes liquid again, stirring to coat the nuts completely.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Immediately pour the hazelnut mixture into the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a second sheet of paper, then, using a rolling pin, roll into a thin, even layer about ¼ inch thick. Leave to cool and harden, then remove the paper and break into small pieces. Alternatively, put in a food processor and pulse to a coarse crumble consistency. Leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To make the sabayon, heat the saffron water in a small pan over low heat until it reduces by one-third and turns dark orange in color. Pass it through a strainer into a large heatproof bowl. Leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Finely grate the zest of one of the grapefruit, then peel all of them, removing the skin and white pith. Segment the grapefruit over a strainer suspended over a saucepan to catch the juices. Line a cookie sheet with a clean dish towel, then put the segments on the prepared sheet and leave to dry slightly.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Add the honey to the grapefruit juices and bring to a boil over medium heat, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 6 to 8 minutes until it reduces to a thick syrup. Add the syrup and egg yolks to the saffron water and mix together. Set the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Beat the mixture, using an electric mixer, 8 to 10 minutes until it turns pale and thick.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Meanwhile, heat the broiler to high. Put the grapefruit segments in fan shapes on four flameproof serving plates. Spoon the sabayon over the tops to cover the segments, then broil briefly until light golden brown. Sprinkle with the nut brittle and serve.</p>
