<p class="summary1">Pipirrana<span class="italic">, also called</span> mojete, <span class="italic">is part of a family of salads based on chopped or pureed tomatoes. In this case, the tomatoes are roasted and turned into a sauce with a sweet intense flavor. These were the traditional foods of agricultural laborers of Andalusia, Murcia, and La Mancha. On festive occasions, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, and black olives would be added.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 red bell peppers</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound tomatoes</p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun1">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the peppers and tomatoes on a sheet of foil on a baking sheet and roast in a preheated 500°F oven. Take the tomatoes out after about 15 minutes, when they have softened a bit and their skins have loosened.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Turn the peppers over and continue to roast for an additional 15 minutes, or until they are soft and their skins have blistered and blackened in parts. To loosen the skins further, put the peppers in a sturdy plastic bag, twist it shut, and let steam and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, peel the tomatoes, discarding the hard white bits at the stem end, and chop them.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel them, remove the stems and seeds, and cut them into strips about ⅔ inch wide. Reserve their juices to add to the salad.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Sauté the garlic in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet for seconds only, just until the aroma rises. Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste, and the sugar and cook over high heat for about 8 minutes, or until reduced to a sauce. Stir in the peppers.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve at room temperature or chilled, sprinkled with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the juices from the peppers.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">In La Mancha, <span class="italic">asadillo</span> is a similar salad of roasted red peppers simply dressed with fresh tomatoes blended to a cream with extra virgin olive oil and a little crushed garlic.</p>
