<p class="yield">MAKES ABOUT TWELVE 10-INCH/25-CM CRÊPES; SERVES 4</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">There are three main versions of crêpe-like filloas in Galicia. Two are savory kinds from the interior, ancient dishes once cooked during the winter <em>matanza</em>, the important pork butchering season, and during the Carnival festivities in February. Of these, one is prepared with a simple stock made of pig’s feet, the other with blood from the pig. This recipe is—regrettably for some, happily for most—a third version, <em>al natural</em>. More similar to French crêpes, this is by far the most popular of the trio.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     But even if these crêpes are “sweet,” it is typical to use a piece of <em>tocino</em> (fat back) to grease the pan between frying. That, surely, gives them a distinctive Spanish touch.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 EGGS</li>
<li>2 CUPS/480 ML MILK</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>2 CUPS/255 G ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON BRANDY OR COGNAC</li>
<li>BUTTER FOR GREASING PAN, OR A PIECE OF TOCINO (FAT BACK)</li>
<li>POWDERED SUGAR FOR DUSTING</li>
<li>FRESH WHIPPED CREAM FOR GARNISHING</li>
<li>HONEY FOR DRIZZLING</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large bowl, beat the eggs with the milk. Add a pinch of salt and begin adding the flour while continuing to beat, until it has the consistency of a smooth, loose, and thin batter. Let sit for 1 hour in a cool place. Add the brandy and whisk again.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Preheat a 10-inch/25-cm nonstick skillet or crêpe pan over medium heat. Grease the pan with butter using a piece of folded paper towel or pastry brush. Ladle in about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup/75 ml batter and immediately swirl and slightly roll the pan to evenly coat the bottom in a thin layer of batter. Cook until bubbles appear in the surface and the edges begin to just curl away from the sides of the pan, about 1 minute or so. Loosen with the help of a thin spatula and then flip. Cook on the other side until golden, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Transfer to a plate and repeat until all of the batter is used, greasing the pan between each crêpe. Place a sheet of parchment or wax paper between each. Reheat the first ones briefly in the pan before serving.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Dust with powdered sugar and serve with the whipped cream and honey to add as desired.</p>
