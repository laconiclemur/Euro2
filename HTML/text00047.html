</h1>
<p class="pf">My new husband was a very picky eater. Pasta was out. So was rice. He was a meat-and-potatoes guy. In fact, I was told that the hot lunch cooks at Warba would save food for Dick if they knew the menu the next day would include something he didn’t like—like Spanish rice or spaghetti.</p>
<p>Still, little by little, he became more adventurous. While traveling in Italy, we stopped in Rome, hoping to tour the catacombs, the underground tunnels that were used to bury bodies along the Old Appian Way. I think we were attracted to the area because we knew of pizza mixes that were titled “Appian Way.” We had to wait an hour or so for the attraction to open, so we found an outdoor café in the meantime. We were served the most delicious veal-stuffed cannelloni with a creamy Parmesan sauce that completely changed Dick’s mind about pasta. At another meal in Rome, a deep plate of lemon risotto changed his long-standing opinion about rice. But the last thing to go was his total disdain for lamb.</p>
<p>When I was on the staff at <i>Sunset</i>
, we were doing a feature story on lamb and I brought food home from the test kitchen for dinner every night for a week. I told him it was veal, and he devoured it. The following weekend, we were invited to a friend’s home for dinner. She had prepared moussaka. My husband, of course, asked what was in it.</p>
<p>When he was told the ingredients, he responded that he didn’t eat lamb. That’s when I let him in on my secret; he’d been eating lamb all week. The moussaka was delicious, and better than that, it was the last breakthrough into a whole world of food acceptance. Today, Dick will try anything—even a diet of breakfasts with no toast!</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Moussaka</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This is an adaptation of the recipe we used at <i>Sunset</i>
. I make this today with the ground lamb from our son Greg’s farm in Missouri.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="rpil">2 large eggplants (2½ to 3 pounds total) cut into ½-inch thick slices</p>
<p class="rpil">2 pounds lean ground lamb</p>
<p class="rpil">2 large onions, chopped</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, oregano, and salt</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon each nutmeg and pepper</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup each tomato catsup and water</p>
<p class="rpil">¾ cup dry red wine</p>
<p class="rpil">1 can (about 15 ounces) Italian-style tomatoes, drained (save liquid) and chopped</p>
<p class="rpill">½ cup minced parsley</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Custard Topping</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">½ cup (1 stick) butter</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">4 cups milk</p>
<p class="rpil">6 eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon each ground nutmeg and white pepper</p>
<p class="rpill">2½ cups grated Parmesan or hard Greek cheese</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Divide the butter and oil evenly between 2 large rimmed baking pans. Place the pans in the oven as it is preheating and tilt the pans to distribute the mixture evenly. Arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer in the pans and turn to coat with the butter-and-oil mixture. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes, turning the eggplant slices once. Continue baking for 15 minutes more until the eggplant is soft. Drain the eggplant slices on paper towels.</p>
<p class="rp">Crumble the lamb into a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring often, until onions are soft. Spoon off and discard the excess fat.</p>
<p class="rp">Stir in the flour, cinnamon, oregano, salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Slowly stir in the catsup, water, wine, tomatoes with the liquid, and parsley. Cook, stirring, until thick, about 15 minutes; set aside.</p>
<p class="rp">For the custard topping, melt the butter and stir in the flour; cook, stirring, until bubbly. Gradually stir in the milk and cook, stirring, until bubbly and thickened. Beat the eggs with the nutmeg and pepper. Gradually stir in 1 cup of the hot white sauce; then pour the egg mixture into the remaining white sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese.</p>
<p class="rp">Arrange half the cooked eggplant in a greased 9- by 13-inch baking dish; evenly spread with the meat sauce and top with the remaining eggplant. Spread the custard topping evenly over all. (At this point you may let cool, then cover and refrigerate the dish until the next day.)</p>
<p class="rp">Bake in the 350°F oven, uncovered, for 50 minutes or 1 hour if refrigerated, or until the custard is bubbly at the edges and center feel firm. Cut into squares to serve.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 8 to 10 servings</p>
