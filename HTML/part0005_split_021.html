			<p class="rec-intro">In France, this dish is cooked with thrushes in early autumn, when the birds have been gorging themselves on the remaining grapes on the vines, but in England you could use partridges. I always serve these with a few ceps and some thick slices of grilled baguette that have been rubbed with garlic and doused in olive oil. </p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp sultanas or golden raisins</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 thick slices of brioche</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">enough milk to soften the brioche</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">brandy</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g good-quality saucisson</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 partridges, cleaned</p>

			<p class="body">Put the sultanas in a pan of cold water and bring to the boil, then drain and leave to cool. </p>
			<p class="body">Cut the brioche into 2cm cubes and douse them with a little milk and brandy until soaked. Peel the saucisson and cut it into 2cm cubes. </p>
			<p class="body">Stuff the cavity of each partridge with a few sultanas, cubes of brioche and saucisson. Thread the birds on to the rotisserie skewer, season and brush with a little olive oil. Cook gently until the skin is golden and the meat is cooked but still pink – this should take about 40 minutes, depending on how fierce the heat is or how near to the flame the birds are. Serve with ceps and grilled baguette as above.</p>
			<p class="body">Alternatively, preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Rub the stuffed partridges with butter and oil and roast for about 20 minutes. The meat should be cooked but still pink. </p>
