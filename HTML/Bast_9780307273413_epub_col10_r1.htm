    <p class="nonindent">Molise, the second-smallest region in Italy (after the Valle d’Aosta), is also its newest: until 1963, it was joined with Abruzzo. It has a relatively small economy, focusing on agriculture and, on the coast, fishing.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Campobasso</strong>, the regional capital, has been destroyed by earthquakes throughout the ages, but the heart of the city, crowned by the massive Castello Monforte, still boasts ancient churches and winding medieval roads; I am almost surprised, when walking a narrow Campobasso alley, suddenly to spill out onto a large piazza with tall trees. It is through these streets that, in June, the region’s most important festival, Sagra dei Misteri (Festival of Mysteries), makes its way, a winding parade of wooden religious symbols.</p>

    <p class="extract">Not far from Campobasso is <strong class="calibre13">Saepinum</strong>, a town founded by Samnites, a highly civilized people who predated the Romans. When the Romans themselves moved in, they built a theater and temples to Apollo and Jupiter, the remains of which can still be seen.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Isernia</strong>, another ancient Roman city, boasts a Roman aqueduct and bridge, and its streets still follow the Roman grid network of <em class="calibre4">cardo</em> and <em class="calibre4">decumanus</em>, the two main intersecting streets. The elegant Fraterna Fountain reuses old Roman stonework and looks like a mini-palazzo, with six portico arches in front.</p>

    <p class="extract">I once went to <strong class="calibre13">Larino</strong> in late May for the festival in honor of the town’s patron saint, San Pardo. The whole town was decorated, and hundreds of carts, covered in handmade silk flowers, were pulled through the city streets by snow-white oxen. Larino’s cathedral is one of the most ornate in Molise, and its amphitheater the oldest in all of Italy.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Termoli</strong> is a busy port and one of Molise’s best beach resorts. Its cathedral houses the relics of martyrs brought back to Termoli after the Crusades. The imposing castle, built in the thirteenth century by Frederick II, once protected Termoli from pirates and marauding Saracens (maybe they wanted their bones back).</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Agnone</strong> is a musical town, famous for bells, from lowly cow bells to ornate pontifical bells. But I come to Agnone to see Luca Giordano’s moving portrait of the Holy Family in the Church of San Marco. Like most of Giordano’s paintings, it is an upward spiral of movement, all billowing robes and dramatic light.</p>

    <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page290"></a>Anyone who enjoyed Umberto Eco’s <em class="calibre4">Name of the Rose</em> will want to visit the <strong class="calibre13">Castel San Vincenzo</strong>, situated on a high plain with snow-covered mountains in the distance. Originally built to defend the Benedictines from the Saracens, the Castel contains the ninth-century Abbey of San Vincenzo al Volturno; its frescoes are a treat for the eye. In the Crypt of the Epiphany, you’ll find the martyrdom of St. Stephen, but my favorite is the martyrdom of St. Lawrence, or San Lorenzo; he is being grilled at a very high temperature but merely appears to be sunbathing.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Monteroduni</strong> wins the prize for Molise’s most impressive castle, the Pignatelli. I love its square shape and four cylindrical towers, one on each corner. Built, destroyed, and rebuilt, the castle is at the apex of the town, and houses objects from the Pignatelli family, a museum devoted to local agricultural life. It even has an old torture chamber.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
