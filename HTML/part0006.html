  <p class="txc">Although French crêpes can be served like pancakes, they differ from pancakes in thickness and feel. Brittany is the region most associated with French crêpes. There they are served in various ways, either as a dessert or as a main dish. As the latter, it can be served with ham, cheese, eggs, béchamel sauce, or various other ingredients. As a dessert, they can be accompanied by chocolate, various fruits, caramel, sugar, flambé, crème fraîche, or crème Chantilly.</p>

  <p class="ing">Ingredients</p>

  <p class="txc1">1 cup of flour</p>

  <p class="txc1">¼. tsp. of salt</p>

  <p class="txc1">1 Tbsp. of sugar</p>

  <p class="txc1">2 large eggs or 3 small eggs</p>

  <p class="txc1">1½ cup of milk</p>

  <p class="txc1">1 tsp. of vanilla extract (optional, for crêpes served for dessert or breakfast)</p>

  <p class="break"> </p>

  <p class="tx">1. Mix all dry ingredients (flour, salt, and sugar) in a sufficiently large bowl and create a depression in the middle. Break the eggs and pour them into the depression. Add the milk and the vanilla extract and mix until the batter is completely smooth, using an electric mixer if desired. Let the batter rest for a few minutes (30 minutes is optimal).</p>

  <p class="tx">2. Heat a small frying pan over medium heat, add butter to the pan, and allow to melt. Scoop between 2 and 3 tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Tip and rotate the pan to spread the batter as thinly as possible. Flip to allow both side to become lightly browned. Repeat for the remaining batter.</p>
