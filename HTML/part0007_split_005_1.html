  <h3 class="h3a"><a id="ch1sec4a" class="calibre1"></a>Beef broth</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">When I make <em class="calibre4">brodo di carne</em> I always choose beef brisket, an inexpensive boneless cut from the breast of the animal. Brisket is one of the toughest cuts of beef and is perfect for slow cooking, gradually becoming tender and releasing its flavour. This is one of my favourite comfort foods, especially in cold weather. I like to cook some tortellini in the broth for a first course and then serve the boiled beef and vegetables as a main; or use the beef to make a <a href="part0009_split_005.html#ch3sec5a" class="calibre1">salad</a> or <a href="part0009_split_006.html#ch3sec6a" class="calibre1">meatballs</a>. The beef broth can be made a couple of days in advance and kept in the fridge, leaving the meat and vegetables in the liquid. The beef broth can also be used as <a id="pg21" class="calibre1"></a>stock for soups and stews, and can be frozen.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz beef brisket</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large onion</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large carrots</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 celery stalks with leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 turnips</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="para">Put the meat in a large saucepan and add 3 litres/5¼ pints/3 quarts cold water, making sure the meat is covered – if necessary, add more water. Bring to the boil. You will notice scum appearing on the surface; remove this with a slotted spoon.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the rest of the ingredients, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 3 hours.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove the meat and vegetables from the pan and set aside. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve. To serve as a soup, pour the broth back into the pan and reheat, cooking some tortellini or small pasta shapes in the broth if you like. Slice the meat and cut the vegetables into chunks to serve after the broth.</p>
