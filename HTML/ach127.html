<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_246"/><a id="ach127"/>stuffed beef rolls</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">braciole</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are many variations on this basic recipe, and it seems that every southern Italian family has its own version. My mother prefers to stuff several pieces of beef round pounded to <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub>-inch thickness, brown them, and then add them to a simple tomato sauce.</p>
<p class="indentb">The tomato sauce is served over pasta as a first course, and the meat is sliced and served as a second course, followed by salad. This entire recipe may be prepared in advance. Cover and refrigerate for up to three days or freeze for up to one month.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 pieces beef round for braciola (about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds total)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 cloves garlic, minced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup freshly grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry red wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can), pureed in a blender</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place each piece of meat between two sheets of waxed paper and pound until it is about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the pieces evenly with equal portions of the garlic, cheese, and parsley. Gently roll up the meat, pressing the filling into it, to make a tight roll. Tuck in the ends and secure the rolls with butcher’s string. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the olive oil in a wide, deep saucepan set over medium heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the onions. Cook until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan with a slotted spoon. Add the beef rolls to the pan and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Return the onions to the <a id="page_247"/>pan. Add the wine and cook, scraping to loosen any meat that has stuck to the bottom of the pan. When the wine has reduced slightly, about 1 minute, remove the meat rolls from the pan to a plate and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Add the tomatoes to the saucepan. Season with salt and pepper and simmer to warm through, about 10 minutes. Return the meat rolls to the pan, along with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. The meat should be completely submerged in the sauce. Simmer gently, with the cover of the pan slightly askew, until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened, about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours.</p>
