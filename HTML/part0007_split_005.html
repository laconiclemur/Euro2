			<p class="rec-intro">Globe artichokes were a real treat for me as a child, but I remember my English friends coming round for dinner and being quite scared when they saw these alien things on the plate. I loved the sheer delight and fun of tearing off the leaves, dipping them into the vinaigrette, and finally drawing the leaf through clenched teeth to leave a morsel of deliciously deep-flavoured artichoke. When all the leaves have been chewed, only the heart and the inedible choke is left. This needs to be lifted or scraped out with a spoon. Add another drizzle of vinaigrette and one of the most classic and satisfying starters is complete.</p>

			<p class="body">Snap off the stems and place the artichokes in a deep pan. Cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt and the lemon quarters. Bring the water to the boil and simmer the artichokes gently for 30–40 minutes. You may need to put a plate on top of the artichokes to keep them submerged. Take the artichokes out of the water and drain, then check they are done by pulling off a couple of leaves.</p>
			<p class="body">Whisk all the vinaigrette ingredients together and serve with the artichokes. I think they are best served warm, but you can put them in the fridge and eat them the next day.</p>
