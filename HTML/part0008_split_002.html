<p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">What do four French girls eat when they gather at home for a girls’ night in? I always ask my friend Isabelle if she would bring her wonderful</em> Endives au Jambon<em class="calibre7">. You could not make me eat raw endives (so bitter!) but somehow, in this recipe, they are transformed into something fabulous.</em></p><p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">This is not the kind of meal served in French restaurants, but you will find it on people’s kitchen tables throughout France. This is French comfort food at its most basic and pleasurable.</em></p><div id="c05s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre24"><b class="calibre4">Endive in ham and béchamel sauce</b></span></p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre24"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for four (8 servings)</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">8 medium/large heads of white endive</p><p class="calibre6">1 large pot of unsalted water</p><p class="calibre6">8 slices of plain ham (not too thin), not flavored or smoked.</p><p class="calibre6">8 oz grated Gruyere cheese</p><p class="calibre6">3 oz butter</p><p class="calibre6">¾ cup flour</p><p class="calibre6">4 cups milk</p><p class="calibre6">1 pinch of nutmeg</p><p class="calibre6">pepper and salt to taste</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre24"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- Trim the bottom of each endive. If there are blemishes you can remove outer leaves, if not leave as is and rinse.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Boil the water. Add the endive and cook on medium boil until you can easily pierce them with a knife. Drain.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Butter an ovenproof dish pretty enough to bring to the table (about 9 x 12).</p><p class="calibre6">4- Roll a slice of ham neatly around each cooked head of endive and place in the center of the buttered dish.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Time to make a béchamel sauce. But first taste your ham and your cheese. The amount of salt you add to the béchamel will depend on how salty they are.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Melt butter in a medium sauce pan.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Add flour and stir until absorbed. Do not let it brown.</p><p class="calibre6">8- Little by little add all the cold milk while stirring.</p><p class="calibre6">9- Stir for a while, about 15 to 20 minutes (if you start with warm milk it will take less time).</p><p class="calibre6">10- Add salt, pepper, and a hint of nutmeg to taste.</p><p class="calibre6">11- When it has achieved the consistency of pudding, pour the béchamel on top of the ham-wrapped endive.</p><p class="calibre6">12- Top with all the grated cheese.</p><p class="calibre6">13- Place in a hot oven for up to 30 minutes, until the cheese has obtained a nice golden color. You can place it briefly under the broiler to achieve this, but beware, Swiss cheese burns quickly.</p></div></div></body></html>
