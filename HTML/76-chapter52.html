<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Spinach was being grown in Sevilla by the eleventh century, brought, like many new products during those centuries, by Arab traders. It adapted well to the land and into the cuisine, and frequently partners now with a host of various other ingredients in the pan—both savory and sweet. One of the latter is raisins, which in Catalunya you find paired with pine nuts, while in Granada, cooks tend to toss in roughly chopped toasted almonds instead. This recipe is quick to prepare, especially using fresh baby spinach leaves. If using whole spinach leaves, closely trim the stems and thoroughly wash with plenty of fresh running water.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>¼ CUP/35 G SEEDLESS RAISINS</li>
<li>12 OUNCES/340 G TRIMMED FRESH BABY SPINACH LEAVES</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>¼ CUP/35 G PINE NUTS</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a small bowl, cover the raisins with warm water and soak for 10 minutes; drain. Spread out on paper towels to dry (to avoid splattering when cooking).</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Meanwhile, wash the spinach in a couple of changes of water and drain. Put in a large pot, cover with a lid, and wilt over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain off excess liquid.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a small sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the raisins and pine nuts and cook, stirring frequently, until the pine nuts are golden and the raisins plump, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Put the spinach in a serving bowl and season with salt and pepper. Spoon in about half of the raisins and pine nut mixture with the oil from the pan and toss. Spoon the remaining mixture over top. Serve immediately.</p>
