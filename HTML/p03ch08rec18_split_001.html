</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Fishermen in the north of Spain around the Bay of Biscay caught hake when they went whaling in the northern seas, and Basque chefs gave it a prestigious place in Spanish gastronomy. This is one of their favorite recipes for this long slender fish with a delicate flesh, but you can use other fish, such as monkfish or cod. Parsley is the Basque herb par excellence. The sauce, with olive oil, garlic, and parsley, acquires an unctuous texture from the juices of the fish itself. The skin plays a part, so do not remove it. The asparagus cooking water is also part of the sauce.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound asparagus, hard bottom ends removed</p>
<p class="qun">3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup mild extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1½ teaspoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun1">2 hake steaks (6 to 7 ounces each)</p>
<p class="recsum">Cook the asparagus in boiling, salted water to cover until tender. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Stir the garlic in the oil in a large skillet over low heat for a few seconds; do not let it brown. Add the flour and stir for a minute. Add the parsley, then gradually add the reserved 1 cup asparagus cooking water, stirring vigorously until the sauce thickens. Add salt and simmer gently for about 8 minutes, until the sauce thickens a little more.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Put in the fish steaks and swirl the pan without removing it from the heat, so as to move the fish steaks very gently around. This allows the white liquid they release to mix with the sauce and give it a slightly gelatinous texture. (You can cheat by moving the steaks around with a wooden spoon.) After 5 minutes, turn the fish steaks over, arrange the asparagus around them, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the fish only just begins to flake away from the bone when you cut into it with a pointed knife.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Use peas instead of asparagus.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Omit the asparagus and use 1 cup fish stock instead of the asparagus water. Add 8 clams (see page 127) when you have turned over the fish, and continue with the lid on to steam them open.</p>
