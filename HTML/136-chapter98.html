<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Most Spanish clam preparations are pretty straightforward, and cooked so that the shellfish don’t lose their delicate flavors. Steaming them open in a pot with some white wine is common across Spain, with the differences mostly in the type of wine. In Galicia, cooks reach for their minerally, fruity Albariño <a href="141-boxnote21.html#page_204"><span class="red">(see page 204)</span></a>, while in the Basque Country they might tip in some young Txakoli. In Andalucía, they add a <em>chorro</em> (shot) of one of the various dry sherries produced around Jerez.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     My favorite way to prepare clams is using an aged sherry like amontillado, with its rich hazelnut and, at times, tobacco notes, or else oloroso. Deep amber-toned and highly aromatic—the name means “scented”—oloroso carries hints of toasted nuts, dried fruits, even raisins. If you don’t have either of these, use a trick that I learned from one wine store owner who was loath to sell me such an elegant, unique wine for cooking: Use a dry white wine and some drops of brandy to give it some depth of color and flavor. Try to find large, meaty clams that will absorb the sherry’s perfume.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Purge the clams of any sand by soaking in salty water following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Discard any clams with broken shells.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the garlic. Cook until fragrant and just golden, about 1 minute. Do not let it burn. Add the sherry, stir in the flour, and bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes to burn off the alcohol, and then add the clams. Cover and cook, stirring and shaking the pan, until the clams have opened, about 5 minutes. Discard any clams that did not open.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Transfer the clams and sauce to a deep serving platter, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve immediately.</p>
