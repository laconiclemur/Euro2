</h1>
<p class="pf">People often ask me, “What is Martha really like?”</p>
<p>My answer: “I was really impressed. She’s very smart, a quick learner, polite, and very businesslike—also she is so organized. I felt like I had to clean house when I got home!” You know the kind—people who have their homes so perfect that your own home looks like a mess!</p>
<p>It wasn’t long after my appearance on Julia Child’s show that I got a call asking if I would like to tape a cooking show with Martha Stewart. Again, as with Julia Child, I felt so privileged and wondered “Why me?”</p>
<p>So I offered to do a Finnish holiday coffee table and Norwegian lefse. For this I needed to do a lot of baking preparation as well as pack materials for the trip. I baked my pulla (Finnish cardamom bread), a selection of butter cookies, Finnish prune stars, and sponge cake layers, which I planned to put together on camera. In addition, I packed my lefse equipment, potatoes, butter, and cream. I hardly had room in my bags for a toothbrush and nightgown!</p>
<p>I checked in at the Duluth airport on the e-ticket that had been issued to me. Time to board, and I was in row 2, seat B. I didn’t think too much about it, as the plane was one of those puddle jumpers that a large percentage of the flights from Duluth are. When I checked in for my Minneapolis to LaGuardia flight, I was in row 3, seat B. Wow! I was being sent first class—nice wide seats and orange juice in a real glass!</p>
<p>An assistant of Martha’s met me at LaGuardia. The drive to Martha Stewart’s Westport, Connecticut, studio took about an hour. The studio itself looked like a big farmhouse, but inside it had no feeling of a home. It was more of a large space broken into different areas—a big square in the center of desks and computers, surrounded by more offices, each housing key people in the operation.</p>
<p>It was a maze of file cabinets and storage areas. Everything was labeled, stored, and sorted into specific areas. When I commented about the tidiness of her studio, Martha remarked that she would never find anything if it weren’t organized.</p>
<p>The same was true of the kitchen: a bank of stainless steel shelving in one corner and at the end of it a deep sink and counters, with multiple restaurant-style gas ranges lining one wall while refrigerators lined another. There were two long worktables with banks of drawers all labeled and well organized with tools of all kinds. Just off the kitchen was Martha’s private restroom, complete with a shower, tub, and vanity.</p>
<p>Martha’s office was done in pale green—her signature color—and had a unit with narrow drawers and a large table in the center they used for conferences. Everything was all done in high-gloss paint.</p>
<p>When I finally met Martha, it was over a kitchen counter. I presented her with a slab of lutefisk and she was delighted. She said she would turn it over to her Norwegian sister-in-law, who would be preparing their family Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>We unpacked my bags—fortunately everything was in fine shape and I was able to place all of the baked goods on the beautifully set table. Because Martha’s sister-in-law is Norwegian, the table was set with classic blue-and-white cups, plates, and saucers.</p>
<p>I proceeded to explain the layout of the Finnish holiday coffee table. There are three basic “courses.” For the first course, the guest selects a slice of the cardamom-flavored coffeebread (no spread or butter on it). The next course is a sample slice of an unfrosted cake—like a pound cake or a spiced fruit cake—and you are permitted to choose a cookie or two, to go with your second cup of coffee. With the third cup of coffee (I might mention that the coffee cups hold about 5 ounces), you are permitted to sample the fancy filled cake.</p>
<p>The next thing I did was demonstrate the making of the fancy filled cake. I used Katja’s recipe, which was from a girl we had hosted as a Finnish high school student in our home several years before. Katja came home from school one day saying she would like to bake a birthday cake for her friend. She went on to make the cake using basic proportions. Measure the eggs, then add an equal amount of sugar, beat until light and lemon colored, and fold in an equal amount of flour. A pinch of salt, a splash of vanilla—and that’s it!</p>
<p>What a revelation! I explained that since then, I have used this “basic proportion” cake to make cakes large enough to serve fifty and small enough to serve just four. In the kitchen at First Lutheran in Duluth we have a commercial-sized mixer, and I used it to make huge batches of sponge cake based on three quarts of eggs and baked the cakes in commercial-sized bun pans to make a celebration cake for a hundred people. The proportion always works!</p>
<p>Martha thought this was a superb idea.</p>
<p>We broke for lunch. A healthy salad and soup, a menu that Martha chose every day and had available for all of her employees.</p>
<p>After that, we went on to my lefse-making demonstration. I was concerned that we cook the correct kind of potatoes (russets) just the proper length of time (until they were soft but not mushy). When the potatoes reached the exact doneness, Martha got the hiccups and we had to delay the procedure a good five minutes!</p>

<p>The demonstration went on, then, uninterrupted. We drained, riced, and mashed the potatoes with cream, butter, a bit of sugar, and a bit of salt. I carefully explained that the mashed potatoes should be chilled overnight uncovered.</p>
<p>So, when the potato mixture was chilled and ready, we mixed in the flour and started rolling out the flat potato breads, cooking them on the special griddle I had brought with me. This is a procedure people often have trouble with—but Martha was able, on her second try, to roll out a perfectly round, delicate lefse. I congratulated her on being a quick learner!</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Katja’s Birthday Sponge Cake</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Several years ago we had an exchange student from Finland whose mother is a fabulous cook. One day, Katja asked my permission to bake a birthday cake for her friend and said that she had the recipe. Of course, I thought it was a great idea. I explained the “baking corner” in the kitchen, showed her where I kept my baking tools—measuring cups and spoons, pans, bowls, and the like—then helped her set the oven.</p>
<p class="rp">Katja proceeded to take down three identical glass tumblers and pulled out the electric mixer and one springform pan. She cracked eggs into one glass, poured sugar into a second to the same level as the eggs, and added flour to the third one, again at the same level. Hmm. “So much for measuring cups,” I thought.</p>
<p class="rp">“Oh, dis is the vay vee make birthday cake,” she explained. She proceeded to whip the eggs and sugar together until they were very, very light. Then she carefully mixed in the flour. A pinch of salt and a bit of vanilla added, and she poured the batter into the pan and baked it.</p>
<p class="rp">It’s baking by proportion and I love this recipe! In fact, I don’t need to use a recipe at all, but just remember to use an equal measure of eggs, sugar, and flour. Using this simple formula, I’ve made everything from a single-layer cake to cakes for a hundred. Instead of a springform pan, though, I use regular 8- or 9-inch round layer pans, something that is not commonly used in Europe. Or, if I’m making a half-sheet-pan-sized cake, I use rimmed cookie sheets and multiply the recipe by three times for a double layer 12½- by 17½-inch cake. The baking time and temperature are about the same.</p>
<p class="rp">For an irresistible cake, fill it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries or any berries or fruit that is in season. Right now, I’ll rely on homemade strawberry or raspberry jam and whipped cream—or I’ll splurge and fill the cake with cloudberry jam from Sweden or Finland.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1½ cups (about 6) large eggs, room temperature</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ cups granulated sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">Pinch of salt</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p class="rpill">1½ cups all-purpose flour</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Filling and topping</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">2 cups whipped cream, slightly sweetened</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup strawberry, raspberry, apricot, or cloudberry jam or 1 pint fresh berries</p>
<p class="rpill">4 to 6 tablespoons cloudberry liqueur, Swedish punsch, or light rum (optional)</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bottoms of two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment or brown paper rounds.</p>
<p class="rp">In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs until fluffy. Turn speed to high and gradually add the sugar, the pinch of salt, and the vanilla. Continue beating at high speed at least 5 minutes until the mixture is very light and lemon colored. Turn speed down to low and add the flour gradually, mixing just until it is incorporated.</p>
<p class="rp">Pour the batter into the two prepared cake pans evenly. Bake for 25 minutes or until the centers bounce back when touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and dry. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack.</p>
<p class="rp">Loosen edges of cake with a knife and ease the first layer onto a cake plate. Have whipped cream and jam or berries ready. Remove parchment paper from cake. With a long serrated knife, split each layer into two parts. Drizzle with liqueur if desired. Layer with whipped cream and jam or berries. Top with whipped cream. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 12 servings</p>
