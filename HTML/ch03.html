<p class="h2title">August, or <span class="scalasans">Discipleship</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">I</span>f you were to dine at elBulli, you would arrive in Roses fairly early in the day. With no luxury hotels to speak of and an excess of shops selling bad pizza and cheap sandals, the town tends to attract tourists who don’t quite see the point in spending 230 euros per person on dinner. So, like most elBulli diners, you have likely made Roses a one-night stop. Maybe you have driven up from Barcelona and arrived just in time for a light lunch of grilled fish at Rafa’s and an afternoon siesta. Or maybe the excitement has kept you awake. After all, you have probably waited years for this opportunity, so that when you finally got the e-mail from Lluís García informing you that elBulli would have a table for you, you felt a little as if you’d won the lottery. Which helps explain the fluttery feeling in your stomach as, sometime after 7 <small>P.M.</small>, you begin the drive up the unmarked road that leads to the restaurant.</p>
<p class="indent">If it is your first time, you will likely drive a mile or so before you start to worry that you have made a wrong turn. The lack of signage, the tortuous, potholed road, the complete absence of guardrails standing between you and the craggy cliffs—can this really be the way? The scenery will distract you for a while—mountainside jutting down to aquamarine water, <a id="page_90"/>scruffy pines glowing in the fading light—but a couple more miles on, you’ll be convinced that you’re lost. Are you going to be late for the one reservation you most want in the world? Will they save your spot? There are few places to turn around on the twisting road, and so you continue, fretfully, until finally the road begins to descend and you spy some white buildings in a bend up ahead. One bears the restaurant’s name, but it is so modest that you may find yourself thinking, “Is this really it?”</p>
<p class="indent">Should you arrive before 7:30, the gate to the restaurant parking lot will still be locked, and you’ll have to wait outside with the other clients who didn’t want to be a minute late for their meal. Inside, Oriol Castro will be holding a last-minute meeting with the dining room staff, explaining the night’s new dishes, asking if there were any problems with any courses the night before. Not until Oriol ends the meeting, as he always does, by wishing the staff a <span class="txit">buen servicio</span> will one waiter walk outside and up the hill to unlock the gates. You’ll cross the parking lot, never noticing the carefully placed rocks because you are so excited to finally be walking through the narrow wooden door with its homely little plaque of a bulldog. But if you look to the right, just before you cross the threshold, you’ll realize that you can see into the gleaming kitchen. It feels like you are spying on Willy Wonka.</p>
<p class="indent">Inside the restaurant, one of the maître d’s will greet you warmly in your own language. He’ll ask if you’d like to start the meal with cocktails on the veranda, and you will of course say yes, since the view there, down to Cala Montjoi’s beach, is so inviting. You’ll sit at one of the heavy wooden tables, trying not to be too obvious as you steal glances around you: the other diners, the dishes coming out at other tables, the bustle of the staff. Within minutes, though, a waiter sets your first course in front of you: a cocktail (or freshly squeezed juice, if you don’t drink alcohol) unlike any you have tried before. Regardless of what the “drink” comprises, there will be something about it that is amusing or delightful: a honey-dipped pine shoot to chew while you sip the pine-flavored concoction in your glass, the shock of opposite sensations as you down your hot-and-cold gin and tonic. Then, the snacks will start appearing, in groups of two or three, each one on its own specially designed plate: pristine disks that <a id="page_91"/>look like elaborately decorated candies from a Parisian <span class="txit">confiserie</span> but taste of salty sesame; crisp, translucent rectangles of raspberry punched up with wasabi’s heat; a thin cracker that tastes purely and intensely of the juiciest tomato you’ve ever eaten.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with the excitement, a bit of anxiety usually accompanies a meal at elBulli. You’ve heard so much about this restaurant and for so long, how can it ever begin to live up to its reputation? The question of what exactly you will be putting in your mouth also disarms you: at elBulli you have no choice in the menu. Although you may have specified ahead of time that you don’t like liver or are allergic to shellfish, the list of products the restaurant uses is so far-reaching and unusual that you will, inevitably, end up eating things you have never seen before, let alone thought to rule out. As you finish your time on the patio and are led into the dining room by the maître d’, the first source of anxiety begins to recede; the snacks have convinced you that elBulli really may be everything you’ve heard it is. But the second source—the mystery of it all—has only grown.</p>
<p class="indent">You are seated. Instead of the sleek, design-conscious interior you expected for so renowned an avant-garde restaurant, you are led to a red velvet, cushioned banquette and a table covered in thick white linens. There are no minimalist rocks or spiky floral compositions on the table; a single red rose in a glass vase forms the only centerpiece. The white stucco walls are hung with oil paintings that would not look out of place at a red-sauce joint in New Jersey. The tile floors show their age. Seated there amid the faded pillows and tchotchkes, attended by a staff that sincerely seems to have your well-being at heart, it’s hard to believe that anyone is going to make you eat anything scary. And then one of the first “tapi-platos” comes out (tapi-platos are how the restaurant refers to its “main” courses—the tapas-sized dishes that come after the snacks and before the pre-desserts), and it’s a hideous, shaggy black mass that resembles volcanic rock but has the feel of a damp sponge.</p>
<p class="indent">The waiter tells you to eat it in two bites. You look at your dining companion nervously, then look around the room. No one else seems to be suffering. In fact, they seem almost joyfully happy with what they are <a id="page_92"/>eating. At the table next to you, a woman is actually laughing between bites. And so you put the ugly, shaggy, squishy thing in your mouth and tentatively chew. It turns out to be delicious: slightly sweet, with the toasty flavor of black sesame and a delightful texture somewhere between layer cake and sea sponge. It reminds you of something, though you can’t quite say what.</p>
<p class="indent">This, then, is what dinner at elBulli is like: a recurring cycle of emotions. Excitement, mystification, delight, nostalgia, and then, with each brief interval between courses, the resurgence of anticipation and a bit of fear. Thirty or so times, a waiter will appear tableside with calm, almost compassionate instructions for how to eat the thing in front of you. Thirty or so times, you will surrender to the next course and, usually (though not always; if everything were exquisitely pleasurable, the meal would lose the tension that Adrià seeks), find yourself delighted by whatever surprising flavors and textures it contains. And so it goes, through fried chicken cartilage and pressed cotton candy paper and sherry-tinged baby goat kidneys and sea anemones and truffles and rabbit brains and lychee-filled shellfish for dessert. Finally it is midnight. You move back to the veranda for coffee, and the server delivers a large, marvelous box, a treasure chest of chocolates. You start opening drawers, some obvious, some secret, to find a different, exquisite candy in each compartment: in one, a tiny piece of coral dusted red, in another a fresh mint leaf coated in dark chocolate. The tension of the night dissolves in one last burst of pure, childlike pleasure, as you realize that elBulli really <span class="txit">is</span> as good as they say. You pay the bill, which suddenly seems a lot more reasonable than it did when it was only an abstraction, and depart amid a chorus of warm good-byes from the staff. Somehow, even though it is now pitch-black, the drive back down to Roses seems less precarious than before. You think it may have been the most thrilling meal of your life.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how exciting the concoctions on each plate and the elaborate theater that accompanies the serving of them, the one moment that many diners at elBulli recall as the most memorable has nothing to do with the food. As each party enters the restaurant, but before it is <a id="page_93"/>seated on the patio, Pol or Luís or David López demurely suggests that perhaps the group would like to see the kitchen and greet the chef? First-time guests are usually surprised but flattered by the offer, wondering modestly if perhaps the staff has detected some level of sophistication or other special quality that warrants such an invitation. In any case, no one ever refuses. The maître d’ nods his approval and leads you past the massive stone fireplace that was once where the restaurant grilled its meats. As you step into the kitchen, he turns, points to the metal strip bolted to the floor, and issues a mild warning to watch your step. You pass the humidor and the coffee station, but you don’t notice any of it, because there, up ahead, is Ferran Adrià.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="331" src="../images/f0093-01.jpg" width="528"/></p>
<p class="caption">The view from the kitchen as Ferran greets diners (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent">Most likely his back is to you, for even at this late hour, he is still testing new dishes with Oriol. He stands at the front of the kitchen—maybe waiting observantly at the pass, maybe pacing near the bar, and, upon hearing you enter, turns, smiles, and welcomes you to the restaurant. He nods graciously when you ask if you can take a photo <a id="page_94"/>and pulls you toward the restaurant’s famous sculpture of a bull’s head, midway down the pass. You hand off your camera to whomever led you into the kitchen and stand there, beaming, as if Ferran Adrià were your best friend in the world (if you are in fact, a friend, he will pose with his arms around you. If not, he will cross them in front of his chest). Then, when the camera has flashed and Luís or Pol or David is gently urging you along, you turn and, just for a moment, try to catch a glimpse of what it is that the thirty or so cooks behind the pass are doing as they prepare this long-awaited meal.</p>
<p class="indent">Now switch the frame. You are standing shoulder to shoulder with thirteen other cooks, laying cold rose petals on a plate. You’ve been standing there, with only one thirty-minute break, for the past six hours. You are not allowed to talk to anyone else on the line, so any jokes or wisecracks are issued in whispers. You have been chastised before for not focusing, so for the most part you keep your eyes on the plate in front of you. But it’s impossible to ignore the flash of bulbs as the cameras go off, one every few minutes for about an hour and a half, from in front of the pass. You steal looks at the clients, posing there with Ferran, dressed in their formal evening wear or their jeans and sandals. Even from a distance you can see that their faces fairly shine with anticipation. You wonder what their meal will be like. After all, you wouldn’t know: neither you nor any of the other forty people you work with has actually eaten at elBulli. And thus you don’t know that the servers will take the matcha tea powder you set out when you’re plating the shrimp and whisk it with the straw brush until it turns into a bright green broth whose slightly bitter herbaceousness will play nicely off the sweetness of the crustacean. You don’t know what it’s like for a server to pour the bowl of foie gras ribbons, frozen with liquid nitrogen, over the plate of lulos, so that smoke billows over the table in clouds and the tartness of the fruit is mellowed by the richness of the liver as it melts. You don’t know what it’s like to have a magic box of chocolates placed before you and open drawer after drawer to find only more. You know only what it’s like to fill that box, piping one perfect mint leaf after another with melted chocolate for elBulli’s take on an after-dinner mint.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_95"/>This is the great paradox of elBulli: that the most exciting dining experience in the world depends on the most extreme absence of excitement. It depends on the rigor, the discipline, and, to be honest, the utter boredom of the men and women who are standing in those two straight lines, laying cold rose petals on plates. Like all great restaurants, elBulli’s dazzle rests in large part on the willingness of its apprentices, in the name of education, to do the dreary work no one else wants to do—and to do it for free. It’s just that here the equation—learning for drudgery, learning <span class="txit">through</span> drudgery—is different.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">If Luke is able to bear the sometimes crushing routine of mise en place better than many of the stagiaires, he has the South Korean army to thank. His real name is Myungsun Jang, but at elBulli he goes by “Luke” because, he has learned from experience, the latter is far easier for Europeans to pronounce. Like all young Korean men, he was obliged to enter the military and enlisted at age twenty-two. Stationed at a secret location in the mountains, he spent the grueling first four weeks in basic training, learning to fire a rifle, going on twenty-kilometer marches with a sixty-five-pound pack, and picking up a few chemical warfare tricks. Prohibited from keeping any personal possessions, he had to send his civilian clothing home as soon as he received his uniform; in a familiar ritual for Korean women, Luke’s mother cried when she received his. Physical punishment was common—although officers are prohibited from beating their underlings, they have other means of discipline at their disposal: assigning laps, piling a soldier with extra weight during marches, forcing him to assume the <span class="txit">wonsan pokgyeok</span> position—sort of like downward-facing dog but with his body weight supported by his head rather than his arms. It was not unheard of for new recruits to die—“accidentally,” Luke points out—during training. But the combination of extreme physical labor and utter submission to discipline fostered a tolerance for difficulty that would serve Luke well later in his life. When basic training was over and his squad was distributed to bases throughout the country for the remaining twenty-nine months of their <a id="page_96"/>service, Luke found that, unlike some of his unlucky companions who had been sent to the border with North Korea, he was reassigned to a kitchen. Of all the positions in the army, it was the job he most wanted.</p>
<p class="indent">Food had always been important in his family, and some of Luke’s best memories are of holidays spent with his cousins at his grandfather’s cottage in the mountains, where the main event was a massive feast grilled over an open flame. His energetic mother, a housewife turned entrepreneur, was a good cook—“and fast,” which in Luke’s world is the highest possible praise. His father, who had left a university career teaching language for a better-paying office job, loved to eat. “Whenever there was good news, we would have a feast or go to a restaurant,” Luke recalls. “Even when we were poor, it was always very important to go out to eat.” By the time he was twelve, both his parents were working full-time, and it fell to young Luke to prepare family meals. Nothing fancy, usually rice or soup, but it was during those times, he says, when he was alone in the kitchen and waiting for his parents to come home, that he decided he wanted to be a chef. When he turned seventeen, he took his first job, working at a small Chinese restaurant in Seoul.</p>
<p class="indent">A position as army cook, then, was the best possible outcome of his conscription. He still had to turn out for morning drills and periodically had to demonstrate his weapons-readiness, but unlike his comrades, many of whom spent time patrolling the barren border of the demilitarized zone that divides South Korea from its enemies to the north, Luke at least got to spend his day chopping cabbage and cleaning chickens. He had been doing that for a little less than a year when he heard about a culinary contest with divisions for both military and civilian cooks. He asked his commanding officer for permission to enter and found himself a few months later at a hotel kitchen in Seoul, having entered—Luke is nothing if not driven—both divisions. He took gold in the public competition for his lamb with mustard sauce and crisp nuts and silver in the military one for his steamed sea bream with pumpkin and white kimchi. The latter tormented him for a while—how could he have come in <span class="txit">second</span>?—but there was another prize awaiting him that almost made up for the shortcoming.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_97"/>Back at the military base, the general heard about Luke’s win and contacted the young man because he was looking for a new cook to prepare meals for him and his wife. The general had spent eight years in the United States and was far more worldly than the average Korean officer. Luke was immediately drawn to him and yearned for the job, but he knew it would require more sophisticated skills than those he employed in the mess hall. In the days leading up to his audition with the general, he forced himself to go over techniques and flavor combinations in his head. Finally it was time: Luke went to the general’s house, where, in a nod to those eight years in America, a carved pumpkin marked the holiday being celebrated halfway around the world. The officer showed Luke the kitchen and explained where all the utensils were. Then he handed him a whole octopus. “Make something with that,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">Luke had never cooked octopus before. Still, he had watched his mother prepare it enough times that he knew the basics. He turned it inside out, removed the innards from the head, then simmered it for nearly two hours to make sure it was tender. At that point he could have done the typical thing: stir-fry it with chilies and mushrooms to make <span class="txit">nakji bokeum</span>. But Luke wanted to show that he could do more than the traditional dishes, more than was expected. So he cut off the tentacles, sliced them as thin as carpaccio, then drizzled the slices with a sauce made from soy and yuzu. It was simple but elegant, and the general couldn’t stop talking about how well the flavors melded. Luke got the job.</p>
<p class="indent">Overnight, what is usually the most difficult period of a young man’s life became the most exciting for Luke. He moved out of the barracks and into the general’s house, and although he would have to turn up for preparedness exercises every three months, he was suddenly free of the daily drills and workouts—to say nothing of the drudgery of preparing kimchi for hundreds of hungry soldiers every day. He still woke at 6 <small>A.M.</small> but in order to prepare the general’s breakfast, not for calisthenics. He shopped, planned menus, and tended the little vegetable garden behind the general’s house. Early each afternoon, he began preparations for that night’s dinner, which, because the general and his wife liked to entertain, was usually fairly elaborate. The two treated him like a son, and between their encouragement, the practice, and the time the work gave him to dream, Luke came up with a plan for his future. He loved the cuisine of his homeland, but he wanted to know more. “Korean food is great,” he says, “but it’s still pretty traditional, even backwards. I wouldn’t have been able to learn anything new if I stayed there.” To become the sort of chef he wanted to be, Luke would have to travel.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">“I hate August.” Ferran stands impatiently at the top of the driveway that leads down to the kitchen and tries to cross the road to his house. For the past two months, he has been slipping out of the kitchen at 5 <small>P.M.</small> for an hour’s worth of exercise in his garden. (“Can’t you tell?” he asks. “I’ve lost six kilos!”) But now a line of cars snakes its way to and from the beach, making it difficult to cross—especially because many of them pull over abruptly to allow their passengers to spill out and pose with the restaurant sign or, when they see the man on the side of the road, the chef himself. “I find people in my yard sometimes, halfway up the hill to <a id="page_99"/>my house,” he says, dashing across as several cars honk in recognition. You’d have thought a busload of tourists in Beverly Hills had just spied Brad Pitt picking up his newspaper.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a lot of reasons why August is Adrià’s least favorite month. For one, the heat and humidity—so treacherous to the crackly pink sugar that is pulled, flamelike, around a raspberry, so threatening to those crisp corn <span class="txit">pañuelos</span> inspired by Katie—are at their highest. The weather is especially an issue for pastry, and Mateu is on his stagiaires constantly for not closing quickly enough the door to the tiny, chilled petit fours room, where chocolates and other delicacies vulnerable to temperature and humidity are stored. One night, just before service, he realizes that the mint leaves for the After Eights have turned brown in the heat, and a moment’s panic surges through the team as they rush to pull the imperfect leaves from their drawers in the chocolate box. Remarkably, the kitchen itself doesn’t feel uncomfortably warm—the ventilation system, at least in summer, is so expert that elBulli is possibly the only restaurant in the world where the cooks don’t end the night bathed in sweat. The only real clue to the season is hair, which lies a bit lanker than usual. Gaël and Luke have even abandoned their now-futile hair gel.</p>
<p class="indent">But temperature and its cosmetic effects aside, the real reason Ferran hates August is for the people it draws. Roses may not have much in the way of historic monuments or charming streets, but it does have a beach, and in August, when nearly all of Spain and France is on vacation, about half of each country’s population seems to be lying on the town’s white sands. The unmarked road up to Cala Montjoi becomes clogged with cars seeking a less trammeled piece of beach. Accidents can stop traffic for hours when a gawking sightseer drives off a particularly impressive curve.</p>
<p class="indent">Summer vacation also means a higher percentage of diners who aren’t exactly at elBulli for the artistic experience. “They come because they’ve heard it’s the most famous restaurant in the world, and they want to say they’ve been here or they want to check it off their list,” Ferran says. “Not because they truly appreciate what we do here.” And <a id="page_100"/>it’s true—in August, the restaurant does fill with a larger number of sunburned clients given to criticism and misunderstanding, including one unfortunate sod who gets himself so drunk at dinner that he throws up at the table. The situation is disheartening enough to Ferran that for several years now, he has dreamed of closing the restaurant altogether in August, a perhaps less-than-sound business decision, considering that it is the most popular month for reservation requests. But Adrià says he doesn’t care about that—he’d shut down on Saturday nights too if he had his way. The only thing that prevents him, he says, are the stagiaires. “What would they do for the whole month of August? We couldn’t just send them home.”</p>
<p class="indent">The stagiaires themselves don’t really notice that August is different from any other month. True, the bars where they hang out at night are a lot more crowded, and they have to leave earlier in the morning to get to work on time because of the traffic. But the restaurant’s clientele? Those supposedly less sophisticated customers who fill the dining room each August? That they don’t notice at all. It’s one of the things that makes the experience of working at elBulli different from that of almost any other restaurant: there are no particularly bad services. Nor, for that matter, are there particularly good ones. All the services are more or less the same.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s because elBulli controls almost all the variables. It starts with its own staff; by hiring so many people and establishing such an elaborate system of control there is little room for the kind of personal errors that can upset an entire service. Asked for the worst mistake a stagiaire has ever committed, Ferran has to search far back in memory. “Well, there was that time in the late eighties, early nineties,” he recounts. “We had told a stagiaire to make a fish stock and, when it was done, to strain it. So the stagiaire did what he was told, and a little while later, I went over to get it. He handed me a bunch of boiled fish bones. I said, ‘Where’s the stock?’ And he pointed to the bones—he had drained them, just as he was told, and thrown away the rest.” René Redzepi, who did a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli in 1999, recalls a more simple mistake with horror. “It was a big table—an eight- or ten-top,” he says. “And they were on the duck <a id="page_101"/>course. They had been plated and the waiters had started to take some of them out, when Lalo, who was expediting [Eduard “Lalo” Bosch, who today works in elBulli’s administration was chef de cuisine from 1996 to 2001] realized one duck was missing.” The chef called to the meat station for one more, but for some reason—I still don’t know how this happened—there wasn’t any more. We were out of duck.” René shakes his head, still cringing at the memory. “Lalo went crazy, screaming that we should all remember this day because it was the worst day in elBulli’s history.” The idea that falling one dish short—a routine event in most restaurants—could constitute the worst night in history is telling; elBulli make so few mistakes that an ordinary one takes on disproportionate significance.</p>
<p class="indent">Without an à la carte menu, there is no doubt about which dishes will sell and which will not; the kitchen has eradicated that mysterious alchemy by which every table on a given night decides to order the lamb chops and none the pasta. Mise en place is strictly controlled, with each task accounted for on a daily chart that prevents any station from ever running out of a preparation during service. The cooks can also rest assured that no diner is going to send back a dish because it’s not cooked to his liking or isn’t what she expected—those criteria don’t even figure into the elBulli universe. There are no delivery men who flake out at the last minute: elBulli has a dedicated shopper, José Maria, who travels daily to the markets in Roses and, for more exotic products, twice each week to the Boqueria market in Barcelona. A party doesn’t reserve for four people but show up with six. Almost no one cancels a reservation at the last minute—and if they do, the restaurant always has someone to take their place. The only thing that can throw off the kitchen is timing: if eight tables show up at once (the restaurant groups reservations into three or four time slots, separated by half an hour each, but, this being Spain, not everyone is exactly prompt) or if someone decides, halfway through his meal, to get up for a leisurely smoke on the patio. Otherwise, every service is remarkably similar to every other one.</p>
<p class="indent">In other restaurants, the distinction between good and bad services fuels the brigade’s motivation. Like long-distance runners, cooks talk <a id="page_102"/>about “the zone,” that adrenaline- and seratonin-fueled state in which everyone is working perfectly, orders are coming out on time, and the whole night goes by in a kind of athletic dance. Daniel Ryan misses the feeling. The twenty-eight-year-old stagiaire from Baltimore worked for a while at Alain Ducasse’s restaurant in New York, where—as in most kitchens—each cook had his own station, did his own mise en place, and took care of his own orders one at a time. “With that kind of cooking you get into a groove,” Daniel says almost wistfully. “At elBulli, it’s different; everything is done in big projects. So the groove, the kind of ecstasy you feel turning out a hundred covers, is missing.” The ecstasy-fueled services make the bad ones worthwhile. But even the bad ones—the ones where you can’t stop overcooking your meat, or somebody burns himself, or you run out of sea bass, or everyone is in the weeds, the purée, the shits (choose your metaphor)—serve their purpose, providing yet another war story to be recounted in hilarious detail over drinks late at night. Even more than the zone, the weeds unite the members of the brigade, making them feel that they have endured something together, and bringing them closer as a result.</p>
<p class="indent">Without the unifying highs and lows, elBulli’s crew is perhaps a little more susceptible than normal to petty fractures. Certainly by August, cracks have begun to appear, a frazzling of nerves that seems the result of too much time spent in one another’s presence. At home, Andrea fights with Laia, one of her three roommates, over things such as who is responsible for the clutter in their room. She chalks the tension up to overexposure more than any core conflict. “I’m kind of tired of being with the same people,” she says. “I wish I didn’t have to see so much of them.” Katie feels the same way. She’s been staying home at night and visiting Felix’s family on days off, rather than spending more time with the people at work. “You know, I just don’t have the desire to make the effort. I’d rather have a social life with people outside the restaurant.” Nor are the tensions confined to extracurricular hours. Laia fights with José Luis at work over who does what. “He’s lazy,” she says simply. “She’s bossy,” he retorts. Mizuho complains about what she sees as rudeness and a kind of competition among the stagiaires as one person gets <a id="page_103"/>stressed out and starts ordering others around. Lorenzo resents Luke for telling him he’s not focused enough; Luke resents Lorenzo for letting down the rest of the team. When it comes to plating, those full-on rushes when six or eight cooks struggle simultaneously to finish a dish, there’s a bit more pushing than strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">With little else to occupy their minds, the stagiaires transform the minor occurrences of personal life into the objects of full-blown intrigue. Is Emma, the auburn-haired Canadian stagiaire, going out with Aitor, the tattooed chef de partie in charge of <span class="txit">cuarto frio</span>? They tend to sit together when everyone is out at night. But how can they possibly communicate, seeing as Aitor speaks little English and Emma’s Spanish barely exists? Maybe, the stagiaires snicker, they have another way of communicating. Did you notice that Eugeni tries to keep them apart in the kitchen? Is that because he knows something and is concerned that a burgeoning romance will distract them from work? Or is it because he is hoping to have his own shot with Emma? Emma, whose predilection for girlish dresses belies her backbone, hates the gossip swirling around her. One night she decides to put an end to it. “Yeah, we’re sleeping together,” she announces to her fellow cooks. “Is that a problem?” The next day she moves in with Aitor.</p>
<p class="indent">That episode, and a pressure cooker that explodes one night during service, constitute the two highlights of the month. Otherwise, a kind of torpor has set in: as the novelty of the kitchen and menu wear off, it begins to dawn on the stagiaires, with noticeably sobering effect, that this is all there is. A handful, it is true, have rotated into new stations, but not nearly as many nor as quickly as most had expected. At one meeting Diego—always quick with a raised hand—asks with a touch of frustration if others are going to be assigned to creativity or <span class="txit">cuarto frio.</span> Eduard assures him that there will be changes in the future. But with nothing more concrete than that, many of the stagiaires begin to fear that they will spend the next four months doing exactly the same thing that they are doing now.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_104"/>Fifteen thousand dollars is how much Luke figured he would need to embark on his itinerant culinary education. If he were going to do it right—and his many months in the military had taught him the value of doing things right—he would need a lot more money than the measly army stipend he had been putting away each month. He called a friend in Australia who ran a beef-packing plant and asked if he had any jobs. The friend invited Luke to come work in the local slaughterhouse. The bloody, backbreaking work paid well and offered Luke a chance to learn English. As he was saving up the necessary funds, however, tragedy struck: his father was diagnosed with cancer. Luke made it back to Seoul just in time to be with his dad when he died. He spent the next three months at home with his mother, but his destiny, he felt, wouldn’t wait. One night he told his mother he had to leave again. “This is really important to me, Mom,” he said as she cried. But she said she understood, and Luke went back to the slaughterhouse. A few months later, he had at last accumulated his $15,000. It was time to start spending it.</p>
<p class="indent">The curriculum that Luke had designed for himself didn’t involve classes in flavor profiling or <span class="txit">stages</span> in prestigious kitchens; it was much more simple than that. He would go to the best restaurants in the world and eat. On paper it sounded sybaritic, but Luke approached the task with the utmost seriousness. In order to save money for meals, he would hitchhike as much as possible and camp instead of staying in hotels. And in order to truly understand what each restaurant was trying to accomplish, he would make a point of trying to talk with the chef every place he ate. He gave himself ten months before his money ran out.</p>
<p class="indent">His first meal was at Tetsuya’s, Tetsuya Wakuda’s famed Japanese-French restaurant in Sydney, Australia. Climbing its austere steps, he was awed by the hushed intimacy inside and the plate-glass wall in the dining room that looked out onto a lovely garden—no place his family had taken him had ever been as exquisite as this. He was surprised, however, to find that the tasting menu wasn’t as diverse as he had expected—vanilla ice cream made an appearance three times, as did raw fish (although, considering Wakuda’s Japanese heritage, this latter was not, perhaps, surprising). And although Luke got to see the kitchen, <a id="page_105"/>Wakuda himself was too busy at the time to speak with him. All in all, it was an inauspicious launch.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, he had begun. From Australia Luke went first to the Philippines and from there to Vietnam and Thailand. India was a favorite stop, and he especially loved the tandoori dishes at New Delhi’s opulent Bukhara restaurant. From there he made it to Turkey, which he loved even more for its hospitality; instead of arresting him for sleeping in the rough, one policeman in a small town outside Istanbul took him to dinner at a café, then invited him home to stay with his family for three days. In Germany he traveled to the elegant Die Schwarzwaldstube; in Italy to Gambero Rosso. He was, quite possibly, the only backpacker in the history of the Eurail Pass to keep a neatly folded suit and tie in his rucksack. Before each meal, he would unpack his jacket and slacks, hang them near a hot shower to get out the wrinkles, and dress properly for the evening.</p>
<p class="indent">What was Luke searching for? At home in Seoul, he had read everything he could on chefs he admired, but he soon found that eating widely provided a depth of knowledge that no book could match. Still, it was more than just a mental catalogue of textures and flavors that he was after. In each restaurant, he asked to speak with the chef, and almost always, the chef obliged. “I was a paying customer,” explains Luke, with one of his trademark shy smiles. “They had to be nice to me.” He would probe each chef for his philosophy, ask for his recommendations for training. And always he would end with the same question: “What is the most important thing for a chef?” He was searching, in other words, for a mentor—or maybe more than a mentor. He was looking for someone to whom he could dedicate himself wholly, just as he had dedicated himself to the general. He was looking to make himself a disciple.</p>
<p class="indent">It wasn’t until Luke reached Spain that he found the right opportunity. He had first read about elBulli when he was in the military, and even though he found the photo that accompanied the article a little off-putting (Ferran, he thought, looked gruff standing in his favorite cross-armed position), he was thrilled by what he learned about Ferran’s passion, his energy, his will to reinvent both cuisine and himself. That inkling—that <a id="page_106"/>this chef, above all others, was worth traveling to—perhaps explains why Luke was so determined to overcome the hardships he encountered when he tried to reach elBulli. He arrived in Roses with little problem but, once there, had no means of getting to the restaurant itself—he could hardly afford the 25 euros that a taxi would cost, and there was no other transportation available. So he walked. Seven kilometers, uphill. It was a hot summer day, and the trek took Luke a couple of hours, but finally, he was standing there, by the restaurant’s discreet entrance. An entrance that, it being Sunday, was firmly locked. ElBulli was closed.</p>
<p class="indent">He walked back down to Roses. The next day, he tried again: seven kilometers up in the blazing sun. Again he found the gate locked and no one around. He walked back down to town. Up the following day and back down again—Luke didn’t realize it, but the restaurant was on one of its monthly four-day breaks. All told, he would climb the mountain to Cala Montjoi and descend back to Roses about ten times before he finally got in. Not, it should be said, to eat—elBulli could hardly come up with a reservation for this scraggly wanderer who turned up on its doorstep, no matter how impassioned he might be. He did, however, get the chance to meet Ferran. Standing face to face with him gave Luke goose bumps, but he managed to get out his crucial question: What is the most important thing for a chef? “Don’t copy,” said Ferran. That was it.</p>
<p class="indent">Luke didn’t know it, but Ferran himself had received that piece of advice years before, from the wickedly talented, if mercurial, Jacques Maximin. As part of a group of Spanish chefs invited on an eating tour of the Côte d’Azur, Adrià had attended a demonstration where the chef of the Negresco reportedly answered a question about creativity with the same words. It struck the young Korean as the most interesting thing he had heard in his travels so far, and he was moved by the passion with which Ferran delivered the words. Still, he kept moving. After elBulli, Luke traveled to France, where he ate at Michel Bras’s restaurant in Laguiole and Pierre Gagnaire’s in Paris (it was on a train to Paris that he met the French couple who gave him the name Luke, since Myungsun taxed their pronunciation capabilities). He kept moving, eating at Heston Blumenthal’s cutting-edge Fat Duck in Bray, England, and Thomas <a id="page_107"/>Keller’s flagships in both New York (Per Se) and Napa Valley (The French Laundry). The only place he didn’t get to on his list was Grant Achatz’s Alinea, because he ran out of money before he could buy a ticket to Chicago. Ten months to the day after that first meal at Tetsuya’s, he was back in Seoul.</p>
<p class="indent">And he was miserable. Now that he had seen the gastronomic world, Korea felt more backward than ever when it came to cuisine. “There wasn’t a Pacojet in the whole country!” he laments, referring to a device, common in European and American professional kitchens, that makes ice creams and other frozen purées without significant quantities of sugar. And he couldn’t get Ferran’s words out of his head. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that this one simple idea—don’t copy—represented a complete revolution in cuisine. Luke had read a lot of culinary history, and he knew that professional cooking was founded on a set of recipes that a talented chef might hone, polish, even reimagine to fit his own vision. But Ferran had overturned all that. He didn’t start with someone else’s recipe and tinker with it. Ferran started only with himself, with his own ideas. “That takes so much passion,” Luke says. “And courage.”</p>
<p class="indent">Having found his master, Luke was ready to wholly dedicate himself to the task of discipleship. He had no money and no job offer. His mother, who had understood his desire to travel the first time but had missed him terribly in his absence, wanted him at home. Yet Luke felt he had no choice. Ten days after he returned to Korea, he left again for Europe. This time, he decided, he would do a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Cooking is one of the few professions that still allows for discipleship. True to its artisanal roots, it has a long history of mentorship—you learn to cook by watching an expert do it. The deep roots of that tradition is part of its appeal. As an apprentice with Michel Guérard, Daniel Boulud was reassured to learn that his mentor had had his own mentor. It reminded him, he writes, “of the jazz legend Fats Waller playing organ and doing his own <span class="txit">stage</span> with an organist in Paris, who in turn had studied with a <a id="page_108"/>student of Franz Liszt.” Finding a mentor means plugging into a long chain of greatness in the hope of finding your place within it. It can give a young cook a sense of direction and purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Any good discipleship demands rigor, and indeed, training to be a cook requires a physical exertion and mental steeliness that would not be uncommon in, say, one of those aspiring yogis who must learn not only to hold the lotus position for hours but to stick needles through his cheek while he does it. Much of any culinary apprenticeship consists of training to withstand its twin demons: exhaustion and tedium. It’s why most every chef in the world can tell horror stories about the hardships of her time at the bottom of the kitchen hierarchy. When Boulud did his first apprenticeship with Gerard Nandron in Lyon, he spent so much time washing lettuce, his arms plunged deep in water, that he earned the nickname “the Beaver” (his assistant suggests that Boulud was not wholly distressed to learn years later that in English the word has another meaning). Dan Barber recalls having to shuck three hundred oysters every morning at Michel Rostang in Paris, according to a precisely designed procedure. First, the twenty-four-year-old stagiaire had to wash each oyster by dunking it exactly three times in ice-cold water—though not, it must be clear, water that actually contained ice. Then, he was taught, he had to hold the oyster in his right hand and, with a dull paring knife in his left, open the shell by going under the belly, being careful not to nick the flesh. (“Which was ridiculous,” Barber points out, “since no one was going to see it. This was for oyster ravioli.”) He had to make sure that he held the oyster upright—not the most natural position but one that ensured that the juices ran directly into a container below. And since Rostang permitted his cooks only two towels a day, Barber also had to make sure that his didn’t get too dirty or wet from the oyster liquor since that would mean his allotment was rendered useless for the rest of the day. “But that was the point,” Barber recalls. “If you washed them right, your towel didn’t get dirty when you held it. And because you opened them upright, all the juice went into a container and was saved to finish a shellfish sauce, instead of soaking in a towel.” It was a model, Barber found, that could be applied to other preparations as well. Tomatoes, for <a id="page_109"/>example, also had to be dunked three times—though this time in boiling water—in order to be skinned and then again held upright as the peel removed without nicking the flesh, so that the juice would fall neatly into a bowl, to be used later for vinaigrette.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, there was not only a purpose to every step, no matter how seemingly absurd, but a building block in each—something that served as the foundation for something else, a lesson a young cook might carry with him, might employ, for the rest of his career. But what happens if the tasks you repeat each day of your apprenticeship are not ones you will be able to use elsewhere? What happens, for example, if you have to make Montjoi lentils?</p>
<p class="indent">Spaniards adore what they call <span class="txit">cocina de cuchara,</span> or “spoon cuisine,” a reference to traditional stews soupy enough to make forks impractical. Each region has its own variation—red beans with ham, white beans with blood sausage, chickpeas with cod—but lentils have somehow defied the boundaries of regional identity to become a national dish, available in restaurants throughout every part of Spain. Including, as of August 2009, one in a small corner of the Catalan coast.</p>
<p class="indent">ElBulli’s version is more delicate than most. A bit of translucent broth, a dusting of spice, and, at the bottom of the clear glass bowl, a small heap of tiny olive green legumes. Only they aren’t, of course, actual legumes. “Montjoi lentils” are made from a batter of melted clarified butter and sesame paste that is the exact color of a Puy lentil. Squeezed through the narrow tip of a syringe into a bowl of ice water, the batter seizes, transforming each drop of liquid into a small, elliptical sphere. As long as it stays cold, you have a “lentil” (by itself, it tastes mostly of sesame, but once it is submerged in the lentil-flavored broth, with ham oil dotted on top, the taste is reminiscent, if not an exact match, of the beloved bean stew). It’s a brilliant dish—delicious and playful at the same time. And the playfulness is layered.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a standard elBulli trick: to serve something that resembles what it is called but is not, in fact, made of it. In this case, there is the “lentil” that looks and tastes like a lentil but is not a lentil. But there is also a self-referential quality to the dish. The knowledgeable diner <a id="page_110"/>who understands Adrià’s signature techniques tends to sit down to the bowl of Montjoi lentils and assume—indeed, may even pontificate to his dining companions—that the tiny disks at the bottom of the bowl are spherifications. Maybe made from lentil purée, maybe made from some other substance altogether, but definitely mixed with calcium carbonate and run through the alginate bath. The joke is that this isn’t an elBulli trick at all. There are no additives in the Montjoi lentils, and they are not spherified. There is nothing to them, in fact, besides butter and sesame and the natural reaction that occurs when a liquid fat encounters cold water. (For serving, the lentils are strained from the ice bath in which they float.) The diner’s expectations are twice dashed. Montjoi lentils are elBulli’s idea of an inside joke.</p>
<p class="indent">But for the stagiaires who make them, the lentils are not the least bit funny. Each bowl contains precisely thirteen grams, which comes out to several dozen lentils, and since the dish appears on almost every menu, the stagiaires must push approximately two thousand drops of lentil batter through their syringes into ice water each day. Divided by eight or so people, that’s 250 lentils per stagiaire. And although the technique is ridiculously simple (put lentil batter into syringe, push plunger), a lot can go wrong. Push too hard, and you’ll get a stream instead of a drop; even the slightest excess of pressure results in globules that look more like tiny bullets than legumes. The batter also tends to firm up if it spends too long in the syringe, making it hard to expel properly, so a stagiaire may have to carry hers over to the flattop to warm it a bit. And as Lucho points out, the worst thing about the lentils is that because you’re working from a huge, full bowl of batter, you can always see exactly how much remains, and it always seems to be more than you had hoped. It takes the stagiaires more than an hour to finish a day’s batch.</p>
<p class="indent">If, in its double entendre, the Montjoi lentils perfectly represent the diner’s experience at elBulli, so too do they capture what it means to be a stagiaire in the restaurant’s kitchen. For one, it is a remarkable, genre-bending dish that depends, for its dazzle, on a cheap, ample supply of labor. In a normal kitchen, with far fewer staff, it would be nearly impossible to dedicate the time and effort of even one cook to reproducing <a id="page_111"/>such a painstaking component. But at elBulli, there is labor to spare—in fact, it is precisely so that the kitchen can produce dishes like the lentils that the restaurant takes on so many stagiaires. This dish also represents what, for the apprentices, is the very worst of the elBulli experience. The lentils take <span class="txit">forever</span> to prepare, causing hands and arms to cramp from holding the syringe in the right position for that much time. The process is incredibly boring—drip, drip, drip, like some kind of culinary water torture—but holds just enough potential complication that they can’t completely space out. Worst of all, the preparation seems so futile. It’s not just that they are boring themselves silly for a single dish but that the dish—the technique it requires, the unique blend of exactitude and mindlessness—doesn’t really have any applications beyond the lentils themselves. Even if another restaurant wanted to adapt the technique to new ingredients, where would it get the manpower to make the dish?</p>
<p class="indent">At one point, watching Emma steam herself over a boiling pot, Ferran says, with just a touch of pride, that what they do at elBulli is create specialists. Pointing to her, he emphasizes his point: Emma is now the “world expert in roses—no one knows more about cooking roses than she does. Not even me.” Given that Emma is likely the only person in the world to spend hours each day plucking, blanching, and straining edible petals, he is probably right. But what, exactly, is the value of this esoteric knowledge?</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps that’s the wrong question. Many chefs hold that the most important thing a stagiaire learns is never a single technique or even a collection of them but the self-discipline to carry out each one perfectly, every time. Yet for someone like Luke, who spent more than two years in the South Korean army, who worked in an Australian slaughterhouse to fund his ambition, and who has spent the better part of a year sleeping outdoors on the ground and walking long distances so that he will have enough money for the three-star meals that are his self-created education, that answer doesn’t satisfy either. He had mastered self-discipline long before he arrived at elBulli. Now he wanted guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_112"/>When Luke returned to elBulli in the summer of 2008, there were just two months left in the season. He had not contacted the restaurant beforehand and thus did not have a <span class="txit">stage</span> arranged there. In fact, no one knew he was coming. He just hiked those same seven kilometers uphill and asked, in nearly nonexistent Spanish, to work. Marc Cuspinera was at the restaurant the day Luke arrived, and he explained to him, patiently, that elBulli has a system for selecting its stagiaires, that the selection process is quite competitive, and that there simply wasn’t room in the kitchen for him at that time. Luke was undeterred. He went outside and set up his tent and sleeping bag on the hillside across from the restaurant, close enough to Ferran’s house that Ferran’s wife, Isabel, joked that Luke was camping in her garden. A couple days later, he went back to the restaurant and asked again; again he was refused. By now Isabel, who had at first been a little startled to see this lanky Korean lurking near the house, had grown accustomed to his presence. She began to exert gentle pressure on her husband. “He’s really very nice,” she told Ferran. “And he certainly is dedicated.” After three weeks of camping and constant pressure, Luke was finally allowed in. He would spend the next eight weeks doing the most dreary of center table’s tasks, but he didn’t mind; he understood that he had come late and was just glad to have found a place. Nor did it bother him that he had practically no contact with his chosen mentor; he knew it would take time for him to earn Ferran’s trust, and for the time being, he was thrilled simply to be in the great man’s presence. Luke worked as hard as he could and then, with the end of the 2008 season upon him, signed up for another <span class="txit">stage</span> the following year.</p>
<p class="indent">In the interim, he couldn’t afford to leave Spain, so he took a <span class="txit">stage</span> in Andoni Luis Aduriz’s two-starred Michelin restaurant Mugaritz, just outside San Sebastián. Aduriz had trained under Adrià and is today one of the most innovative, accomplished chefs in Spain, so Luke knew he would learn a great deal from him. But mostly he was just passing time until June 2009, when elBulli would open again and he could return for the full season.</p>

<p class="caption">Luke in his assigned seat at Ferran’s side during family meal (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent">When at last it began, there was no happier stagiaire than Luke. Even as the apprentices cleaned the rocks on the first day, he was absolutely ebullient. “This is my passion,” he said, grinning broadly as he lifted one stone after the next. That passion was obvious not only in the joyful smile he kept at the ready but in the vigor with which he worked. Taller than anyone else in the kitchen even before a copious amount of gel gave his jet black hair a few extra centimeters, he already stood out. But his sense of urgency distinguished him even more. Whether he was crossing the kitchen in a sort of superhero glide that allowed him to traverse the distance between one station and another in a single step or scrubbing down the flattop with a motion so intense it seemed bionic, Luke moved with an efficiency that would have been flamboyant if that weren’t a contradiction in terms. His <span class="txit">quemo</span> was sharper, his sweeping more rapid, his plate polishing more fervent than anyone else’s; the only thing for which he was consistently criticized was running in the kitchen. He was the most physically eloquent of the stagiaires, channeling his body’s kinetic energy so that it silently but forcefully conveyed the message <span class="txit">I <a id="page_114"/>am working really hard.</span> Sometimes, when he spied coworkers slacking off, that message transformed itself into a subtle reproach: <span class="txit">I am working harder than anybody else</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early days of the season, the chefs used him as a model, not only because he was the only stagiaire who had actually worked in the kitchen before but because his work ethic was so impeccable. They called on him to stack the plates that needed to be wiped down before service because he already knew which plates were used for which courses. He was assigned a broom for the post–family meal cleanup because Eduard already knew he could rely on him to leave a floor utterly free of crumbs. Luke did the tasks uncomplainingly, with a ferocity that bordered on the manic, because it was the only way, he said, that he would learn. The fact that he already knew how to do the jobs, having learned them the previous season, did not seem to occur to him.</p>
<p class="indent">Nowhere was his complete submission to the work clearer than with spherification. A process that uses algae-based gellifiers and calcium carbonate to turn liquids into semisolid globules, spherification is one of the signature techniques of elBulli. It requires the cook to drop a spoonful of some kind of runny substance—red currant purée, say, or pesto or olive oil—first into an alginate bath and then, when a transparent skin has formed on the outside that will allow the product to keep its rounded shape while remaining liquid on the inside, into a tub of water for rinsing, and finally into another for storing. The entire process is exacting: at one point Aitor chastised a stagiaire for crowding his spheres—“It should look like a lake,” he said. “Not a swimming pool.” But the most time-consuming part of the chore is the transfer between baths. The cook is supposed to scoop up each spherification with a slotted spoon, drain off the excess liquid, and slide it into the new tub. At this point in the process, it is not unusual to see a stagiaire pause during the draining and stare off into space. Once he gets over the gee-whiz factor of the technique, the actual task is deathly boring, and it can be hard to maintain focus.</p>
<p class="indent">Not for Luke, however. He had a trick. Like a señorita opening her fan, he flicked his wrist gracefully with every movement. Even hours into <a id="page_115"/>the numbing routine—dip, scoop, dip—he would add that little flourish, time after time, as he transferred the globule from one bath to another. The flick was so consistent that it seemed mechanized and so delicate that it looked affected, but it served a purpose. In fact, it allowed him to get the spherifying liquid off the sphere in a single motion, without having to wait for it to drain. That way, Luke finished his spherifications sooner than anyone else.</p>
<p class="indent">Watching him race through his tasks, the chefs would smile at one another and shake their heads, as if even they couldn’t believe how hard Luke worked. But for Luke, nothing about what he did was funny. Learning required the utmost dedication and focus, and he would not tolerate a moment’s lapse in himself or, for that matter, in anyone else. Many of the stagiaires tried to pass the time they spent doing mise en place at the center table by carrying on whispered conversations with each other or daydreaming; Sunny would go over hikes he had taken recently, while Antonio Romero entertained himself by thinking about the bars he and his friends had hit on their day off. But Luke remained centered on the task at hand. “The only thing I think in my head while I am working,” he said, “is ‘faster, faster, faster.’”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Eugeni de Diego hears those words in his head, too. Thin and anxious-looking, he is elBulli’s “chef of production” (a position roughly equivalent to sous chef in other restaurants), which means he is in charge of mise en place. It is up to him to ensure that the major tasks are finished each day by the time the crew sits down for staff meal, which he also oversees. He has the closest relationship with the stagiaires and the most inherently antagonistic—constantly watching, constantly correcting. It is he to whom Miguel Alexander presents the roughly three cups of julienned lemon peel it took the center table nearly an hour to complete and he who, unhappy with the unevenness of the pieces, unceremoniously dumps them on the table, hands Miguel Alexander a pair of tweezers, and sets him to work pulling out the imperfect ones. Sometimes it seems to the stagiaires that he goes after them simply to assert his authority. One day <a id="page_116"/>he criticizes Emma for coming back from the walk-in empty-handed, but a short while later, when she walks into the kitchen straining slightly under the weight of a crate of water, he snaps at her again. “I don’t want to see anyone carry too much,” he says in front of the entire kitchen before softening his tone a bit. “You’ll hurt your back. If something is really heavy, get two people.”</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the stagiaires, in fact, have a Eugeni story—about a bit of criticism they feel is unfair or the time that he took credit for something that they had done. “Once I saw him say to someone else, ‘I can do five of those in the time you do one,’” recalls one. “He always has to prove he’s better than anyone else.” Or there was the time an avellanto—a fragile cake made from amaranth seeds—was accidentally plated wrong: “He blamed me for it, when he was the one who had done it,” says another.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet Eugeni is in a difficult position at elBulli. “His job is more of a pain than anyone else’s,” Ferran recognizes. “He has to be like a schoolteacher to them all the time.” In other words, he not only instructs and monitors the stagiaires but is expected to assert his authority over them and, to a lesser extent, the line cooks, even though he himself is just twenty-five years old. At the beginning of the season, Eugeni had asked Marc how he should talk to stagiaires; Marc told him to speak to them the way he likes to be spoken to. “If you yell at them, they’ll listen to you the first time and do what you want. They may even do it the second time. But if you keep yelling, they’re not going to want to work for you.” At the time it seemed like sage advice, but as the season advances, Eugeni has found the words hard to live by. He is still struggling to figure out his own role in the restaurant’s hierarchy.</p>
<p class="indent">It is a tricky business. For all their bad-boy affectations, cooks tend to display a marked respect for hierarchy—or at least the upper echelons of it. Most any chef will tell you that a well-functioning restaurant is impossible without a well-run brigade, that without the militaristic order in which everyone knows his or her place at all times, the task of turning out fifty or two hundred meals each night quickly descends into chaos. And there is little doubt that the top-down chain of command that characterizes most restaurants helps the guys—and again, most are <a id="page_117"/>men—in the highest positions maintain a kind of order that serves their interests. The more remarkable social dynamic is that, as long as the chefs are skilled, the people further down the chain tend to embrace the hierarchy just as fervently as their superiors. You’d be hard pressed to find the enthusiasm with which a young cook will reply, “Yes, chef” today in once-hierarchical areas such as medicine or academia. With a deference that occasionally veers on self-abasement, most of the stagiaires don’t just complete a task, they jump to it with an alacrity. They stand aside to let their chefs pass in front of them and would never think of interrupting one engaged in conversation, no matter how pressing the emergency.</p>
<p class="indent">But this respect, while automatically given, can be retracted if judged unwarranted. As Momofuku chef David Chang writes, the title “chef” can, if delivered with the right intonation, be derogatory. “What a joke, what a meaningless term it is these days: a fool in a black chef’s jacket who has no fucking clue about anything. But when you work in a kitchen, your boss is your chef, and you call him or her that.” At elBulli no one calls anyone “chef,” but that doesn’t mean they aren’t evaluating. Nor does it mean that they don’t miss the signifier. On their days off, the stagiaires will frequently get together to cook, and as one asks another to help with a task, the helper will often respond, <span class="txit">“Oui, chef.”</span> It’s a joke, of course, but something more as well; a chance to say the longed-for words and in so doing acknowledge the tradition you belong to and your place in it. For all that outsiders may think of the professional kitchen as a place of noisy, unbridled frenzy—a vision reinforced, no doubt, by those quick peeks through the window on the way from dining room to bathroom—most of its denizens like structure, even crave it. “I like the hierarchy,” Katie says, “Because I always know exactly where I am.”</p>
<p class="indent">At elBulli, hierarchy works in strange ways. The use of first names implies accessibility, and in fact, Oriol, Eduard, and Mateu do tend to be approachable in ways that chefs de cuisine in other restaurants often aren’t. “I’ve never been so afraid of someone as I was of Chef [Jonathan] Benno,” Kim Floresca says of her chef de cuisine at Per Se, even now—eighteen months after she left the restaurant—referring to <a id="page_118"/>him by his honorific. “But here I joke around with Oriol all the time.” It’s not unusual for Oriol to place a paternal hand on a stagiaire’s shoulder as he answers a question or checks a preparation. Mateu receives high praise from most of his stagiaires for his patient willingness to answer their endless slew of questions. And even Eduard, whose personality is the sternest of the three, inspires a sense of collegiality that is unusual among the people who generally bear the brunt of his criticism. “I like Eduard a lot,” says Diego. “I know he’s got this authoritarian way about him, but that’s just a role. No one else puts himself in it, so he has to. But when you talk to him one-on-one, he’s a really nice guy.”</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the sense of accessibility has its limits. Despite the first-name basis, hierarchy at elBulli is reinforced in gestures both formal and subtle. The chefs de cuisine, for example, tend not to socialize with the stagiaires. When they step outside the kitchen for cigarettes during break, they remain standing while everyone else sits. Eduard encourages questions, but only to a point. “We’re not going to eat you if you ask us something,” he says at one morning meeting. “But we’re not going to like it either if you ask us the same thing six times.” The chefs can go where they want in the kitchen, but no stagiaire can walk in front of the pass, unless she has been sent there for a specific purpose, such as to sweep. A stagiaire in charge of, say, cooking a rose petal, must take one every day to a chef to taste and either approve or dismiss, just as a chef de partie preparing a stock, no matter how many times he has done so, must daily take a spoonful of it to his superior for approval. The chefs de cuisine and, of course, Ferran himself do not have to line up to be served for family meal; instead of waiting at the back entrance, they come in through the front and are served first. Even their table—the center one—is set first and always with the best-looking salad or an extra loaf of bread.</p>
<p class="indent">Language reinforces the hierarchy. Ferran, Juli, the chefs de cuisine, and all the permanent front-of-house staff are Catalan, which means that they were born and raised in a region of Spain with a distinct language and culture, and a politics that tends to support greater autonomy from the central Spanish government. None of elBulli’s staff is a particularly vocal Catalan nationalist (elBulli has become too much an emblem of <a id="page_119"/>Spain itself for the higher-ups to allow that), and in the fall of 2009, when many towns throughout the region, including Roses, hold a nonbinding referendum on independence from Spain, none of them votes. But from their wholesale and virulent embrace of the Barça football team to the prevalence of dishes such as <span class="txit">escalivada</span> (marinated roasted vegetables) and <span class="txit">escudella</span> (chickpea stew) at family meal, elBulli’s permanent staff clearly embraces Catalan culture. And that means that although they speak native Spanish, they prefer Catalan, the Romance language indigenous to the region. Though “prefer” may not be the right word; it implies a choice, and in fact Catalan seems to pour out of their mouths naturally whenever they are in one another’s presence. It’s what they immediately lapse into when they’re shooting the shit during break, and it’s what they unthinkingly use to communicate among themselves at work. Oriol and Eduard may conduct the morning meetings with the entire staff in Spanish, but should one of them need to consult the other on a particular question, he will slip into Catalan. No doubt this practice helps shield their discussion from prying ears, but it is not pure obstruction; after all, some of the stagiaires are Catalan too and can understand everything being said. But those same cooks, should they need to speak to Eduard or Oriol, do so in Spanish. At elBulli there are two tiers of language, and Catalan, at least in the kitchen (in the dining room, the servers are all Catalan and thus use the language regardless of rank), is reserved for the chefs.</p>
<p class="indent">The respect for rank reaches all the way to the top. So utterly in control of their own realms, Eduard, Oriol, and Mateu nonetheless defer completely to Ferran. One day during mise, one of the people who works occasionally in the elBulli office in Barcelona appears in the kitchen with a laptop and sets himself up at the table, ensconcing himself in one of the two free seats (the other two are piled with that day’s allotment of mail, gifts, and press clippings) to type up Oriol’s notes on the new dishes. For the first few hours he works alone, but finally he needs Oriol’s help: in several cases he can’t make out the chef’s handwriting. Oriol hovers over the typist’s left shoulder, where he accidentally knocks the cord that is charging the man’s computer out of the socket. The <a id="page_120"/>typist plugs the computer back in and pulls out the chair beside him, suggesting it would be easier if Oriol took a seat. Oriol lightly refuses, saying he prefers to stand. The typist moves on to another recipe, and the two begin to make their way down the list of illegible ingredients when Oriol leans in and again knocks out the plug. “Dammit,” the man snaps. “Would you please just sit down?” Oriol shakes him off. They get a little further, and the whole sequence happens again. “Look, if you don’t sit, we can’t do this!” the typist exclaims, exasperated. Oriol smiles nervously, then excuses himself, suddenly remembering a sauce left on the stove top.</p>
<p class="indent">The chair he refuses to take is Ferran’s. Sometimes Oriol sits there first thing in the morning, before Ferran arrives, as he goes through his notes from the previous day. But this encounter occurs in the afternoon, and although Ferran is occupied elsewhere with a television interview, he is still in the house. As long as he is at elBulli, no one else sits in his chair.</p>
<p class="indent">This exaggerated deference is another way in which cooking promotes discipleship, and at elBulli few of the stagiaires are bothered by it. In fact, they <span class="txit">expect</span> their chefs to have privileges; they <span class="txit">want</span> them to be different. After all, those same privileges may someday await them when they are chef, and the chance to receive your plate of lentils before anyone else seems like fair reward for all those years of scut work. Most of them too respect the idea of the imperious chef. They accept that an integral part of a great restaurant is the great man—the genius, they like to say—at the top. They know that running a great restaurant carries with it a sometimes crippling amount of stress and pressure. They understand that that pressure will sometimes lead their chefs to behave poorly, to snap, to shout, to act like prima donnas. And for the most part, they understand, even embrace, this part of the territory, because if their chef is a great man, then it means they are affiliated with greatness. It’s the thing that Eduard and Oriol and Mateu say over and over again when asked, as they inevitably are, if they don’t mind that their names aren’t on the menu. No, they respond, I know what it means to work here. I know what I have been a part of.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"/>Still, there are limits to the stagiaires’ acceptance. Ferran doesn’t like to shout, and in fact, elBulli has none of the angry, testosterone-filled energy of, say, a Gordon Ramsay kitchen. At the beginning of the season he promised that there would be no insults or other forms of verbal abuse in his restaurant, and he reiterates the thought throughout the season. “If there’s screaming in a restaurant, it’s because control has been lost,” he says. “And that doesn’t happen here.” Except when it does. Mistakes are sometimes made; things occasionally don’t go as smoothly as one would like. At those times—and they are admittedly few—Ferran does shout. He just doesn’t shout at the person directly responsible for the error.</p>
<p class="indent">One night, for example, an eight-top comes in a little past 8:30 <small>P.M.</small> It is still light out, so the group first sits on the patio, taking in the view of Cala Montjoi’s aquamarine waters while they start their meal. Ever since the late 1990s, elBulli has opened meals with cocktails and “snacks” because, says Ferran, “it always seemed ridiculous to me that you would go to a fine dining restaurant and have to wait half an hour before they gave you any food beside a piece of bread.” In this case, the first cocktail, the conífera, is set before them without a hitch. But then the table does something the staff hates: it orders a bottle of wine. In most restaurants, this action is heartily welcomed: a table that starts so early with a bottle is likely to continue with another and thus drive up the check. But at elBulli, a bottle of wine at this stage of the meal threatens to throw off everyone’s timing. And indeed, that’s exactly what happens: a sommelier stops the sequence of dishes while he brings and pours the wine, but then, critically, the server forgets to restart it. Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes pass, until suddenly Ferran realizes something is wrong. He charges over to the pass, rifles through the tickets, and begins shouting at Eduard. “That table has been seated for half an hour and they still don’t have all their snacks!” he yells. “It makes no sense! Are you not paying attention? Don’t you know how important rhythm is to the experience here?” At this point, he switches to Catalan and continues berating Eduard; the words “disaster” and “stupid” float through the linguistic morass. Eduard remains preternaturally calm, his eyes firmly fixed <a id="page_122"/>on the tickets in front of him, and continues to call out orders. Ferran switches back to Spanish. “Are you listening to me?” he demands, before harrumphing into a chair and thumbing angrily through the reservation book. He had planned to do his own complete menu tasting that night, to see how things fit together, but in the upheaval, that does not happen. Eduard asks if they should hold on to his planned menu so they can do the tasting tomorrow; Ferran cannot bring himself to look the chef in the eyes and only nods a stony yes. “That was nothing,” Eduard says at the end of the night, when Ferran has gone home. “That was anger ‘lite.’” Throughout it all, Ferran never once raised his voice, or even spoke, to the waiter responsible for the mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">A few weeks later, this pattern of reprimand repeats itself. A new stagiaire, Frederico Ribeiro from Portugal, has joined the crew. On his first day, he seems enthusiastic, but on this, his second morning, he doesn’t appear at staff meeting. No one knows what happened to him; his roommates testify that he seemed fine that morning but admit that they haven’t had a chance to get to know him. Finally, about an hour or so after the kitchen starts mise, Lluís walks downstairs from his office and whispers to Eduard that the restaurant has received a call: Frederico took one of the curves on the road up to the restaurant too quickly and hit an oncoming car. No one is hurt, but he is stuck about a mile from elBulli, waiting for the police to show up.</p>
<p class="indent">Eduard tells Ferran what he had learned, and within seconds, Ferran is yelling at Mateu, who, needless to say, had nothing to do with the accident, and nothing to do with Frederico’s absence. But along with Marc, he is in charge of the stagiaires, especially on the days when Marc isn’t in the restaurant. Why, Ferran wants to know, didn’t Frederico have Mateu’s cell phone number? What if he hadn’t thought to call information and get the reservation line? Why had they had to wait all this time to find out what had happened? Hadn’t Mateu impressed on the stagiaires the need for communication? It didn’t matter that it was only Frederico’s second day. Didn’t he realize that they were responsible for the stagiaires’ well-being? What if something more serious had happened? And again: why the hell didn’t Frederico have Mateu’s number? Mateu, like Eduard <a id="page_123"/>before him, freezes in the blast of Ferran’s anger, a hiker hoping that if he remains still enough the large grizzly bear he has just stumbled across won’t notice him.</p>
<p class="indent">Most cooks are accustomed to being yelled at. It’s an inherent part of restaurant culture, a reflexive response to the intense stress and physical discomfort of working in a kitchen. But anger is not just an uncontrollable reflex, it’s also a tool: it keeps people focused. As one otherwise mild-mannered New York chef says in reference to the staff he regularly screams at, “You need their fear. Otherwise it all goes to shit.” As a result, most cooks excuse the anger, seeing in it at least a sign of virtue if not actually virtue itself. Paras Shah, a cook who has worked in David Chang’s notoriously volatile Momofuku kitchens and whose own colorful vocabulary is hardly constrained, explains his chef’s outbursts like this: “It’s because he’s a perfectionist. If he gets mad, it’s because I’m not doing something perfectly. And it has to be perfect.” Which is why Shah has no doubt that, once he has his own restaurant, he’ll yell just as much as Chang ever did. Like abused children who grow up to abuse their own, cooks learn to scream from their superiors.</p>
<p class="indent">At elBulli, there are a few stagiaires, such as César Bermúdez in Pastry, who are unhappy with any display of anger; at thirty-two, he has worked most of his career in culinary schools and is unaccustomed to the rough-and-tumble of service. Still, he did work for a while at Carme Ruscalleda’s three-star restaurant Sant Pau, and there, he says, no one ever screamed. “When an order came up, it was always, ‘Could you please take this?’ She would never have permitted anyone to yell at anyone.” César is the exception, though; most of the stagiaires have experience being yelled at. Andrea, who came to elBulli from noma, recalls that Chef Redzepi’s temper tantrums were legendary. “René used to get in your face and scream at you if a piece of leek wasn’t set at exactly the right angle,” she says. “That wasn’t so great.” It turns out, however, that having their chefs take the fall for them isn’t so great either. The apprentices are unaccustomed to seeing their superiors chewed out, and in some ways, those outbursts bother the stagiaires more than if they themselves were the object of them. They rationalize the anger in <a id="page_124"/>the same way—after he witnesses Ferran raging for a solid half hour at Eduard for an undercooked suckling pig’s tail that has to be sent back, the quiet Chilean stagiaire Juan Pablo Mellado explains the explosion as proof that “for Ferran, everything needs to be perfect all the time.” But that doesn’t assuage Juan Pablo’s discomfort, or that of the other stagiaires, when Eduard, Oriol, and Mateu are reprimanded in front of them. They tend to go rigid, dropping their eyes as if to block out the scene, like children witnessing their parents fighting. At the very least, they say, they wish Ferran would do his chewing out in private. What seems to Ferran like the proper use of the chain of command (“It makes things work more smoothly, and besides, those three know how to take it,” Ferran says of Oriol, Eduard, and Mateu. “It’s like when you get mad at your family members.”) seems to them like an assault on the hierarchy. They want their chefs to be treated with respect at all times, even—especially—by the chef above them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Yet for all their embrace of tradition and rank, many of the stagiaires long for some kind of direct relationship with Ferran. It’s not that they expect to be pals with him—only Diego, who, on the day he turns twenty-eight, dares to jokingly ask Ferran what the chef had gotten him for his birthday, describes his relationship with Adrià as friendship. (“He calls me Messi,” Diego offers as proof, a reference to the star Argentine player on Barcelona’s soccer team.) But they had hoped for something more. Although one stagiaire recounts how Ferran bought his table dinner when they both ended up at the same restaurant on a night off, others report running into him in Barcelona and getting the distinct impression that he didn’t know who they were. Many are bothered that he doesn’t greet them at the restaurant. Gabriel Vidolin, a sensitive, cuddly stagiaire from Brazil who arrives halfway through the 2009 season, gets a chilly response when he attempts to show Ferran a short video of some of the dishes he prepares at his restaurant back home. Ferran is his greatest hero, Gabriel says, and he is anxious to hear his advice. The response is crushingly brusque. “I don’t interact with stagiaires,” Ferran says. A few <a id="page_125"/>minutes later, Mateu rushes over to Gabriel. “What did you say to him?” he demands. “You want to talk to someone, you talk to me.”</p>
<p class="indent">In many ways, the apprentices’ disillusionment is a product of generational differences. Fifteen years ago, no stagiaire would have expected anything from his chef except distance, and perhaps disdain. “When I was <span class="txit">staging</span> in France,” says Dan Barber, who spent half a year working at Michel Rostang, “it would never have occurred to me to approach the chef unasked.” Other prominent chefs recount a similar attitude. “Are you kidding?” asks Claude Bosi, chef of the two-star Hibiscus in London. who apprenticed with Jean-Paul Lacombe in Lyon. “He would have smacked me if I talked to him like that.”</p>
<p class="indent">In truth, Ferran knows more about the stagiaires than he lets on. His memory is prodigious, and he maintains a mental record of at least their bare biographical facts, if not their actual names. He is given to referring to some of them by nationality: The Argentine, The Japanese. It’s a characteristic that Juan Pablo, who has come to elBulli after years teaching in a culinary school in San José, will discover when, fifty-eight days into his <span class="txit">stage,</span> Ferran calls him over to meet chef José Andrés. “He’s Chilean,” Ferran explains to Andrés before shuffling him off to the dining room to start his forty-course meal. “And a prof.” That night, as excited as any adolescent girl with a crush, the thirty-five-year-old writes in his journal, “He remembered me!” And once a stagiaire has gone on to a job of his own, Ferran is unfailingly generous and kind. “He is incredibly supportive,” says Redzepi. “But that’s once you’ve left elBulli.”</p>
<p class="indent">Still, many of elBulli’s stagiaires find Ferran’s self-imposed distance disappointing. That is a reflection in part of the expectations that elBulli itself creates, with its emphasis on first names and no insults. It is also a sign of changing times, as even the most haute of haute cuisine restaurants succumbs to a certain degree of democratization. The fame accorded the celebrity chef probably plays a role as well: through his own books and the innumerable articles about him, the conference talks and television appearances, Ferran—like an increasing number of famous, media-friendly chefs—foments the illusion among his admirers that they know him. But his remoteness is one of the stagiaires’ most <a id="page_126"/>common complaints, the uneasy product of their perhaps unrealistic expectations. Mateu puts his finger on it. “They come here,” he says with a rueful smile, “thinking that they’re going to learn to cook from Ferran Adrià.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">“Luke, do you have any brothers or sisters?” Sergi, the teenage stagiaire from one of the local culinary schools, asks with a grin. It is late at night, nearly the end of August, and everyone is standing around outside, waiting for word that they can go home. The others turn to Sergi, expecting a punch line that quickly comes. “Because I could run an entire restaurant with just two or three of you,” Sergi says with a guffaw.</p>
<p class="indent">All the stagiaires laugh, including Luke. But the expression on his face exposes a faint trace of doubt: Are you laughing with me or at me? Until this point in the season, Luke has never questioned what he is doing at elBulli. He knows that he doesn’t quite fit in with the rest of the stagiaires: his lack of funds prevents him from going out very often after work, and both his Spanish and his English are limited, making it hard to communicate as fully as he would like. And his efforts, so superhuman as to earn him the moniker “the Machine” also distinguish him, even in this hardworking place. As someone for whom efficiency and effort come almost naturally, he knows that he is sometimes critical of those who in his opinion fail to meet the restaurant’s standards. It’s not unusual for him to play enforcer at the center table, a self-appointed second in command to Eugeni, noticing when other stagiaires lose focus, chastising them with a silent shake of his head when they talk on the line, correcting them on any work that is less than perfect. But he has never doubted that this was the way it should be, that this was what it means to be a disciple.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, two months into the season, Luke admits what is to him a shameful secret: he is tired of spherifying. Each day, he and two other stagiaires create thousands of globules. He has been doing it since the start of the season, eight weeks ago now. The year before, when he was at elBulli for two months on that impromptu <span class="txit">stage,</span> he spherified too. “I <a id="page_127"/>know it’s an important job,” he says with a guilty smile. “It’s just—” He pauses over the treasonous thought before blurting it out. “It’s just that I’d like to learn something new.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s a benign complaint, but it signals a larger discontent. When he started the season, Luke was convinced that elBulli—and Ferran—were the highest pinnacle to which a young cook could aspire. “It’s the perfect restaurant,” he said then. “Just perfect.” When he was put in charge of spherification, he took the assignment as a sign that his devotion had been recognized. The same held true for his seating position at family meal: of all the people at elBulli, he was chosen to sit next to Ferran. All these gifts he accepted with modesty and grace, along with a driving ambition to prove himself worthy. He has worked harder than anyone else. He has monitored the others, trying to encourage them to meet his own efforts. And he has made it clear that, given his druthers, he would continue at elBulli indefinitely, dedicated to it forever like Marc or Oriol.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of August, Eduard tells Luke that he will be given new tasks. He is excited by the news; not only does it represent a chance to learn something new, but perhaps it will also mean the dreamed-for increase in responsibility, the first step toward acquiring a permanent position in the restaurant. He has already proven that he is ready to oversee other people’s work. That’s why, for example, he chewed out Lorenzo for not hosing down the landing properly and why, when he saw Gaël drift off in the middle of lentil production, he opened his index and middle fingers in a “V,” brought them to his eyes Robert De Niro–style, and pointed accusingly to the bowl. (Gaël straightened up, but not without a scowl; you could almost hear his inner voice asking who Luke was to tell him what to do.) But Luke doesn’t care. “There are a lot of really strong-minded people here, and it can be hard to work with them—everyone has his own way of doing things. But we have to work together, and in the way that we’re told,” he says. “Otherwise, the quality suffers.”</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe, he hopes, the new tasks mean he is being auditioned for a permanent position. At the beginning of the season, Luke told Marc that he was interested in returning the following year as a line cook. <a id="page_128"/>Marc made a note of it, but since then Luke has heard nothing. Still, he was optimistic. ElBulli seemed to him an environment not very different from the army, and hadn’t he been promoted there? Surely, he thought, Ferran would recognize his efforts, his submission to the good of elBulli.</p>
<p class="indent">But the two new jobs that Luke is assigned fall short. The first is to prepare the Parmesan “pasta” that forms the shell for the ravioli dish. To make it, he pours hot Parmesan serum—made by melting cheese and separating out the solids and fats—in a thin sheet across a plastic tray, lets it harden, and then cuts out a thin, translucent circle with a ring. Thanks to the addition of agar-agar, the disks have the consistency of gelatin and are extremely fragile, so transferring them from tray to the drying rack on which they will be lightly dehydrated requires a bit of finesse. Luke slides his offset spatula under each one and then, as he goes to retract it, adds the little flourish, the barely perceptible twist of the wrist, that makes his work look simultaneously more mechanical and more balletic. Three hundred times he does this, over and over, until all the Parmesan disks are removed. The second task is simpler. He sets up the equipment for the lentils: bowls filled with ice water and topped with a strainer, syringes at the ready. Luke attacks both assignments with characteristic gusto, but it takes him only a day or two to recognize that they are no more challenging than his old ones, and impart no greater responsibility. One day he catches Marc at family meal and asks about next year. “We haven’t made any decisions yet,” Marc responds. His tone is gentle, but Luke gets the definite sensation he is being blown off.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m disappointed,” he says. “So much time, working so hard.” Luke is too disciplined to let his work be affected by his own setbacks, but it does make him wonder, for the first time, about his priorities. Ever since that cooking competition back in Seoul, he has been on a clear path of his own making, and he has been relentless in its pursuit. From the army to the slaughterhouse to the nights sleeping on the bare Turkish ground to the long hours in the elBulli kitchen, he has followed the plan he first devised in the general’s kitchen years ago. And just as he never stopped asking, in restaurant after restaurant, what is the most important thing for a chef, so too has he never stopped repeating to himself to always <a id="page_129"/>work harder, to always be faster. But now, though he is a little afraid to admit it, he realizes he may have been wrong. All that discipline may not necessarily get him what he wants—a better job, recognition, acceptance, embrace as part of Ferran’s team. He may never gain access to elBulli’s inner circle. In Luke, the first seeds of rebellion stir. Every now and then, as he squeezes out lentils or scoops up Parmesan disks, he pauses and stares pensively into space.</p>
