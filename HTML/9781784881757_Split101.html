<h1 class="chapter">ravioli filled with tomato &amp; bread stuffing in a warm mozzarella cream</h1>
<div class="covser1"><a id="page_172"/><img alt="images" src="images/p172.jpg"/></div>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is one of Daniele Sera’s signature dishes that he makes at the stunning hotel Castello di Casole in central Tuscany. He has taken a typical Tuscan recipe for a tomato, basil and bread soup called <i><a href="9781784881757_Split83.html#page_141">pappa al pomodoro</a></i> and made it into a filling for fresh pasta. These tangy, tomatoey parcels are served in a warm bath of melted mozzarella and cream: dairy heaven in a sauce. (You can enjoy it as it is or make it thicker with cornflour/cornstarch blended with a little of the sauce.) The result is sublime.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 AS A STARTER (MAKES 24 RAVIOLI MEASURING APPROX. 6 CM/2½ IN WIDE)</span></h4>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE FILLING</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) stale country-style bread</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 ml (5 fl oz/⅔ cup) <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">Homemade Tomato Sauce</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>10 g (½ oz) basil leaves, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE RAVIOLI</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 quantity of <a href="9781784881757_Split97.html#page_167">Fresh Pasta</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>coarse semolina or ‘00’ flour, for dusting</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE MOZZARELLA CREAM</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 × 125 g (4 oz) ball of mozzarella, roughly chopped, plus the water/brine from the bag</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) double (heavy) cream</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125 g (4 oz) unsalted butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt, to taste</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) salted or unsalted butter, cubed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3">To make the filling, soak the bread in a small bowl of cold water until soaked through. Remove the bread from the bowl and squeeze out the water. Put the tomato sauce in a saucepan over a medium heat and add the bread to it – it will melt into the pan. Add the basil and stir through. Leave to cook over a low heat for 15 minutes or until the bread has broken down and thickened the sauce. Remove from the heat, transfer to a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="tx">To make the ravioli, take half the fresh pasta. Flour the work surface but don’t flour the top side of the pasta or it will be hard to seal. Roll out the pasta using a rolling pin or a pasta machine until you can see your hand through it. If using a pasta machine set it on the second to last setting – the very last setting makes the thinnest pasta but this is too fragile for ravioli – and roll out 2 equally sized sheets of pasta.</p>
<p class="tx">Dot heaped teaspoons of the filling at even intervals (two fingers’ width apart is ideal) onto one of the sheets and place another sheet of the same length over the top. Press down around the filling to expel the air and seal the pasta sheets together. Using a pasta wheel or a sharp knife, cut the ravioli into even 5 cm (2 in) squares. Set the shapes aside on a surface dusted with flour or semolina (semolina is good as it doesn’t stick to the pasta). Repeat with the remaining pasta until the filling is used up.</p>
<p class="tx">For the mozzarella cream, put the mozzarella, the brine from the bag, the cream and butter into a saucepan and set over a high heat to melt. When the cheese has melted pass it through a sieve to remove any remaining small lumps of cheese. Taste and add salt as necessary.</p>
<p class="tx">To serve, warm the mozzarella cream sauce over a gentle heat. Drop the pasta into well-salted boiling water and cook for just 2–3 minutes. Drain and put into a warm dish with the butter and toss the bowl to combine – this will stop the pasta sticking. Put a ladleful of mozzarella cream into each bowl and place the pasta on top. Drizzle some olive oil on top of each dish, sprinkle over a little grated Parmesan, season with black pepper and serve straight away.</p>
