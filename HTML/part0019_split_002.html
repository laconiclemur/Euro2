<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">You can add crab to this recipe for instant glamor. You can buy cooked crabmeat and warm it up by setting it on top of the clams and mussels while they cook. One thing I always do at the seafood counter (and the reason they eye me with suspicion at Whole Foods) is ask to smell the shellfish. It should smell like the ocean, nothing more. Sure I seem odd, but rather that than bring home nasty-smelling crab.</em></p><div id="c16s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre53"><b class="calibre4">Ragout de la Mer -- Fish Stew</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre53"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for four to six servings</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">Your choice of 4 filets of monkfish, sole, tilapia, whitefish and/or salmon</p><p class="calibre6">½ lb mussels tightly shut</p><p class="calibre6">½ lb small clams tightly shut</p><p class="calibre6">½ lb peeled raw shrimp</p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp butter</p><p class="calibre6">3 peeled, chopped shallots</p><p class="calibre6">¼ bottle cheap white wine</p><p class="calibre6">1 small glass of cognac (optional)</p><p class="calibre6">1-28 oz can crushed tomatoes or 6 diced fresh ripe tomatoes</p><p class="calibre6">1 peeled clove of garlic, crushed or minced</p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp flour</p><p class="calibre6">½ pint heavy cream, or 3 tbsp crème fraîche</p><p class="calibre6">Salt and pepper</p><p class="calibre6">¼ tsp rosemary (dry or fresh)</p><p class="calibre6">½ tsp thyme (dry or fresh)</p><p class="calibre6">Red pepper flakes (to give it a kick)</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre53"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- Melt the butter in a large skillet (one with a lid). Before it gets too hot add the shallots. Stir over very low heat as you do not want the shallots to burn (they turn bitter). When the shallots are a bit translucent, add the flour and stir. Before the flour changes color, add the cognac and/or wine. Stir and bring to a gentle boil. Add one and a half cups of water.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Add the peeled shrimp and tightly shut mussels and clams to the pot and close the lid. Steam for 7 minutes. The mussels and clams will release their liquid into the sauce and build its flavor, which is why you want to steam there rather than in a separate pot. Remove shrimp, mussels and clams from the pot. Any that did not open must be discarded. Keep warm in a dish by covering with aluminum foil.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Add tomatoes, pepper flakes, and crushed clove of garlic to the juices inside the pot. Gently boil sauce for ten minutes. Add thyme and rosemary</p><p class="calibre6">4- Place all your pieces of fish delicately on top of the sauce, cover and simmer until the fish is cooked (check by inserting a the blade of a knife and making sure the center isn’t gooey or translucent).</p><p class="calibre6">5- Delicately remove the fish and place it on the dish that contains the mussels and shrimp. Keep warm for a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Add the heavy cream to the sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir and reduce for 2 minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Pour the sauce in a wide low serving dish. Place the fish on top of the sauce and arrange the shrimp, mussels and clams around it. Add cooked crab meat, or crab legs on top if you choose.</p><p class="calibre6">8- Serve piping hot with steamed, peeled potatoes, rice or pasta.</p></div></div></body></html>
