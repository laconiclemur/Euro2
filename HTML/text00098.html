<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0000081">There’s nothing like a meal together for saying thank you, I’ve missed you, or I just want to see your face. Between working and looking after the children and the house, I don’t often get lots of time to cook or entertain. Luckily my work involves a lot of recipe testing and recipe tasting, so nobody at home ever really misses out on eating by the truckload. We eat all day, every day! But cooking with purpose has a very different feel to it. Especially if it’s cooking with purpose and people in mind. I have the ability to turn a meeting at home into a three-course dinner party. These are some of my favourite recipes to feed a crowd of family or friends, or both. My crowds often involve more children than adults, so these recipes please everyone around the table.</p>
