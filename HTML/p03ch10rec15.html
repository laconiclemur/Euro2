<p class="summary1">Churrasquerías, <span class="italic">steak houses where meats are cooked over smoldering wood fires, have become immensely popular in northern Spain. In Tolosa, in the Basque Country, where they first started grilling ox steaks more than forty years ago (see page 394), they have</span> chuletón <span class="italic">fiestas. (Now they use well-hung meat from indigenous cows that have been specially fattened.) In the more distant past,</span> maestro asadores <span class="italic">(master roasters) would be hired to roast meats at village feasts. Today many chefs and owners of</span> churrasquerías <span class="italic">are Argentinian emigrants. At home, men expect to be in charge of the barbecue when they are cooking for family and friends. Buy large, thick T-bone steaks, which includes both fillet and sirloin, and serve with</span> alioli <span class="italic">(page 141).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 TO 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 large T-bone steaks, 2 to 2½ inches thick</p>
<p class="qun">Olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="recsum">Start the fire, and wait until it is reduced to glowing coals. Take the steaks out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature.</p>
<p class="summary">Trim the excess fat and any sinew from the steaks, and brush them lightly with olive oil. Oil the grill well. Put the steaks on the grill, and sear for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Move the steaks to a cooler part of the fire, or raise the grill rack, and continue to cook, turning the steaks a few times until they are done to your taste: allow 10 to 15 minutes for rare, a little longer for medium. You can judge by feel. If the meat feels soft when pressed, it is rare; if it feels springy, it is medium. If it feels firm, it is overdone. Transfer the steaks to a carving board, season with salt and pepper, cover with foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">To serve, cut the meat off the bones and cut it across the grain into thick slices. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">You can cook the steaks on a heavy cast-iron griddle or in a heavy skillet. Heat it until it is very hot, and lightly oil the pan before you put the meat in. Press the meat down with a spatula to sear it, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, turning the steaks over a few times.</p>
