<p class="summary1">I have tried a few recipes for pig’s ears and feet: the ears, orejas, gelatinous and crunchy, cut into little squares and stewed in white wine with a touch of cinnamon; the feet, manos (they call them “hands”), gelatinous and rich in flavor, cooked in fortified wine and a tiny bit of chocolate, were delicious. But I will not make them again. They are difficult to buy, especially ears; most butchers don’t sell them. And they take too long to prepare before you even begin to cook them. You have to singe off any remaining hairs, then scrub them, blanch them, and rinse them in cold water. Then you boil them for 3 hours. I cut up the ears and removed the bones from the feet. They are much-loved delicacies in Spain, but these days people eat them at restaurants and rarely cook them at home.</p>
