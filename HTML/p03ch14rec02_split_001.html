</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="bi">A wine-making revolution has turned the country with the greatest</span> amount of land under grapevines in the world, which was once known for producing cheap, undistinguished, anonymous wines to be sold in bulk, into the most promising and exciting country for high-quality wines. This surprised the world, and it surprised Spain.</p>
<p class="summary">Fifteen years ago, only sherry and Rioja wines were appreciated abroad, and most Spaniards did not really know about wine. They knew Rioja, were used to drinking their own rough, acidic local wines, and used sherry for cooking. Small farmers made their own wine, usually in a primitive way. They dried grapes on their terraces or in their attics to make sweet wine, and they distilled grape skins and seeds to make <span class="italic">aguardiente</span> (eau-de-vie) or brandy. Large vineyards were owned by members of the aristocracy and by monasteries. In Franco’s time, big <span class="italic">bodegas</span> (wineries), some of them cooperatives run by the Church, bought grapes from peasant growers, whom they exploited, and produced oceans of cheap bulk wine for export.</p>
<p class="summary">Today, every region except Asturias makes wine with a distinctive character, and many of these wines are astonishing. There is wine tourism, with wine routes that include visits to wineries and vineyards. Restaurants pride themselves on their wine lists. At a cooking school I visited in Galicia, the Centro Superior de Hostelería de Galicia, they place great importance on training sommeliers.</p>
<p class="summary">I heard about what was happening in the wine trade mainly from three people who write about wine and food: Ana Lorente, Gaspar Rey (see page 309), and Pepe Iglesias (see page 328). Lorente, editor of the magazine <span class="italic">Opus Wine,</span> explained the phenomenon that has swept the country over the last fifteen years as she drove my friend Alicia and me through the spare landscape from Madrid to Segovia. When Spaniards became wealthy and discriminating in their tastes, and domestic and foreign demand for high-quality wines increased, it became worthwhile for wineries to invest in and make the effort to achieve higher standards. The <span class="italic">Denominación de Origen</span> (DO) classification that aims to guarantee quality was a spur that rewarded their achievements, and the European Union helped with subsidies.</p>
<p class="summary">There is enormous enthusiasm and competitive vitality in the trade today. The old <span class="italic">bodegas</span> and some new ones adopted state-of-the-art technology and sophisticated practices with the help of oenologists who had learned from French and New World winemakers. At first, they started growing fashionable foreign grape varieties, such as Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Chardonnay, and tried to emulate French styles. Then they went back to their native grapes, Tempranillo, Verdejo, Graciano, Monastrell, Garnacha, Prieto Picudo, and many others, and focused on improving viticulture, from making the most of their <span class="italic">terruño</span> (land) and irrigating it, to training and pruning the vines and deciding when to harvest. Grapevines carpet many different terrains with different soils and climatic conditions, on mountains and in river valleys, on vast dry plains and on volcanic islands. It is not surprising, then, that Spain has one of the widest range of distinctive wines in the world. Most winemakers blend varieties, and some include foreign grapes to achieve their characteristic color, flavor, and aroma; alcohol content; and aging properties. There are now seventy wines with a <span class="italic">Denominación de Origen</span> and fifty-five <span class="italic">Vinos de la Tierra</span> with regional names. The <span class="italic">Vino de la Tierra</span> system was started as a rebellion against the stricter system of classification, and to get around it. But such wines can be of excellent quality.</p>
<p class="summary">There are stars and heroes in the trade, pioneers who started the revolution twenty-five years ago and entrepreneurs who continue to create wines and to improve their wines. Previously little-known areas have produced superstar wines. A few wineries are rated by American wine writers as extraordinary. The map of Spanish wine can change so fast that wine writers find it hard to keep up with the ever-growing number of emerging wines. There is a lot to choose from, among both cheaper everyday wines and the more expensive Reservas and Gran Reservas. I mention some in the chapters on the regions (pages 67 to 118). Try what you find in your stores.</p>
