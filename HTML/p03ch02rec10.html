<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">The great Catalan writer Josep Pla complained that the rural world had an ancestral obsession with putting tomatoes into everything, and that they invaded every food and made Spanish cooking monotonous. Tomato sauce is certainly ubiquitous, and there are many versions. A commercial version called</span> tomate frito <span class="italic">is a pureed tomato sauce with a flavor of fried onions and garlic. (Pla also called garlic the “Genghis Khan of the kitchen.”) This is a basic tomato sauce without garlic. According to old Spanish tradition, it should be made with enough oil to cover the bottom of the skillet by almost half an inch, but I have seen it made with much less oil, and that is how I prefer it.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large sweet onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 teaspoons sugar, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onion in the oil in a large skillet over low heat, stirring often, until it is soft and beginning to color. Add the tomatoes and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced and jammy, stirring occasionally so that it doesn’t stick and burn. Add the sugar and salt to taste toward the end, as their flavor will get concentrated when the sauce is reduced.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Traditionally the sauce was passed through a food mill; now you can use an immersion blender if you want to blend it right in the pan.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Add 2 to 3 finely chopped garlic cloves to the onion.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• The Riojan <span class="italic">fritada</span> version of this tomato sauce made with green peppers is now popular throughout Spain. It accompanies meat, fish, and vegetables, which are sometimes cooked in the sauce. Add 1 cored, seeded, and diced green pepper to the onion when it is slightly soft.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• For the Catalan <span class="italic">salsa de tomàquet,</span> omit the onion. Cook the tomatoes in a little oil until they are reduced to a thick sauce, then add salt and, if necessary, a little sugar. Some versions add a little chopped garlic at the start.</p>
