<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">S</span><small>UNDAY DINNER IN</small> Italian families is all about macaroni—the word we use for almost any kind of pasta. Over the course of my career, I’ve found that I really enjoy making fresh pasta and experimenting with different flavor profiles in my pasta dough. In my Italian-inspired restaurant, Graffiato, I always have four or five different pastas on the menu that incorporate what’s fresh and available during the season. This chapter showcases lots of fun flavors of pasta you can make at home, and the accompanying sauces and extras that go with it.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that I don’t include salt in any of the recipes for my pasta doughs. I think it’s more important to salt the pasta water correctly—one tablespoon kosher salt per every quart of water. Your pasta water should taste like the ocean—that’s how you get the best flavor out of your pasta.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have a stand mixer, you’ll need the pasta rollers and cutter attachments to make some of these pastas. Or, you can buy a standalone pasta machine, if you wish. If not, you can always use well-made artisanal fresh pasta from your farmers’ market or grocery store in many of these recipes.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re willing to learn, making fresh pasta is really pretty easy and takes almost no time at all. You probably already have all the ingredients you need: flour, eggs, water, and oil. In terms of tools, you need your hands or a food processor. From there, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>You’ll need squid ink for this pasta, which you can find at a local Asian supermarket or from a fishmonger. In Italy, this dish is called spaghetti al nero de seppia. I just call it good. The squid ink pasta has an inherent seafood taste to it, and the heat of the chili flakes brings it all together with the clams. The parsley and basil make it fresh and bright.</i></p>

Using a pasta extruder fitted with the spaghetti attachment, place the pieces one at a time into the powered extruder. Spaghetti will begin to form and cut at around 8 inches long. Toss with a little flour to prevent sticking and clumping, and place spaghetti on a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate. (If you do not have a pasta extruder you can use a pasta machine to create pasta sheets, then cut them with a spaghetti cutter.)</p>

Discard any clams that didn’t open.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> In a large sauté pan over high heat, sauté the pancetta in olive oil for 3 minutes or until just crispy. Add shallot, garlic, and chili flakes and sauté for 3 minutes.</p>

<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>6.</b></span> Reserve ¼ cup of the cooking water before draining the spaghetti. Drain the spaghetti.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>7.</b></span> Add the reserved pasta water and spaghetti to the sauté pan. Add the clams, reduced clam broth, and butter. Toss to coat the spaghetti, and when the butter is melted, toss in the lemon juice, parsley, and basil.</p>

<p class="serve1"><span class="color">YOU CAN MAKE THE AGNOLOTTI AHEAD OF TIME AND FREEZE FOR 3 DAYS.</span></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="" src="images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>1.</b></span> Using a sharp chef’s knife, slice the corn kernels off the cobs and use the back of your knife to extract extra corn juice. You should have 4 cups of kernels with juice.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>2.</b></span> In a food processor, blend the corn kernels and juice for 1½ minutes for a smooth purée.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> Place a fine-mesh strainer over a mixing bowl and pour the corn purée through the strainer, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to push through as much liquid as possible. This should yield 1½ cups corn juice. Discard the solids in the strainer.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> In a small saucepan, bring the corn juice to a simmer over medium-high heat, whisking as the juice begins to simmer. Lower the heat to medium and continue to whisk for 2 minutes longer to allow the corn juice to thicken. Remove from heat and whisk in the mascarpone and ¼ teaspoon salt to create a pudding-like texture. If it’s too thin, whisk in a paste of 1 tablespoon water plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch while liquid is simmering.</p>
<p class="step"><a id="page_170"/><span class="color"><b>5.</b></span> Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 2 days. When chilled, put the corn filling into a pastry bag or Ziploc bag with ½ inch snipped off the corner just before piping.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>6.</b></span> Divide the pasta dough into two equal pieces. Flatten with the heel of your hand, then roll the first piece of pasta dough through a pasta machine on the widest setting twice. Fold it lengthwise, and roll it through one more time.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>7.</b></span> Adjust rollers to next setting and roll pasta sheet through one time. Adjust rollers to next setting and put pasta sheet through again. Continue this until you have reached the fifth-widest setting of your pasta rollers. You may need to cut the pasta sheet in half depending on the size of your work surface. Lay the rolled pasta sheet on a flat, lightly floured surface.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>8.</b></span> Repeat with second piece of pasta dough.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>9.</b></span> Dust a baking sheet (that will fit into your refrigerator) with semolina flour. Set aside.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>10.</b></span> With the pasta on a lightly floured flat surface, pipe the corn filling in a straight line on the pasta sheet, about ½ inch up from the bottom edge. Fold the bottom up and press it into the top of the pasta sheet, leaving ½ inch of space for the filling to move into. Press all the way down the long line of the pasta to seal it closed into a sort of tube.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>11.</b></span> Starting at one end, use your thumb and forefinger to pinch this long tube of pasta in 1-inch increments to create little “pillows.” Doing this will compress the filling more tightly and create a pinched, sealed space (about ¾ inch) between each pillow for you to separate them into individual agnolotti in the next step.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>12.</b></span> Run a serrated pasta cutter or crimped pastry wheel along the top edge of the folded-over dough to trim off the excess. Don’t cut it too close to the filling, or you’ll risk it leaking out or breaking apart in the boiling water.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>13.</b></span> Then, rolling it away from you, use the pasta cutter or pastry wheel to cut through the center of the pinched area between each pillow, creating the agnolotti. You can press down again around each edge to make sure they are sealed. Place individual agnolotti on the semolina-dusted tray in a single layer. You should have 45–50 pieces. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>14.</b></span> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. A good rule of thumb is to use 1 tablespoon of kosher salt per quart of water in your pot.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>15.</b></span> Meanwhile, in a dry sauté pan, toast the pine nuts over medium heat for 5 minutes, shaking the pan often to prevent burning.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>16.</b></span> Heat the canola oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the chanterelles for 5–7 minutes, or until soft and tender, and season with remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Keep warm.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>17.</b></span> When the pot of water is at a full boil, drop in half the agnolotti and cook for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, stir butter into the warm chanterelles.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>18.</b></span> Remove the cooked agnolotti with a slotted spoon or wok skimmer and gently toss with the chanterelles, as the butter continues to melt.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>19.</b></span> Cook the remaining agnolotti and add them to the sauté pan. Then add 2 tablespoons of the Parmigiano-Reggiano and gently toss to coat.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>20.</b></span> Transfer the agnolotti to a large serving dish or individual serving bowls. Garnish with toasted pine nuts, chives, and remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
