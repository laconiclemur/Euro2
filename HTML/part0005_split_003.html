			<p class="rec-intro">The sauce for this delicious chicken dish tastes beautifully creamy but is actually thickened with walnuts. It’s best made with fresh ‘wet’ walnuts, which are available for just a few weeks in autumn. These are walnuts that have just been picked so the insides are still damp and juicy, with a wonderful mild flavour.</p>

			<p class="body">Pour 3 litres of water into a large pan and add the roughly chopped vegetables, garlic, thyme, bay leaf and a good pinch of salt. Simmer for 20 minutes, then leave to cool until tepid.</p>
			<p class="body">Add the chicken to the pan and bring everything to a very gentle simmer. Cook for 1½ hours, keeping the water at a slow gentle simmer – it mustn’t boil – and topping up with extra water if necessary. Once the chicken is cooked, take it out, remove the skin and cut the flesh into large bite-sized pieces. Cover them with a damp cloth and keep warm. </p>
			<p class="body">Add the chicken bones to the cooking stock, bring it to the boil and simmer for a further 20 minutes, skimming off any fat and scum. Pass this through a fine sieve. Shell the fresh walnuts.</p>
			<p class="body">Pour 300ml of the sieved stock into a blender, add the shelled fresh walnuts and blitz to a smooth creamy sauce. Season with salt, pepper and a hint of grated nutmeg. Pour the sauce over the chicken pieces and serve warm, garnished with toasted walnut halves, deep-fried parsley and a drizzle of walnut oil. </p>
			<p class="alt-head">garnish</p>
			<p class="body">To deep-fry the parsley, pick the leaves from the stems, wash and dry well. Heat some vegetable oil in a pan, add the leaves and fry for a few seconds, then drain on kitchen paper. Put the walnut halves in a pan with a drop of vegetable oil and toast them in a frying pan on the hob. </p>
