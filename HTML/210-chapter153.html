<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The name of this rustic dessert, the eminent Catalan gastro-historian Néstor Luján argues, derives from what was given to itinerant musicians playing at village festivals during the autumn harvests. Curiously, <em>postres</em> is always plural here—“desserts” in Catalan—not singular, even when referring to a single dish. Perhaps the musicians had to make do with the nuts for more than one meal? While the classic combination includes almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, raisins, and prunes, other dried fruits are added to the blend, often depending on what can be found in the pantry.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">      Today there is no Catalan dessert more emblematic of the countryside than a platter of nuts and dried fruits and some Muscatel or another sweet wine. The wine comes to the table in a <em>porró</em>, a thin-spouted glass beaker. (In Spanish, it’s called a <em>porrón</em>.) Held at arm’s length, the porró is tilted downward and a stream of wine is shot straight into the mouth. The wine surely aided digestion, but I can’t help but see it as part of the musicians’ pay, too. Apart from not needing to dirty glasses, the porró, Luján added, served another purpose. It limited the amount of wine that could be gulped to an “honest” amount, surely no small consideration with those wily minstrels.</span></strong></p>
