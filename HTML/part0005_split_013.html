			<p class="rec-intro">This is a Roux Christmas favourite and never fails to please. Jars of duck confit with hearts and gizzards are now fairly easy to find, but if you’re squeamish you can leave out the offal and add extra duck legs instead. You can make this in individual moulds or in one large tin.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6 as a main course</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 large loaf of good-quality bread</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">duck fat from the confit </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 shallots, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml port</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">750ml veal stock </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300g mixed wild mushrooms, wiped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp chopped flatleaf parsley</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 confit duck legs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 confit gizzards</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 confit hearts (optional)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Cut the bread into medium slices and remove the crusts, then cut the slices in half again. Moisten the bread with some of the duck fat from the drained confit – melt the fat and brush it on, or dip the bread into it. Line the moulds with bread, making sure that the slices overlap so there are no gaps and that they are well pressed into the moulds.</p>
			<p class="body">Sweat the shallots in a pan with a little duck fat and cook until soft. Add the port and reduce by half, then add the stock and reduce again until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Leave the sauce to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">Trim the mushrooms and sear them in a frying pan with a knob of duck fat. Add the chopped garlic and parsley, cook for a few minutes longer, then tip the contents of the pan into a bowl and set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">Remove the skin from the duck legs and flake the meat. Slice the gizzards and hearts. Add all the meat to the mushrooms with just enough of the sticky port sauce to bind. Season with a generous amount of pepper. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6.</p>
			<p class="body">Divide the mixture between the bread-lined moulds and cover the tops with foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Leave to rest for 10 minutes before turning the charlottes out of the moulds, then serve with the remaining port sauce, warmed through, and some extra wild mushrooms if you like – cook these in a little duck fat. </p>
			<p class="body">If you prefer to make one large charlotte, use a round cake tin, measuring about 2ocm in diameter by 10cm deep, with a removable base. Cook the charlotte for 35–40 minutes and leave to rest as above.</p>
