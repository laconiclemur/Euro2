ome provincial markets still manage to draw smallholders and farmers in from the surrounding area with a couple of boxes of their own produce to sell. Home-laid eggs and misshapen artisan cheeses are always a reassuring sight – they are the signs of a truly local affair. The weekly market at Cangas de Ónis, high in the Picos de Europa mountains pulls in a huge crowd of local producers. Trestle tables are covered with tomatoes, potatoes, beans and cut flowers, as well as the fresh cheeses and baskets of eggs.</p>
<p class="indent">A genuine free-range egg can transform a dish such as the simple tortilla that tops the tapas menu in virtually every bar. I would never have believed how sublime that simple combination of eggs, potatoes and oil could be until I tasted a warm, juicy omelette in a Galician farmhouse. No tricks, no sorcery, just freshly laid eggs straight from the henhouse, it really was exceptional. The largest markets have entire stalls devoted to selling vast ranges of eggs. Ous de Calaf, in Barcelona’s Boquería, stocks goose, duck and ostrich eggs, the latter hollowed for decorative purposes, as well as the more customary quail and hen’s eggs. And, shell-less unborn eggs from boiling fowl can be purchased at the poultry stand should you decide to throw a few in to your <em>Cocido</em>
, stew (see page 88) as more traditional cooks like to do.</p>
<p class="indent">Eggs are combined with milk in the nation’s favourite desserts – <em>Flan</em>
, <em>Crema Catalana</em>
, <em>Natillas</em>
 and <em>Leche Frita</em>
 (see pages 118–20). These popular custard-based desserts were confined to the North until relatively recently. The scarcity of milk in the South meant that egg yolks were combined with orange juice, in Valencia’s own version of the <em>Flan</em>
 or, in the case of Andalucia’s cholesterol hit, <em>tocino del cielo</em>
, with vast quantities of sugar and water.</p>
<p class="indent">Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria have long been regarded the dairy of Spain. In Santiago de Compostela, pats of butter are still sold wrapped in fresh cabbage leaves, keeping with time-honoured tradition. Local cakes and pastries are made with butter rather than the customary pig fat or olive oil used elsewhere in Spain. But, it is at the cheese counter that regional differences and localized producers really shine.</p>
<p class="indent">Broadly speaking cow’s milk cheese is restricted to the north coast while those made from sheep’s and goat’s milk are available across the rest of the country. Great cheeses such as Manchego transcend regional boundaries and are available virtually anywhere in the country, or the world for that matter. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of cheeses produced in such tiny quantities that they never make it out of their own immediate area. There are 40 registered cheeses in the region of Asturias alone, and most are unknown to anyone but a local. These cheeses give regional markets their own very special magic.</p>
<p class="indent">A local producer had brought some of his pungent Gamonedo cheese to the market in Cangas de Ónis. Similar to the internationally renowned Cabrales it is made with a blend of cow’s, sheep’s and goat’s milk, in proportions that vary with the seasons. I shall never forget that lightly smoked, pungent cheese. Even when you tuck into a familiar cheese it seems to taste better in situ. Cow’s milk cheese is the pride of Galicia and the young, creamy Tetilla I scoffed with a hunk of rye bread at Ribávia was exceptional. It was hands above the Tetilla I buy from my deli back at home, but perhaps the romantic picnic spot in the misty vineyards had played its part too. And, as for the sheep and goat’s cheeses at the June market in Cáceres, I have never seen such a spectacular selection: torture indeed for a heavily pregnant cheese lover.</p>

mayonesa</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">mayonnaise</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The people of Menorca will proudly insist that the name <em>mayonesa</em>
 is a derivation of <em>mahonesa</em>
, a reference to their island capital of Mahón. What they will fail to add is that it was reputedly a displaced French chef in Mahón who, at a loss with what to serve his Duke, came up with the recipe. Whatever its origins it is a classic. Just remember to keep the mayonnaise refrigerated until you are about to serve your food, especially on a hot summer’s day.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes about 300 ml/½ pint</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 egg yolks, at room temperature (see note)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground white or black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>lemon juice or white wine vinegar to taste</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 ml/8 fl oz olive oil – half extra virgin and half ordinary olive oil or sunflower oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the egg yolks, a pinch of salt and a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar together in a bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Now add the olive oil to the yolks literally a few drips at a time to begin with and then, when at least a quarter of the oil has been absorbed, add the rest of the oil in a steady stream, whisking all the time. The mayonnaise should become thick and wobbly once you have incorporated all the oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Splash in a little vinegar or citrus juice, salt and a pinch of white or black pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Eggs and emulsions</strong>
 If you are using eggs straight from the refrigerator, beware, they have a tendency to curdle and so you will need to add the first few drops of oil very slowly. Do not despair if your sauce splits. Start with a fresh egg yolk in a new bowl and add the curdled mixture slowly as if you were making the mayonnaise from scratch.</p>
<p class="pagebreak"></p>
<div data-amznpagebreak="always"></div>
<h1 class="section0" id="heading_id_4">allioli</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Catalan purists will be surprised to find this recipe in the egg section. A true <em>allioli</em>
 is quite literally <em>all</em>
, or garlic and <em>oli</em>
, or oil, with a seasoning of lemon juice or vinegar and salt. I have even witnessed a luckless Frenchman be disqualified from an <em>allioli</em>
 contest for including an egg yolk. Yet most restaurants and busy cooks opt for this version, which is in truth just a very garlicky mayonnaise. It is easier to make and less likely to give you hairs on your chest.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes about 300 ml/½ pint</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2–4 garlic cloves, crushed in a press or with a little salt in a mortar with a pestle</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground white or black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 egg yolks, room temperature (see note above)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 ml/8 fl oz olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a splash of wine vinegar, lemon juice or Seville orange juice to taste</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the garlic, ½ tsp salt and egg yolks together thoroughly in a bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Slowly add the olive oil to the yolks and garlic, literally a few drips at a time to begin with, and then in a steady stream, whisking all the time. The allioli should reach a shuddering jelly-like texture once you have incorporated all the oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Splash in a little vinegar or citrus juice, salt and a pinch of white or black pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 If you are really short of time or you are making large quantities of <em>allioli</em>
 for a party, then you may prefer to make this simpler version in the blender. Just use the recipe above substituting a whole egg for one of the yolks. With the motor running, steadily add the oil to the eggs and garlic. Season with vinegar, salt and pepper to taste.</p>

tortilla española</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_6">spanish omelette</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This is the quintessential Spanish dish, where everyday ingredients come together to create something truly special. Leave those rubber, vacuum-packed Frisbees to languish in the chiller cabinet, there is nothing to compare with a soft-centred home made <em>tortilla</em>
.</p>
<p class="indent">Do not be tempted to reduce the amount of oil in the recipe – it is the key to an authentic Spanish omelette. Weight watchers need not apply!</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4, or 8 as <em>tapas</em>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>300 ml/10 fl oz light olive oil, plus 2 tbsp extra olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>700 g/1½ lb waxy potatoes, peeled, cut into chips and sliced into thin squares</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 medium onion, diced (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 medium eggs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the 300 ml/10 fl oz olive oil in a deep frying pan, add the potato and onion, if using, and cook the potatoes gently over a medium heat. The idea is to soften them without any colouring or burning.</p>
<p class="extract">After about 15 minutes, once the potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander and reserve the oil for your next <em>tortilla</em>
.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the eggs in a large bowl and, using a fork, beat thoroughly before stirring in the potatoes and onion, if using, and seasoning with salt.</p>
<p class="extract">Next heat 1 tbsp olive oil in your <em>tortilla</em>
 pan (see right) and as soon as it is hot add the omelette mixture. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes until the bottom begins to set. Use a wooden spatula to loosen the edges of the <em>tortilla</em>
 and give the pan a shake.</p>
<p class="extract">Now for the adrenaline rush, it is time to flip your omelette. A large plate will do the job but a flat saucepan lid will make it easier giving you a handle to grip onto. Some enthusiasts own a specialist ‘flipper’ (see right). Invert the omelette onto the flat surface, add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and slip the tortilla back in. Continue cooking until the tortilla feels almost set – a little squashy rather than bouncy to the touch. Perfectionists will flip the omelette a couple more times during the cooking to achieve the characteristic rounded sides, but that is up to you.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 <em>Tortilla</em>
 is wonderful served while warm with a soft, oozing centre, but if you plan to leave it standing at room temperature for any length of time, it is safer to cook the eggs more thoroughly until just firm.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>The key to a good <strong>
<em>tortilla</em>
</strong>
: the right pan</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">A vital factor when making <em>tortillas</em>
 is to own the right pan, an average frying pan will result in a thin leathery omelette or, worse still, a mess welded to the base. The egg mixture should only just fit in the pan to create an authentically thick and juicy omelette.</p>
<p class="indent2">I have a 20 cm/8 inch diameter, non-stick frying pan reserved for the purpose – it is worth investing in one if you plan to make the potato or any other thick Spanish omelette on a regular basis. And don’t let those egg-frying Philistines wielding their metal spatulas anywhere near it.</p>
<p class="indent2">If you fancy becoming a pro’ you can pick up a very economical plastic disc with a handle, specifically designed for turning omelettes, from any good Spanish kitchen shop.</p>
<p class="pagebreak"></p>

tortilla de espinacas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_8">spinach tortilla</h1>
<p class="nonindent">An exceptionally juicy omelette packed with healthy spinach. The mixture may seem very wet when you begin to cook it but will firm up enough to be sliced and even eaten with your fingers, if you like. The secret is to drain your spinach well, squashing out the moisture in a sieve with a wooden spoon.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4, or 8 as <em>tapas</em>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz spinach, washed and any tough stalks removed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 medium eggs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp salt and a good grind of black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Place the spinach and water in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and cook over a medium heat for a few minutes until the spinach has just wilted. Drain in a sieve, reserving the spinach juice to drink later – people pay good money for vegetable juice these days.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan, add the spinach and fry for a moment or two.</p>
<p class="extract">In a bowl, beat the eggs with the salt and pepper, then add to the spinach, stirring well to combine. The mixture should only just fit in the pan, guaranteeing a thick and juicy result.</p>
<p class="extract">Now cook the omelette over a medium heat until you can see the sides beginning to firm up. Loosen the edges with a wooden spatula (woe betide anyone who dares touch my precious pan with a metal one) and give the pan a shake.</p>
<p class="extract">Now take a large plate, flat saucepan lid or, better still, the plastic disc with a handle the Spanish have designed specifically for the job (see note on previous page) and invert the omelette. Take care as the base will still be soft and runny.</p>
<p class="extract">Slip the omelette back into the pan and continue to cook for a further 5 minutes until the centre feels springy, rather than soft, to the touch. Turn the <em>tortilla</em>
 onto a serving plate and eat hot or at room temperature.</p>

Custard-based desserts</h1>
</div>
<h1 class="section0" id="heading_id_10">flan</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_11">caramel custard</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Served in bars throughout Spain, these little custard puddings are all too often of the mass-produced variety. Not so in the Boqueria market’s Bar Pinotxo where Albert bakes this ever-popular dessert two dozen at a time in his tiny galley-style kitchen. Cooking a lusciously creamy home-made <em>flan</em>
 is totally straightforward once you have mastered the simple art of making a caramel.</p>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>600 ml/1 pint full fat milk</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 drops of vanilla extract</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/Gas Mark 2.</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by making the caramel, making sure that you have 4 <em>flan</em>
 moulds (see page 17) or ramekins at the ready. Place the sugar and water in a small pan and warm gently over a low heat until the sugar dissolves. Do not be tempted to stir the caramel at any stage; it is best left to its own devices. Now increase the heat and boil rapidly until the sugar turns a light toffee brown. Take care not to overcook as the sugar will continue to bubble and darken once the pan is removed from the heat.</p>
<p class="extract">Moving swiftly, divide the caramel between the 4 moulds, by now it will have reached the perfect, deep brick-brown colour that you are after.</p>
<p class="extract">Now you can make the custard. Using a spoon, mix the eggs, yolks and sugar together in a large bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Bring the milk to the boil in a small pan. Leave to cool for an instant before stirring into the egg mixture. Add the vanilla extract and pour the custard into the moulds.</p>
<p class="extract">Stand the moulds in a roasting tin, and pour in enough hot water to come halfway up their sides. Cook in the oven for about 35–40 minutes until the custard is just set. Leave to cool before refrigerating.</p>
<p class="extract">When you are ready to serve, run a knife around the moulds and carefully turn out the custards with their accompanying caramel syrup.</p>

crema catalana</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">catalan crème brûlée</h1>
<p class="nonindent">It is worth buying some of the individual terracotta dishes traditionally used for <em>Crema Catalana</em>
. Their wide, shallow shape ensures just the right ratio of burnt sugar to custard. You will usually track them down in the <em>ferretería</em>
, ironmongers; don’t ask me why. Snap up at least a dozen as most will be instantly transformed into saucers for flowerpots, hamster food bowls or handy containers for small change and, rather frustratingly, be nowhere to be seen next time you make <em>Crema</em>
.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp cornflour, <strong>
<em>maizena</em>
</strong>
 (cornstarch)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>570 ml/1 pint full fat milk</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 stick cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>pared zest of ½ lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 egg yolks</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp granulated sugar, for caramelizing</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by mixing the cornflour to a paste and a little bit of milk in a small bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, bring the rest of the milk, the cinnamon stick and lemon zest to the boil in a small pan. Once the milk has reached the boil, turn off the heat and leave the flavours to infuse.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, mix the egg yolks, caster sugar and cornflour paste together in a large bowl, then pour over the warm milk, stirring all the time.</p>
<p class="extract">Rinse out the milk pan and pour in the custard. Cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened. I find a square-bottomed wooden spoon very useful for this, allowing me to scrape the bottom of the pan at the same time, giving nothing a chance to stick. Do not let the custard boil – the cornflour will help to stabilize the mixture, but the custard can still become lumpy if it overheats.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the mixture is slightly thicker remove the pan from the heat and keep stirring for a minute or two. Straining the custard will ensure a silky smooth texture as you pour it into ramekins or shallow terracotta dishes used in Catalonia. Place the custards in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="extract">Just before serving, sprinkle the custards with a thin layer of sugar and, using a cook’s blowtorch or a very quick flash under your hottest grill, caramelize until a deep brown colour.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 Lovers of kitchen gadgetry can pick up a caramelizing tool designed specifically for the job. It is a type of branding iron that you place in the gas flame until red-hot and then sear the sugar with. Upmarket electric versions are available for true enthusiasts.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>
<span class="gray">natillas</span>
 custard</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">If the thought of all these caramel desserts is putting your teeth on edge then here is your answer. <em>Natillas</em>
 are a nursery favourite, a simple custard flavoured with cinnamon. Follow the recipe for the <em>Crema Catalana</em>
, omitting the burnt sugar crust at the end. Sprinkle with a pinch of ground cinnamon instead.</p>
<p class="indent2">For a more exotic version you may like to use orange rather than lemon zest and add a touch of orange flower water to the custard once it is made. A carefully judged hint of rosewater and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds would make a custard fit for Moorish sultan.</p>
<p class="indent2">For a more adult dessert hide a layer of dried fruit such as apricots, dates or figs steeped in brandy under the blanket of custard.</p>

leche frita</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_15">fried custard</h1>
<p class="nonindent">A rather unappetizing title for one of Spain’s most exquisite and popular desserts, I must urge you to try it. Best served hot, the crispy sugar and cinnamon crust contrasts magically with the creamy custard centre. The zesty, lightly spiced flavour works particularly well with the caramelized oranges (see page 160), but try using a vanilla pod to infuse the milk instead – it is heaven combined with the strawberries on page 167. Begin this a few hours, or even a day in advance</p>

<p class="extract">While the milk is still warm strain it onto the egg mixture, stirring well. Rinse out the milk pan and pour in the custard. Cook, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens. I have a square-bottomed wooden spoon that is ideal for the purpose, I can scrape the bottom of the pan as I stir preventing it sticking and burning on the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat and cook for a further 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the custard into the prepared tray to a thickness of about at least 3 cm/1¼ inch. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely and become firm.</p>
<p class="extract">After a few hours turn out the custard and cut into 5 cm/2 inch triangles.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat enough oil for frying in a large heavy pan. A depth of oil about 3cm/1¼ inch is ideal.</p>
<p class="extract">Now you can prepare your production line. You will need a plate of flour, a dish with the beaten egg and another plate of the sugar and cinnamon mixed together. Dip the triangles first into the flour, then the beaten egg. Fry the custards until golden brown, then leave to drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="extract">Turn the fried triangles in the sugar and cinnamon until coated and serve at once. Alternatively, place in a warm oven, 100°C/200°F/Gas Mark ¼, until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Using citrus zest</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Try to buy unwaxed or organic fruit whenever possible. Failing this, give the skin of the lemon or orange a good wash under very hot running water to remove some of the wax and pesticides. Make sure that the zest has as little white pith as possible, on it. It is extremely bitter and will taint the flavour of any custard or infusion.</p>

soplillos</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_17">almond meringues</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Almond blossom brings a first glimpse of spring to the mountain villages of the Alpujarras near Granada. Colourful striped blankets hang over doorways warding off the persistent chill and snow still lies thick on the peaks of the Sierra Nevada above. Later in the year the almonds are harvested, finding their way into many a dish, sweet and savoury alike.</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<em>Soplillos</em>
 are a local delicacy dating back to Moorish times. These “puffs” of almond meringue range from the dry, dusty variety that seem to self destruct at the touch of a spoon to those with a deliciously chewy toffee-like centre (dental insurance recommended). This recipe will most likely produce the latter.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes 36 small/24 medium</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>400 g/14 oz whole blanched almonds</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 medium egg whites</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a pinch of salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/Gas Mark 2.</p>
<p class="extract">Cover 2 baking trays with silicone paper.</p>
<p class="extract">Bake the almonds in a roasting tin for about 10 minutes until lightly roasted. Pulse the nuts in a food processor for a few seconds, breaking them down to the size of pine kernels. I have also used flaked almonds, which give a different but equally successful texture. Take care when roasting the nuts, because they can burn in a matter of seconds. One call from the double-glazing salesman and they will be fit for the bin.</p>
<p class="extract">Whisk the egg whites and salt in a large clean bowl until they are stiff and snow-like. Next add half of the sugar, one spoon at a time, whisking between each addition. The meringue should become very stiff and shiny. Whisk in the lemon juice and zest.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the remaining sugar and almonds together in a bowl and carefully fold the mixture into the meringue. Dab a tiny amount of the meringue between the paper and baking tray to secure the paper, then using two spoons, place dollops of the mixture onto the paper, leaving space for expansion. This will make about 36 Ping-Pong ball-sized meringues.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the meringues in the oven for about 25–30 minutes until pale golden and slightly cracked. It is an idea to turn the trays around after 15 minutes as few ovens have absolutely even temperatures throughout.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;I love to serve these meringues with vanilla ice cream and sultanas soaked in dark, sweet Pedro Jiménez sherry.</p>

<strong>Storing egg whites</strong>

<p class="nonindent2">You may not have the time or the inclination to whip up a mountain of meringues next time you are making an egg yolk-based dish, such as <em>Allioli</em>
 (see page 114) or <em>Flan</em>
 (see page 118), but do remember that egg whites can be frozen very successfully, or refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a week. Do not worry about keeping a count for future use; an average egg white measures about 30 ml/1 fl oz/ 2 tbsp.</p>

arroz con leche</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_19">rice pudding</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The generous quantity of milk required for this dish made it a Northern speciality until relatively recently, while the lack of dairy pastures in the South led to a version made with almond milk. Nowadays milk is available everywhere, although much of it of the long-life variety. I would reserve this recipe for fresh, full cream milk – dieting has no place in a dish such as this and skimmed milk will give a watery, thin result.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1.5 litres/2½ pints full cream milk</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 stick cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>pared zest of 1 lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>110 g/4 oz pudding rice</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>30 g/1 oz/2 tbsp unsalted butter</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>55 g/2 oz caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp ground cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Bring the milk, cinnamon stick and lemon zest to the boil in a large saucepan. Watch the milk carefully as it has a terrible habit of erupting out of the pan.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the rice and reduce the heat as low as it will go. The dessert should barely simmer for at least 1 hour and preferably even 2 hours until soft. You will need to stir the rice occasionally to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pan. Leave the pan uncovered allowing the milk to evaporate and giving a lusciously creamy result.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the rice is soft add the butter and sugar. You may decide to add more or less, a good excuse to taste as you go.</p>
<p class="extract">The rice is usually served cold, although there is nothing to stop you serving it warm.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 Try piling a few sherry-plumped raisins and toasted flaked almonds on the top.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tips</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your stove is too hot for long slow simmering then it may be worth purchasing a heat diffuser (see page 17). You could alternatively turn your back on tradition, be thoroughly British and bake the pudding in the oven preheated to 150°C/300°F/ Gas Mark 2 for about 3 hours. The downside is the unpleasant rubbery skin that forms on the top, but don’t despair there will be some bizarre individual at the table who will relish it (there’s one in every family).</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_21">ibicenco cheesecake</h1>
<p class="nonindent">You are more likely to pick up a pair of rope-soled sandals or a beaded headscarf than the weekly fruit and veg’ at most of Ibiza’s markets. A very welcome exception is San Joan’s Saturday market; the place to fill your basket with glorious organic local produce such as oranges, almonds, honey and goat’s cheese.</p>
<p class="indent">The rocky island is perfect goat terrain and the traditional cheesecake, <em>flaó</em>
, is made with a very fresh goat’s cheese giving it a deliciously sharp edge. The signature flavours of mint and aniseed work well with cow’s cheese too, and the addition of a lemon juice will give the extra zing.</p>

<p class="extract">
<strong>Cooking pastry</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Place a heavy baking sheet in your oven when you switch it on. Lay the tart tin directly on top to cook. The baking sheet will conduct heat and help the base of your pastry to cook through.</p>

selección de quesos y frutos secos</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_23">cheese and fruit platter</h1>
<p class="nonindent">There are dozens of exquisite cheeses available in Spain. I have chosen a few of the most celebrated from which I would select my ‘Desert Island’ cheese board. Cheese is often combined with dried fruit, honey or <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
, quince paste (see page 170), a delicious of marriage of the sweet and savoury.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cow’s milk</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<strong>Mahón</strong>
 cheese from Menorca is soft and mild when young but wonderfully sharp and punchy once matured for at least a year (Mahón Reserva). It is ideal for grating on vegetable or pasta dishes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mató</strong>
 is a fresh Catalan cheese akin to ricotta. It is known as Requesón elsewhere in Spain. It is sometimes made with ewe’s milk. This cheese is delicious served with honey and toasted pine kernels as a breakfast or dessert, and it is also used in cheesecakes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tetilla</strong>
 is a breast-shaped cheese from lush green Galicia. It is deliciously soft and creamy when young and often teamed with <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
, quince paste (see page 170).</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Mixed milk – blue cheeses</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<strong>Picos de Europa</strong>
 or <strong>Valdeón</strong>
 is a deliciously creamy, pungent blue cow’s milk cheese from the mountains of Cantabria. It sometimes contains a little goat or sheep’s milk too. Serve walnuts with this cheese.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cabrales</strong>
, the king of the blues, is made from a blend of cow’s, goat’s and sheep’s milk, the proportions varying according to the season. This cheese is often eaten when extremely blue and sharp when it is absolutely delicious accompanied with the local Asturian honey.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Sheep’s milk</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<strong>Idiazábal</strong>
 is a mildly smoked, hard cheese from the highlands of the Basque country and Navarre. It is heavenly combined with <em>dulce de manzana</em>
, firm apple jelly.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Manchego</strong>
 is the celebrity among Iberian cheeses. The dry plains of the Meseta offer a meagre diet of herbs and grasses to the local sheep, resulting in low yields of intensely flavoured milk. The Manchego cheese is firm and caramel-like as a curado (1 year old cheese) becoming increasingly hard and peppery as it ages to an <em>añejo</em>
 (over 2 years old). Delicious with <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
, quince paste (see page 170).</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Torta del Casar</strong>
 is, in my mind, a ‘one man show’. It is best served at about 20°C/68°F. A meltingly soft sheep’s cheese, just slice off the top of a whole cheese and dip into the creamy interior: an instant fondue. Spoon the cheese onto lightly toasted bread.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Goat’s Milk</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">
<strong>Garrotxa</strong>
 is a hard cheese from Catalonia with a wonderfully smooth texture. Try serving it with walnuts or hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Montenebro</strong>
 or <strong>Queso de Tietar</strong>
 is a semi-cured firm log of nutty goat’s cheese with a grey rind, from Ávila. It is fabulous served with <em>pan de higos</em>
, the compressed cake of dried figs and almonds available at local markets and good delicatessens.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>El Suspiro</strong>
 from Toledo, with its fresh, creamy charm, will even convert those who claim to hate goat’s cheese. It has none of the ‘farmyardy’ flavour associated with goat’s cheese. Delicious served with juicy sultanas.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to serving cheese, however, it is infinitely better to produce one exceptional cheese than a collection of small wedges. Even when entertaining keep the selection of cheeses small, otherwise the platter will look sad and decimated by the time a few people have helped themselves.</p>
<p class="extract">Three varieties will usually keep everyone happy: maybe one goat’s, one sheep’s, one cow’s or one young creamy, one blue and one matured hard cheese. Allow 75–100 g/3–4 oz per person.</p>
