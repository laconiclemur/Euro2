  <p class="nonindent">With its North Sea and Baltic coastlines, and its many rivers, mountain lakes and streams, Germany has a tremendous variety of excellent fish, both fresh and salt water. Since freshness is of paramount importance these fish are most popular on their home grounds, so that salt-water specialties originate in the areas around Hamburg and Bremen, as well as around Lübeck and other ports. Fresh-water fish specialties such as pike, trout, carp and, most especially, Rhine salmon are naturally credited to the inland regions.</p>

  <p class="indent">The simplest fish preparations are the ones found most often on German menus, with boiled or poached, steamed, baked or sautéed versions leading all others. Melted butter, or cream, wine, mustard, Hollandaise and green sauces are favored with fish, as is natural pan gravy thickened with sour cream. I have included examples of all such preparations here, with the hope that you will realize similar fish can be prepared in similar ways. (A firm-fleshed salt-water fish such as halibut or sole can be cut into filets or slices and prepared in the same way as pike, allowing for differences in cooking time. However, a fat fish such as salmon should never be larded with bacon and baked in sour cream.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Buttered boiled potatoes, or Fish Potatoes (Fischkartoffeln), are almost always served with fish in Germany. To prepare these potatoes, peel large boiling potatoes and scoop out balls with a potato-ball cutter. Boil in well-salted water until tender. Drain and serve with hot melted butter and minced parsley and/or dill. Steamed rice is also a fairly common <a id="page103"></a>accompaniment to fish in Germany, as are cucumbers, asparagus and green salad.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to fresh fish, smoked fish is eaten a great deal. For descriptions of types and uses.</p>

  <p class="indent">As I’ve already said, shellfish is usually served in the simplest way possible. Shrimp, crab, lobster and crayfish are boiled, well chilled and served with mayonnaise; oysters are favored raw, and in Hamburg’s Austernstuben—oyster inns—are accompanied by sliced Cheshire cheese and a glass of red wine. In addition to being served by themselves, shellfish are often added to meat, vegetable and fish dishes as garnishes. The few cooked shellfish preparations found in Germany are included in this chapter.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>GENERAL FISH PREPARATIONS</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">1. The most exacting German cooks and housewives always purchase fresh-water fish live and cook it as soon as possible. If they must buy it a day in advance, they keep it swimming in a tub full of cold water. Kill the fish with a heavy blow on the head—a marvelous expression in German : <em>mit einer kräftigen Schlag auf den Kopf</em>. If you do not want to go to this kind of trouble, buy the fish very fresh and cook it the same day you buy it.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Salt-water fish is always prepared in Germany according to the “3-S System”—<em>säubern, sauern, salzen. Säubern</em>, or cleaning, means that fish is opened and eviscerated and washed under cold running water until all blood streaks and clots are removed. <em>Sauern</em>, or souring, is done by marinating the fish in lemon juice or vinegar for various lengths of time, depending on the size of the fish. This makes the fish meat white and firm. <em>Salzen</em>, or salting, may be done along with souring or after it. The fish should not be salted too heavily or too long, as it will become watery.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BOILED FISH (Gekochter Fisch)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">The one thing you must never do to “boiled” fish is boil it; it should cook or poach at a very slow but constant simmer. The fish may be whole or cut into large chunks or thick steaks. It should be wrapped in cheesecloth so it can be removed from the stock without being broken. Start a whole fish in cold water or stock; smaller cuts can be started in boiling liquid which must then be reduced to a simmer. If <a id="page104"></a>you have time and patience, and want the very tenderest fish, bring cooking liquid to a boil, before or after the fish has been added depending on its size, cover pot and turn heat off completely. It will take almost twice as long for the fish to be done, but the result will be worth it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fish is done when its meat can be flaked with a fork. Do not let fish overcook until it falls apart.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you cook whole or large pieces of fish this way often, it’s a good idea to buy a fish cooker. The fish is placed on a perforated rack and lowered into the cooking liquid. When done, the fish is lifted out on the rack, and it is then easy to drain it. If you use a rack, no cheesecloth is necessary. Although the showiest and best fish cookers are made of tin-lined copper, they are extremely expensive; aluminum cookers are available at one-third to one-half the price and serve the purpose admirably.</p>

  <p class="indent">To boil salt-water fish, prepare it according to the 3-S System mentioned above. Simmer it in fish or vegetable stock. A little vinegar and/or lemon slices can be added if none was used in the stock. Season stock with a pinch of sage and/or bay leaf. Do not use parsnip in vegetable stock when cooking fish.</p>

  <p class="indent">To boil fresh-water fish, follow same procedure, eliminating the 3-S treatment unless a specific recipe indicates that you should use it.</p>

  <p class="indent">To poach small fish or filets, lay them in a buttered skillet or baking pan and add just enough stock, white wine or water to cover them. Cover pan, let simmer slowly on stove or in oven until fish is done, usually in 5 to 8 minutes.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>STEAMED FISH (Gedämpfter Fisch)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This is best done with whole or large pieces of fish. Place 3 or 4 tablespoons of herb or mustard butter inside a whole fish or spread on top of a cut piece. Sprinkle with minced parsley. Place fish in a pan or baking dish that can be set over another pan of hot water. Cover fish pan tightly and steam about 1 hour. If you have a fish cooker or vegetable steamer, the fish pan can be placed on the perforated rack and steamed that way; or place the fish pan over another pan of boiling water and steam it in the oven. Cover fish pan tightly and bake-steam for 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page105"></a><em>BRAISED FISH (Gedünsteter Fisch)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Fish may be whole or cut into portion-size pieces. Sauté some onion, celery, carrot and parsley in butter 3 or 4 minutes, then place fish on this bed of vegetables. If fish is lean, lay some bacon on top of it. Cover pan and braise over moderate heat 5 minutes. Add just enough wine, water or stock to cover bottom of pan. Cover and braise until fish is done, basting with pan juices several times and adding more stock if needed. Bind sauce with 1 tablespoon flour (for 2 cups of stock) stirred into 3 to 4 tablespoons sour cream.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>SAUTÉED FISH, MEUNIÈRE (Fisch, auf Müllerin Art)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">What the French call sauté meunière, the Germans call Müllerin Art, or miller’s style. Lean, white firm-fleshed fish, fresh- or salt-water, are prepared this way, most often sole. Filets are generally used, although you could also use halves that are boned but not skinned, or whole small fish that are split and boned. The fish is seasoned with salt and pepper or mace or nutmeg, dredged lightly with flour on both sides and sautéed in moderately hot butter. Turn once so fish browns on both sides. The butter should be nut-brown but not black by the time the fish is done, so regulate heat accordingly. The finished fish are placed on a hot platter. Add some lemon juice to the pan, along with a little minced parsley. Bring to a boil and swirl in an extra lump of butter. Spoon over fish.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the above, one also finds breaded fried fish and broiled fish in Germany, but these are not nearly as typical. “Blue-cooked” fish, fish in aspic and fish in cream are all given elsewhere in this chapter in specific recipes. And, if I may repeat myself, the recipes for most of them are interchangeable.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds fish (eel, carp, salmon, trout)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Fish Stock, or Vegetable Broth</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 envelope unflavored gelatin softened in ¼ cup cold water or white wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups fish stock</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If small, the fish may be served whole; otherwise cut into steaks, filets or other such portion-size pieces. A whole fish may be molded with or without its skin but usually with its head. Clean and wash fish and sprinkle inside and out with lemon juice. Let stand 20 minutes, then pat dry. Poach fish in fish or vegetable stock to cover, flavoring stock with vinegar. When fish is done, remove carefully from stock, drain and lay in large shallow but rimmed dish, such as pie pan, or individual dishes. Let cool thoroughly. When gelatin has softened, add it to the 2 cups hot stock in which fish was poached. Stir until gelatin is completely dissolved. Cool until slightly thickened but not set. Pour over cool fish to cover. Chill until completely set, 1 to 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If you are molding a large fish such as a salmon, remove skin after cooking. Brush aspic over fish in several layers, letting each layer set before another is added. You may have to heat aspic if it sets before last layer is added. After fish has a good glaze, pour remainder of aspic over and around it. Various garnishes such as fancy lemon slices, olives, hard-cooked-egg slices, truffles, etc., can be stuck onto the aspic glazes and then covered over with another coating of aspic after they have set into place.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>JELLIED FISH (Fisch in Gelee)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">It is only necessary to use the above method, adding gelatin to fish stock, when you want fish to be molded and encased in a solid aspic. Otherwise, fish is served in a softer and, to my mind, more delicately flavored jelly formed by its own cooking liquid. To prepare this, cook some fish heads, bones and, if fish has been fileted, the skin removed from it, in water along with an onion, a carrot, some celery, peppercorns and, if you like, a bay leaf and/or a lemon slice or two. Simmer this 30 minutes and use that stock to cook fish itself. The stock may be strained through cheesecloth or fine mesh sieve either before or <a id="page107"></a>after fish is cooked. When fish is done, place in a bowl or deep dish and pour strained stock over it. The vegetables may be added in slices if you like. Store in refrigerator until serving time, but for not less than 3 or 4 hours and preferably overnight. Place fish on a chilled plate with some of the jelly spooned around it. Serve at once before jelly melts. Carp, whitefish and eel are most often used this way.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_10"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>FISH AU GRATIN (Überkrusteter Fisch oder Überbackener Fisch)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This is a very popular dish in Germany. Poach steaks or filets or fork-size pieces of any lean, firm, white-fleshed fish according to directions. Prepare Cheese Sauce, using Gruyère, Parmesan or combination of both. Use some of the fish stock for sauce liquid. Place cooked, drained fish in a buttered open baking dish and pour sauce over it. Top with grated cheese, breadcrumbs and dot generously with butter. Bake in upper third of oven, preheated to 450°, or place under preheated broiler until nicely browned on top and sauce is bubbling. This dish is sometimes prepared with a ring of mashed potatoes around fish; make sure that potatoes are well seasoned. Place fish in baking dish and pipe a ring of potatoes around them, forcing potatoes through a pastry tube. Cover fish and potatoes with sauce and proceed as described above. Halibut, haddock, bass, whiting and trout are a few of the fish that are very good this way.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_11"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L03_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CARP (Karpfen)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L04_r1.jpg" /></h2>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">This dark-fleshed meaty fish is served most often during the winter months, since it tends to taste musty in warm weather. It is the traditional speciality on Christmas Eve and Sylvester, New Year’s Eve. It may be prepared at that time in any of the ways that follow, though it <a id="page108"></a>is usually done according to the Bohemian style. It may also be stuffed and baked as described for Stuffed Pike.</p>

  <p class="indent">Carp is at its best when young and weighing between 2 and 4 pounds.</p>

  <p class="indent">Carp roe is a great delicacy and should be poached separately in stock that may or may not be flavored with a little white wine. The roe is served as a garnish with the fish.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_12"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BOILED OR BLUE CARP (Karpfen, gekocht oder blau gekocht)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">If carp is alive just before you cook it, it may be prepared “blue;” see Blue Trout. Otherwise it can be boiled according to directions. It will take about 25 to 30 minutes for a carp to cook, depending on its size. It is done when its eyes are white and distended; if the eyes fall out, it is overcooked. Horseradish Sauce, or hot melted butter is usually served with this.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 onions, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pint dark beer</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>10 Lebkuchen or gingersnaps, crushed or grated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 peppercorns, lightly crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 strip lemon peel</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ teaspoon powdered cloves</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If the carp is alive, kill it with a sharp blow to the head just before cooking. Reserve blood in a little vinegar, if you want to add it to sauce. Clean carp thoroughly and cut into portion-size pieces. Sprinkle with salt and let stand 30 minutes. Heat butter in deep saucepan and when hot and bubbling, add onion. Stir and sauté slowly until onion is golden brown. Add flour, stir and sauté 5 or 6 minutes, or until flour <a id="page109"></a>is medium brown. Add beer and stir smooth, over low heat, with wire whisk or wooden spoon. Add Lebkuchen or gingersnap crumbs, peppercorns, bay leaf, lemon peel and cloves. Add carp to sauce. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily until done, about 15 minutes. Add a little beer or water if sauce thickens too quickly. Remove fish pieces. Rub sauce through a strainer into clean saucepan and reheat. If you are using carp blood, add it with vinegar and heat but do not boil. Pour sauce over carp and serve with boiled potatoes.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Chopped carrot and/or leek can be sautéed with onion. Red currant jelly can be melted into sauce just before serving.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 cups dry red wine, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare fish as described above. Cut cleaned carp in portion-size pieces. Salt and let stand 30 minutes. Pat dry. Heat butter in a skillet and when hot and bubbling, add fish and brown over moderate heat, turning once or twice. Using a heavy, shallow casserole, add cut-up bread crusts, onion, parsley, garlic, herbs and lemon slices. Place fish on top of vegetables. Add butter in which fish was browned, pouring it over fish. Add red wine. Cover pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily until fish is done, about 15 minutes. Baste fish several times as it cooks and add more wine to pan if necessary. Remove cooked fish to a heated platter. Add blood and vinegar to sauce if you are using it, or flavor with a dash of wine vinegar or red wine. Strain sauce and heat but do not boil if blood has been added. Pour over fish and serve.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This excellent fresh-water fish is very firm-fleshed, meaty and not at all “fishy.” As its meat is very solid and lean, it always requires added fat for cooking. In Germany, it is usually larded with bacon and cooked with sour cream. The two most famous pike preparations in that country are those of Baden-Baden and the Moselle district. Pickerel is a young pike (junger Hecht), and can be prepared the same way.</p>

  <p class="indent">Any recipe for pike can be used for pickerel or perch.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 cups sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>white wine or fish stock, if needed</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 400°. The center bone of the fish should be removed, and the head cut off. The fish may be baked in one piece or it can be cut in two long filets. Wash quickly under running cold water, then pat dry. Sprinkle fish with salt and let stand 45 minutes. Rinse and dry. Butter a shallow baking dish and lay fish in it, skin side down. Sprinkle fish with onion, bacon, cheese and breadcrumbs. Pour melted butter over fish and, finally, 1 cup sour cream. Place baking dish on a cookie sheet in preheated oven. Bake 45 minutes, or until fish is done. Baste with pan juices from time to time and if pan seems dry, spoon in a little fish stock or white wine. Add 1 more cup of cream to pan (not over fish) for last 15 to 20 minutes of baking time. Remove finished fish to heated platter and serve with the sauce. If you would <a id="page112"></a>like more sauce than you have in pan, add a little more sour cream along with a tablespoon or two of wine or stock. Stir and heat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sprinkle fish with salt; let stand 30 minutes. Rinse and dry. Heat butter in a shallow casserole or deep skillet with a cover. When butter is hot and bubbling, add onion and parsley and sauté over moderate heat 2 or 3 minutes.

  <p class="indent">Preheat oven to 475°. Melt 2 tablespoons butter, and when hot, stir in flour. Sauté and stir over low heat for about 4 minutes, or until flour just begins to turn color.

To prepare stuffing, melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet and when hot and bubbling, add onion, parsley and chopped mushrooms. Stir and sauté over moderate heat about 5 minutes, or until vegetables just begin to soften and brown slightly. This should be done fairly quickly so mixture does not become too wet.

  <p class="nonindent">Trout is one of the most highly prized fish in Germany, especially when it comes from the crystal streams of the Black Forest. Although they are served fried, grilled or baked, trout are preferred “blue-cooked,” for which a live fish is practically essential. Traditionally, this sleek sapphire fish is served in a circle, its tail tucked into its mouth. Only a live fish will snap into a curl as it is placed in boiling water. The distinctive blue color, due to the interaction of vinegar and a substance on the skin which evaporates once the fish has been killed, can also be achieved only with a live, or <em>very</em> recently, killed fish. You could have the fish killed and cleaned at the market and then take it home and prepare it at once, but if there must be more than a 10-minute delay, prepare <a id="page115"></a>the trout in some other way. Needless to say, frozen trout can never be cooked “blue.”</p>

  <p class="indent">In the enchanting little Black Forest town of Herrenalb, known for its Kneipp water baths and fresh-air cures, the Mönchs Posthotel catches trout to order in the flower-edged stream that runs in front of its restaurant. The fish are then prepared as follows.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">You will need 6 live trout, one for each serving. Kill the fish with a heavy blow on the head. Cut open along the stomach and clean very quickly. Sprinkle trout with vinegar and let stand 4 or 5 minutes before cooking. Bring 2 to 3 quarts water to a boil with a little salt, and 3 or 4 slices of lemon. Other seasonings which can be included are 1 bay leaf, 6 or 8 peppercorns, 3 sprigs of parsley, 1 or 2 stalks of celery and/or 1 sliced onion. When water is boiling, turn off heat and add fish. Cover pot and let stand about 12 minutes, or until fish are done. Remove fish from stock and drain well. Arrange on a heated platter or individual dinner plates.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">For a slightly more piquant version, bend the cleaned trout in a circle, tucking its tail in its mouth. Place in a bowl and cover with hot vinegar. Cover bowl with a double thickness of aluminum foil or a plate and let stand 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the trout gently and place in the boiling water with a little of the vinegar and seasonings as described above. Turn off heat, cover pot and let stand 15 minutes, or until fish are done. Drain and serve as above.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 halibut steaks, 1” to 1½″ thick, or 1 3½- to 4-pound whitefish, boned and split</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 to 5 slices bacon (for whitefish)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 to 5 drained canned tomatoes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 green peppers, seeded and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large onions, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water or stock as needed</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 400°. Prepare fish according to instructions. Halibut should get the 3-S treatment mentioned there. Whitefish can be sprinkled with lemon juice but it is not entirely necessary. Dry fish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. If you use halibut, brown lightly in 4 tablespoons hot butter. If you use whitefish, skip that step. Arrange tomatoes, peppers and onion on bottom of a large baking dish with a cover (or make a cover of a double thickness of aluminum foil). Arrange fish on this bed of vegetables. If using halibut, pour butter in which fish was sautéed over fish and vegetables. If using whitefish, mince bacon and sprinkle over fish and add 3 tablespoons butter to pan. Cover pan and bake in preheated oven about 30 minutes, basting fish with pan juices and adding water or stock if needed. Remove cover and bake for another 10 minutes, or until fish is lightly browned on top. Serve with pan vegetables and juices.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">This dish gets a decidedly Hungarian flavor if the fish steaks are sprinkled with paprika before being browned. With whitefish, the paprika can be mixed through the sliced vegetables. Use about 1 to 2 tablespoons sweet paprika in either case and sprinkle a little more on fish after you remove cover to brown them. Stir 2 or 3 tablespoons sour cream into the vegetables and pan juices before serving and heat. Spoon over fish.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The term “green” is applied to fresh herring that is absolutely unsalted or treated in any way. Unlike the herring sold in barrels, this fish is purchased at a fish market, not at a delicatessen or appetizing store. It tastes, looks and is prepared almost exactly like its first cousin, the mackerel, and is not salty. Fresh sardines, smelts or small herrings can be used in any recipes for green herring that follow. These can also be cooked “blue,” just to show you how flexible the German gastronomic color spectrum can get. Follow directions for Blue Trout.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Fish should be thoroughly cleaned and heads removed. Remove center bone but leave fish in one piece, opened flat. This can best be done by your fish man. Sprinkle lightly with salt and dredge with flour. Heat fat in large heavy skillet and when hot, add fish. Fry slowly, turning once, until both sides are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Onion rings and/or breadcrumbs, both browned in butter, are often served on top of fried herring or mackerel. Other sauces used include Bavarian Mustard Sauce, or red currant jelly melted in hot butter.</p>

Strain stock and reserve. Cut fish filets in half lengthwise so that you have 12 long strips. Sprinkle top side of each piece lightly with salt and pepper and roll jelly-roll fashion. Fasten with toothpicks. Place rolled filets, standing upright, in a deep skillet or shallow casserole. The rolled filets should be close enough to keep each other from toppling over, but they should not be crammed together.</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine strained shrimp stock, white wine and butter in the pan. Cover tightly, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily until fish is solidly white throughout, about 15 minutes. Remove fish to heated platter.

  <p class="hanging1"><em>corn oil or other vegetable shortening for deep frying (not olive oil)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut filets in halves or quarters; they should be in large portion-size pieces, but not so large that they will be hard to handle in the batter or deep-fryer. Sprinkle with vinegar or lemon juice and marinate for 30 minutes. Pat dry and sprinkle lightly with salt. While the fish marinates, prepare the batter. Mix flour with beaten egg and salt and add beer. Stir with fork until batter is blended and free of lumps but do not beat too thin. Mixture should be the consistency of a medium pancake batter. Set wire basket into a deep-frying pan full of fat, heated to 375°. Slip batter-dipped fish into fat, a few at a time; fry until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove finished filets with wire basket and drain on absorbent paper. Fry remaining fish filets in the <a id="page129"></a>same way. Be sure that temperature of the fat remains even during frying. If you do not have a wire basket and deep fryer, simply use a deep saucepan. Slip fish directly into fat and remove finished pieces with slotted spoon or pancake turner.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">“In Fernstein the king always ate Hechtenkraut, a specialty which had often figured in the royal menus during earlier reigns. This dish was prepared in the following way. A pike was baked and then allowed to get cold. All the bones were removed, even the very smallest, and the fish was cut up into small pieces and put on one side. Sauerkraut was then cooked with a lot of finely browned onions and plenty of butter and a fireproof dish greased with butter and lined with breadcrumbs. In this, alternate layers of fish and sauerkraut were laid and the whole topped with breadcrumbs, covered with crayfish tails and sauce and browned for twenty minutes in the oven.”</p>

Cook sauerkraut according to recipe, omitting apples but using wine and caraway seeds. Cook to the “dry but juicy” stage described. Preheat oven to 375°. Sauté bacon and when it begins to melt, add onion. Stir and sauté slowly until onion and bacon just begin to brown. Butter a 6-cup soufflé dish and sprinkle sides and bottom with breadcrumbs, tapping out excess.

Add water or stock and beat smooth with wire whisk or wooden spoon. Cook 10 minutes, or until sauce is smooth and thick. Flavor with salt and pepper or nutmeg. Cool sauce slightly and pour over fish. Add egg yolk and mix thoroughly. Chill fish mixture 1 to 2 hours. (If you want to prepare this for dinner and do not have <a id="page132"></a>much time, you can prepare fish mixture up to this point in the morning, and leave it in the refrigerator until evening.) Shape chilled fish mixture into small hamburger-like patties. Dredge lightly with flour, then dip in beaten egg and let excess drip off, then dredge with breadcrumbs. Heat fat in a deep skillet. There should be enough melted fat for fish cakes to “swim.” Add fish cakes and fry over moderate heat, turning once until golden brown on both sides.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">If you start with raw fish, this recipe gives a more solid sort of fish pudding.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 stale rolls or 4 slices white bread</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup milk, approximately</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds white firm-fleshed fish, or salmon (inexpensive fish will do very nicely here)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><a id="page134"></a><em>lemon juice or vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="indent"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>slices bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons grated onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 375°. Soak rolls or bread in milk and when soft, squeeze out all excess milk. Clean, wash and bone fish and grind three-quarters of it through fine blade of a food chopper. Cut rest of fish in several long strips and sprinkle with lemon juice and salt. Let stand for 20 minutes. Grind soaked, drained bread through food chopper with bacon. Cream butter in a mixing bowl and gradually work in whole eggs. Add ground fish, rolls, cheese, grated onion, flour, salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Dry large pieces of fish and gently stir them into ground-fish mixture. Butter a 6-cup soufflé dish or pudding form. Sprinkle sides and bottom with breadcrumbs and tap out excess. Turn fish mixture into dish or form. Set in a pan of hot water and bake in preheated oven 1 hour, or until a knife inserted into the center of the pudding comes out clean. If you use a pudding form with a cover, steam in a water bath on the stove for the same amount of time. Serve with sauces indicated for Fish Soufflé, above.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Guests have to shell their own, or go without dinner, when you serve this dish.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ pounds shrimp that run 14 to 16 per pound, or 20 crayfish tails (thawed, if frozen)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cups Munich or Berlin</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Weissbier (if unavailable, use light ale)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Crab butter is used as a spread for canapés and open sandwiches, and as a base for white sauce. It is also melted into fish soups and is an important ingredient in Keukenragout, the savory fricassee that is a Bremen specialty. If crayfish are unavailable, or seem too expensive for such purposes, use large shrimp instead. Lobster butter can be made in the same way.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 hard-shell crabs or 16 medium-sized shrimp, or 1 ¾-pound lobster</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅔ cup butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cups water</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove crabmeat, shrimp or lobster from shell. Dry shell on paper towel and with sharp knife, or meat cleaver, chop as fine as possible. De-vein shrimp if you use them. Heat butter in a skillet and when hot and bubbling, add chopped shells. Sauté over moderate heat until they turn bright red. Stir and sauté carefully as this butter will be ruined if it starts to brown. When shells are bright red, add water. Chop meat and add to pot. Cover and simmer ½ hour. Pour into deep, narrow bowl or wide-mouthed jar and chill overnight. The pieces of shell and the shellfish meat will sink to bottom; the butter will set at the top. Remove layer of butter and use as needed. The stock may be strained and used as a base for soups, sauces or for poaching fish. Use this shellfish butter instead of regular butter when making White Sauce, for fish dishes or fish soups. To make the Keukenragout referred to above, follow recipe for Chicken Fricassee, using 2 very young broilers. Use this butter as a base for sauce indicated at end. Garnish with crayfish tails or shrimp. Sliced mushrooms sautéed a few minutes in a little butter can be added also, as can some cooked asparagus tips.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 TO 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>24 to 30 mussels</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to ⅔ cup dry white wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour 1½ cups mussel stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 generous tablespoon minced fresh dill</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Scrub mussels with a stiff brush until free of sand, and debeard them. Heat butter in a deep pot or kettle and when hot and bubbling, add onion and parsley and sauté slowly for 2 or 3 minutes. Add the mussels and then the white wine. Cover pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily for 8 to 10 minutes, or until mussels shells open. Remove mussels and drain. Strain stock and reserve. Take mussels out of shells very gently so as not to break them. Discard shells. Heat butter in 2-quart saucepan and when hot and bubbling, stir in flour. Stir and sauté slowly for about 5 minutes, or until flour begins to take on color. Add strained mussel stock. If you do not have ½ cups, make up the difference with water, or a combination of water and white wine. Beat sauce with wire whisk or wooden spoon, over low heat, until smooth. Add dill and salt and pepper to taste. Add shelled mussels to sauce and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Check seasoning and serve.</p>

Heat butter in a shallow casserole or deep skillet with a cover. When butter is hot and bubbling, add frogs’ legs and fry, turning several times, so they become golden brown on all sides. Sprinkle with flour. Stir and sauté until flour is absorbed and begins to turn color, about 4 minutes. Add stock, lemon peel and a dash of nutmeg. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily about 15 minutes, or until meat is tender. Remove peel. Beat egg yolk into sour cream and add very slowly to hot, but not boiling, gravy. Season to taste with salt, well-drained capers and, if you like, minced anchovies or a dab of anchovy paste. Heat thoroughly but do not boil.</p>
