<p class="author1"><span class="txit">fettuccine con asparagi e gamberetti</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This is an elegant but simple spring pasta. The sauce cooks in the time it takes to boil the pasta. The shrimp may be replaced by bay scallops, crabmeat, lobster, or squid. Or substitute thinly sliced white mushrooms for the seafood to create a purely vegetarian meal.</p>
<p class="indentb">An easy way to peel the fresh tomatoes called for in this recipe is to plunge them into the boiling water the pasta will be cooked in. It will not affect the flavor of the pasta and eliminates boiling a second pot of water just to remove the skins.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound fettuccine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">12 medium-size asparagus (about 1 pound)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle on top of the pasta</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons finely diced shallots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> teaspoon red pepper flakes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound medium-size shrimp, shelled, deveined, and sliced in half lengthwise</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup peeled and coarsely chopped ripe tomatoes (1 large or 2 plum tomatoes)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the fettuccine. Cook until al dente, following the package instructions.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Meanwhile, cut 1 inch off the bottoms of the asparagus. Use a vegetable peeler to trim away the tough outer layer of the asparagus, beginning about 1 inch below the tender tip. Cut the asparagus on an acute angle to create 2-inch-long slices. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_153"/><span class="red">3.</span> Warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, garlic, red pepper flakes, parsley, and basil and cook, stirring frequently, to flavor the oil with the aromatics, about 1 minute. Stir in the asparagus and shrimp, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until the shrimp are pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook until it evaporates, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and return the sauce to a gentle boil. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Gently toss to coat the pasta with the sauce.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Serve immediately, placing the shrimp decoratively on top of the pasta and drizzling with additional extra virgin olive oil.</p>

Two thin, round slices of seeded fresh jalapeño pepper may be substituted for the red pepper flakes. Remove the pepper slices from the pan just before tossing pasta with the sauce.</p>
