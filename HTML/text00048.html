<p class="pf">“Pull up my pants, wipe my nose, and make cookies!” That was what my three-year-old son, Greg, said pretty much every day when I stepped into our apartment at Stanford Village after spending the day working at <i>Sunset.</i>
 I really wanted to be a good mom, so I made cookies.</p>
<p>Cathy, who was five when we moved to California, entered kindergarten at the Laurel School, a public school in the Atherton School District, smack in the middle of a wealthy and prestigious community. Shirley Temple Black and her family resided there.</p>
<p>Cathy always was very self-confident and shrugged off comments made by other kids about her lack of “designer” tennis shoes and dresses. One weekend she was invited to the birthday party of one of her wealthy friends. The mother phoned me and said that they really wanted Cathy to attend the party but she didn’t have to bring a gift.</p>

<p>When I dropped her off at the home of her friend, her friend ran out to meet her and asked her where her gift was. Cathy just replied, “I didn’t bring one,” and confidently entered the scene of the party. It was a catered affair, with cloth-covered tables, multicolored umbrellas, and pretty lights strung over the backyard. The pile of gifts was at least six feet deep. Later, when Cathy returned home, she described all the gifts—it sounded like her friend received one of every item in the toy department!</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Jumbo Sugar Jumbles</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This is a simple drop sugar cookie that dates back to the 1800s and is the kind of simple cookie I would often make for the family. I included this recipe in my <i>Great Holiday Baking Book,</i>
 originally published by Clarkson Potter in 1994 and republished by the University of Minnesota Press in 2001.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">½ cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 large egg</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpill">Water and sugar, for dipping</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a cookie sheet, or cover with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="rp">In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar together well. Add the egg and beat until light.</p>
<p class="rp">Stir the flour, baking soda, and salt together and then add it to the creamed mixture; mix until the dough is stiff.</p>
<p class="rp">Using a large ice-cream scoop, divide the dough into equal-sized mounds, placing them 3 inches apart on the prepared pan. For normal-sized cookies, cut the big mounds in half. Flatten with a fork dipped in water and then in sugar.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until light golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 6 jumbo cookies or 12 normal-sized cookies</p>
