    <p class="nonindent">Valle d’Aosta is so rich in castles that as you are driving through the countryside it is hard to know how to choose which to stop at. I am particularly drawn to the castles of <strong class="calibre13">Fenis</strong> and <strong class="calibre13">Issogne.</strong> Set against the backdrop of the Alps, Fenis’s silhouette looks as if someone had taken a large lace ribbon and casually placed it standing on its side on a soft hill in front of the mountains. In the early fifteenth century, Jacquerio painted for the Castello di Fenis one of the most elegant <em class="calibre4">uomini illustri</em> fresco cycles on the Italian peninsula, consisting of twenty-four figures each holding a scroll with a moral proverb or a saying in archaic French.</p>

    <p class="extract">The courtyard area of <strong class="calibre13">Castello d’Issogne</strong> is decorated with representations of everyday shops and happenings depicted under the portico from the end of the fifteenth century. Almost like a voyeur, the visitor walks under the courtyard portico and looks at the arches on the walls, peering into the butcher shop, the bakery, the shoemaker’s shop, and the tavern. The detail is extraordinary, as if a page of fifteenth-century life has been opened for us to enjoy. I love the two figures playing backgammon in the tavern, or the people busy at work in the fabric shop with reams of cloth piled on tables and clothes hanging from the rafters. The whole castle is worth exploring, particularly the wonderful chapel.</p>

    <p class="extract">The <strong class="calibre13">Castello di Verràs</strong> is built on a craggy rock. Massive, towerless, and constructed in a cube shape, this is a castle that children enjoy, because the huge stone halls are almost empty. From one room inside, you can peer down into the vast hall below, which seems to go on forever.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Aosta</strong>, a Roman city founded in 25 <span class="small1">B.C</span>., is one of the finest examples of Roman city planning, a perfect rectangle divided into a grid carved out by the roads. Twenty centuries later, the current city of Aosta follows pretty much the same city plan. There are many Roman artifacts, such as the triumphal Arch of August and the grand urban Roman villa that was excavated on the outskirts of town and is the only remaining Roman villa in the Valle d’Aosta.</p>

    <p class="extract">The Abbey of <strong class="calibre13">Ranverso</strong> is one of the most important examples of Lombard Gothic architecture. Its location in the Val di Susa, not far outside of Torino, has helped protect most of the structure, which consisted of a church, hospital, monastery, and farm. It was built on the busy pilgrimage route from Torino to Lyon. The overall effect is one of absolute elegance, particularly evident in its pointy arches and elongated spires. Mostly, I enjoy the rich pinkish brick color of the buildings. The intricate terra-cotta decorations weave around the outline of the architectural elements like frilly lace.</p>

    <p class="extract">With all the medieval castles in Valle d’Aosta, <strong class="calibre13">Castel Savoia</strong> in Gressoney is a relatively modern masterpiece. It was begun in 1899 by the Savoy family, kings of Italy, in particular for Margaret of Savoy. The castle is richly decorated with wood carvings and affords a wonderful panoramic view. There is also a lovely botanical garden.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
