</h1>
<p class="pf">We met at the University of Minnesota Duluth at the beginning of my freshman year in 1952 as I set out to exert my independence from home, from home’s everlasting responsibility on the farm. I loved the sweet taste of freedom for that brief period of time. I really didn’t want to be tied down to anybody, no matter how nice. I wanted a career—as a writer, perhaps for a newspaper or magazine.</p>
<p>During my first month at the university my roommate, Wilma, and I were asked to help with mailing the <i>Statesman,</i>
 the university newspaper. We went to Washburn Hall, where we were to meet the staff. My job was to lick the stamps that were placed on the folded newspaper for mailing.</p>
<p>Wilma—or Willie, as she now likes to be called—was impressed by the “cute guys.” I guess I didn’t notice.</p>
<p>A few days later I got a phone call at Torrance Hall. “Hi! This is Dick Ojakangas!” a confident voice declared.</p>
<p>“Dick who?” I was puzzled.</p>
<p>Willie informed me quickly that Dick was that cute guy we met in Washburn Hall licking stamps for the <i>Statesman.</i>
 I really didn’t remember.</p>
<p>I had been going home from school every second weekend, taking the Greyhound bus back to Floodwood. Dick drove home to the nearby town of Warba on weekends also, but on opposite weekends. After that day working on the <i>Statesman,</i>
 Dick persistently began asking me if I’d like to go to a movie “next weekend,” or if I’d like a ride home. I persistently declared that I was not going home <i>that</i>
 weekend, or, that I was. I had a schedule, and I was keeping to it!</p>
<p>Later that quarter, there was a university event called the Engineers’ Marriage Ball. Dick called and invited me to the ball. I told him that was my weekend to go home.</p>
<p>He asked me again and again, and again I insisted that I was going home that weekend. Finally, a mutual friend named Jack Hautaluoma (a roommate of Dick’s and a fellow Floodwood graduate and longtime friend) sat me down with a cup of coffee in the cafeteria and asked me if I was going to the Marriage Ball. I told him that Dick had asked me several times but that I was going home that weekend.</p>

</div>
<p>“Aw, Peach!” he declared. “That’s the big event of fall quarter! Everybody goes to the Marriage Ball! You gotta tell Dick you will go!” I reluctantly agreed that if he were to call again, I would accept the invitation.</p>
<p>Jack went back to the house where he and Dick rented rooms. He convinced Dick that I would, indeed, accept an invitation to the dance, even though Dick had given up. Jack slapped a dollar bill down on the table and said, “If she says no—that dollar is yours!”</p>
<p>Later, Dick called me. “Peach, would you like to go to the Marriage Ball with me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’d love to go!” was my answer—even though I secretly thought the idea was rather sinister.</p>
<p>It was by then the week of the ball, and I had to figure out what to wear. I called home and had my parents send me the dress I had worn for homecoming the year before. They sent the dress down on the Greyhound bus, which made its trip from Floodwood to Duluth every day.</p>
<p>The dance itself was frightening to me. A long line of suited male students paired with formally dressed female students took their turns ahead of us. In the lineup was an old chemistry professor and his wife. They simply walked around the big wedding ring on the platform, and I secretly thought, “There’s my out!” We were supposed to step up to the betrothal-theme-decorated platform and, under the ring, kiss our partners.</p>
<p>We had never kissed before, and I was petrified! Dick tells me he really was eager to go through the ritual himself. So for a minute, I thought I could just walk around the platform like the chemistry professor and his wife. But then I stiffened and forced myself to go through with it.</p>
<p>That is all ancient history now.</p>
<p class="psec">It turned out that my ambition to write was a road covered with not rocks but boulders. (Dick, a geology graduate, jokingly told me he would put me into rocks as big as diamonds.) I ended up on the rigid path of home economics at the university because it seemed logical to me at the time. I didn’t want to come to the university and just get my Mrs. degree. I truly wanted a degree that expanded my horizons. After all, if I were a writer, I reasoned with myself, I really needed to have something to write about and would have to expand my knowledge in a particular area. Home economics seemed like a broad field, one that covered not just food but family life, home design, aesthetics, and relationships. It seemed a continuation of my growing up, a life that was domestic rather than eclectic, being raised as the oldest of ten on a farm near a very rural community. What I knew best and understood best was the business of a household, and I was looking to expand that perspective and perhaps even write about it.</p>
<p>Alas, my selected major in home economics ended up being “nothing new” to me for the most part, and I found that the support studies (such as chemistry and physics) were much more interesting. The related arts of communications were deemed to be too esoteric to be in my curriculum, so I was denied entry into such studies by the head of the home economics department. I was supposed to follow through with education courses and become a teacher. My road to freedom was again, momentarily, blocked.</p>
