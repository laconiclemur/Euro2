<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">Y</span><small>OU CAN</small>’<small>T BE</small> a Jersey Italian and not do a chapter on fried food. While I love the deep-fried classics from my childhood—corn dogs, funnel cakes, fried shrimp, and French fries—in this chapter, I’ve included recipes that are a little more grown up and not necessarily what you’d find at a carnival or on the boardwalk.</p>
<p class="indent">The trick to making good fried food is keeping a close eye on the oil temperature. If you have an electric fryer at home, great! If not, I’ve noted how you can use a heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven on the stovetop with a clip-on candy thermometer to track the oil’s temperature. You’ll just need to keep an eye on the thermometer as food goes in and out of the pan, and adjust the heat of your burner accordingly. Make sure your oil temperature stays consistent so the outside of your food doesn’t burn while the inside is still cooking.</p>
<p class="indent">A few safety tips: When I tell you to pat something dry before adding it to the oil, please do so. Any water on your vegetables or proteins and that hot oil is going to bubble up like crazy. Keep your face away from the pot of oil, too. Battered items can crackle, spit, and splatter oil out of the pan, so you’ll want to use common sense and be careful.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_76"/>Like the other chapters in this book, I’ve included recipes that span the seasons. You won’t be able to find squash blossoms year-round, but when you do, my recipe for <span class="color"><a href="#chapter04section09"><b><i>Squash Blossoms with Tomato, Feta, and Basil</i></b></a></span> (<a href="#page_99">page 99</a>) is a great summer treat. In the fall and winter, you might crave <span class="color"><a href="#chapter04section03"><b><i>Crunchy Crushed Potatoes with Bacon Gravy and Ricotta Salata</i></b></a></span> (<a href="#page_83">page 83</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Any time of year is a good time for frying, in my book.</p>

When making risotto for this recipe, it’s important to stir it in one direction so as to not break the grains and allow the rice to release its natural starch more evenly.

<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>1.</b></span> In a large saucepan, combine the water, 2 tablespoons salt, and sugar and bring to a boil. Set a bowl of ice water to the side.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>2.</b></span> Trim two inches from the end of the broccoli rabe stem and discard. Slice the remaining stem, leaves, and florets in half and blanch in boiling water for 1 minute, then shock in ice water until chilled. Strain and dry completely with a clean dish towel or paper towels.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> Pulse the broccoli rabe in a food processor for 1 minute until finely chopped. Measure ½ cup and set aside. Refrigerate the rest for a snack.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> In a large saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-low heat. Add diced onions and sweat them for 3–4 minutes until soft and tender. Don’t let them caramelize or turn brown. They should remain translucent white.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>5.</b></span> Add the carnaroli rice to the onions and stir with a wooden spoon to coat each grain of rice. Cook for 3–4 minutes.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>6.</b></span> In a small saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a simmer.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>7.</b></span> Add simmering vegetable broth in ½-cup increments to the rice, continually stirring in one direction. When each ½-cup of broth has been absorbed, add another ½-cup and keep stirring in the same direction. Repeat this until all the broth has been used. With the last ½-cup of broth, add the ½ cup reserved broccoli rabe and stir. When all broth has been absorbed, remove from heat. The rice should be creamy but firm to the bite.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>8.</b></span> Stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano, remaining tablespoon of butter, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Transfer risotto to a small baking dish and cool in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>9.</b></span> Heat the canola oil in an electric deep fryer to 350°F. If you do not have an electric fryer, use a large, heavy-bottomed pot and candy thermometer.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>10.</b></span> Using a 1-ounce scoop, place risotto in the palm of your hand and gently roll it between both hands to form a ball. Using your finger or the handle of a wooden spoon, make a divot in the center of each ball and place 1 cube of smoked provolone in the hole. Form the risotto around the cheese to seal it completely. Repeat with the remaining risotto.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>11.</b></span> Roll each risotto ball in the panko bread crumbs, tapping off any excess.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>12.</b></span> Fry the balls in small batches for 2–3 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. They will drop to the bottom of the fryer, so use a wok skimmer or slotted spoon to gently move them around to prevent clumping. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>When I was a kid, my mom grew squash in our garden, and she’d stuff the blossoms with rice and bake them. In the summertime when squash and tomatoes are abundant, this dish is a natural. I include feta in these because it’s a salty, briny cheese that goes so well with fresh tomatoes. The real key to this dish, though, is the vodka batter. I use vodka in my frying batter because alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature, so the blossoms crisp up immediately. The inside won’t overcook and the outside won’t fall apart.</i></p>
<p class="serve">SERVES 4 AS A SMALL PLATE<br/>ACTIVE TIME = 40–45 MINUTES</p>
