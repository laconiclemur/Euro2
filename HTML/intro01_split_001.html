<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Recipes, I have come to understand, have a special place at the heart</span> of Spanish identity. And they give the measure of a man. It was always so. In the early seventeenth century, Miguel de Cervantes began the first paragraph of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> by describing the gentleman who rode a scraggy horse, carrying a wooden lance and an ancient shield, as a man who ate lentils on Fridays, eggs on Saturdays, sometimes a pigeon on Sundays, and an occasional stew with more beef than mutton.</p>
<p class="para">Spain figured powerfully in my life long before I first went there for the BBC television series <span class="italic">Claudia Roden’s Mediterranean Cooking</span> in 1987. My grandmother Eugénie Alphandary spoke an old Judeo-Spanish language called Judezmo, or Ladino, which she said was old Castilian. She was from Constantinople (now Istanbul) and was descended from Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and went on to live in Ottoman lands. Her friends, who were mainly from Salonika, Smyrna, and Constantinople, were labeled Spaniolis in the Jewish community of Egypt that I grew up in. They were proud of their Spanish ancestry. They sang ballads about <span class="italic">hidalgos</span> (knights) and Moros (Moors), as Muslims were called in medieval Spain, and about princesses who became slaves. Some of their names—Toledano, Cuenca, Carmona, León, Burgos, Soria, Saragossa—were a record of the cities their ancestors came from. The dishes they clung to—<span class="italic">albóndigas</span> (meatballs), <span class="italic">almodrote</span> (vegetable flan), <span class="italic">maronchinos</span> (almond biscuits), <span class="italic">pan d’espanya</span> (sponge cake)—were their badge of identity.</p>
<p class="para">As I traveled through Spain to research this book, the names of cities and streets conjured up in my mind the faces of my family and friends in Egypt. I recognized the names of vegetables and dishes. Traces of the old Muslim presence—arabesque carvings, blue and white tiles, a fountain spouting cool water in a scented garden—evoked nostalgic memories of the Arab world I was born in. At the sight of an old minaret, I imagined hearing the call to prayer of a <span class="italic">muezzin</span>. The streets lined with orange trees explained why my family makes orange cakes and crystallized orange peel, and why we put the distilled essence of orange blossom in so many of our desserts and pastries. The way people cook in Spain, the ingredients they put together, their little tricks, their turn of hand, are mysteriously familiar. A word, a taste, a smell, triggered memories I never knew I had. It is surprising how dishes can appeal directly to the emotions. They say that with food, as with music, you can touch people and even make them cry.</p>
<p class="para">I am intrigued by how interested Spanish people are when they learn that I am a Sefardita (a Jew whose ancestors came from Spain). For centuries, the country had wiped its Muslim and Jewish past from national memory. The drama of the centuries-long Reconquista—the reconquest of their land from the Muslims—was the official and cherished feature of their history and self-image that was taught at school. But the legacies of the once huge population of Muslims and a significant minority of Jews, and the consequences of their expulsion or conversion, are now matters of scholarly research and public interest and discussion.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p016.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">It is an exceptional time to be traveling and eating in Spain today. The country has changed dramatically in less than thirty years. After the horrors of the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939), when thousands died and parts of the country knew famine, and after a long period of oppression and hardship when food was rationed during General Francisco Franco’s dictatorship, it is now a rich, modern, dynamic country, where everything, especially food, arouses great passions. And there has been a revolution in restaurant kitchens.</p>
<p class="para">Spanish food had never until now received praise from foreigners. In the nineteenth century, although the French were fascinated with their neighbor, and accounts of their travels in Spain were immensely popular, they described the food with disdain. Writers such as Théophile Gautier, in <span class="italic">Un Voyage en Espagne;</span> Alexandre Dumas, in <span class="italic">Adventures in Spain</span> and <span class="italic">From Paris to Cádiz;</span> and Prosper Mérimée, in the novella on which the opera <span class="italic">Carmen</span> was based, complained that the food was poor and that too much oil and too much pork fat, too much garlic, and too much <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (paprika) made it unpalatable. Dumas sometimes insisted on cooking his own food in the hostels where he stayed. British writer Richard Ford’s <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Spain,</span> originally published in 1845, had nothing good to say about the food, nor did the hispanophile Gerald Brenan. At a recent dinner in Córdoba, I was asked politely if the food in England was all that good in Richard Ford’s time. His comments obviously still hurt. In the mid-twentieth century, a bastardized tourist cuisine of the fixed-price menu and fake paellas arose during the massive expansion of cheap sand-sea-and-sun tourism. It is still there in parts, and tourists still complain, but Spain has transformed itself into the world’s effervescent center of gastronomic creativity.</p>
<p class="para">San Sebastián, in the Basque Country, has become the culinary capital of Europe, with the greatest concentration of Michelin three-star restaurants in Spain. Ferran Adrià at El Bulli in Roses, Catalonia, who is famous for using science and technology in his cuisine, is feted abroad as the greatest living chef. Food and travel writers rave about the extraordinary and fantastic <span class="italic">nueva cocina,</span> the new Spanish cuisine, and its star chefs are rightly acclaimed throughout the world. These avant-garde chefs use machines, cook <span class="italic">sous-vide</span> and with syringes, freeze-dry and caramelize, and create hot jellies, instant mousses, bubbling froths and foams, vapors, and explosions. They deconstruct traditional dishes and use exotic foreign ingredients. Their food is what they call an artist’s <span class="italic">cocina de autor</span>—signed by the chef—and it is constantly changing.</p>
<p class="para">There have been several phases in the gastronomic revolution over three decades. Among the other top influential chefs are Juan Mari Arzak, Pedro Subijana, Andoni Luis Aduriz, Martin Berasategui, Sergi Arola, Dani García, Carme Ruscalleda, and Victor Arguinzoniz. Some things have been crazy, but the kitchen revolution has led to the development of an exquisite and refined professional <span class="italic">alta cocina</span> (haute cuisine) that Spain had never had before, and to an updating of the traditional culinary know-how that had been passed down the generations for centuries. The new ways of doing things—to grill, fry, and roast better, to boil and stew better, to present food better, and to make it more delicious and appealing—have reached home cooks. And there has been a new appreciation of traditional Spanish food as well—which is what this book is about.</p>
<p class="para">Many of these innovative chefs now say that they have been inspired by their roots. They talk about their parents’ and grandparents’ cooking and about rescuing rural traditions and local ingredients that are in danger of disappearing. The revered Catalan chef Santi Santamaria, whose restaurant El Raco de Can Fabes is in San Celoni near Barcelona, says that cooking has to be sentiment as well as technique and that without “ideology,” it is simply a matter of manual skills and technology. His ideology, he says, is rooted in the life of his peasant family and the progressive politics of his youth. He quoted the painter Joan Miró: “To be universal, you have to be local.” The young Basque chef Andoni Luis Aduriz, of the restaurant Mugaritz in San Sebastián, spoke with touching intensity when he said that, apart from giving pleasure, his aim was to give “memories and emotions—even bad ones.” This is the refrain today of most of the innovative chefs.</p>
<p class="para">Despite the glamour of the innovators (in a cooking school I visited, all the students wanted to be like Ferran Adrià), a huge fraternity of chefs has stuck to traditional ways. In old-style <span class="italic">mesones,</span> informal restaurants or inns, and in grand establishments, they offer the food Spaniards have always known and loved. Because children now eat at school and men do not come home for lunch, because women work too and are busy (they cook on weekends or “just make pasta” and cook <span class="italic">a la plancha</span> [see page 121] or have Latin American or North African maids who also cook for them), restaurants and bars have become places where people go to find the traditional and regional home cooking they hanker after.</p>
<p class="para">Throughout the country, there is a palpable feeling of nostalgia for the old rural life that was too quickly swept away by the booming tourist economy. It has translated into a newfound passion for regional cooking and products. During the Franco regime, regional cultures were suppressed and artisan products were discouraged in favor of industrial ones that could feed the population cheaply. When the autonomous communities (as the historic regions are now called) gained political recognition and the right to govern themselves in 1978, people felt free to celebrate their regional heritage and began to value their cuisines and their sometimes almost lost local products.</p>
<p class="para">In a mood of regional nationalist hedonism, organizations have formed to preserve their culinary heritage by recording recipes. Such organizations have collected nine hundred recipes in Catalonia, six hundred in the Balearic Islands of Majorca and Menorca, and nine hundred in Galicia, and regional producers have rushed to defend their wines, their olive oils, their hams and charcuterie, their cheeses, beans, and honeys, and their indigenous breeds of cows, pigs, and capons. Many of them obtained <span class="italic">Denominaciones de Origen</span> (DOs)—designations of origin that specify geographical origin and time-honored traditional methods of production and guarantee quality. As Spaniards became more affluent and could afford to buy good wines and foods, it was worth investing effort and money in good quality. The European Union helped with subsidies, and the world has come to appreciate the results.</p>
<p class="para">Like language and music, food in Spain is about local patriotism. The historic regions, now seventeen autonomous communities (nineteen with Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan coast), each divided into provinces, were born out of the old medieval kingdoms. Each has its own history and culture, sometimes its own language, and a cuisine that springs from the land—the <span class="italic">comarca,</span> or <span class="italic">terroir</span>—and also reflects the past. The first thing you discover about Spain is its extraordinary geographical diversity. The greatest difference is between the very long, narrow coastal plains, with their string of vibrant port cities, and the vast empty interior—a high plateau and huge mountain ranges. Traveling through, you see endless flatlands and gentle hills, great rivers, mountain forests, marshlands, and deserts. There are seas of wheat and of rice, and endless landscapes carpeted with grapevines and olive trees. Until roads began to be built in the 1960s, the high mountains made internal transport difficult. Rural communities were isolated, and culinary styles developed separately. That is one reason why every province, every town, and every village has its own distinctive dishes or versions of a dish, and why every coastal region has at least three distinctive culinary styles; one of the sea, one of the rural coastal plain, and one of the mountains.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p019.png" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="para">Regional cooking has survived because it is loaded with emotional associations and because Spaniards are attached to their roots. Until the mid-twentieth century, the majority of the population lived and worked on the land. Most people now live in towns or cities, but they regularly go back to the village where their parents or grandparents came from, and where there is usually a family home. What their grandparents cooked has become something to be proud of.</p>
<p class="para">As I worked on this book and traveled throughout Spain, I asked everyone I met what their favorite foods were, how and where their parents and grandparents lived, and how they cooked. People were happy to give me old family recipes and to take me to bars and restaurants where I could taste their favorite dishes; some invited me to their homes. I had a few mentors who helped me and gave me contacts in different regions, and I talked with food writers and scholars, chefs and producers. I also spoke with fishermen who remembered when fish and seafood were regarded as poor food, with people who had once worked on the land as virtual serfs, with landed aristocrats, and with nuns who made pastries. I never studied Spanish formally, but I understood almost everything the people I met said, and they understood my mix of Italian, French, Judeo-Spanish, and the Spanish I gradually picked up. I taught myself to read Spanish and went through old and new cookbooks. My greatest mentor was Alicia Ríos, a food writer and historian and an olive oil expert, and when I stayed in her studio in Madrid, I had access to her huge library and archive of cookbooks.</p>
<p class="para">The recipes in this book represent traditional home cooking from all the regions as it is cooked today. My aim was to feature the best dishes I could find, the most interesting and delicious, those I loved best and that I thought everyone would enjoy cooking and eating. Sometimes a dish was good, but the effort to make it was too big. I had a rule—because most of us are short on time—that there should be a balance between the effort of making a dish and the pleasure of eating it. This was the case for Catalan <span class="italic">canelones,</span> which I made when my granddaughters stayed the night, and they watched me prepare them. The stuffing is complex and intriguing, with many ingredients, and the process of filling the pasta, then making the sauce and baking the dish, is long and finicky. I had told them of my rule and that if a dish were really fantastic, it should go in the book no matter how difficult or time consuming it was to make. We all liked the <span class="italic">canelones,</span> but we agreed that, considering the time it took to make them, we did not love them enough to give the dish a place in the book. There are dishes that you will not find in this book. For instance, I have only a few using salt cod, although there are dozens throughout Spain, because it is hard to find it in America and it is not part of our culture in the way that it is there. I do not feature many recipes with pigs’ ears, feet, and offal for the same reason.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p021.png" class="calibre8"/></p>
<p class="para">Most Spanish dishes were born in a rural world where there were no modern ovens or kitchen gadgets, when people worked hard and needed warming fatty foods that would give them energy for arduous toil in the fields. Things have changed so much. Peasant life as it was has disappeared. Now the work is done by immigrant workers. People have every kitchen gadget. They want to make things easier and are concerned with healthy eating, dishes that are quicker and lighter, with less fat and less frying. In many parts of the country where they once cooked exclusively with pork fat, they now mostly use olive oil (that is why I allowed myself to use olive oil rather than pork fat throughout the book). Fish and seafood are cooked much more quickly. Where people once preferred long-cooked vegetables, they may now prepare them slightly al dente. And they do not now always dredge everything in flour before frying it, as they once did.</p>
<p class="para">But although traditional Spanish cooking has evolved, it has not lost its character and identity. As with poetry and music, cuisines have rhymes and tunes and recurrent themes that characterize them. Spain’s signature tune is the <span class="italic">sofrito,</span> of fried onion and tomato, to which garlic and green peppers are often added. Among its other themes are the bits of chopped cured ham that find their way into most dishes; the chorizo and blood sausage that are featured together in bean and chickpea stews; and the wine or sherry and brandy that go together in sauces. A <span class="italic">picada</span> of nuts crushed with garlic and fried bread tells you that a dish is Catalan. The gentle flavor of saffron tells you that you are on the Mediterranean coast or perhaps in the south. <span class="italic">Pimentón</span> or the faint aroma of lemon zest and cinnamon tells you that a dish is Spanish.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p022.png" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="para">Part of the appeal of traditional dishes is that they hold memories of the past. The Catalan chef Santi Santamaria wrote, “We are products of our history,” and that the reference points of his cooking were the memories of his grandparents’ generation and medieval Catalan cookbooks. In Spain, the past is always an intimate part of the present. I have found that history is a sensitive subject that arouses passions whenever I say that I am researching the history of Spain through its food. You can imagine that past against the background of Roman aqueducts, Moorish and Romanesque palaces, and medieval villages. At festivals, the taste for the spectacular and the macabre that Spain has kept from the Middle Ages is on show. During Semana Santa (Easter Week), when statues of the Virgin dressed in fine clothes are paraded through the streets, the men leading the processions are in the tall pointed hoods and robes worn by penitents during the public sentencing at the courts of the Inquisition (these were later adopted by the Ku Klux Klan). The popular festival of Moros y Cristianos is a costumed reenactment of the battles of the Reconquista.</p>
<p class="para">Many old monasteries, castles, and palaces have been restored and transformed into state-run luxury hotels, called <span class="italic">paradores</span>. Their menus offer regional and “historic” dishes. A little booklet produced in 1998 to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the first <span class="italic">paradores</span> explains that Spanish gastronomy is as varied as its history and gives recipes to illustrate the influences going back to Roman times. The stories behind what you eat in Spain are like pieces of a puzzle. Working on this book was for me a delicious and exciting way of finding all the fragments and putting them together to discover Spain.</p>
<p class="para">At home in London, as I roast my red peppers and eggplants and sprinkle them with olive oil, as I caramelize onions or fry almonds with garlic and bread, wonderful aromas fill my house, and I remember the mountains and the olive groves, the old churches and convents. I miss the conviviality that Spaniards are so good at, but I re-create it with the friends who come to taste the dishes I have discovered. They are used to me calling to invite them just a day before. I tell them what is on the menu. When it was pigs’ feet and ears, one or two said, “I’ll pass on that.” Over the past few years I have invited many friends and visitors from abroad to these tasting dinners. That too has been part of the pleasure of writing the book.</p>
