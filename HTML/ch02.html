<p class="h2title">July, or <span class="scalasans">Achievement</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">“J</span>am,” Mateu says. “I need you to make jam.”</p>
<p class="indent">Katie Button nods enthusiastically, envisioning a morning spent stirring pots of fragrant berries on the stove top. It is several days into the season, and finally, she thinks, she will get to do the kind of cooking she likes. Tall and coltish, with long, honey blond hair that she tames with bobby pins while she’s working, Katie is the least experienced professional in elBulli’s pastry kitchen and, except for the kids who are still in culinary school, the least experienced stagiaire in the entire restaurant. But jam is something she knows how to make. Since she was a child, her mother has run a catering business, and the twenty-six-year-old spent much of her adolescence and young adulthood helping her mom prepare sauces and roll out doughs. It was simple but delicious food, made with care and the freshest ingredients, and it’s what Katie loves best.</p>
<p class="indent">Mateu explains that he’s going to teach her to make the jam that pools under the dessert called Ices. The first step, as always, is to gather the ingredients. Katie nods appreciatively and begins to head to the walk-in where produce is stored when Mateu stops her.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"/>“Go to the <span class="txit">almacén</span> and get two canisters of lyo-<span class="txit">melocotón</span> and one of lyo-<span class="txit">fresa</span>.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Almacén?”</span> Katie asks. The word has not yet come up in the textbook she is using to teach herself Spanish.</p>
<p class="indent">Mateu points in the general direction of the storeroom. “Okay?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Okay!” she responds, momentarily forgetting in her enthusiasm to use <span class="txit">oído</span>. The “lyo” part she has learned; the word is short for <span class="txit">liofilizado,</span> elBulli-speak for “freeze-dried.” But she is still processing all the words in the sentence. <span class="txit">“Melocotón?”</span></p>
<p class="indent">Mateu cups his hands together in the shape of a medium-sized round fruit, realizes the futility of that, and points to his eye. “Just read the label.”</p>
<p class="indent">Katie disappears and comes back with two canisters of freeze-dried peaches and one of strawberries. Mateu is waiting for her. “Now get a <span class="txit">báscula</span>.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Báscula?”</span></p>
<p class="indent">Remarkably, Mateu never loses patience. He grabs a scale and shows her the proper ratio of strawberries to peaches. Katie carefully jots down the proportions in her notebook, then weighs them out herself, checking repeatedly to make sure she has them right. As she empties the canisters, she remembers to put the lids inside them, just as she has been taught. She goes to get a bowl, smells it, wipes its interior, and pours the freeze-dried fruit into it. Only now she realizes she’s missing something. She goes back to the dish station, fetches another bowl, smells it, wipes its interior, and finally pours a small dose of amaretto into it. She weighs the container with the liqueur in it, removes it from the scale, and is about to add it to the fruit when she stops herself: <span class="txit">Was that right?</span> Back on the scale the amaretto goes. She weighs it again and this time pours off a little. Satisfied, she finally adds it to the fruit, reconstituting it. It has taken her a lot of time and multiple trips to the dish station, but at last she has it: jam.</p>
<p class="indent">Mateu comes by to check the results. “<span class="txit">Muy bien,</span> Katie,” he says encouragingly. She beams.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">By early July, the stagiaires’ nerves have calmed, leaving in their place a ravenous desire for information. Most of them don’t have college degrees—“I wasn’t very good in school” is a common refrain—and what they want to study, they want to study in a kitchen. Now that their more pressing worries have been resolved (<span class="txit">Will we get through service? Are we as good as last year’s crop of stagiaires? Am</span> I <span class="txit">as good? Will I ever learn my way around a fucking sea anemone?),</span> they have an almost palpable hunger for more: more techniques, more access to Ferran, more challenging tasks, more tricks, more knowledge. The stagiaires have learned all the mise en place required for the opening menu and have more or less mastered the tasks that, only two weeks ago, befuddled many of them. Everyone is an expert at shucking oysters; they all know their way around a rabbit ear. In fact, they’ve become so skilled at their jobs that most no longer have to come in at noon to ensure they have enough time to finish their prep; morning meeting now starts at 2 <small>P.M.</small> or, on very good days, 2:30. Iosu and Miguel Alexander still have to arrive early to start their yubas, but even they have picked up speed and usually finish the day’s milk <a id="page_58"/>skins by 4 <small>P.M.</small> or so. Eduard and Eugeni are still on top of people, still correcting—Gaël for forgetting to put a cloth under his cutting board one day, Sergi for still mauling the sea anemones. (“That’s really ugly,” Eduard says in response to one particularly butchered specimen. “Do you not get that this is a minimalist dish?”) Oriol still has to remind people about the proper method of hand washing. And according to Ferran, the kitchen is still too noisy during service; people are putting plates down too hard, it should be completely silent except for the orders being called and the <span class="txit">oído</span>s issued in response. But the criticism is a little less frequent, and some things, such as the setup for family meal—now perfectly timed—garner no criticism at all. Service is also smoother; most of the stagiaires have figured out a way to stake a claim to certain components of certain plates. If plating seems no less like a scrimmage, at least it is a scrimmage in which each cook knows the plays and his proper position. Outside work, the stagiaires have managed to relax a bit: they’ve had a few days off and time away from the kitchen to make friends (Roger and Laia—whose lanky hair is dyed a shade of reddish pink not generally seen outside the tropics—have even started dating). And everyone has learned his or her way around the town of Roses. Like generations of elBulli cooks before them, the stagiaires now stop for coffee and pastries in the morning at Sant Pau and gather for drinks after service at L’Hort. And with all of that out of the way, they have suddenly, startlingly, found themselves with time to think. As they stand at the center table, bent over the task at hand, it sometimes seems as if a collective thought balloon has opened over their heads: <span class="txit">What’s next?</span></p>
<p class="indent">Not everyone is thriving. In fact, three of the stagiaires have already left the restaurant. Pablo, suffering from health problems, didn’t want to leave, but one call from Marc to Pablo’s parents convinced them it might not be wise for their son to be on his feet for fourteen hours a day, and he went home. Cesare was a more protracted case. Despite his assignment to the coveted Cold Station, the Italian’s disenchantment with elBulli was evident in both the smirks with which he occasionally received direction and his attitude—an imperfectly spherified pesto square here, an unwiped plate there—toward work. Still, he gave no <a id="page_59"/>advance warning. At the morning meeting on the Tuesday after the first two days off, he simply wasn’t there. But even that departure wasn’t as shocking as Perfecto Rocher’s. Not only had the thirty-year-old applied for an elBulli <span class="txit">stage</span> four years in a row before finally getting in but his American girlfriend had moved to Barcelona for the season so that they could see each other during his days off. Although he had been assigned to the small kitchen, he seemed thoroughly content with the work and remained as enthusiastic as ever about the restaurant. When he left, he told Marc it was for financial reasons—a car payment had something to do with it—and hinted that his girlfriend had played a role in his decision. But the truth was that he had been offered a job opening Julian Serrano’s new restaurant in Las Vegas and his chef needed him right away. “I really loved being at elBulli,” he says. “Leaving like that left a bad taste in my mouth.” A few days later, two new stagiaires had taken Perfecto’s and Cesare’s places.</p>
<p class="indent">However particular the details, the departures were motivated by some common tensions. At the start of the season, both Perfecto and Cesare were excited to be at elBulli, thrilled to have the chance to learn from a restaurant each greatly admired. But in the world of professional cooking, learning requires you to subsume yourself and your ego in the undifferentiated mass that labors at the bottom of the kitchen hierarchy. “Humility,” Oriol Castro answers when asked what makes a good stagiaire, and it takes only a glance at the center table to see what he means: you have to be willing to be a cog in the machine and take your lessons where they come. In Cesare’s case, whatever he learned—and he did pick up new techniques, though not, he says, to the extent he had hoped—didn’t compensate for the ego-crushing drudgery of the work and the uncomfortable position of being on the bottom rung. Perfecto, on the other hand, succumbed to the other enemy of this kind of education: ambition. He might have spent many years longing to immerse himself in elBulli, but, given the opportunity to break away from the brigade and assume control of his own kitchen, he leapt at the chance.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the stagiaires feel some version of this tension. However much Ferran may refer to elBulli as a classroom, the education the <a id="page_60"/>restaurant offers differs significantly from that of a university or even a culinary school. The kitchen, after all, does not reward individualism; instead it requires a near-total submission to the brigade. The paradox for an aspiring cook is that the characteristics of a good apprentice (humility, an ability to swallow your ego) are antithetical to those that will one day make her a great chef (ambition, a strong sense of self). Thus all of the stagiaires face the same dilemma: How do they prove themselves apt, humble students while simultaneously standing out from the mass they are meant to meld into? With few options for resolving that conflict, most of them alight on the same tactic, which is not merely to comply with the rules but to surpass them. It’s not enough to show up on time each morning; many of them arrive thirty or forty-five minutes early, even if it means they will do nothing but change into their uniforms and sit outside on the bench. (Eventually so many will come so early that they will annoy Ferran, who likes having the quiet morning hours to think.) And instead of merely moving briskly in the kitchen, almost all of them move with the exaggerated speed and intensity of a novice firefighter gearing up for his first three-alarm call. Racing through the kitchen as if a trip to the dishwasher were a minor emergency, chopping garlic as if the global supply might dry up at any moment, they seem veritably <span class="txit">propelled</span> by their determination to demonstrate how hard they are working. The irony, of course, is that everyone else is moving with the same determined vigor and in the end, no one stands out at all.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Katie hadn’t always wanted to be a chef. For most of her life, she was drawn to science; like her father, she was enchanted by things like chemical reactions and the life cycle of insects. As a child growing up in South Carolina, she received a new chemistry set every year for Christmas, and although she was a strong all-around student, she excelled especially in science. By high school, she already mapped out her path: Ivy League college, graduate degree at a prestigious institution, then a career as a researcher at one of the country’s premiere laboratories. It almost all came true. After graduating from Cornell, she got her master’s degree <a id="page_61"/>at Paris’s École Centrale and was one of three students in the world to receive a joint doctoral fellowship in biomedical engineering from the National Institutes of Health in the United States and Sweden’s Karolinska Institute. At twenty-four, she was preparing to divide her time between Baltimore and Stockholm, where she would research apoptosis and the effects of aging on the brain. It was all in keeping with her pattern of striving: the best grades, the best schools, the best job. “Prestige, approval, they were always my thing,” she says now. “I could count on them.”</p>
<p class="indent">Scientist that she was, Katie didn’t count on a crisis of faith. But then, for a month during the summer of 2007, before she began her PhD program, she went to Zambia to build houses with Habitat for Humanity. There she found herself fulfilled by work that produced such clear and immediate results. She also met and became involved with a man who worked in humanitarian causes; suddenly a lifetime in the lab didn’t seem as appealing. “It helped put things into perspective. I didn’t care about money or prestige anymore. I wanted to become Mother Teresa, join the Peace Corps, spend my life in Africa,” she says. “But I was also very confused. I felt totally lost.”</p>
<p class="indent">She returned to the United States and spent the rest of the summer traveling as she tried to figure out what to do with her life. She didn’t feel prepared to go back to Africa, but she couldn’t shake the apprehension she felt whenever she thought about graduate school. As August ended, she moved to the Washington, D.C., area, where the NIH is located, but her sense of dread only grew. “It was going to take me seven years to finish my PhD, and I just wasn’t sure about it.” A few days before the semester began, she realized she wasn’t ready to make the commitment. In one of the darkest moments of her life, the girl who had always pushed herself to be the best decided to give up her fellowship. Guilt consumed her as she called her schools to inform them of her decision: she couldn’t forget that they had chosen her from among hundreds of applicants. But that was nothing compared to telling her parents. “I had always done everything right. I never rebelled,” she explains. “So when I did this, they really freaked out.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_62"/>Her father was especially disappointed by the decision. Ted Button had spent most of his life working as a pilot, but he had always longed to be a chemist. It was he who had nudged his daughter from an early age into science and bought her those Christmas chemistry sets. When Katie had begun college, he had started subscribing to <span class="txit">Nature,</span> the prestigious scientific journal, so that he could keep up with what she was learning. “He would read an article that interested him and then call me up to point it out to me,” says Katie. “When I came home, we would go into the living room, just the two of us, and have these ‘science talks.’”</p>
<p class="indent">Yet for all the guilt and confusion, Katie also felt immediately relieved by her decision. Now she just needed to come up with something else to do. Until that moment, her path had always been clear to her, and she had ticked off achieved objectives like items on a grocery list. It was a shock, then, to find herself, at age twenty-four, unemployed, living in a new place, and with absolutely no idea of what she wanted to do with her life. She took a job waiting tables at Café Atlántico in Washington, D.C., because it was a restaurant she had heard of, and now that she had surrendered her cushy fellowship, she needed the money. But underneath that immediate need lay another motivation, hidden and barely admitted, not even to herself. “I think I unconsciously picked serving because it was a way to be connected to food,” Katie says. “And food was the thing I had always loved.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">No period within elBulli’s transition to its new menu is more intense than the ten-day stretch that begins on July 7. Normally, the restaurant is open Tuesday through Saturday, with two days off each week. But once each month, the restaurant stays open for ten days in a row. On the first day of 2009’s first ten-day sequence, the stagiaires take their regular places around the edges of the kitchen for morning meeting, their arms crossed confidently across their chests, now that they no longer have to frantically write down everything said to them. Oriol and Eduard go through the usual list: the tasks imperfectly completed the day before, the plates sold for that night’s service. But just before they are about to <a id="page_63"/>break, Ferran issues a reminder both exciting and daunting: “<span class="txit">Señores,</span> remember: at the end of these ten days, we’ll have the new menu virtually in place.”</p>
<p class="indent">For diners—even those who have been there before—elBulli’s emphasis on constant reinvention means that each of the thirty-five or so courses they eat will be new to them. The restaurant maintains a database of its clients, so that when one makes a return visit, it can call up exactly what he or she ate during previous meals. Each day, Lluís García, the director of the front of the house and one of the most gracious professionals in the business, prints up a list of that night’s reservations. To the right of each name he types any aversions or allergies. (The number of the latter has grown exponentially in the last few years, and the chefs occasionally find themselves struggling to cater to diners who claim allergies to seemingly innocuous but omnipresent ingredients such as garlic or lemon. Offal—regardless of the animal it comes from—also threatens the health of a remarkably high number of diners.) In the same column, Lluís notes the date on which the client last dined at the restaurant; Eduard Xatruch will use that information to draw up the table’s menu for the night. If no one in a group has ever been to elBulli before, the table may get a dish or two from an earlier year—the spherified olives, for example, have made repeat appearances since their debut. But otherwise, every single bite a diner puts in her mouth will be new. At elBulli, there is no such thing as returning for a favorite dish.</p>
<p class="indent">For the stagiaires, the emphasis on reinvention means that no sooner have they mastered 2008’s menu than they must begin learning new dishes. It is true that some of the new season’s plates have been served from the very first night. Almost everyone, for example, is now getting Ansón’s pine nut ravioli, which means that two stagiaires now fold, fill, and seal two hundred triangles a day. The triangles are no longer called ravioli, however; after a brief, forgettable period as “Cold Fondue,” the dish now goes by the name Shabu Shabu, a play on the Japanese hot pot, in which slices of thinly sliced raw meat are dipped into boiling broth. The mojitos and caipirinhas made from infused sugarcane that went <a id="page_64"/>out to a lucky few on June 16 are also on nearly every menu, where they confound the waitstaff, who must come up with an acceptably polite way of explaining to diners how to consume them. (“‘Suck it’ just doesn’t sound right,” notes maître d’ Pol Perelló.) The stagiaires don’t like the <span class="txit">cañas</span>—as the cocktails are called—any better. It’s one of the axioms of elBulli’s cuisine that the dishes that seem simplest often demand the most taxing labor. In this case, the cocktail, which is little more than a few sticks of sugarcane steeped in rum, lime, and mint, requires a couple of people with handsaws to cut the tough cane into manageable pieces, two more with cleavers to pare away the bark, and anywhere from two to eight more cooks to trim the cane first into flat planks and then into precisely measured sticks. The task provides Eugeni with entirely new sources of criticism: the people doing the sawing often forget to wear the protective chain glove he requires, and those doing the cutting often fail to get the sticks exactly seven centimeters long. It drives Sunny, the South Korea–born stagiaire from Minnesota, crazy, too: he hates what he perceives as the laziness of those who can’t be bothered to measure the sugarcane sticks, the waste produced by the parers who don’t take care to remove as little flesh as possible along with the bark, and the inefficiency of the saw-and-glove combination. It would be much faster, he thinks, to simply hack the cane into pieces with a chef’s knife. “Sometimes I want to say to him, ‘Eugeni, let me do all the <span class="txit">cañas</span> by myself,’” Sunny confesses. “I’d get them done faster.”</p>
<p class="indent">On July 7, the first of the ten-day stretch, 38 of an eventual 120 or so dishes have been made final; by July 16, that number will have risen to nearly 80. The kitchen struggles to keep up. One day the <span class="txit">mesa central</span> has replaced its oysters with cockles; the next it suddenly has to learn to clean the kidneys of baby goats. One morning, about halfway through the week-and-a-half-long period, Eduard brings out the by now familiar tray of rabbit heads, only this time the skulls are still attached to the shoulders. He picks up a truncated carcass, pries apart the rabbit’s mouth, and uses a pair of tweezers to pull out its tongue. From now on, the stagiaires will be pulling rabbit tongues; the size of a sage leaf, they will be deep-fried and set next to the fried brain on the rabbit-ear canapé.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_65"/>Perhaps the most labor-intensive new dish the stagiaires must master is the rose. Sometime during the course of the previous year, Ferran got the idea that he wanted to make a dish using rose petals. The trick was finding ones that were edible; many varieties, he discovered, have an unfortunate effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, Eduard, who is also in charge of sourcing, located digestible, organic roses in Ecuador and arranged for their shipment. They arrived in thick bundles, their long stems topped with fat white buds. In his earliest tests, Oriol began by plucking the petals and laying them out on a plate with a drizzle of oil: a take on carpaccio, the Italian dish composed of thin slices of raw, dressed beef. It wasn’t right: the flowers were too bitter. He tried cooking them briefly in boiling water, and, although an imperfect method, it provided the spark that would allow the dish eventually to come together. Oriol lay the boiled petals on the plate, then dressed them with lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Ferran tasted a petal and smiled. “Tell me that doesn’t taste like artichoke,” he said.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="435" src="../images/f0065-01.jpg" width="333"/></p>
<p class="caption">To plate the artichoke rose, a stagiaire places cooked petals in concentric circles, forming a flower. (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_66"/>Thus the artichoke rose was born. Over the next few weeks, the dish is honed. The chefs learn that they need to cook the petals three times, blanching them in ice water in between scaldings, to rid them of bitterness. They also learn that a final pass through a pressure cooker gives the petals a more pleasing texture. Eventually the finished plate will be drizzled with both artichoke and rose oils, to play up the flavors of both references the dish makes. But the essentials remain the same: the petals are laid in concentric circles so that, to the unsuspecting diner (over the course of the season, the dish stumps several visiting chefs, including David Chang and Juan Mari Arzak), the plate looks like a rose made from thinly sliced artichoke leaves. In fact, however, it is a rose made from roses made to look like artichoke leaves. Ferran is thrilled with it. Watching an early iteration go out one night, he nods his head knowingly. “This is going to be an incredible year,” he says.</p>
<p class="indent">What is less incredible, at least from the stagiaires’ point of view, is the work involved in making the artichoke rose. First the flowers have to be removed from their stems and the petals individually separated. Early on, Emma is assigned the task of cooking them; she spends a couple of hours each day over pots of boiling water, lowering the fragile petals in and out. “It’s incredibly boring,” she comments wryly, her face damp from the steam. “But my skin has never looked better.” Once the petals are in their final ice bath, the tubs are brought over to the center table, where the stagiaires reach into the frigid water, lift out the petals one by one, uncurl them, and press them flat (“Remember! No wrinkles!” commands Eugeni) on a slotted sheet to dry. Or almost flat: the petals actually have to be laid with their bases lifted up a tiny bit to form a raised point; the effect is important for the final plating. And that plating, which usually begins right after the dishes have been wiped down following family meal, requires another sixty minutes or so of work. For the first part of service, while most of the dishes are coming out of Pastry or Cold Station, eight or ten stagiaires on the center table carefully lift a petal from its draining rack, unfurl it once again, press all but its tip to the plate, and gradually form one circle, then another inside it, and a third inside that. A single rose can take a stagiaire as long as ten minutes to compose.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_67"/>When Katie was eighteen, her mother briefly gave up her catering business. “I was really mad at her,” she recalls one night after work, her long hair pulled into a ponytail, her chef’s jacket replaced with a blue hoodie. “Finally I was going to have the time during the summer to work for her, and she just gave it up, without asking me.” When it came to food, there were some things that Katie and her mom didn’t talk about. As a teenager, Katie always preferred <span class="txit">Gourmet</span> to the fashion magazines that her friends read. She would make both her parents birthday cakes each year—German chocolate cake for her mom; Boston cream for her dad—and Thanksgiving, with all its cooking, was always her favorite holiday. But despite her mother’s example, no one mentioned cooking as a possible career. Katie was happiest in the kitchen, yet throughout her childhood and adolescence and even young adulthood, she thought of it as a refuge from real life, not life itself.</p>
<p class="indent">But what a refuge it was. The year she lived in Paris was one of the most memorable of her life, and not because of the work she was doing at the École Centrale. She might have spent her days conducting research, but like Julia Child and generations of enamored Americans before her, what truly excited Katie was the food—the cheese shops, produce markets, charcuteries, bakeries, and restaurants, all offering seductive enticements. It was so inspiring that one day she bought a cookbook, determined to teach herself to make puff pastry, the ethereal dough that, through nothing more than a skillful layering of butter and flour, rises spectacularly to several times its uncooked height. “The only problem is that I lived in a horrible studio apartment with literally no counter space,” she recalls. “And you need a counter to make puff pastry.” She went out and bought herself a roll of duct tape and a large bottle of bleach. “I scrubbed the floor ten times with the bleach and then marked off a square with the tape,” she says. “And that became the counter for my puff pastry. I made my first puff pastry on the floor.”</p>
<p class="indent">A short while later, she made it again. By then she had moved into her boyfriend’s apartment on rue Mouffetard and had fallen in love <a id="page_68"/>with the famous open-air market there. She bought a sea bream from the fishmonger and had him clean and fillet it for her (“I wasn’t quite ready to do that myself,” she admits). Then she took it home, stuffed the fish with julienned vegetables, and wrapped it in the puff pastry she could now prepare on a proper countertop. She fashioned the pastry so that it looked like a fish, scoring the tail and adding little fins: a classic preparation. When it came out of the oven, she had never been more proud of herself. “It tasted bland as hell,” she says. “But it looked <span class="txit">gorgeous</span>.”</p>
<p class="indent">That year for Christmas, there were no chemistry sets. Her mother bought her Child’s <span class="txit">Mastering the Art of French Cooking,</span> and her new sister-in-law (one of her half brothers had married) gave her <span class="txit">The Cordon Bleu Cookbook.</span> “I see now that that’s where my true interests were,” Katie says. “It just took a while for my professional ambitions to catch up.”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Restaurants go through their own learning processes, one that forces them to ask the same question that the stagiaires ask themselves: In an ever more crowded field, how do we stand out? It is almost impossible to believe now, when elBulli is the most innovative, unusual restaurant in the world, but in the beginning, the only thing that distinguished it was its location. When Hans and Marketta Schilling bought a piece of land in 1961 on the sparkling, isolated Cala Montjoi, they had no greater ambition than to find a way to stay in the coastal paradise they had just discovered. Which is why, logically enough, the German couple opened a mini–golf course. Being in Spain, they quickly realized that they couldn’t offer a form of recreation without simultaneously offering a place to have a drink and perhaps a snack. Thus to the artificial green of their new golf course they added a covered beachside bar—what Spaniards call a <span class="txit">chiringuito</span>—where they served beer and sandwiches. Over time, the golf side of the equation diminished (it was never exactly a moneymaker) and the service aspect increased, until finally the Schillings decided to transform their chiringuito into a proper restaurant. Centered around a fireplace that still stands today, the restaurant (which, in a nod to <a id="page_69"/>Marketta’s beloved bulldogs—called <span class="txit">bulli</span> in French slang—became first Bulli Bar and later Restaurante El Bulli) in the mid-1960s specialized in simple grilled meats and fish. Gradually, though, it grew more ambitious, thanks in part to Hans’s travels and his love of fine dining. A pair of German cooks improved the offerings until, in 1975, Hans and Marketta hired Jean-Louis Neichel, a Strasbourg-born chef who had worked in several of France’s most important restaurants. Neichel pulled El Bulli’s menu toward France, and despite the fact that it was located at the end of a seven-kilometer unpaved path and had no phone line (customers requested reservations through the mail), the restaurant earned its first Michelin star the following year.</p>
<p class="indent">Neichel stayed until 1980, the same year that Juli Soler, then a young, unproven restaurateur with a marked penchant for rock and roll (thirty years later, he remains just as enamored: when David Gilmour, the lead guitarist and singer for Pink Floyd, requested a last-minute reservation, Juli fit him in, then excitedly conducted his predinner kitchen tour himself), became El Bulli’s general manager. Within a short period, he had promoted one of the cooks, Jean-Paul Vinay, to chef. Vinay was from Lyon, and his cooking bore the clear stamp of the nouvelle cuisine that is his hometown’s hallmark. He took advantage of the excellent local products to improve El Bulli’s offerings, but his dishes were hardly innovative; his New Year’s Eve menu for 1983 started with duck liver in aspic and culminated in a lamb saddle <span class="txit">en crépinette</span>—wrapped in pig caul. Lobster consommé, sole ballottine, stuffed rabbit with a leek gratin: these were the components of El Bulli’s regular menu. Yet they were well executed enough to earn Vinay the restaurant’s second star. It might not have had a particularly exciting menu, but by the time Ferran Adrià, age twenty-one, arrived in 1983 for his own month-long <span class="txit">stage,</span> the restaurant was already ambitious.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">At Café Atlántico, Katie discovered she was good at serving. One of several Washington, D.C., locales owned by José Andrés, the restaurant is considered one of the city’s best. It’s a fun, high-energy place that <a id="page_70"/>specializes in updated Caribbean cuisine but includes within its core a separate space, called minibar, that serves unusually inventive tapas—a cotton candy foie gras, a beet “tumbleweed”—that wouldn’t be out of place at elBulli itself. To get the job, Katie had to pass a written exam. “There were parts on wine and service that I just did so-so on,” she recalls. “But I <span class="txit">aced</span> the food part. The manager couldn’t believe it: ‘You know what chanterelles are? You know what a gastrique is?’ I hadn’t had any formal training, but I knew about food.”</p>
<p class="indent">The transition from prestigious research scientist to waitress still had the power to embarrass her when she was forced to admit it to people who had known her in the past. Yet Katie couldn’t deny that she got pleasure from her new job. “I liked talking to people about food,” she says. “When you give them good service, they really appreciate it.” Another factor, however, made the restaurant a good place for her: about one month after she started, three staff members from elBulli, which had just closed for the 2007 season, came to help out at Café Atlántico. Two of them, Aitor Zabala and Luis Arrufat, were chefs, but one, Felix Meana, took over as a manager in the front of the house. Within a month, he and Katie were dating, and not long after that, he encouraged her to apply for a serving <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli so that they could stay together when he returned to Roses.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Adrià’s restaurant maintains a full-time front-of-house staff made up of eight people, it also brings in another eight or so servers each season to help with the intensive labor of getting diners their food and otherwise making the elBulli experience exceptional. Like the kitchen stagiaires, front-of-house interns aren’t paid, and most of them come straight from their studies in hospitality schools: they may be working for free, but at least they’re getting course credit. Katie was out of school and had no use for credit. But she didn’t have any other plans either, and six months in Spain seemed as good an opportunity as any. At the very least, she reasoned, she’d emerge better at her job. Or maybe she chose it because she hadn’t completely broken her aspirational habits: instead of taking advantage of the best fellowship at the best school, she would work at the best restaurant. In any case, she got José Andrés to write her <a id="page_71"/>a letter of recommendation, and a few weeks later, she received word that she had been accepted into elBulli’s 2008 season. It was a decision that would change her life, in more ways than she imagined.</p>
<p class="indent">Serving at elBulli was a totally different experience from serving at Café Atlántico. For one thing, there were no menus; the diners ate what the kitchen decided they would eat. The lack of choice made the work of waiting tables considerably easier in some ways: no one ever depended on her for a recommendation, nor did a diner angrily send a plate back when it didn’t live up to his expectations. At elBulli, her job was mainly to control the timing with which each new course appeared, to run the dishes out to the tables, and, depending on the dish, to apply a last-minute garnish. She was also responsible, at least with the English-speaking tables, for explaining how a dish was to be eaten, a task that, at elBulli, is not always as straightforward as it sounds. The best part about the job was that she got to facilitate what for most diners was a unique and thrilling experience. It was not unusual to look around the dining room at elBulli and see people laughing out loud at the morsel they had just put into their mouth, and Katie—like much of the restaurant’s waitstaff—considered it a privilege to be part of such a remarkable, consuming experience. It didn’t hurt that she rarely had to deal with bad customers; the boorish behavior and annoyed complaints that are the lot of most waiters throughout the world, regardless of the quality of the restaurant, are practically nonexistent at elBulli. The only customers Katie didn’t like, in fact, were the ones who were indifferent to the experience. “Occasionally you’d get a two-top where you could tell the man was really into food and really excited to be there,” she recalls. “But his date didn’t know anything about the place and was freaked out by having to eat so much.”</p>
<p class="indent">Katie, meanwhile, was feeling the opposite of indifference. Night after night, as she would set down, say, a Styrofoam ice cream container and then explain to the delighted table that they were to sprinkle the packet of rose-colored muesli on the frozen Parmesan air inside, she found herself increasingly moved by the power of food to amaze, enchant, and provoke. Gradually a plan formed in her mind. Maybe, she <a id="page_72"/>thought, she could make this a permanent part of her life. And maybe she didn’t have to limit herself to serving the food—maybe she could actually <span class="txit">make</span> the dishes that so delighted people. She would have to start over again, of course, in order to learn to cook professionally, but at least she would be learning about the thing she most enjoyed in the world. And maybe it wouldn’t mean going back for more schooling, which she wanted to avoid. Maybe she could learn on the job. And not just any job. Maybe she could learn at elBulli itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that Katie—female, smart, highly educated, overachieving—would consider a career in the kitchen is indicative of just how much the profession has changed. Although there have been a handful of celebrity chefs for at least as long as there have been restaurants—and even earlier, if you count the reputation of some of the men who cooked in aristocratic houses—the work itself has long been seen as menial, almost servile. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were attempts in France to raise the status of the chef to that of artisan or even professional, but as late as the 1960s, Jacques Pépin could see they had not amounted to much. As he considered whether to take a job as White House chef for the Kennedys or as head experimental chef for the chain Howard Johnson’s, he was guided by a clear vision of what cooking meant. “My training as a chef had taught me that being a chef—no matter where,” he later wrote, “was a blue-collar job. Period.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was, in other words, a job that someone like Katie or, for that matter, Mario Batali, Dan Barber, Daniel Patterson—all of them the products of upper-middle-class parents who sent their kids to college—would never have considered had they been planning their futures in the 1960s. It would take another twenty or thirty years before cooking became an acceptable, even admirable, profession in the public eye. Of all the aspects of the food revolution, this may be the most dramatic: by endowing restaurant cooking with respect, prestige, and a measure of glamour, it has drastically broadened and improved the pool of people willing to take on the labor. “Thirty years ago, most people who worked in restaurant kitchens had either just gotten out of the army or were on their way to jail,” says Batali. “Now you get all these people who went to <a id="page_73"/>college, then found their passion in cooking. The level is suddenly much higher because the people cooking are a lot smarter.”</p>
<p class="indent">Katie, certainly, was smart about how she went about entering the field. To meet her desire for public approbation, she would train in the best restaurant in the world. And to satisfy her scientific frame of mind, she decided, she would focus on pastry. More exacting and less intuitive than savory cooking, pastry met her need for precision; the pleasure she imagined it would give her reminded her of the delight she found in the elegant equations she had studied in college. “I like to follow a recipe,” she admitted. “I know there are people who say, ‘Oh, if you use recipes it shows you don’t really know how to cook.’ But a recipe gives you consistency. You always know what the finished product will be like.”</p>
<p class="indent">So it would be a career in pastry, and it would begin at elBulli. Now she just had to convince Albert Adrià, Ferran’s younger brother and the head of both the restaurant’s pastry division and its laboratory in Barcelona, to take her on. It wasn’t easy: of all the stations at elBulli, Pastry demands the most experience, both because its products are the restaurant’s most delicate and because the team is small and works independently of the rest of the kitchen. The stagiaires accepted into Pastry always came with professional experience—often a great deal of it. Katie had no professional experience at all, which is why Albert politely but firmly put her off for months. But one night toward the end of the 2008 season, she went to run a plate of <span class="txit">nenúfares,</span> then stopped, realizing something was wrong. A complicated pre-dessert made up of a dozen or so elements floating in a small pond of herbal tea, the dish—whose name translates as “water lilies”—was missing the tiny streak of minuscule amaranth grains that formed one of the many garnishes. Katie took it back to the pass and, in the process, changed Albert’s mind. “So we know you’re paying attention,” he said approvingly. “If you go back home and learn something about pastry, we’ll take you. You’re in.”</p>
<p class="indent">Katie returned to the United States and, as she had promised, took a <span class="txit">stage</span> that would teach her the basics of pastry. In fact, she found work with Johnny Iuzzini, then one of the country’s hottest pastry chefs, at Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s flagship restaurant, one of only five <a id="page_74"/>restaurants in New York at the time judged worthy of four stars by <span class="txit">The New York Times</span>. She stayed there for six months, then took a paid job as a line cook at the splashy new restaurant that her former boss José Andrés was opening in Los Angeles. Felix was waiting for her there; he was The Bazaar’s new general manager. She would spend the next four and a half months running garde-manger at what turned out to be one of L.A.’s most exciting restaurants—another feather in her cap. In its first year, The Bazaar, would earn four stars from the <span class="txit">Los Angeles Times,</span> the paper’s highest ranking. At last, she thought, she was ready for elBulli.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Among the many things that distinguish a professional from a home cook is this: a professional coughs into his elbow. Not his cupped hand—that tends to be occupied—and not, of course, into the open air, where food is almost always exposed. Instead, he raises his elbow to shoulder level, like a wing, turns his head into it, and coughs there. The experienced stagiaires at elBulli arrive at the restaurant knowing this, but the young ones, those still in culinary school, have to pick it up. You can watch them learning these little things, hungrily acquiring the actions and phrases that will identify them—if only to one another—as cooks. Knife skills and a well-developed palate may be critical for the professional, but the true culture of the kitchen lies in subtle signs and rules that have little to do with food itself. Your apron is tied low, for example, right above your hips; tie it around your waist, and you’ll invariably be informed that you look like a grandmother. You register no sign of pain when you stick your hands into boiling liquid or flip a piece of seared meat in a smoking pan. When dining out, at least in restaurants with obvious ambition or skill, you smell your food before you eat it, sticking your face myopically close to the plate and inhaling deeply, as if the meat or fish before you were a fine wine.</p>
<p class="indent">Once Ferran had to learn these things, as well. When he took his first restaurant job at age eighteen, at a seaside hotel south of Barcelona, he had no experience or particular interest in cooking. Like most young Spanish men at the time (and, let’s be honest, most today), he ate what <a id="page_75"/>his mother cooked for the family’s meals—which meant, since he still lived at home, that he likely had never even fried an egg for himself. But when he dropped out of school and needed to earn money for a planned vacation in Ibiza, his father got him a job in the kitchen of an old friend, Miquel Moy. Ferran spent a few months as a dishwasher, but gradually, with the chef’s encouragement, began picking up cooking skills. It was Moy, in fact, who made the fateful decision to give Ferran a copy of a nearly century-old cookbook called <span class="txit">El Práctico,</span> written by two Argentines, that covers with almost encyclopedic comprehensiveness the classic recipes of several cuisines. Ferran, who has startlingly good recall and whose mind has always tended toward the encyclopedic, started memorizing.</p>
<p class="indent">As he studied, he spent the next two years moving from one Catalan restaurant to another. None of the food Ferran cooked in these places was exceptional, but the training, along with what he read, gave him enough knowledge and skill that, when he was drafted into the navy in 1982 (the dictator Franco may have been dead, but military service in Spain remained compulsory until 2001), he quickly won a position as a cook in the admiral’s kitchen. There he met Fermi Puig, a fellow Catalan, who the year before had begun working in a small French restaurant on the Catalan coast called El Bulli. Fermi urged Ferran—who at the time still went by the Spanish version of his name, Fernando—to take a <span class="txit">stage</span> there during his summer leave. A few months later, both he and Fermi were discharged from the military, and by the spring of 1984, the two friends had taken full-time positions at El Bulli as chefs de partie—Ferran for meat, Fermi for fish. It would be Ferran’s first real immersion in the world of the classic French cuisine. It was not, however, his first brush with the kitchen’s subculture.</p>
<p class="indent">In his hugely popular <span class="txit">Kitchen Confidential,</span> the New York chef Anthony Bourdain exposed what he called “the underbelly” of professional cooking. When the book came out, the restaurant-going public found both shocking and deeply, deeply alluring its stories of drug-fueled debauchery; of cooks getting revenge on annoying customers by spitting (or worse) in their food; of practical jokes that centered around <a id="page_76"/>well-placed severed “fingers”; of chefs driven into violent rages by an improperly fried potato. Bourdain may not have been cooking haute cuisine, and he may have alienated some colleagues who had spent the better part of their careers trying to elevate the status of the chef, but he also shed light on the profound, almost mystical, respect for craft that motivates most of those who have succeeded in the field. The pages of his book are full of descriptions of people who “could stay up all night snorting coke and drinking Long Island iced teas, getting into trouble of the most lurid kind, and still show up the next morning and knock out a thousand meals.”</p>
<p class="indent">With that portrayal of the testosterone-fueled, joke-playing, waitress-shagging, trash-talking, coke-snorting world of the professional cook, Bourdain made the chef an almost irresistibly appealing, romanticized figure—a pirate, to use his own metaphor—dedicated in equal amounts to hard work and hard play. Without a doubt, the book helped draw legions of aspiring young chefs into the profession. But though Bourdain may have been the first (entire cadres of chefs have since written memoirs, and each one—even those who are women—seems intent on proving his or her bad-boy creds) to expose the excesses of the kitchen to a broad public, he was hardly the first to experience them.</p>
<p class="indent">In his autobiography, Marco Pierre White notes, for example, that when he wasn’t perfecting his cooking skills, he was so driven by his pursuit of casual sex that, by the time he opened Harvey’s in 1987, he had already earned the nickname “The Jagger of the Aga.” The genteel Jacques Pépin, in his memoir, recalls the hazing that new Parisian cooks were subjected to in the late 1940s: their chefs would send them from one restaurant to another with an order to retrieve a (mythical) chicken-deboning machine. In <span class="txit">Down and Out in Paris and London,</span> his classic tale of trying to get by in 1920s Europe, George Orwell too describes a uniquely aggressive environment, where fights among the staff were not only constant but necessary for maintaining the breakneck pace of service. “It was for this reason that during the rush hour the whole staff raged and cursed like demons,” he writes. “At those times, there was scarcely a verb in the hotel except <span class="txit">foutre</span>.” Traveling backward through <a id="page_77"/>history, past Escoffier and Marie-Antoine Carême, we might find M. Boulanger, the owner of the world’s purportedly first restaurant, hurling pots at the <span class="txit">commis,</span> cussing out the dishwasher, and getting thoroughly tanked after work.</p>
<p class="indent">Surely that aspect of the job helps explain some of Ferran’s initial attraction to the profession. After all, he took that first position in the kitchen at the Hotel Playafels only because he wanted to earn enough money to spend the summer partying in Ibiza. And once he started working at El Bulli, his dedication to having a good time didn’t stop. Stories about those first few years—when clients were few and the staff was sleeping in campers outside the restaurant—are legend. His biographer Colman Andrews describes Ferran as “crawling on the floor” the first time he went to a club with his future business partner Juli Soler and cites Fermi Puig’s depiction of the rather hectic schedule the cooks maintained: “We’d work until midnight or so—assuming we had customers—and then we’d all go to the discos in Roses to meet Swedish girls.” In those days, the staff, including Ferran, went out for drinks most nights after work, often returning home only an hour before it was time to hit the markets or be back in the kitchen. “Once we even got thrown out of the hotel we were staying at for an event,” he recalls with a chuckle. “Just like the Rolling Stones.”</p>
<p class="indent">As it helped attract new numbers to the profession with its tales of debauchery and devotion, Bourdain’s book also, ironically, endangered the very thing he described, the kitchen as pirate ship. As Francis Lam explains in an essay he wrote for <span class="txit">Salon</span> to commemorate <span class="txit">Kitchen Confidential</span>’s tenth anniversary, the book had the unexpected effect of making “civilians” want to delve even further into the chef mystique Bourdain describes. Henceforth they wanted to <span class="txit">know</span> their chefs and the fascinating extremes of their lives. In an effort to meet that desire—and no doubt flattered by the attention—chefs began to spend more time in the dining room talking with customers and transgressed the ancient frontier that is the swinging door by inviting favored diners into the kitchen. They also brought the kitchen to the diners, creating the open kitchens so popular in the first decade of the 2000s, which <a id="page_78"/>some Spanish critics, with their weird habit of naming trends in vaguely nonsensical English, call “showcooking.” That openness, in turn, led to greater professionalization (that is, fewer pirates) in the kitchen. “It turns out,” wrote Lam, “that no one wants to see dinner being made by a bunch of dudes snorting rails of coke.”</p>
<p class="indent">The highest-end restaurants may never have succumbed to the bad-boy culture that Bourdain describes—at least not during work hours. But elBulli’s evolution to a more serious, organized kitchen coincided with the growth in its own ambitions. By all accounts, Ferran stopped going out for nightly binges about the same time that he became sole chef de cuisine. And although others on the staff would maintain the tradition for years to come—longtimers still look on the late 1980s and early ’90s as a kind of golden age of elBulli hedonism—the kitchen gradually became increasingly serious. A lot of that had to do with the expanding staff: there’s a lot less room for flexibility in a kitchen of twenty-five people than there is in one of seven. As elBulli went after its third Michelin star, and later, as Ferran struggled to keep up with the flood of media attention and the ever-climbing expectations of his diners, the kitchen’s freewheeling, “hippie”—as some detractors called it—atmosphere gave way to an ever-more-regimented environment. Drinking on the job became a firing offense. More than one incident of lateness was grounds for firing. Even practical jokes were barred. Ferran might still be welcoming new stagiaires with the phrase “Maximum seriousness, in order to have a good time,” but it was clear that the weight now lay on the first part of the equation.</p>
<p class="indent">Today’s stagiaires cling to the barest remnants of that former age. They may still imbibe prodigiously but on “school nights” tend to limit themselves to a few quiet drinks at L’Hort after work—the clubs and all-night benders are confined to days off. They do smoke; even many of the stagiaires from the United States, where the practice is generally frowned upon, rush outside at the start of family meal, taking advantage of the time it takes for everyone else to line up for food, to suck down their first cigarette in five hours. Indeed, cooking is one of those last bastions where smokers far outnumber nonsmokers. And, like any <a id="page_79"/>battle-scarred veteran, they will in certain moments proudly compare burn and knife scars, each mark a sign of valor. But these days elBulli is much more like the regimented navy of Ferran’s training than any pirate ship. That may be a loss for the Bourdains of the world, but it has been a gain for Katie. Without that change, she would never have aspired to become a chef.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">When she showed up at elBulli on June 10, Katie was nervous, even though in many ways she was in a better position than other stagiaires. For one thing, her boyfriend, Felix, owned an apartment in Roses, which meant that, although she’d be living alone (Felix had stayed in Los Angeles), she wouldn’t have to live in the restaurant’s group housing. She would have a little privacy, a small break between her work life and her home life. She found a ready-made family in Felix’s mother and siblings, who invited her for meals on her days off and would drive her to Figueres when she needed to get her visa extended. She also already knew elBulli from her full season’s experience: how intense Ferran could be during service, how fast to move during the setup for family meal, how irritating all those <span class="txit">quemo</span>s could be. She even knew about the rocks.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet for all her knowledge, she didn’t have the background that got her new peers their positions in Pastry. Luca and César Bermúdez had years of experience between them; Mizuho had worked in some of the top restaurants in Paris. Even Daniel, who had worked Pastry only once before, had several years experience in some of the best kitchens in the United States. Before she started, she would tell herself that being in a position above her skill level wasn’t such a bad thing—it could force her to get up to speed more quickly. But once she was in the kitchen, even working with Mizuho on something as simple as hulling strawberries reminded her of the distance between herself and everyone else. “I’m watching her and thinking ‘Oh, man, how does she do that?’” Katie admits. “I wouldn’t call it competition, exactly, but it did make me wish I worked faster.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_80"/>Katie had one other thing going for her: her boss. Tall and lean, with dark hair and the high cheekbones of a cologne model, Mateu Casañas had joined elBulli as a stagiaire in 1997, the year after the restaurant had earned its third Michelin star. Just nineteen at the time, he’d had only six months’ culinary experience working in his family’s restaurant in Roses, a job he had taken when he dropped out of college that same year. One night he met Juli Soler at a bar, and the two men got to talking. Maybe it was the drinks, or maybe it was Juli’s disarmingly goofy demeanor, but Mateu found himself opening up a bit and confessing that he was at a loss about what to do next with his life; he thought he might want to cook, but he wasn’t sure. Juli invited him to come up to the restaurant and meet Ferran, which is how Mateu became a member of the select group that would spend their entire career with the restaurant. “I’m one of the ones who was born at elBulli,” he says, only half joking.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="494" src="../images/f0080-01.jpg" width="333"/></p>
<p class="caption">Mateu Casañas, chef de cuisine of Pastry (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_81"/>As a stagiaire and then a chef de partie, Mateu moved through all of the savory kitchen’s stations. He was about to become chef de cuisine when Ferran reminded him that the one place he didn’t have experience was with pastry; would he like to try? In the interest of well-roundedness, Mateu signed on in 1998 as pastry cook. By then Albert had been in charge of the section (a position he had held since joining elBulli in 1984, just one year after Ferran himself) for more than a decade, and under him elBulli’s sweets had become as provocative and exciting as anything turned out in the main kitchen. For the next decade, the two worked side by side. By 2008, Albert had both published a gorgeous coffee-table book called <span class="txit">Natura</span> and was running a wildly successful tapas bar, called Inopia, that he had opened a year earlier in Barcelona. All of which helps explain why that year was his last at elBulli. In 2009, Mateu was on his own for the first time.</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe it was innate talent, or maybe it was fatherhood—he has two young children—but somewhere along the line, Mateu learned to teach. He is always careful to explain what he is doing and always clear about his expectations of the six stagiaires who work under him. He knows that explaining <span class="txit">why</span> something is done a certain way is much more effective than simply telling someone <span class="txit">to</span> do it. Thus, each time he comes across first Katie, then Mizuho, then Daniel grating lemon with the Microplane and setting aside the zest, he offers the same gentle correction: if you do it directly into the bowl you’re working with, rather than letting it sit, you’ll capture more of the essential oils that impart flavor. He also has the crucial ability to tailor his lessons to his students’ needs. After working in several restaurants in France, Mizuho, for example, knows her way around a pastry kitchen, but she doesn’t know Spanish. Mateu has acquired a vast, expansive vocabulary of articulate gestures designed to communicate quantities and techniques for apprentices with little Spanish. For Daniel, who calms his anxieties about being caught unprepared by stockpiling extra supplies of Silpats and pastry brushes at his station, Mateu grants a kind of tolerance that he wouldn’t necessarily extend to the other cooks. With César, who is both the most experienced of Pastry’s stagiaires and the moodiest, Mateu has learned whenever <a id="page_82"/>possible to withhold his criticism, to grant a wide berth. With Katie, he knows to start at the beginning and take nothing for granted. And by beginning, he means absolute basics. “First thing every morning, before you even say hello,” he says to her on the first day, “I want you to come in, put down two cutting boards with towels underneath, and put out measuring cups.” In Mateu, Katie has found the perfect mentor.</p>
<p class="indent">Which is not to say that he isn’t critical. One day, Mateu taught Katie to enrobe croquants—the word normally refers to a hard candy made from sugar and nuts but at elBulli can refer to any (in this case honey) caramelized substance—in chocolate. It didn’t look difficult: put candy on fork, dip in chocolate, let drain. But Katie’s croquants came out misshapen and lumpy; worse still, she couldn’t figure out what she was doing wrong. Eventually, she realized that Mateu was tapping the dipping fork, hard, on the edge of the bowl to get rid of the excess. But by the time she fixed the problem, he had already come to a conclusion about her enrobing abilities. Trying to be nice, Mateu told her the job was probably too much for one person to handle; in the future, they would do the enrobing together. Katie’s shoulders slumped a little when he left. “Well, that was humiliating,” she said. Her croquants went into the trash.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Among the things one does not learn at elBulli are these: how to make a béchamel sauce; how to compose a salad; how to break down a pig or chicken or sea bass; how to make a velouté; how to clarify a stock; how to press a terrine; how to prepare a pâte au beurre or pâte sucré or pâte à choux. In other words, one learns none of the basics of classical French cooking. Of course, none of the stagiaires has come to elBulli for that kind of education; if they had wanted it, they would be <span class="txit">staging</span> with Georges Blanc in Vonnas, France, or at the Maison Pic in Valence. They would be <span class="txit">staging</span>, in other words, at the same places Ferran did.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran spent only a few weeks at each (he still has the 1985 letter from Georges Blanc that testifies that he has successfully completed a <span class="txit">stage</span> and is now “free from all obligations”). But between those brief stints, Ferran acquired close training in classical cuisine through his <a id="page_83"/>own avid reading and because, when he began working there, El Bulli was essentially a French restaurant (admittedly one that specialized in nouvelle cuisine, but still: French). One of that cuisine’s distinguishing characteristics is that it relies on a comprehensive taxonomy developed by Escoffier. There are five “mother” sauces that any chef must master; all others stem from that original quintuplet. Roasting builds on the cook’s knowledge of larding, perfect sole Florentine requires the ability to make a perfect fish fumet. Before he ever began to experiment, in other words, Ferran immersed himself in haute cuisine’s deep roots.</p>
<p class="indent">Does it matter that an elBulli stagiaire today does not necessarily have the benefit of that kind of training? Ferran himself seems of two minds, at times arguing that “You can’t make a great béchamel foam without knowing how to make a great béchamel” and at others questioning why the ability to make a great béchamel should be considered inherently more important than the ability to make a great spherified olive. As a group, the stagiaires themselves are similarly divided, with some convinced that there is no longer any need to study the classics (“Why should I?” asked Mike. “I know I’m never going to cook that way”) and others longing for a more comprehensive kind of training.</p>
<p class="indent">However revolutionary the cuisine at elBulli may be, it does not form a system. It is a philosophy, an approach to cooking that can be applied to a limitless variety of ingredients, but it is hardly a codified curriculum. Spherification does not build on an earlier recipe; its variations depend only on the kind of gellifier added, not on any progression of technique. The Pacojet is a tool that opens the door to any number of new textures, but you do not need to have first learned how to use a blender in order to operate it. Ferran has stated that one of his projects for the two years elBulli will be closed is to create a comprehensive encyclopedia of all the techniques developed, and maybe that will expose a kind of structure heretofore hidden. But in the meantime, there is a piecemeal quality to an elBulli education, a sense that what they learn or don’t learn is arbitrary, that leaves some of the stagiaires longing for something more authoritative.</p>
<p class="indent">Some, but not all. There is only one subject that unites all the <a id="page_84"/>stagiaires in complaint and that is tasting. One of the basic tenets of professional cooking is that you can’t learn what distinguishes an extraordinary dish from a merely good one without putting it in your mouth. It is a lesson drilled into a young cook’s head. At the Culinary Institute of America, new students are issued a supply of tasting spoons along with their toques and textbooks, and it’s a common joke that they will gain fifteen or so pounds their freshman year because they will be sampling so much. Jean-Georges Vongerichten famously keeps packets of plastic spoons at each station.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet at elBulli there is no tasting, at least not among the stagiaires. Ferran and Oriol routinely taste a complete dish as they are developing it; Eduard and Mateu often do so as well. The chefs de partie get that chance only when a mistake so grave is made during service that it prevents an entire plate from going out—in that case, the plate will be shuttled back behind the pass and quickly scarfed down by the spoonful. Otherwise, they are confined to tasting individual components—a spoonful of sauce here, a ball of spherified currant juice there—to check for proper seasoning. The stagiaires, however, don’t even get to do that. As Eugeni reminds them every time he catches a cook trying surreptitiously to pop a mandarin orange segment into her mouth, there is no eating on the line.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran defends the policy with an appeal to logistics: forty-five people in the kitchen, more than fifty dishes in circulation at any time. “Impossible,” he says, shaking his head. “Think of how much it would cost. Think of how much time it would take.” But for the stagiaires, it is one of the great disappointments of their time at elBulli. After all, it is almost impossible to deduce what, say, a rabbit brain with sea anemone tastes like if you have never tried either ingredient—let alone understand how they work in combination. Even a dish as simple as the <span class="txit">estanque</span> defies easy comprehension. Frozen water, mint powder, brown sugar—the stagiaires know what all those things taste like. But until you crack the surface with your spoon, crush the thin sheet of ice against your tongue, and feel your breath turn cold from the mint and your teeth crunch against the sugar crystals, it’s impossible to <a id="page_85"/>comprehend the dish, with its conjurings of ice skating on frozen lakes and Christmas Day. (Trying a bite of an <span class="txit">estanque</span> deemed too flawed—its surface wasn’t perfectly smooth—to go out one night, Nico put it this way: “It’s all in the crack.”) The stagiaires satisfy their curiosity by sneaking spoonfuls of porcini broth and discretely popping spherified lychees into their mouths, and occasionally using a detour to the freezer to beg for a chocolate or two from someone in Pastry. Luca even occasionally goes around collecting on one spoon all the elements that go into a finished dish, in the hope of getting a sense of how its flavors work in combination. The fact that they will never know the taste of the dishes they spend so much time crafting galls them. “How can you learn anything?” complains Gaël. “It’s like trying to play the violin wearing mittens.”</p>

<p class="noindent">What she lacks in skill, Katie makes up for in determination. She never complains and would never dream of showing up late, even if it means leaving behind the other stagiaires she regularly drives to work. Her jacket is always clean, her pocket always contains pen and notebook. She keeps lists of her tasks, so that when Mateu asks what she has to do after she has finished painting the liquid batter for the yogurt croquants over snowflake stencils, she can pull out the notebook and make sure she has the right answer. She tends not to go out much after work, preferring a good nine hours of sleep to the beers at L’Hort that other stagiaires favor. And before she gets into bed each night, she studies Spanish for half an hour. Katie, in other words, is the quintessential good girl.</p>
<p class="indent">A good girl with grit. Later in the season, when they know her better, the other stagiaires will tease Katie about her controlling impulses. But they won’t be telling her anything she doesn’t already know. Even at Jean-Georges—her first time working in a professional kitchen—she had a tendency to take charge. “Once we were trying to get out bonbons at an event,” she recalls, “and I was delegating tasks. Another intern got really mad at me. She started yelling at me, ‘Stop telling me what to do! You’re the same as me!’”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_86"/>There is chagrin in Katie’s voice as she recounts the tale, but a bit of steel as well: she knows that she isn’t the same as the other stagiaires. In her, many of the personality traits that distinguish a good apprentice are intensified. She likes organization and structure and never chafes against the hierarchy of the kitchen. “I think we work best when Mateu is telling us exactly what to do,” she says. “Otherwise we’re just running around with our heads cut off.” The most criticism she has ever lobbed at her superior was to admit, with a bit of a smile, that sometimes she doesn’t understand why Mateu makes them prepare quite so much ice cream ahead of time. She works hard, despite the fact that Pastry has the longest hours in the kitchen. And perhaps more than any other apprentice, Katie is driven by the sense that getting by is not enough. For all her desire for clear lines and properly defined roles, she feels an intense pressure to excel. She may be far from the laboratory, but she hasn’t lost the part of her personality that got her into the kitchen. Which is why just a few weeks into her <span class="txit">stage,</span> she decides that the fastest route to success is through elBulli’s own path to excellence: creativity. She decides to create her own dish, the bell jar.</p>
<p class="indent">From the beginning of the season, the chefs, including Ferran himself, have encouraged the stagiaires to think creatively. Oriol and Mateu have even suggested that, should one of the apprentices come up with a good idea for a new dish, the kitchen will try it out, to see if it might be worth developing. Katie takes them at their word and for nearly a week stays up late at night, sketching ideas, filling in ingredients. Finally, she is ready to present her dish. During one morning meeting, she raises her hand and asks to speak. Mateu tells her it’s a busy day and that she should wait for tomorrow; he repeats the same message the following day. After a few rounds of that, impatience gets the better of her, and one morning Katie simply starts blurting out her idea, describing it as quickly as she can so that no one has a chance to cut her off. She thrusts a sketch into Mateu’s hands and is rewarded with his interest. “Okay, Katie,” he says. “Let’s try it tonight.”</p>
<p class="indent">The inspiration for Katie’s dessert came from the potato-starch obulato. Pastry had been testing large sheets of it, drying them in a low <a id="page_87"/>oven so that they became crisp and fragile. But Katie wanted to drape the obulato before it hardened, so that it took the form of a transparent bell, which she would then place over a terrarium-like scene. She got the idea from the collection of bell jars her mother kept in New York; instead of plants, hers would top a dessert. Inside, would be a floating island, made from meringue, cast in a pool of cold elderflower soup, topped with goat cheese ice cream and perhaps some caramelized walnut powder. All the elements would conform to the same monochromatic scheme except for a single flower, made from chocolate, that would stand out on top. The “jar” would go over the entire concoction, waiting for the diner to crack it open with a spoon, shattering sweetened obulato pieces into the dessert below. Or at least that was the idea. When Katie finally gets to test the dish, the obulato doesn’t shatter so much as tear. Still, Mateu shows it to Oriol, and for a gratifying few minutes, the two hunch over the dish, discussing its potential. Too soon, however, Oriol raises his head and gently suggests that the dessert is a little too representational for elBulli; they like things more abstract. Katie nods her understanding, but she looks as though she’s been punched. It hadn’t really occurred to her that, after trying so hard, she could fail.</p>
<p class="indent">That very week, though, Mateu begins working on a new snack, called the pañuelo. He takes an immense obulato, the size of a coffee-table book, coats it in a dried corn caramel and bakes it, then; while it is still hot, lightly drapes it into rippling folds. When it dries, he serves it upright, like a massive, stiff curtain. Mateu tells Katie that her bell jar served as the inspiration for the pañuelo. It should have been pleasing news, but Katie doesn’t feel consoled. Instead, she worries that the chefs are condescending to her. “What, just because you shaped the obulato while hot?” she asks. “Otherwise, it has nothing to do with my bell jar.” For the rest of the season, as the kitchen keeps experimenting with the pañuelo, she blushes a bit every time someone makes reference to her contribution. (Her discomfort is made all the worse when she finally learns what <span class="txit">pañuelo</span> means: “handkerchief” or “tissue.” “And they coat it in something yellow?” she asks incredulously. She wants to suggest that perhaps the name is not the most felicitous, but by then, the dish <a id="page_88"/>has been going out for weeks. By the end of the season there will be a chocolate pañuelo as well.) But for the next five months, the bell jar incident gnaws at Katie. Maybe she just isn’t used to failure, or maybe she is frustrated that all her extra work—all that effort to make herself stand out—didn’t amount to more. Or maybe she’s aware of just how high the stakes are for her.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the stagiaires, Katie is one of the few who arrived at elBulli knowing exactly what she will be doing when the season ends. In January, she and Felix will move to North Carolina, along with Katie’s parents, and together they will open a restaurant. Katie will be executive chef, despite the fact that she’s never held any position higher than garde-manger. Two months into her <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli, she has proven that she can work hard, make smart choices, and push herself farther than almost anyone else. What she still doesn’t know, simply because hasn’t had the chance to find out, is whether she is any good at everything else that goes into the making of a decent chef: managing staff, watching costs, and, most important, creating new dishes. Katie takes the bell jar rejection hard because she worries that it foreshadows what’s to come. Are her skills strong enough? Is she creative enough? Is she even a good enough cook? One night after work, seated in Si Us Plau, the same bar where she and the other stagiaires began their first day, she confesses she isn’t sure. “I know that I’m not ready for this. Not old enough. Not experienced enough.” She pauses to take a sip of her beer before posing a question that Ferran could have asked himself as he took the helm of elBulli in 1987. “But if someone hands you the chance to live your dream when you’re twenty-six, are you really going to turn it down?”</p>
