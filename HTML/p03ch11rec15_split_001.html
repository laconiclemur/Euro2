<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">fideos en cazuela–catalonia</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This heartwarming pasta dish is from the Catalan interior. Small curved macaroni are cooked in an aromatic stock and the meats, sautéed separately, are added toward the end along with the marvelous nutty, fragrant thickener called</span> picada. <span class="italic">You will need a</span> cazuela <span class="italic">or a wide casserole.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 5 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 chicken thighs, cut into 1- to 1½-inch pieces, or 10 ounces boneless rabbit, cut into 1- to 1½-inch pieces</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">6 tiny pork chops</p>
<p class="qun">4 pork sausages (about 7 ounces)</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 red or green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="qun">14 ounces (about 3½ cups) small macaroni</p>
<p class="qun">4½ cups chicken stock (or 4½ cups water plus 1 bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup fresh or frozen peas</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE</span> <span class="bolditalic">PICADA</span></p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup blanched whole almonds or hazelnuts, lightly toasted</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun">Pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun1">3 tablespoons coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the chicken or rabbit pieces, and sauté over medium heat, turning them and sprinkling with salt and pepper, until lightly browned and cooked through. Take them out and put them on a plate.</p>
<p class="summary">Sauté the pork chops in the same oil until lightly browned and cooked through, adding salt and pepper and turning them once. Transfer them to the plate. Sauté the sausages (prick them first with the point of a knife so that they don’t burst), shaking the pan and turning them, until done. Take them out and cut them into thick slices.</p>
<p class="summary">Fry the onion, pepper, and garlic in a wide casserole in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over low heat, stirring often, until soft. Add the tomatoes, sugar, a little salt, and the bay leaf and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">Bring the stock (or water and bouillon cube) to a boil.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the pasta to the sauce and stir well. Pour in the boiling stock and add the peas and some salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat until the pasta is somewhat softened but a little underdone (about 3 minutes less than the cooking time on the package). Taste the pasta with a little of the sauce when it begins to soften and add more salt if necessary.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, for the <span class="italic">picada,</span> blend all the ingredients to a paste in a food processor, and dilute it by adding about ½ cup of the stock from the casserole.</p>
<p class="summary">Stir the <span class="italic">picada</span> into the pasta, along with the rabbit or chicken and the sausage. Lay the pork chops on top, cover, and cook until the pasta is done and the meats are heated through.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Substitute dry white wine or dry oloroso sherry for 1 cup of the stock.</p>
