<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The fertile northwest corner of Castilla y León, tucked into the region near Asturias and Galicia, is well known for its pantry preserves—chestnuts in syrup, cherries in aguardiente <a href="225-chapter163.html#page_320"><span class="red">(see page 320)</span></a>, roasted peppers, and the like. These delightful preserves are adapted from Moncloa de San Lázaro, a small preserves company in the village of Cacabelos. The key, I learned from a group of women making preserves there one summer, is to patiently cook the onions until soft and translucent, without browning—what they called <em>pochar</em> (literally “to poach”)—before adding the sugar and vinegar. Serve with cheeses (warmed goat cheese makes for a particularly pleasing combination), or on the side of a beefy grilled steak.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2½&gt; POUNDS/1.2 KG RED ONIONS</li>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>6 TABLESPOONS/80 G SUGAR</li>
<li>¾ CUP/180 ML RED WINE VINEGAR</li>
<li>1 TEASPOON AGED SHERRY VINEGAR OR BALSAMIC VINEGAR</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Peel the onions. Chop into ½&gt;-inch/1.25-cm pieces, leaving some a bit longer and rectangular shaped.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over low heat. Add the onions and cook slowly, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle in the sugar and cook, continuing to stir frequently, until it begins to darken to a soft brown tone, about 20 minutes. Add the vinegars, and cook, stirring, until the vinegar evaporates, 5 to 10 minutes, and the onions are reddish brown. Remove from the heat and let cool.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Spoon the onions into sterilized glass canning jars, leaving one finger space at the top.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Store in the refrigerator and use within 2 weeks. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled.</p>
