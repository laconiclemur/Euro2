<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">rabo de toro–andalusia</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This recipe for</span> rabo de toro, <span class="italic">“oxtail,” was given to me by Manuel Andrade, who was for many years head chef at El Burladero in the Hotel Colón in Seville. Bullfighters have lodged there during the season since the Exposición Ibero-Americana world’s fair held in the city in 1929. Manuel now has his own restaurant, the Porta Gayola in Calle Barcelona, where he cooks some of the best food I have eaten in Seville in a tiny upstairs kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Manuel’s is the classic recipe for this famous dish, the way it was made with the trophy bull’s tails that were given to the</span> picadores, <span class="italic">the horsemen who pierce the bull’s back with a lance early in the bullfight. There are many estates in Andalusia where bulls are raised for the</span> corrida. <span class="italic">The dish is served in all the tapas bars in Seville and in Córdoba, where the tails of ordinary cows are used. What we call oxtails in America are not the tails of oxen (castrated bulls that were once used for the plow as work animals) but those of ordinary beef cattle. Butchers sell them cut up into pieces consisting of vertebrae surrounded by meat, fat, and connective tissue. After long, slow cooking, the meat becomes silky-tender and the sauce rich and gelatinous. With the heady flavors imparted by the wine and brandy, this dish is a luxury.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Serve it with the roasted potatoes on page 430 or with mashed potatoes (page 281). In grand restaurants in Spain, they remove the meat from the bones and serve it up with the sauce atop a little ball of mashed potatoes.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">5½ pounds oxtails, cut into pieces</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 medium onions, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 carrots, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 large leek, trimmed, washed, and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="qun">6 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups dry red wine</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup brandy</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="recsum">Cut away the excess fat from the oxtails—the larger pieces have the most fat. Leave any skin on; it will disappear during the cooking. Place the pieces on a sheet of foil on a baking sheet and roast in a preheated 500°F oven for 30 minutes, until they have browned and released more fat.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large casserole. Add the onions, carrots, leek, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme and cook over medium heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until softened a little. Add the tomatoes and cook for another 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the browned oxtails to the vegetables (discard the fat). Pour in the wine and brandy and season with salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Add enough water to cover the oxtails and cook, covered, for 3 to 4½ hours, until the meat is meltingly tender and falls away from the bone. Let the stew rest for about 20 minutes, and remove the fat from the surface with a ladle and paper towels.</p>
<p class="summary">It is usual in Spain to lift out the oxtails and the bay leaves and thyme sprig and blend the sauce to a cream with an immersion blender, then return the oxtails and reheat before serving. I like the sauce with all the bits of vegetables and prefer not to blend it.</p>
