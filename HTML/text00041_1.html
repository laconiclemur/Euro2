 CORIANDER-CRUSTED CHICKEN LIVER SALAD</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002748">
<em>I can picture the dread on people’s faces when they see the words ‘liver’ or ‘onion’ or – heaven forbid! – ‘liver and onion’! I grew up eating liver curry as if it was what all children went home and ate. But saying that, I once came home from school to be greeted by a 4-foot defrosting river fish in the bathtub, so what was normal to me was perhaps unusual for many! My mum makes a mean liver curry, but I think that adding a sauce just masks the flavour of the livers, which I quite enjoy eating pink, much to my mother’s disgust. So what I like to do is cook them lightly enough that they don’t lose their flavour but so they also take on some of the spices they are coated in. Here they’re served with delicious, warm, cooked onions. Let’s make livers more than just tolerable – let’s celebrate them!</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0002759">
<span class="blue">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put the flour, salt and coriander on a plate and mix together so the spice is distributed.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002760">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Have another plate handy while you dip each piece of liver into the spiced flour mix. Once dipped, set aside on the second plate. This light coating will give the livers an aromatic crust when fried.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002761">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Put a frying pan on a medium heat and add 3 tablespoons of oil. Once the oil is warm, add the chicken liver pieces and fry for 3 minutes. Turn each piece over and fry for another 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002762">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Take the livers out of the pan and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002763">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the same pan (don’t wipe it out, as you want all the flavour from the livers) and add the sliced red onions. Because of the flour left in the pan the onions may begin to stick, so add the water – this will evaporate, but it will stop the onions sticking.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002764">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Cook the onions for about 2 minutes. They will begin to wilt and soften slightly. Now season and add the chilli flakes. Cook for another minute.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002765">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, put a large handful of green salad on each plate.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002766">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Put the livers back into the pan of onions and stir through to warm for about 20 seconds.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002767">
<span class="blue">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Top each plate of green salad with the liver and onion! There – we said the two words together and it didn’t even hurt, and neither will this dish.</p>
