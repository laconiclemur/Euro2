  <h3 class="h3a">Cherry sponge dessert</h3>

  <p class="image1"><a id="page_155" class="calibre1"></a><img alt="Illustration" src="../images/00052.jpeg" class="calibre2"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">This stunning dessert is halfway between a <em class="calibre4">semi-freddo</em> (ice cream) and a mousse and is perfect in spring/summer when cherries are plentiful. It’s very simple to make and looks amazing. You make two plain sponge cakes and a cherry mousse-like filling, then assemble it – and the freezer does the rest. It can be made in advance and taken out of the freezer about 30–40 minutes before serving.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 8</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the sponge cakes</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/¾ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/1¼ cups self-raising flour, sifted</p>

  <p class="ing1">butter, to grease</p>

  <p class="ing">150ml/5fl oz/⅔ cup maraschino liqueur</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the filling</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 gelatine leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">750g/1lb 10oz ripe sweet cherries, pitted</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest of ½ lemon</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz/scant ½ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups double (heavy) cream, whipped</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the topping</p>

  <p class="ing1">7 tbsp apricot jam</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz cherries, pitted and sliced in half</p>

  <p class="ing2">a few small mint leaves</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Lightly grease 2 x 20cm/8-inch diameter round shallow cake tins and line with baking parchment. Line the bottom of a 20cm/8-inch diameter, 10cm/4-inch tall, loose-bottomed cake tin with baking parchment. Put the gelatine in a bowl of cold water to soften.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the sponge, whisk the eggs and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy. Fold in the vanilla seeds, salt and flour. Pour into the prepared shallow cake tins and bake for 15–20 minutes, until springy to the touch. Turn out and leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the filling, put the cherries in a saucepan with the wine, lemon zest and sugar and cook on a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the cherries are very soft and the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and blend until smooth. Squeeze the excess water out of the gelatine leaves and stir them into the cherry mixture until dissolved. Leave until cold, then add the whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="para">Put one sponge in the tall cake tin, smooth side down, drizzle over half the maraschino and pour in the cherry filling. Put the second sponge on top, smooth side up, gently pressing down with your fingers, and drizzle with the remaining maraschino. Cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the freezer for at least 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para1">Carefully remove the cake from the tin and place on a serving plate. Sieve the apricot jam and heat gently to make a smooth glaze. Brush the glaze over the top of the cake and decorate with cherries and a few mint leaves. Serve immediately or store in the fridge.</p>
