 HAGGIS TARTE TATIN</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_lavd" id="nad0000491">
<em>I was brought up on traditional Bangladeshi food, and my dad made sure to teach us about where meat came from and encouraged us to eat every possible part of the animal without being squeamish, ever! So I am not averse to the idea of eating haggis, and was curious to find a way to use this Scottish ingredient in my cooking. I do like to break the rules, though, so I’ve decided to use a vegetarian version of haggis, which means that those who are squeamish – or vegetarian – can still enjoy this recipe. A tarte tatin is simply a tart made upside down – this one has a simple pastry base topped with haggis and sweet shallots. It’s something a bit different, and is delicious served with a creamy garlic dip and a simple green salad.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0000510">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Unroll your puff pastry on a board and place a 20cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan upside down on top of it. Cut out a circle, using the pan as a guide and making your circle about 2<span class="frac_method">½</span>
 cm bigger. Put the pastry back on the paper it was wrapped in and leave to chill in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000511">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000512">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Make sure the 6 shallot halves will fit neatly into your frying pan. Trim the non-root ends if necessary to make them fit together into a star shape, fanning out from the middle of the pan to look like the petals of a flower. Don’t leave them in the pan at this stage – set them aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000513">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Put 1 tablespoon of oil into the frying pan and place on a medium heat. Add the crumbled haggis and cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, until slightly crispy. Remove and place in a bowl.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000514">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Add the remaining oil and the butter to the pan, and once the butter has melted add the shallots, cut side down, and cook over a low to medium heat for about 15 minutes, until they have softened but are still holding their shape. Every now and again, spoon a little of the butter and oil over the tops of the shallots as they cook.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000515">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Add the salt, sugar and balsamic and cook for 10 minutes on a low to medium heat, until the shallots are sticky and the sugar and vinegar have turned into a sweet caramel.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000516">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 With the shallots arranged in their star shape, return the haggis to the pan, using it to fill the gaps between the shallots, then take the pan off the heat.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000517">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Take your pastry circle out of the fridge and place it on top of the shallot and haggis mixture. The circle will be bigger than the pan, so tuck the edges down the sides and under the mixture. It doesn’t have to be perfect <a id="pg153"></a>
 – the rustic nature is what makes it look good when you turn it out.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000518">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Brush all over the pastry with the beaten egg, then, using a sharp knife, prick 5 or 6 holes in the pastry. This will allow the steam to release itself and the pastry to puff up. Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000519">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, make the dip by mixing all the ingredients together in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000520">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 As soon as the tart is cooked, turn it out of the pan immediately on to a plate so that the pastry lid now becomes the base. Garnish with the thyme leaves, and with the chive flowers separated into smaller buds, and serve with the dip and a green salad.</p>
