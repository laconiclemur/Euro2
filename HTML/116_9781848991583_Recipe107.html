<p class="normal"><b>You might ask why I have included another recipe for lamb shoulder in this book. Firstly, because it’s delicious, which should go without saying. And because, along with the neck and the belly, it is the tastiest cut—flavorsome, moist and succulent. These are the cuts we use in the restaurant. You can keep the shoulder on the bone if you want, because this is slowly roasted the bone will come out very easily at the end. Here, I have used basil, garlic and also ginger, the latter being slightly more unusual with lamb, but it adds an exotic touch that goes really well. Also, the Chardonnay vinegar brings a welcome sweet acidity. Just make sure you brown the lamb well first, then reduce the heat and follow the timings basting directions closely to slowly roast the lamb to perfection.</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 3 hours 40 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2¾ pounds shoulder of lamb, either bone-in or boned and tied if boned, at room temperature</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sea salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 large basil leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="acktxt">2-inch piece gingerroot, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 banana shallots</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons Chardonnay vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3⅓ cups Lamb Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tomatoes, quartered</p>
<p class="acktxt">a few small rosemary sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">fried eggplant and zucchini slices, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 425°F. Season the lamb with the salt and plenty of black pepper, massaging the seasoning into the lamb really well. Put it in a deep, flameproof roasting pan, drizzle with the oil and roast 25 to 30 minutes, turning the roast once or twice, until brown all over.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Add 2 of the basil leaves, the garlic, ginger and shallots to the pan and return it to the oven 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven again and put over low heat. Add the vinegar, which should evaporate more or less immediately, and deglaze the pan by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Add the stock and tomatoes and stir to combine everything, then cover with aluminum foil, leaving one edge open to let the steam escape.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Turn the oven down to 275°F. Return the lamb to the oven and roast 30 minutes. Remove the foil, baste the lamb and cover again. Repeat after 30 minutes, then remove the foil and cook 2 hours longer, basting every 30 minutes. The lamb should be very tender, almost falling apart.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Remove the pan from the oven, then pour the juices through a strainer into a sauté pan. Put over medium-high heat and cook 5 to 8 minutes, stirring continously, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Chop the remaining basil leaves and add to the sauce, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Carve the lamb, spoon the sauce over and top with the rosemary sprigs. Serve with fried eggplant and zucchini slices.</p>
