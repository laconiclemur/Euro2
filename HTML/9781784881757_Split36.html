<h1 class="chapter">toasted bread with tomatoes &amp; olive oil</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Alma and Vincenzo Longhitano run the busy Trattoria il Corso in the unpronounceable Roccatederighi, a hilltop town in the Maremma area of southern Tuscany. We went to learn some local specialities, but having got up early to make our way through the winding roads I became rather more captivated by her breakfast than the pasta. Alma made herself <i>pane pomodoro</i>, a simple little number of crusty bread rubbed with a tomato, then smothered in their local olive oil. She added a little salt and ate the lot despite me commenting on how luscious it looked and taking photographs; sadly she wasn’t going to be budged from her brekkie.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 1 PERSON (NOT FOR SHARING)</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 garlic clove, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 thick slices crusty bread, toasted</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 ripe tomato</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good-quality olive oil, for drizzling</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt, to taste</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Lightly rub the garlic clove over one side of each piece of toast. Cut the tomato in half and rub it over the toast, on the same sides you rubbed the garlic. It will naturally tear and break down, soaking into the bread. Drizzle over some of your best olive oil and scatter the toast with salt. Eat all by yourself and make sure the oil and tomato dribbles down your chin in proper Tuscan fashion.</p>
