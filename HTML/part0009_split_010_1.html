  <h3 class="h3a">Marinated mackerel with mint</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">A really easy dish using one of my favourite fish, mackerel. It makes a delicious antipasto or light lunch, served with lots of good bread to mop up the oil. It’s not a dish you can hurry: the fish is first steam-cooked in parchment paper and then marinated, first in vinegar and then in olive oil. The longer you leave it in the oil, the more the flavour improves: it can be kept, covered, in the fridge for up to a week.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">800g/1lb 12oz mackerel fillets</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of mint leaves</p>

  <p class="ing2">abundant olive oil, to marinate</p>

  <p class="para">Take a large sheet of baking parchment and wrap each fillet separately, tying them with kitchen string into a parcel – this is to prevent them from breaking during cooking. Place in a pan of salted water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Alternatively, cook the fillets in a steamer.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove, drain the parcels and open carefully. Put the fillets in a non-metallic container or dish, pour over the vinegar, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge to marinate for at least 4 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Carefully remove the mackerel and place in a clean container together with the garlic and mint leaves, and cover with olive oil. Cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge overnight.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the fridge and bring to room temperature before eating. Serve with lots of good bread.</p>
