<h2 class="h2-a">About the Book</h2>
<p class="normal"><em>Cooking in Provence</em> is a collection of recipes born out of the experience of running a cookery school in the heart of the Provençal countryside. When talented young chef Alex Mackay and internationally renowned photographer Peter Knab realised their dream of opening a school – La Baou d’Infer – not far from St Tropez, they were inspired by the intoxicating flavours and food of the region. The recipes offered here reflect the changing seasons – dishes that truly capture the region’s unique identity.</p>
<p class="normal1">From refreshing summer classics such as Salade Niçoise and Soupe au Pistou and the warming comfort of Daube en Boeuf and Bouillabaisse, to indulgent puddings such as Tarte aux Pommes and Millefeuille aux Fraises, each recipe is clearly presented and gloriously photographed on location in Provence.</p>
<p class="normal1">Accompanying the recipes are vivid descriptions of the scenery, markets and people. Together they conjure a vision of Provence and the food integral to the region – from the fish caught along its breathtaking coastline, to the aromatic herbs and vegetables harvested from its fields and the fruit grown in its orchards. This sumptuous book provides not just a wonderful collection of mouthwatering dishes, but a slice of the warmth and beauty of this enduringly popular region. It is an indispensable companion for lovers of good food – and the good life.</p>
