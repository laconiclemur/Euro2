    <p class="nonindent">I was delighted and relieved to discover, in the course of my research for this book, that not only are fresh black truffles available in America (from December through February), but that the importer (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf4_r1.htm#page67">this page</a>) will airmail one- or two-pound packages to any place in the United States.</p>

    <p class="indent">With the exception of the pheasant <em>salmis</em> which is placed in the “Autumn” section to coincide with the hunting season, all the recipes requiring truffles have been gathered into the “Winter” section. There are few, for truffles are hard on the purse—although French cookbooks persist in giving the recipe, no one stuffs a turkey with two pounds of truffles any more—and I have tried to present recipe “types” in which the truffle itself is best thrown into relief. It is twice found associated with sweetbreads. Whatever its preparation, the “cooking” should consist only in its being sufficiently heated to liberate the heady perfume. There is nothing in the world like a fresh truffle and no matter what its price, it is worth it. A good fresh black truffles is heavy, firm and resilient in feeling, never either hard or spongy. A cross section reveals a rich blackish-brown color with a distinct grayish-brown grain.</p>

    <p class="indent">Cooked whole, in a ragoût or <em>sous les cendres</em>, truffles are never peeled. For most uses, truffles may or may not be peeled—it is a question of personal taste. They can be chopped finely and added to any number of forcemeats or sauces. Boned chicken legs are delicious stuffed with a purée of truffles peelings (pounded, mixed with some fresh bread crumbs soaked in a garlic-rubbed bowl with a bit of white wine and a few drops of cognac, seasoned, and passed through a sieve), sewn up, colored slightly in butter, and braised on a bed of <em>mirepoix</em> with a chicken or veal stock. Chopped peelings added to a potato-croquette mixture, the croquettes floured, dipped in beaten egg, rolled in slivered <a id="page189"></a>almonds and fried in deep fat, constitute a particularly handsome garnish to any grilled or roast meat or fowl.</p>

    <p class="indent">In France one buys truffles coated with the earth from which they have been dug. In America I assume that they are sold brushed and cleaned, ready for use. They may be conserved in a nearly fresh state for many months by heating them in lard, packing them in small earthenware jars (not for aesthetic reasons, but because glass risks being broken by the contact with the hot fat), and pouring the hot, melted lard over so that they are completely covered. When cooled, cover them and store them in the refrigerator. They may be dug out of the solidified lard as needed, making certain that those remaining are not bared to the air. The lard will be perfumed and useful in many a rustic dish.</p>

    <p class="indent">The two following menus are described as “suppers,” with the French Christmas and New Year’s <em>réveillon</em> tradition in mind (Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve are both celebrated by midnight suppers in which caviar, <em>foie</em> <em>gras</em>, truffles, and champagne are rarely absent). The first—the only one of its kind in the collection—has been specifically planned as a “champagne meal.” Each menu contains a recipe for fresh truffles. The eggs in the one and the noodles in the other (any pasta lends support) are perhaps the two perfect truffle vehicles, for although both are fine and delicate in their own right, when inundated by the penetrating perfume of their regal companion, they bask in reflected glory.</p>
