			<p class="rec-intro">Use butternut or any other kind of winter squash to make this dish, which goes beautifully with roast game and other meats or can be served on its own. Meat stock is best as it helps to glue the pasta together, but you could use vegetable stock to make a vegetarian version. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">800g mixed squash, cut into wedges</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 amaretti biscuits, crushed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g dried macaroni</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">200ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g Parmesan cheese, grated</p>

			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Put the squash in a baking tray, drizzle it with olive oil and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes or until tender. Scrape all the flesh off the skin and mash it with a fork, then season well and add the crushed amaretti. </p>
			<p class="body">For cooking the macaroni you need a pan large enough to hold all the pieces in a single layer. Heat the butter in the pan until it is foaming, then add the macaroni. Roll them in the butter until they are golden on all sides, then add the stock and bring to a simmer. Season and continue to cook until the pasta is tender and the stock has almost completely evaporated; add a little water if necessary. </p>
			<p class="body">Place the macaroni side by side on a piece of greaseproof paper – it’s important that they are tightly packed together – and smear any liquid that’s left over the top. Put them in the fridge for about an hour to set. Once set, cut the macaroni into 8 small circles of about 8cm across or to fit the dishes or chef’s rings you are going to use. Boil the cream until it thickens, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Place 4 dishes or chef’s rings on a baking sheet and place a circle of macaroni in each one, followed by some squash and a generous amount of cream. Repeat the layers, finishing with a circle of macaroni, then top with cream, grated Parmesan and chopped almonds. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes to reheat, then colour the top under a hot grill. Carefully remove from the dishes or rings and serve the gratins as an accompaniment to a main course or as a starter with a few bitter leaves.</p>
