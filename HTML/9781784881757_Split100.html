<p class="tx2"><b>Tuscan meat ragù is rich and herby in flavour compared to its neighbouring Bolognese ragù, which usually contains no herbs or garlic. We always make a lot of this when we cook it as it freezes well. Giancarlo’s father, Memmo, used to make it every 14 days, and he would pour it into glass jars and store it in the fridge. Every day at 1 pm he would unscrew a jar and warm it up to have with his pasta. For two weeks he had an easy lunch before he made the next batch. We ask our local butcher to give us a fatty cut of beef, around 15 per cent fat, and coarsely grind the meat for us. Giancarlo’s family ate this ragù with fresh fettucine or dried pasta such as spaghetti, but it is also lovely on soft cheesy <a href="9781784881757_Split20.html#page_37">polenta</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split132.html#page_230">roasted vegetables</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 16–20 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE SOFFRITTO</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) carrots</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) celery stalks</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) red or white onions, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 garlic cloves, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 sprigs of rosemary</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE RAGÚ</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 kg (4 lb 6 oz) beef, coarsely minced (ground)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2¼ cups) red wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1.2 kg (2 lb 10 oz) tinned plum tomatoes</b></p>
<p class="tx3">In a large frying pan (skillet), make a <i>soffritto</i> with the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, rosemary, oil and seasoning, by following the instructions in <a href="9781784881757_Split11.html#page_28">soffritto</a>, but finely chop the garlic with the other vegetables. When the <i>soffritto</i> is soft, remove the rosemary sprigs.</p>
<p class="tx">To make the ragù, add the mince to the <i>soffritto</i> and stir well. Cook the for around 20 minutes, stirring frequently and allowing the water to evaporate from the pan. Add the wine and let it reduce until the smell of alcohol dissipates. Pour the tomatoes into a bowl and crush them with your hands (this is Giancarlo’s way; my way is to use a potato masher when they are in the pan – the choice is yours!). Add the tomatoes to the pan, stir and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and continue to cook for around 2 hours, uncovered, over a low heat. If the heat is low, it shouldn’t catch, but do keep an eye on it and add a little hot water if it looks dry. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p>
<p class="tx">Use straight away or allow to cool and store in the fridge in a covered container for 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
