<h4><span class="red">perdiz roja</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">Though red-legged partridge inhabit much of Spain, the <em>llanuras</em> (high central plains) of the Castilian meseta south of Madrid, along with some areas of Extremadura and Andalucía, are the best place in all of Europe to find them. They are a sedentary (rather than migratory) bird, and live in fields of grains, groves of olive trees, and vineyards. Walking in this region, I have seen a dozen partridge, even two dozen, moving slowly across a field at a time. They will only fly when they must, and then alight with quick, short, and powerful flights.</p>
<p class="running_first">Native to Spain, the perdiz roja is a beautifully feathered bird with a cinnamon-colored top, white throat, bluish gray chest, cinnamon belly, and wings with alternating stripes. The beak, legs, and around the eyes are all red. Weighing around 16 to 18 ounces/455 to 510 g, partridge have lean, smooth, and slightly aromatic meat thanks to their diet which includes plenty of wild herbs. Stewed (see facing page), grilled, or prepared in escabeche marinade, it is an exquisite bird for cooks.</p>
<p class="running_first">But they are also the most prized game bird for hunters. The most famous (and expensive) way to hunt perdiz is in a formal, traditional driven hunt called an <em>ojeo</em>. Like many Spanish kings before him (and one notable twentieth-century dictator after), Alfonso XIII, the grandfather of the current king, was a keen bird hunter, and made it popular for aristocracy across Europe to hunt on the vast Spanish estates. Ojeos have changed little since, and remain, if not an exclusively aristocratic way of hunting, then a wealthy, genteel one.</p>
<p class="running_first">Shooters sit behind a blind with a brace of shotguns and await birds winging by at 55 to 75 miles/90 to 120 km per hour, driven by a line of beaters progressing toward them. Traditionally, each shooter is accompanied by two assistants, a <em>cargador</em>, who helps with loading the shotguns and gathering fallen birds, and a <em>secretario</em>, who keeps track of counts and fallen birds. There are generally five beatings in a morning, with short breaks between.</p>
<p class="running_first">As with nearly every tradition in Spain, food forms a key part of the hunt. The morning <em>taco</em>, or snack, is brought out to the field—chorizo and jamón, aged cheeses, <em>migas</em>, (essentially fried breadcrumbs, <a href="112-chapter78.html#page_161">see page 161</a>), and bottles of supple red wine. After the fifth beating, the hunters, helpers, and assistants adjourn to the manor house for a hearty lunch.</p>
<p class="running_first">Even when the shooting is good (and perhaps even great), the taco and the post-shoot meal are surely among the day’s most important and enjoyable parts.</p>
