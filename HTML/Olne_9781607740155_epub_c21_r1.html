  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page316"></a>THE MARINATED SARDINE FILLETS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Fresh sardines are stiff, often arched, and glossy in appearance. Their scales reflect a bright metallic blue. They must be absolutely fresh. French fishermen delight in eating them straight from the net, with or without a drop of lemon juice, but preferably accompanied by a bottle of cold white wine.</p>

  <p class="indent">Marinated raw, they have a frank, clean savor and are more easily digestible than when cooked. The flesh is fragile and so little resistant that they may easily be cleaned simply by tearing out the intestines with one’s forefinger, and may be scaled by holding under water and rubbing them from tail to head with the fingers. The fillets may be pried from the skeleton without recourse to a knife.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c21-s81"><em><span class="color">Marinated Raw Sardine Fillets</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Filets de Sardines Crues en Marinade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>12 fresh sardines, filleted</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of</em> 2 <em>lemons</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Rinse the fillets, sponge them dry in paper towels, salt them and pepper them on each side, and sprinkle the lemon juice over, turning them so that all are evenly moistened. Leave them for several hours or overnight, turning them from time to time, and serve well chilled, accompanied by rye bread and firm, fresh, unsalted butter.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c21-s82"><em><span class="color">Grilled Steak, Marchand de Vin</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Grillade de Boeuf, Marchand de Vin</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The commonest cuts of steak in France are taken from the fillet (Chateaubriand and <em>tournedos</em>, the tenderest cuts), the rump (rump steak, <a id="page317"></a>the most flavorful cut), the section of the sirloin opposite the fillet (called either <em>contrefilet</em> or <em>faux-filet</em>), and the boned rib section (<em>entrecôte</em>, the cut traditionally accompanied by <em>marchand de vin butter</em>).</p>

  <p class="indent">Whether the meat is cut in the French or the American manner, it should come from an animal that is not too young, it should be finely, but not excessively, veined with fat, it must be fresh and not frozen, but sufficiently aged to have gained in tenderness, juiciness and flavor. To be properly grilled, a steak should not be less than 1 inch nor more than 2½ inches thick. Allow approximately ½ pound, boned, per person. It may be lightly sprinkled with herbs and marinated with a bit of olive oil for a couple of hours or so before cooking. It should, in any case, always be rubbed with oil before grilling, sprinkled with salt and pepper on the side first to be grilled, just before placing it on the hot grill, and, on the other, just after turning it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Steaks may be grilled on heavy cast-iron grills, preheated over a gas flame, or, if very thick, beneath a broiler, but by far the best way of grilling is on a preheated welded-iron grill over hot fruitwood (best of all, grapevine prunings) coals—these should be hotter and the grilling time comparatively shorter than for other meats, but the thicker the steak, the less intense the heat should be. A handful of rosemary leaves thrown into the coals (they will smoke without bursting into flames), a few seconds before removing the meat, enhances the flavor.</p>

  <p class="indent">The French say that a steak is <em>à point</em> (“just right”—the equivalent of medium rare) when, once having been turned, the first “pearl” of transparent, rose-colored liquid oozes up through the seared surface. If it is then removed from the grill and kept warm for a few minutes (on the heated serving platter, for instance, a heated bowl or saucepan inverted above it, or in a warm but not hot oven), the flesh will continue to cook without becoming overdone. Although some people fear rare meat and others require that a steak be <em>bleu</em>, that is to say, both sides so rapidly seared that the heat is not permitted to penetrate the interior, an overdone steak is always dry and savorless, and one that is underdone is always rubbery and resistant. (Raw beef can be delicious, but must be prepared in the manner of steak <em>à l’américaine</em>: the steak, completely cleared of all fat, is scraped to separate the flesh from all tendons or membranous material and <a id="page318"></a>finely chopped. It is usually served with a half eggshell containing a yolk implanted in the center of each portion, and surrounded by small mounds of parsley, sour gherkins, onions and capers, all finely chopped. Olive oil, salt, pepper and sometimes Worcestershire sauce are served separately, and each person doses his mixture to taste. It is nearly always called “steak <em>tartare</em>,” which technically is raw, chopped beef accompanied by tartar sauce.)</p>

  <p class="indent">A steak <em>marchand de vin</em> is served with the <em>marchand de vin</em> butter apart, and each guest spreads a spoonful over his steak. On restaurant menus, <em>marchand de vin</em> often indicates a pan-fried steak sauced by sautéing chopped shallots in the pan in which the steak was cooked, washing the pan with red wine and lightly buttering the reduction, which is sometimes strengthened by the addition of meat glaze.</p>

  <p class="indent">Other “butters” often served with grilled beef are: Bercy (the same as <em>marchand de vin</em>, except that white wine replaces the red), chivry (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c28_r1.htm#c28-s108">Grilled Lambs’ Kidneys</a>), <em>maître d’hôtel</em> (chopped parsley, seasoning, and lemon juice, mashed with butter), anchovy butter, etc. Except for <em>sauce béarnaise</em> (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c13_r1.htm#c13-s51">Stuffed Calves’ Ears</a>), which is served separately, grilled meats are rarely accompanied by sauce, pan-fried or sautéed steaks lending themselves better to this treatment.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">MARCHAND DE VIN BUTTER</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If meat glaze is on hand, a tablespoonful, melted, may be added to the butter. The butter may be prepared in advance, but should be served semisoft and not chilled.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup good red wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon finely chopped gray shallot (if unavailable, replace it with onion plus a small, finely chopped clove of garlic)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a generous pinch of freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 ounces softened butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon lemon juice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Reduce the wine and chopped shallot, in a small saucepan over a high flame, to about ⅓ cup, pour it into a mixing bowl and, when it is just tepid, whisk it vigorously with all the other ingredients.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page319"></a>THE POTATO GRATIN</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">This differs from the classic <em>gratin à la dauphinoise</em> only in that in the latter the potatoes are finely sliced. The potatoes are often mixed raw with the other ingredients and put directly in the oven, but one must then count from 45 minutes’ to 1 hour’s cooking time at medium heat, and the gentle caress of fresh garlic is lost. The potatoes may also (as in the following recipe) be first parboiled in milk. The milk may be replaced by cream in the baking process (the milk serves later for a soup or <em>béchamel</em>).</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c21-s83"><em><span class="color">Gratin of Potatoes</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gratin de Pommes de Terre</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds nonmealy potatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 cups milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper, a suspicion of freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 1 cup grated Gruyère cheese</em> (<em>the dry, nutty-flavored Swiss Gruyère, not Emmenthal</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Choose a large shallow earthenware baking or gratin dish. Earthenware, when rubbed with garlic, “takes” it better than any other material and, the larger the dish, the greater will be the surface of the delicious gratin and the more rapidly will the thinner bed of potatoes cook, keeping the perfume of the garlic fresher.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rub the sides and bottom well with the garlic cloves, wait a couple of minutes for the garlic moisture to dry, and generously butter the dish. Peel the potatoes, pass them through the medium julienne blade of a <em>mouli-julienne</em>, rinse them well in a large basin of cold water, and drain them. Bring the milk, lightly salted, to a boil and parboil the potatoes for about 5 minutes. Pour the contents of the saucepan into a <a id="page320"></a>sieve, collecting the milk in another receptacle, beat the egg, a pinch of salt, the pepper, nutmeg, and half the grated cheese together in a mixing bowl, and slowly pour in the milk, whisking. Stir the potatoes into the mixture and pour it into the baking dish, smoothing out the surface. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese, distribute paper-thin slices of butter, cut from a chilled block, evenly over the surface, and bake in a hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked and the surface crisp and golden. Should the potatoes be cooked before the gratin is sufficiently formed, place the dish beneath the broiler for a minute or so to brown.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c21-s84"><em><span class="color">Apple Tart</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Tarte aux Pommes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 half-baked pastry shell (same ingredients and preparation as for <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c20_r1.htm#c20-s78">Shrimp Quiche</a>)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound cooking apples, preferably russet, peeled, cored and sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of cinnamon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cook the apple slices gently in butter until tender and translucent, but not falling apart (aside from their unique perfume, russets hold their shape best); line the bottom of the pastry shell with the slices and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beat the eggs and sugar together until the yellow color lightens, stir in the cream, and pour the mixture over the apples. Bake in a medium oven until the custard has set and the crust is golden. Serve warm, but not hot.</p>
