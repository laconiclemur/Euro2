<p class="noindentb"><span class="txit">Regina</span> means “queen” in Italian, and these cookies are crownlike in shape—thus the name. People used to ask my grandmother to prepare them for special occasions, such as weddings and christenings, and she was always happy to oblige. Now my mother makes them for her friends and family. She always laughs, recalling the first time she made them: “I cooked my first batch of these cookies as a young married woman to bring to a gathering at Stan’s family’s house, hoping to impress them,” Joan says. “I watched with anticipation as the cookies were tasted and was surprised when no one said anything. When I sampled one myself, I realized why. I must have substituted salt for the sugar—the cookies tasted awful.”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 large eggs, at room temperature</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup granulated sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoons solid vegetable shortening, melted</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon whiskey</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups corn oil for frying</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup confectioners’ sugar</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a large bowl, beat the eggs with an electric mixer until foamy. Add the granulated sugar and blend thoroughly. Beat in the melted shortening, milk, whiskey, and salt. Gradually add 2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups of the flour, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup at a time, beating to form a firm dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding more flour, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup at a time, until the dough is no longer sticky. Tear the center of the dough by breaking it in half. The center should be almost as dry as the surface of the dough. If it is still sticky, add more flour and continue to knead. Set the dough aside to rest under a dish towel for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_330"/><span class="red">2.</span> Cut off one third of the dough, leaving the rest under the dish towel. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a large, evenly thin circle (the dough should be paper thin). Use a pastry wheel to cut the dough into long strips about <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch wide. Separate three of the strips. Pinch the strips together at one end and then loosely braid them. Pinch the ends of the braided strips together. Pinch the top and bottom of the braid together to form a crown. Set it aside on a clean dish towel and continue to braid the remaining dough strips. Any scraps may be reserved and fried along with the crowns.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> When the first third of the dough is finished, repeat the procedure with the remaining dough, one third at a time, braiding it into crowns.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Pour the corn oil into a small frying pan to a depth of 1 inch. (Reserve any remaining oil to add to the pan as needed. If you add oil to the pan, be sure to let it reheat before adding any dough.) Warm the oil over medium heat until it is hot but not smoking. Add one small scrap of rolled dough to the oil. If the oil bubbles and the dough rises to the surface, the oil is hot enough for cooking.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Line two baking sheets with paper towel. Set aside. Place <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the confectioners’ sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Add two braided crowns to the pan. Use a fork to lightly fluff each cookie so the braids open slightly as they begin to cook. Fry the cookies until lightly browned on both sides, bout 3 minutes. Remove from the oil to one of the paper-towel-lined baking sheets. Drain and transfer to the other paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining crowns, adding more oil to the pan as needed.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Shake the sieve with the confectioners’ sugar over the warm cookies to lightly dust them, adding more confectioners’ sugar to the sieve as necessary. When they have cooled, transfer the cookies to a serving dish. The cookies may be dusted with additional confectioners’ sugar just before serving.</p>
