 CARAWAY SALMON WITH RED PEPPER &amp; QUINOA SALAD</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002683">
<em>I’m not a massive fan of cold salads. I eat them because somewhere in my subconscious mind doing so makes me feel better about myself. But if I can help it, I prefer a salad that has some sort of warm element to it. I like warmth in all its forms, and will whack the central heating on 30 minutes before a bath, just on the off-chance that I might feel cold when I get out. My father has even threatened to surgically implant a halogen heater under my skin to stop me complaining about the cold. That’s why I like this salad: it’s a vibrant and fragrant combination of quinoa and caraway, topped with a warm piece of crispy-skinned salmon.</em>

 Put the quinoa into a small pan and add the water. Bring to the boil on a high heat, then turn down to medium and simmer until all the water has evaporated – this should take about 20 minutes. Once the water has gone, leave on the lowest heat for a couple of minutes to dry the quinoa, stirring frequently to make sure it isn’t sticking to the bottom of the pan. If your packet of quinoa comes with different instructions, you can follow those instead.</p>

 Meanwhile, put a frying pan on a medium heat and add 4 tablespoons of oil. When the oil is warm, add the caraway seeds, and once you hear the seeds popping add the onion and red pepper. Season immediately with the salt and cook for 10 minutes, until it has all softened.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002698">

 Add the zest and juice of the lemon, then add the quinoa and parsley and mix it all through.</p>

 Divide the quinoa mixture between four plates and put some watercress on top.</p>

 Clean the frying pan with kitchen paper. Place on a high heat.</p>

 Drizzle the salmon fillets with the rest of the oil and massage all over, then season and place in the hot pan, skin side down. Lower the heat to medium and cook for 4–8 minutes, until the skin is crisp and the salmon has turned opaque most of the way up (how long this takes will depend on the thickness of your salmon).</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002702">
<span class="blue">

</span>
 Turn the fillets over and cook for a further minute on the other side. Place on the plates next to the quinoa and watercress.</p>

 That’s both the hot and cold elements, but I think the halogen heater idea could still catch on.</p>
