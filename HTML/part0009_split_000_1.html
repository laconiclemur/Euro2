Bread should never be placed upside down on the table, for example – that could bring bad luck. A French meal is not complete without bread and it’s served at every opportunity, to savour, enjoy – and to mop up the juices on the plate. The French will even eat bread with bread! Bakers bake throughout the day and many people will visit their local bakery at least a couple of times a day to buy the freshest loaves, warm from the oven. </p>
