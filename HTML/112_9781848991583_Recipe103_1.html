<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_174"/><b>Smoked Chicken, Zucchini, Garlic</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Rosemary Casserole</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>A steamer works perfectly as a smoker, so, if you have one, do give this recipe a try. You put the smoking mix in the bottom and the chicken in the top, but be sure to keep the heat low—you don’t want your kitchen smoke alarm to go off, so take it easy and don’t get too excited! The green tea will bring a subtle flavor to the chicken, which will, in turn, infuse the zucchini. It’s almost as if you’d grilled the zucchini, with the wonderful, smoky scent.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">½ cup basmati rice</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons green tea</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 teaspoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks separated</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups zucchini cut in half lengthwise and then cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 garlic cloves, unpeeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 rosemary sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put a large piece of aluminum foil, shiny-side down, in the bottom of a steamer, then put the rice, tea and sugar on the foil. Cover with a steamer insert and lid and put over medium heat about 5 minutes until the mixture starts smoking. Quickly lift the lid and put all the chicken inside. Put the lid back on, turn the heat down to low and smoke 5 minutes. Lift out the chicken and put on a plate to rest, wrapping the smoking ingredients in the foil and discarding them as quickly as you can.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Melt the butter with the sunflower oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook 6 to 8 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally, until they are golden brown all over. Transfer them to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Discard the oil from the pot and lightly wipe the excess away with paper towels, taking care not to disturb the sediment. Return the pot to medium-low heat, add the olive oil, zucchini and garlic and cook gently 4 to 5 minutes until colored but only just tender.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Move the zucchini to the side of the pot, then and put the chicken pieces in the middle to reheat. Turn the heat up to medium and when you can actually hear the food starting to cook, add the sherry vinegar straightaway; it should evaporate immediately. Quickly pour the stock over the top and throw in the rosemary sprig. When the stock comes to a simmer, gently wriggle the pot around a little so nothing is stuck to the bottom, then put the lid on top without closing it completely—you just want a little gap so condensation doesn’t create too much liquid, but not so large that all the liquid evaporates. Cook 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Remove the lid and discard the rosemary. Turn the heat to high and cook 5 minutes longer, stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom, or until the sauce is shiny and just thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Add the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper to taste, then serve hot. Guests can squeeze the garlic out of the skins into the dish.</p>
