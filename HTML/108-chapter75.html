<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The Pyrenees mountain range divides the Iberian Peninsula from continental Europe, Spain from France. Running more than 300 miles/nearly 500 km in length, with peaks rising to more than 11,000 feet/3,400 m, the range stretches across the north of Spain from the Bay of Biscay on the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. This variation of macarrones comes from the eastern part of the range. The addition of pâté—use a smooth, spreadable type, not coarse country-style—gives the pasta dish a satiny, almost creamy finish. A handful of sliced and seared wild mushrooms blended in at the very end makes an excellent autumn addition. In winter, you find this on tables after a long walk in the hills or a day on the ski slopes.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>8 OUNCES/225 G GROUND BEEF AND/OR PORK</li>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML TOMATO SAUCE</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>¼ CUP/50 G SMOOTH P<span class="serif">Â</span>T<span class="serif">É</span></li>
<li>14 OUNCES/400 G PENNE OR ANOTHER TUBULAR PASTA</li>
<li>1 CUP/70 G LOOSELY PACKED, FRESHLY GRATED MILD PASTA CHEESE, SUCH AS MOZZARELLA</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2"><span class="red">1.</span></span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the meat and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have darkened and the sauce has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Add a small amount of water if the sauce needs more time to sweeten. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the pâté until dissolved.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2"><span class="red">2.</span></span> Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 4 quarts/4 L water to a boil and season with salt. Add the pasta and cook, stirring from time to time to keep the pasta from clumping together, until al dente (follow the time indicated on the pasta package).</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2"><span class="red">3.</span></span> Drain the pasta in a colander but do not rinse. Shake off any water that clings to the pasta. Return the pasta to the pot and blend with the sauce and half of the cheese until thoroughly coated and the cheese has melted. Serve immediately with the remaining cheese on the side to add as desired.</p>
