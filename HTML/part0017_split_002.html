<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">French tarragon (estragon in French) is an herb present in much of Provençal cooking. It is sometimes difficult to find fresh French tarragon but there is no point in making this recipe with dry tarragon. Once dry, the herb tastes and smells entirely different and, in my humble opinion, has nothing much to offer.</em></p><p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">Now that I live in the U.S. I have grown accustomed to using heavy cream rather than crème fraîche because the latter is harder to find.</em></p><div id="c14s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre47"><b class="calibre4">Poulet à l’Estragon -- Tarragon Chicken</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre47"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for six servings</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">8 pieces of chicken (regular or boneless and skinless, a leaner version that also is less flavorful.)</p><p class="calibre6">1 tbsp canola oil</p><p class="calibre6">1 tsp unsalted butter</p><p class="calibre6">2 medium shallots, finely chopped</p><p class="calibre6">2 cups chicken broth</p><p class="calibre6">3 tbsp white wine vinegar or rice vinegar</p><p class="calibre6">1 tbsp strong French Dijon mustard</p><p class="calibre6">2 cups white wine</p><p class="calibre6">1 tsp red pepper flakes</p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp fresh tarragon, chopped or not. Separate from the stems but reserve those.</p><p class="calibre6">½ cup heavy cream or crème fraîche</p><p class="calibre6">Fresh tarragon for garnish</p><p class="calibre6">Salt and pepper to taste</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre47"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- In a 4 to 6 quart pan (Dutch oven or French oven style), melt butter and oil until the butter begins to sizzle, then add the pieces of chicken and sauté them to all side until they are golden (you might have to do this in several batches).</p><p class="calibre6">2- Once the chicken is golden on all sides, remove from the pan and set aside.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Lower the heat. Add the finely chopped shallots and stir for a minute. Do not let the shallots burn.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Still on low heat, deglaze your pan, first by adding the vinegar and stirring, then adding the wine and stirring. When all the juices have been deglazed and mixed in, add Dijon mustard and stir, then add chicken stock and place the chicken back into the pan.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Add black pepper, red pepper flakes, the tarragon stems and half the tarragon leaves.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Cover and cook on medium heat for 20 minutes. Remove the cover, stir, and cook for an additional 10 minutes or more until the sauce has reduced by half (overcooking the chicken is perfectly okay for this recipe.) Taste and add salt and pepper to taste. Some chicken broths are saltier than others; so make sure to taste before adding salt. Cover and cook on low heat. Make sure the sauce doesn't reduce too much. If it becomes too thick add up to 1 cup of water or chicken broth.</p><p class="calibre6">7- A few minutes before serving, remove and discard the tarragon stalks. Reheat the dish thoroughly on the stove. Once it is hot add the cream and turn off the heat so that the cream does not separate. Two tablespoons is enough to give the dish a creamy texture. I like a lot of cream.</p><p class="calibre6">8- Place your tarragon chicken in a pretty dish, pour the sauce over it and sprinkle with a bit of fresh chopped tarragon.</p><p class="calibre6">9- Serve with basmati rice or pasta, red or white wine and string beans, fresh peas when in season, or a green salad.</p></div></div></body></html>
