<p class="tx2"><i>La cucina povera</i>, ‘the poor kitchen’ diet, prevailed among the rural population for centuries and made good use of food leftovers, with <i>ribollita</i> (‘re-boiled’) featuring prominently. This variety of Tuscan soup with peasant origins was made by re-boiling vegetables left over from the previous day, and dates back to the Middle Ages, when servants gathered up food such as soaked bread trenchers from the banquets of their feudal masters and re-boiled them for their own dinners.</p>
<p class="tx">A <i>zuppa</i> (from <i>inzuppare</i>, meaning ‘to soak’) is a soup usually served over bread. A <i>minestra</i> is made from vegetables, and could be thin or thickened with potato. Bean soups are ubiquitous, and the Florentines in particular were always known as the <i>mangiafagioli</i> (‘beaneaters’). A <i>crema</i> is a soup that has been passed through a food mill to make it creamy and smooth.</p>
<p class="tx">Our best-selling <i>primo</i> at our restaurant Caldesi in Campagna is the <i>torta di grana</i>, a wonderfully light cheese tart. It is similar to the <i>sformati</i> (‘moulds’) that are served either as <i>primi</i> or <i>contorni</i> with main courses. The Cibreo (braised chicken livers, see 155) dates back to the time of Catherine de’ Medici and is said to have been one of her favourite dishes.</p>
