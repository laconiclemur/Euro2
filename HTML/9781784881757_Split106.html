<p class="tx2"><b>These large filled ravioli (<i>cappelli di frate</i>), named after the shape of a monk’s hat, make a stunning dinner party dish as the egg yolk oozes out as you eat them. Do practise before you make them for friends however, as you have to learn to be gentle with them in the cooking and serving. We use an 11 cm (4¼ in) pastry cutter but you could instead draw a knife around a small 10–12 cm (4–5 in) diameter saucer to make the circles of pasta. Use the leftover egg whites to make <a href="9781784881757_Split144.html#page_253">Marietta’s Pannacotta</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE FILLING</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) spinach, cooked and squeezed dry</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>30 g (1 oz / ⅛ cup) fresh ricotta</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>30 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan, plus extra to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>¼ teaspoon salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 egg yolks or 6 quail’s eggs</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan, to serve</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE RAVIOLI</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 quantity <a href="9781784881757_Split97.html#page_167">Fresh Pasta</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>coarse semolina or ‘00’ flour, for dusting</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE SAUCE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 g (5 oz) salted butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>18–20 sage leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>30 g (1 oz) pine nuts, toasted</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Start by making the filling. Finely chop the cooked spinach on a chopping board or in a food processor. Put it into a bowl with the ricotta, Parmesan, nutmeg, salt and pepper, and mix together thoroughly. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Cover and set aside until required.</p>
<p class="tx">Roll out half the pasta at a time, following the instructions in <a href="9781784881757_Split101.html#page_173">ravioli filled with tomato &amp; bread stuffing in a warm mozzarella cream</a> to the width of the pasta machine. Lay the first sheet onto a floured board and cut the length in half. Don’t get flour onto the pasta on the top side. Use an 11 cm (4¼ in) cutter to lightly make 3 circles – these will be the size of your finished <i>cappelli del frate</i>. Use a spoon to place 3 equal heaps of half of the filling into the circles. Lightly press the filling outwards leaving a 1 cm (½ in) border around each mound with a well in each one large enough for the yolk. Put 1 egg yolk or 1 quail’s egg into each well. Lay the other length of pasta on top and press down, pushing out the air and sealing the edges down. You shouldn’t need water to stick the pasta together if there is no flour between the edges that are stuck down, but if it is dry, brush lightly with water to help it stick. Use your cutter to cut through the layers of pasta right through to the board. Set aside on a floured plate and make up the rest. Leave on a floured plate for no longer than 2 hours in the fridge.</p>
<p class="tx">To cook, bring a large pan of salted water to a rolling boil. Meanwhile, make the sauce by melting the butter in a large frying pan. Add the sage leaves, a pinch of salt, a few twists of pepper and toasted pine nuts and fry for a couple of minutes. Add a ladleful of pasta cooking water and stir well. Keep the sauce warm but not bubbling while you cook the pasta.</p>
<p class="tx">Gently lower the ravioli into the boiling water, and stir gently to make sure they don’t stick to one another. Cook for 4 minutes for a soft yolk and 6 minutes for firm. When cooked, remove the ravioli gently with a slotted spoon and put them into the warm butter and sage sauce. Shake the pan to coat the pasta and serve immediately in warm bowls with the sauce and grated Parmesan.</p>
