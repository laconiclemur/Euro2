<p class="tx2"><b>Lunch is the time in Tuscany to eat pasta. In most households you will find pots of ragù or tomato sauce in the fridge for just such a time. We sometimes have a ball of leftover pasta dough in the fridge, so all I need to do is quickly roll it through the pasta machine and drop the strands into boiling water for a couple of minutes to make a quick lunch. However, dried pasta is perfectly acceptable and its quick cooking time makes it perfect for a meal when you have little time for preparation. Many Italians also eat it in the evening, or late into the night, but always in small portions. Giancarlo remembers preparing <i>un spaghettata</i> in the early hours of the morning after a night’s dancing: he would boil up pasta and serve it with a little chilli, splashes of new olive oil, a handful of chopped parsley and some of the local sheep’s cheese.
