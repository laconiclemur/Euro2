<h2 class="h2b" id="page31">PROVENCAL BREADCRUMBS</h2>
<p class="normalla0"><em>These are a must! Keep your old bits of bread, dry them in a low oven and store them in an airtight container ready to make these or plain crumbs. You can make them in reasonably large quantities and freeze them in bags, just taking out a handful when you need them. They can be used with the lamb <a href="chapter_003s.html#page108">here</a>, on top of grilled aubergines or peppers, baked with a little fresh or salt cod or sprinkled with a good Parmesan over grilled tomatoes. I’ve even used them mixed with Gruyère, on top of macaroni cheese. Close your eyes and inhale when you make them and you will have an instant hit of Provence no matter where you are</em>.</p>
