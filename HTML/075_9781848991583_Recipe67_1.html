<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 35 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 stick unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">2⅓ cups thinly sliced button mushrooms</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 chicken breast halves, skin on</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large Savoy cabbage, shredded</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 cooked whole chestnuts</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped tarragon leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Melt 2 tablespooons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, nonstick skillet over high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the mushrooms and sauté 4 to 5 minutes until they release all their juices and are just golden. Remove and tip them onto paper towels to dry. Wipe the skillet, then return it to medium heat. Melt another 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the butter is foaming, add the chicken breast halves, skin-side down, and cook one side only 5 minutes, or until the skin is light golden brown. Remove them from the pan and put them, skin-side up, on a cutting board.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Cut the chicken breasts horizontally through the middle and three-quarters of the way through so you can open them out like a book. Spread half the mushrooms over the bottom half of each breast and season with salt and pepper, then fold the top half back over to make a chicken-mushroom sandwich. Tightly wrap each chicken breast in plastic wrap to make a sausage shape. Twist and secure each end with a knot, pushing out any air.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer, with a steamer insert on top, and bring another pan of salted water to the boil. Put the chicken packages in the steamer, cover and cook 12 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove them and leave them to rest on a plate 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> While the chicken is cooking, blanch the cabbage in the boiling, salted water 3 to 4 minutes until it is only just tender, then drain well and pat dry. While the chicken is resting, melt another 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil in the skillet over medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the blanched cabbage. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, then add the remaining cooked mushrooms and the chestnuts and toss 2 to 3 minutes longer until heated through. Transfer the cabbage mixture to a warm bowl, cover and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Once the chicken has rested, remove the plastic wrap and pour any juices into a small pan over medium-high heat. Add the stock and boil 2 to 3 minutes until the liquid reduces by half. Whip the cream until soft peaks form, then add it to the pan and let it melt into the sauce, without stirring. As soon the sauce starts to simmer, remove the pan from the heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then stir in the tarragon.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Meanwhile, melt the remaining buter and oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and fry, skin-side down, about 3 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden. Quarter the chicken rolls and serve alongside the braised cabbage with the sauce.</p>
