  <p class="nonindent">Every German child knows the story of Suppenkaspar, the little boy who faded away because he refused to eat his soup. Apparently, few Germans grow up to be Suppenkaspars, for soup is one of the most important and popular courses on the national menu. Almost everyone has it once a day, and many have it twice. Soup may be the first course of a meal, or it may be the entree, in which case it will be preceded by an appetizer such as herring, sliced cold cuts or stuffed eggs, and followed by a dessert of cheese and fruit, or a sweet pudding. Cold soups are served as refreshing pickups on warm summer afternoons, and in many parts of Germany, particularly in Bavaria, the favorite midnight snack is a steaming bowlful of paprika-bright meat and potato goulash soup.</p>

  <p class="indent">Seven or eight soups appear most frequently on the menus of German restaurants: chicken or beef broth with dumplings, noodles or rice; oxtail; goulash; cream of asparagus; split pea; and the two most elegant and expensive, cream of lobster and Echte Schildkrötensuppe—genuine turtle soup. But don’t let that limited array fool you. German cooks can and do make wonderful soup out of practically everything. In addition to those made of meats, poultry, game, fish and vegetables, there are others based on nothing more than a cupful of leftover gravy or a few slices of bread. Some are made of bones or beer, fruit or chocolate, buttermilk or wine, cereals or a little flour. There are hot soups and cold, some sweet and others sour, and several both sweet and sour. Some, like the oxtail and goulash, are practically stews. Many <a id="page29"></a>soups are thickened with cream and egg yolks or with the browned onion-butter-flour roux which in Germany is called an Einbrenne. Even the clear golden broths (Kraftbrühe) are enriched and made more interesting with an Einlage—literally, lay-in—the dumplings, noodles and egg garnishes you’ll find in the next <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Sher_9780307754578_epub_c003_r1.htm">chapter</a>. Hamburg is famous for an eel soup that contains, in addition to eel, seemingly mismatched ingredients such as ham, dried fruits, vegetables, wine, herbs and raspberry jam, and all day long in Berlin people crowd around the island counters at Aschinger’s, to eat yellow pea soup thick with potatoes, vegetables, smoked ham and wurst. Currently, kangaroo-tail soup is the Feinschmecker status symbol on restaurant menus, and French onion soup (Französische Zwiebelsuppe) has virtually become a naturalized citizen of the German cuisine. The Mock Turtle’s refrain, “Soup of the evening, beautiful soup …” would make a fitting gastronomic national anthem for Germany.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unusual though they may be, a few German soups, such as those made of leftover gravy, browned flour, bread and cereal, are a little too starchy or porridge-like for our taste, and I have not included them.</p>

  <p class="indent">While no canned or packaged soup can match an expertly and carefully prepared homemade soup, there are times when such a short cut is called for, and several very good packaged dehydrated German soups are imported into this country. Those made by ETO seemed especially good to me, most notably the mushroom and the green pea with smoked bacon. As always with such products, a little doctoring goes a long way toward improving them. Some fresh herbs, a dash of cream or wine or a lump of butter, or whatever seems suited to the particular soup you are preparing, will make them even more delicious than they already are.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wurzelwerk means root works and refers to the root vegetables and greens that lend a rich savory fragrance and flavor to German broths and soups. When a recipe calls for pot vegetables, use the selection listed below. If any items are unavailable, eliminate them; for best results, try to use them all. Add as directed in specific recipes.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large carrot</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 stalk celery, with leaves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small knob celery root (celeriac); trim off straggly roots, peel and rinse</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small parsnip, scraped and cut in half lengthwise</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 petrouchka (parsley root), scraped</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><a id="page30"></a><em>1 leek with most of green leaves trimmed off; wash thoroughly under running water to remove sand</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 medium onion, peeled and left whole</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 sprigs parsley</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">A small white peeled turnip is often included with the other soup greens; its flavor can be too powerful and pervasive, so use it at your own discretion</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L03_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOT SOUPS <em>(Heisse Suppen)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L04_r1.jpg" /></h2>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Whenever possible, German cooks make their soups with meat, bone, fish or vegetable stock instead of water. The following broths may be used as stocks or can be served with dumplings, noodles, egg custard cubes, rice, fried “peas” or any other Einlage which you’ll find in <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Sher_9780307754578_epub_c003_r1.htm">Chapter III</a>. If you do not have any homemade stock on hand, substitute canned or dehydrated beef or chicken bouillon, or use a meat extract for a soup that calls for beef stock. Stock can be kept for a long time, but every five days it should be brought to the boiling point and simmered for about 5 minutes, then returned to refrigerator. Always simmer stock slowly. If it cooks too rapidly, it will become cloudy.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CLEAR BEEF BROTH (Fleischkraftbrühe)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound beef bones, chopped in 3” to 4” pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 quarts water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ pounds shin or neck beef</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste pot vegetables</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons butter or rendered beef fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>meat extract</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page31"></a>Rinse bones and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then simmer slowly 1 hour. Add beef and salt, bring stock back to boiling point and simmer another hour, skimming foam as it rises to surface. Add all prepared pot vegetables except onion. Heat butter or fat in a small skillet, add onion, which has been finely diced, and fry slowly until deep brown. Do not let it blacken as it will then have a bitter taste. Add browned onion to soup. Simmer 45 minutes. Add meat extract by teaspoonful until soup is a rich brown color. Remove bones and meat and strain stock through a fine sieve. Cool and skim fat from surface. Store in refrigerator until you are ready to use it. The beef can be diced and served in soup, or it can be used for salad.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. German menus list a number of soups named for their garnishes. Liver Dumpling Soup (Leberknödelsuppe) is nothing more than a broth, usually beef, garnished with Liver Dumplings.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Marrow Dumpling Soup (Markklösschensuppe) is garnished with Marrow Dumplings; if it is called Fladensuppe it has the Pancake Strips described.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CLEAR VEAL BROTH (Kalbskraftbrühe)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow above recipe, substituting veal for beef. Cut total cooking time to 1½ hours. This stock is often used to cook vegetables, in which case it should be light in color. Therefore onion should not be browned before being added to soup. Just add whole onion along with other pot vegetables and eliminate butter or fat.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BONE STOCK (Knochenbrühe)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound veal or beef bones, chopped into 3” to 4” pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 quarts water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pot vegetables</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt-to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>meat extract</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rinse bones and cover with cold water. Bring to boiling point and simmer 1½ hours. Skim foam from surface, add pot vegetables and simmer another hour. Add salt to taste. Add meat extract a little at a time to achieve a rich color. Strain stock through fine sieve. If you want a more<a id="page32"></a>strongly flavored stock, fry onion until brown as described in recipe for Clear Beef Broth. And for an even stronger flavor, brown bones in a little fat before you cook them in water.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_8"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>VEGETABLE BROTH (Wurzelbrühe)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter or rendered beef or veal fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pot vegetables, all finely diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ quarts water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat butter or fat in skillet. Add diced vegetables and sauté until deep golden color. Add to cold water, bring to a boil and simmer 1 hour. Season to taste with salt, strain through fine sieve, and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CLEAR CHICKEN BROTH OR SOUP (Hühnerkraftbrühe oder Hühnersuppe)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">10 TO 12 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 5–6 pound fowl</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 veal knuckle (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 quarts water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pot vegetables</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash and singe chicken. It may be cooked whole, or quartered, depending on what you intend to do with it later. Put chicken and washed veal knuckle in cold water. Use a tall straight-sided soup pot so that water will cover chicken. Bring water to a boil, cover pot and let soup simmer slowly 1 hour, skimming foam from surface as it rises. Add pot vegetables and a couple of teaspoonfuls salt and simmer slowly another hour. Check seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Remove chicken and bone and strain soup through a fine sieve. Cool and skim fat from surface. Store in refrigerator or heat and serve. Chicken may be sliced or diced and served in soup along with one or another of the Einlagen described in the next chapter. It may also be used for salads, fricassee or pot pie. If you want a very clear, light soup, do not use veal knuckle or any other bones.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_10"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page33"></a><em>NOODLE SOUP WITH CHICKEN (Nudelsuppe mit Hühner)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Another of Germany’s most popular soups, this is a combination of the above chicken soup, garnished with slices of cooked chicken and boiled noodles—either fine or wide, packaged or homemade. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley and fresh dill over soup before serving. Add some carrots, celery and peas and this becomes a complete “one-pot meal.”</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 cups hot chicken broth</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and white pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pinch of nutmeg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup heavy sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup white wine</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt butter in saucepan and when hot and bubbly, stir in flour and cook until it turns bright golden. Gradually add hot chicken broth, stirring constantly so mixture stays smooth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Beat egg yolks into cream and add a little hot thickened chicken stock. Mix together and pour egg-cream mixture into remaining thickened stock that is very hot but which has been removed from flame. This can be reheated over a low flame very briefly, but be sure soup does not come to a boiling point, as egg will curdle. Check seasoning and add white wine slowly and to taste. If you prefer a slightly thicker soup, use 1 additional tablespoon flour and one more egg yolk.</p>

  <p class="indent">Possible garnishes: sliced mushroom caps sautéed in butter, slivered salted almonds, Veal Meat Balls or cooked shrimp with asparagus.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For Cream of Chicken Soup with Caraway, add 2 teaspoons caraway seeds to seasonings.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For Cream of Chicken and Spinach Soup, cook 1 pound of spinach<a id="fn2a"></a><a class="hlink" href="#fn2"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a> with a small piece of onion in salted water. Drain and purée through a sieve. Add to soup before adding egg yolks and cream. Heat thoroughly and then thicken with eggs and cream.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Use giblets from chicken, duck, turkey, goose or any combination of these.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 pounds giblets (gizzards, necks, hearts, wings and feet—no livers)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 quarts water, or chicken, veal or bone stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup pearl barley, washed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 or</em> 3 <em>dried mushrooms, soaked and drained (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Place washed giblets in 3-quart pot, along with pot vegetables and a little salt and water or stock. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer slowly 1 hour. Skim off any foam that rises to surface. Add barley and, if you are using them, dried mushrooms cut into tiny pieces or chopped. Simmer 30 minutes, or until barley is cooked. Check seasoning.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Turkey, Duck or Goose Soup can be made the same way, using the leftover carcass of poultry, with or without giblets. Cook carcass with vegetables and proceed. After the first hour of cooking, remove carcass, pick off meat, which you return to soup, and discard bones.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is the favorite midnight snack of the Bavarians. It is served in bowls or in individual pewter casserole-porringers in the crowded Munich beer halls. To be at its best, this soup should be made the day before you intend to serve it.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound beef (chuck, shin, neck)</em></p>

Sprinkle with salt, pepper and vinegar and stir in tomato paste. Simmer 3 or 4 minutes, then add caraway seeds, marjoram, garlic and water. Bring to boiling point, cover and simmer gently 45 minutes, or until meat is almost done. Add diced potatoes and cook slowly 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until meat and potatoes are thoroughly cooked. Check seasoning and serve in deep bowls.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This soup is almost always purchased in cans for home use in Germany. Cut any turtle meat that is in the can into bite-size pieces, return to soup and heat thoroughly but do not boil. Just before serving, add madeira to taste and garnish each portion with a very thin slice of lemon. In Germany this soup is served in white Mokkatassen—white mocha-coffee cups that are between a regular coffee cup and a demitasse in size. A standard coffee cup would do here. As the soup is very rich and also expensive, a small portion is all that is ever served.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Hans Karl Adams, one of Germany’s foremost chefs, who appeared on television and operated the charming old Adams’ Hotel and Restaurant in that medieval set-piece of a town, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, served the following delectable version of turtle soup. Using a canned turtle soup, cut meat into bite-size pieces, return to soup and heat thoroughly but do not boil. Remove from stove and for each pint of soup add one egg yolk that has been beaten with 3 or 4 tablespoons of heavy sweet cream. Stir in madeira to taste and garnish each portion with a tablespoonful of lightly salted whipped cream.</p>

When butter begins to bubble, add diced celery and sauté slowly until it begins to turn light golden color and softens. Stir with a wooden spoon so celery sautés evenly. Sprinkle flour over celery and stir until absorbed. Sauté until flour turns bright yellow; do not let it brown. Cover pan and braise 5 to 10 minutes over very low heat, stirring once or twice. Pour water or stock into pot. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily about ½ hour, or until celery is completely tender. Pour through a sieve and purée celery, either through a strainer or in a blender. Return celery and stock to pot and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Simmer 3 or 4 minutes, stir in cream, check seasoning again and simmer another few minutes. Serve with minced parsley or slivered salted almonds sprinkled on top of each portion.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">People crowded into Aschinger’s in Berlin all day long for this soup. They picked it up, cafeteria style, and carried it to one of the little round island counters, where they ate it standing up. The miracle seemed to be that no one ever spilled the soup that was so brimful in the plates—or at least no one ever did when I was there. The least expensive version of this was Erbsensuppe ohne—literally, pea soup without, meaning with no garnish. The most expensive had everything: ham, bits of bacon, slices of wurst, Spätzle or Sponge Dumplings.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is one dish where “eating is believing.” For years I read about the unlikely combination of ingredients that went into Hamburg Eel Soup, and each version sounded more improbable than the last. Finally I went to the bustling, exciting “Free and Hanseatic city” and tried it for myself. Fortunately, I did so in Weinhaus Dölle’s, a handsome, impeccable old restaurant with dark oak paneling and big comfortable leather-cushioned booths, unfortunately, no longer in existence. The proprietor was very generous about giving me the following recipe for it.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 to 10 prunes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 to 10 dried apricot halves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 smoked ham bone (preferably a meaty one) and rind</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 quarts water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 carrots</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small knob celery root</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 leek</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>7 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon baúl</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon thyme</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon marjoram</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon leaf savory</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pint white wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound eel, skinned and cut into</em> 3” <em>pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 to 5 tablespoons vinegar, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons raspberry jam, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Soak prunes and apricots in warm water to cover 2 or 3 hours. Put ham bone and rind in 3 quarts cold water, bring to boiling point and simmer slowly 1½ hours. Remove rind and discard; cut meat from bone into small cubes. Let stock cool and skim fat from surface. Clean carrots, celery root and leek, and dice finely. Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet and sauté vegetables slowly until they begin to soften and take on a deep golden color. Add vegetables to ham stock. Heat 4 tablespoons butter and in it sauté finely diced onion until deep brown. Sprinkle <a id="page47"></a>flour over this and blend in with butter, stirring over low flame until mixture is deep cocoa brown. Be very careful not to let it scorch. Add this with basil, thyme, marjoram, savory and salt to stock and simmer 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">While stock is simmering, bring white wine to boiling point with bay leaf and peppercorns. Add eel, simmer 10 minutes and set aside. Add diced ham and drained fruits to soup, along with vinegar and 1 cup white wine in which eel was cooked. (Do not remove pits from prunes or they will get mushy.) Stir in raspberry jam. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes. Check and correct seasoning, adding salt, jam, vinegar, spices or wine as they might be needed. The soup should have a winey sweet-and-sour taste with a subtle interplay of flavors. Keep soup hot on very low light. To serve, remove eel from remaining stock and place in bottom of tureen or individual bowls and pour soup over it. Be sure that each person has a piece of eel, an apricot, a prune and a few Sponge Dumplings.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. This soup often includes green peas, although Dölle’s version did not. If you wish to use them, add 1 cup drained canned tiny green peas during last five minutes of cooking.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2 If you do not happen to have a ham bone and would like to try this soup, order 2 smoked ham hocks with rind from your butcher. Cut rind off and trim excess fat from under it. Cook rind and hock as described above.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. You can also make this without eel, in which case it cannot be called eel soup—naturally. Make it as directed, leaving out eel, and call it Hamburg Ham Soup, or Hamburg Sour Soup. Add bay leaf to soup with other spices, and 1 cup white wine during last 10 minutes of cooking. This is an excellent way to utilize a leftover ham bone.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page48"></a>Pour beer into a bowl and let stand at room temperature for about 3 hours, or until beer gets flat. Pour into 1½-quart saucepan and heat. Melt butter in a skillet until hot and bubbling and then stir in flour and sugar. Cook very slowly, stirring constantly until flour and sugar turn a rich caramel color. Be very careful, as sugar can burn and blacken quite suddenly. Add this to hot beer along with lemon rind and juice, cinnamon and cloves. Bring to a boil and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from stove and gradually stir in beaten egg yolks. Serve with Snow Balls.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This soup might sound a little strange, but it is one of the most delightful coolers you could imagine on a hot summer day. The packaged <a id="page50"></a>pudding to use for it is Junket Danish Dessert—a currant-raspberry pudding thickened with cornstarch instead of gelatin. Served in a cup, this chilled, frothy pink soup, garnished with a few fresh raspberries when possible, makes an excellent starter for a summer meal. Served in a tall glass, it becomes a light, easy-to-take, one-course summer luncheon.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Pour buttermilk into a blender or mixing bowl. Cook pudding in 2 cups water as directed on package. As soon as it is done, add to buttermilk along with sugar.

  <p class="nonindent">Although fruit soups are uncommon in this country, they are extremely popular in Middle Europe and Scandinavia. They are used even in winter, when they are made with fruit juices bottled the previous summer. Either hot or cold, they have a rich winey flavor and are served before meals or as between-meal refreshers. Since our fruit tends to have much less flavor than that of Europe, we use much less water <a id="page51"></a>when cooking the same amount of fruit. Be sure that any fruit you use for soup is fully ripened. Too often our markets sell only underripe fruit, and this will not produce a good soup. Wait until the fruit is at the peak of its season. Early fruits generally do not have as much flavor.</p>

  <p class="indent">When a German Hausfrau makes soup out of fruit like plums, cherries, apricots, peaches or nectarines, she usually includes a few of the stones of the fruit when she cooks it and then strains them out. The stones should be cracked before being added to the soup. To do that, wrap them in a twist of doubled or tripled cheesecloth, hold by the twisted “neck” and hit the cloth-covered stones with a hammer. The cloth prevents the pieces from scattering all over the room. The stones add additional flavor to the soup but are not absolutely essential.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds ripe cherries, preferably dark Bings</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 cherry stones, crushed (see above)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>7 cups water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sugar, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 stick cinnamon (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice 1 long strip lemon peel</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons cornstarch</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons white wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to ¾ cup white wine</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Pit cherries over a bowl so you will not lose juice. Set aside 1 cup cherries. Cook remaining cherries in water about 20 minutes, or until completely soft. Rub through a fine sieve and return to soup. Add sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice and peel, tasting as you do so to achieve desired flavor. Dissolve cornstarch with white wine. Add this paste to soup and simmer 5 minutes. Stir so soup will remain smooth as it thickens. Remove lemon peel, and cinnamon if you have used it, add white wine to taste and check seasoning again. If the soup is to be eaten hot, it is now ready to serve. Otherwise, chill 2 hours. In either case, add some of the reserved raw cherries, coarsely chopped or cut in halves, to each portion of soup. Top with slightly sweetened whipped cream or sour cream. Serve with Soup Macaroons or zwieback.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">For a very tangy flavor, use ½ pound sour cherries and 1¼ pounds sweet cherries.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Substitute fruit of your choice for cherries in the recipe above. You may use one fruit alone, or a combination of several. With the exception of the apple, fruit soups look most inviting when they are red, so if you plan to use apricots, nectarines, peaches or rhubarb, combine them with something else. Cherries seem to make the most satisfactory of all the fruit soups, and second place goes to soup made of the soft, ripe red Santa Rosa plums that are in season in midsummer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Adjust the amounts of sugar and lemon according to the flavor of the fruit you use. Rhubarb soup will take at least 1 cup of sugar. Apple soup can be garnished with currants or raisins that have been soaked in a little white wine.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">There is a whole category of “soups” in Germany that are made with cereals such as oatmeal, rice, semolina or farina, buckwheat groats or kasha. To us, all of these would pass as breakfast cereals and I have not included specific recipes for them here. The cereals are cooked just as we would prepare them, either in salted water or milk. They are usually eaten hot with butter, sugar and cinnamon; or with cooked fruit compote and juice; or with raisins, chopped nuts and sugar. In some cases white wine is added to the cooking water and the cereal is then also served with fresh or cooked fruit or berries. Soups such as beef and chicken broth are often called oatmeal or buckwheat groat soup, when those cereals are served in them instead of noodles or rice.</p>

  <p class="indent">One also finds cooked cold cereal with fruit compote served in German homes as dessert after a light entree, and some are even raised into soufflés.</p>

  <p class="indent">A very special cereal that should be mentioned here has the rather lengthy name Dr. Bircher-Benner Schweizer Müsli—Dr. Bircher-Benner’s <a id="page53"></a>Swiss Muesli. It is a combination of oatmeal flakes and other grain along with chopped raisins, figs, nuts and lemon rind. It may be mixed at home, but a very good version comes already packaged under the above name. It is the invention of a Swiss nutritionist, Dr. Bircher-Benner, and is sold at health food stores and in gourmet food shops. It can be prepared as a breakfast cereal or a dessert, or can be used in making excellent cookies. Recipes are on the package itself.</p>
