    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page255"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind524a"/>In the remote <a id="ind657a"/>Westfjords,</span></span> <a id="ind530a"/>Saltverk offers hope that even if a tradition disappears, it is not necessarily gone forever. The owners were engineers before they stumbled on a long-forgotten era of Icelandic history and decided to give up their careers to revive a lost tradition. In the same spot where Saltverk now stands, the Danish, who once colonized Iceland, produced salt for the kingdom from the ocean water that laps at the edge of the production center and the geothermal heat billowing up from the earth.</p>
<p class="extract">The production is simple: The ocean water is pumped into large drying tanks that are heated geothermally. The water slowly evaporates, leaving behind large salt crystals that are transferred to drying racks, where they finish dehydrating. The anemic records left behind by the Danes offered little guidance to the new salt makers on how to create the ideal salt crystal, and discovering the perfect formula demanded trial and error. Being a salt maker in this remote area is a lonely business. Even the owners of Saltverk have sometimes wondered if they made the right decision. In spite of such doubts, they have persevered with their mission to revive a lost tradition, and today they have no regrets.</p>
<p class="extract">It seemed a fool’s errand when <a id="ind78a"/>Björn Stigursson and his business partner first decided to become salt makers with nothing more to work from than old records unearthed hundreds of years after the first salt producers left their shovels, seawater, and geothermal steam behind. The salt produced in the past and now is winter white and flaky, with a pristine flavor neutral enough to form the foundation of a dish and noble enough to finish it.</p>
<p class="extract">Today, white-and-blue boxes of Saltverk salt can be found in virtually every Icelandic pantry, and its owners struggle not with convincing people to buy their salt but with keeping up with demand. Gunnar likes Saltverk salt because of the refined finish it gives his dishes. But he also loves it for the story he can share with his guests about the engineers turned salt makers who revived a long-forgotten tradition.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c11-s78"><a id="page256"/><span class="dk_blue">An Interview with Salt Maker Björn Stigursson</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What makes your salt different from any other salt?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Our salt is the first artisanally produced salt in the world that uses 100 percent geothermal energy to produce it. Nothing but pristine Icelandic seawater is pumped into our facility, which is just a few feet from the shoreline, and there the heat transforms the water into our salt. It’s very clean, flaky salt—and we hope one of the best produced in the world.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What is your history?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I was a professional in <a id="ind503a"/>Reykjavík before making the decision to found Saltverk with my business partner. We stumbled on some seventeenth-century documents recounting a salt-making business in the exact spot we are located today. Denmark once colonized Iceland, and the salt company was started by the Danish king to produce enough salt to meet the needs of the Icelandic bacalao business, as salted fish was an important export for the Danes. Salt making was established in the town of <a id="ind493a"/>Reykjanes in the <a id="ind658a"/>Westfjords because of its proximity to the ocean and to the geothermal heat needed to produce it. The Danish empire sent the salt makers, tools, and calcium from Norway needed to produce over eighty tons of salt per year. Eventually, the Danes stopped making salt here, but the Icelanders continued to do so until the nineteenth century. I wanted to do something new, and when I discovered this long-forgotten tradition, reviving it seemed like a fulfilling challenge.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Why has there always been a lack of salt in Iceland?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">You would assume, because Iceland is surrounded by an ocean, that salt would be plentiful. But you need heat to make salt, and that usually means either wood to make fires or strong, steady sunlight. Iceland has a shortage of wood and a lack of sun, which means it was nearly impossible to make salt before this innovative geyser-heat method was discovered.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you produce your salt?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We pump the 97°C [206°F] geyser water in from the Reykjanes hot springs and use it to preheat, boil, and dry our salt. It is incorporated from the beginning to the end of the process. This means that our carbon emissions are zero, something we are very proud of.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page257"/>What was the initial reaction to your salt?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">At first, it was a bit of a challenge to convince Icelanders to try something new. But soon they came around and seemed to appreciate that we had revived a tradition that had once been so important to our heritage. Now our salt can be found in almost every supermarket in the country, and it is gratifying to know that Icelanders have so fully embraced it.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What are some of the challenges you currently face?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">One of the biggest challenges right now is keeping up with demand. We supply many of the restaurants and markets in both Iceland and Copenhagen, and it is hard to find the balance between saying yes to orders and knowing how you will fulfill them. We now produce our original salt, a lava salt, an arctic thyme salt, a licorice salt, and a birch-smoked salt. At first, it was lonely making salt in the remote <a id="ind659a"/>Westfjords, and we wondered how well it would be received. We now have the opposite problem and find ourselves worrying about how we can produce more salt while still maintaining our commitment to quality. But I am not complaining. It is not a bad problem to have.</p>

<h2 class="Recipe_Title" id="c11-s79"><a id="page258"/><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind528a"/>SEA SALT</span></h2>
<div class="yield">MAKES 1½ CUPS (340 G) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 24 HOURS, DEPENDING ON HUMIDITY</div>
<div class="headnote1">Gunnar is obsessed with making his own sea salt and is a firm believer that where it is sourced defines how it will taste. He has collected salt from virtually every corner of Iceland and is committed to a few areas where he feels the ocean is the purest and the filtration is the most robust. It’s a lesson for what criteria to look for should you decide to make your own salt at home, and although you might not have water as pristine as what laps the shores of Iceland, it’s likely you will discover a source close to home if you live near the sea.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Once you’ve collected your seawater, producing salt is surprisingly easy, and it makes a unique gift. Flavor it with ingredients in the same way the owners of <a id="ind531a"/>Saltverk do. Everything from dried herbs to dried flower petals to smoked and powdered tree leaves will work. The other bonus to making your own salt is that once the ocean water is at a vigorous boil, your home will smell of the coastline from which the seawater was sourced.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>7 quarts (7 L) seawater from a pure source</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the salt, line a fine-mesh sieve with a coffee filter, place it over a large pot, then pour the water through the filter to remove any silt and sediment. Bring the pot of water to a boil over high heat and boil for about 30 minutes to encourage the reduction process to begin. Turn down the heat to a lazy simmer, maintaining the water temperature between 189°F and 194°F (87°C and 90°C). Continue to reduce for about 5 hours, until the water is 1 to 1½ inches (2.5 to 4 cm) deep and a salt skin has formed on the surface. Your house will smell briny and you will swear you’re spending the day at the beach.</div>
<div class="method">Lower the heat to its lowest setting to prevent scorching and continue to reduce the liquid until the salt begins to crystallize on the bottom of the pot and resembles wet sand. Depending on the humidity, this can take an additional 1½ to 2½ hours.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer both the liquid and solids to an unlined rimmed baking sheet or tray and place it in a warm place, such as next to the stove or on top of an unused burner until the remaining liquid has evaporated. The amount of time required depends on the humidity and warmth of the kitchen.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the salt to an opaque container with a tight-fitting cap and store in a dry, dark environment. The salt will keep indefinitely.</div>

<div class="Essays" id="c11-eass20">
<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">A HISTORY WITH <a id="ind176a"/>DENMARK</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The Danes colonized Iceland for centuries, and as a result many benchmark Icelandic dishes are actually interpretations of Danish recipes. Everything from soups and breads to roasted meats and vegetable dishes have ties to the Danish kitchen. Most Icelandic pastries are directly linked to Denmark, and some people in Iceland insist that Icelandic bakers now make better Danish pastries than the Danes themselves. Many Icelanders speak fluent Danish and many also work in Denmark for at least a few years during their careers, including Gunnar, who cooked in Copenhagen for several years. The two countries are necessary allies and, also, both fiercely independent.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">A contemporary example of Denmark and Iceland collaborating to improve the conditions of both nations is the <a id="ind367a"/>Manifesto for a New Nordic Kitchen, which was spearheaded by Danish chefs <a id="ind376a"/>Claus Meyer and René <a id="ind488a"/>Redzepi and was signed by chefs throughout the region. It declares a commitment to sourcing ingredients as locally as possible and to celebrating the virtues of the region’s many culinary resources.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Gunnar was the first chef to introduce the tenents of the manifesto to Iceland, and at first he faced resistance from a population that preferred to continue to import expensive foods and ignore its own resources. But with the economic collapse of 2009, less expensive Icelandic products became more appealing, which ushered in a newfound appreciation for Gunnar’s mission.</p>

<div class="headnote1">Iceland has a long history with the <a id="ind225a"/>Faroe Islands, which lie about 450 miles to the southeast. Today, one of the most valuable resources this tiny archipelago of eighteen islands provides its bigger neighbor is scallops. They grow large and winter white in the brisk Faroe waters, and are showcased in this recipe two ways: marinated and dried. The dried and powdered scallops also make an excellent seasoning for salads, vegetables, and fish.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">The anise flavor of the fennel pairs wonderfully with the brininess of the scallops, and the bright orange carrots offer a stunning contrast to the snowy white shellfish. This recipe calls for baking carrots in a canning jar, which sounds dangerous but is no different than roasting foods in a ceramic container. The cooking process marries the carrots with the seasonings, infusing them with flavor in the same intense way that immersion cooking does but without using an expensive piece of equipment. Gunnar garnishes this dish with flakes of <a id="ind532a"/>Saltverk just before service, its crunch reminding guests with every bite that this recipe was born of the sea.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the marinated scallops, preheat a dehydrator to 150°F (66°C). Trim the scallops, removing the muscle from each one, and reserve the trimmings for dehydrating; you should have 1¾ ounces (50 g). If any scallop is particularly small or doesn’t look good, add it to the trimmings as well. Slice the whole scallops in half horizontally and season with salt and oil. Refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the dried scallops, arrange the scallop trimmings in a single layer on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate for 12 hours, until crispy. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a powder. The powder will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page261"/>To make the celery and fennel salad, prepare an ice bath. Thinly slice the celery and fennel lengthwise on a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>). Transfer the slices to the ice bath, immersing them, and leave for about 20 minutes, until chilled and crisp. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer the slices to a bowl, season with salt, and then toss with just enough oil to make them glisten. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the carrot salad, preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C). Trim the carrots until just long enough to fit inside a canning jar. Stand the carrots in the jar and add the rosemary, cloves, and cinnamon. Fill the jar with oil, secure the lid in place, and bake for about 1 hour, until the carrots are cooked through but just tender. Drain the carrots immediately, being careful not to let the hot oil splatter; you may discard the oil or save it for another use. Once the carrots are cool enough to handle, slice them in half lengthwise. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the carrot puree, preheat an immersion circulator to 183°F (84°C). Season the carrots with salt, place the carrots and oil in a vacuum bag, and seal on the medium-high setting. Cook in the circulator for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until tender. To test for doneness, pinch a carrot through the bag. If it is tender and you are able to easily pinch through it, the carrots are ready. Remove the bag from the circulator, and when cool enough to handle, transfer the contents to a blender. Begin processing on low speed to prevent the hot mixture from splattering. Once the elements are incorporated, increase the speed to high and continue to process until smooth. Season with vinegar until the flavor is bright.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the scallops and celery and fennel salad on plates and spoon the carrot puree alongside. Place a small spoonful of the carrot salad next to the puree and garnish the plate with dill and crème fraîche. Season everything with the powdered scallops and sprinkle with sea salt.</div>

<div class="headnote">The combination of beets, pine, and roses might leave some cooks scratching their heads, but the trio proves congenial for this vibrantly colored, explosively flavored recipe. The red of the beets and the addition of roses make this an ideal dish for a romantic evening when the standard romance recipes seem overdone. There are several ways to hay smoke beets (see <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#page265">photos</a> at right and <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-fig40">photos</a>); however, for this dish the beets are baked under a cap of dough that ensures they will retain their juices as they cook and will marry with the fragrance of pine. They are a perfect pairing for a white fish such as halibut or cod, and lovely on their own, too.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Generous 1 pound (500 g) medium red beets, trimmed, scrubbed, and dried</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Hay, <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-eass6">for smoking</a></strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>7 (6-inch) pine tree twigs, rinsed well under ice-cold water to remove residue and sap</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Scant 1 cup (250 g) plus 4 teaspoons salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>⅔ cup (150 ml) water</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup (240 ml) cider vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>⅓ cup (75 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Petals from 3 chemical-free rose heads</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the beets, preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Cover the bottom of a small, deep roasting pan with hay about 2 inches (5 cm) deep. Distribute 6 of the pine twigs evenly over the hay. Arrange the beets on top.</div>
<div class="method">In a bowl, stir together the scant 1 cup (250 g) of salt, the flour, and the water to form a dry dough. Dust a work surface with flour and transfer the dough to it. Roll out the dough ¼ inch (6 mm) thick and wide and long enough to extend beyond the rim of the roasting pan by 2 inches (5 cm) on all sides (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-note43">see note</a>).</div>
<div class="method">Carefully transfer the dough sheet to the pan, covering the top and then pinching the edges of the dough to the rim of the pan to seal securely. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to 350°F (180°C) and continue to bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the dough sheet is baked through but not golden brown. The sheet’s surface will harden and begin to develop thin cracks once it is cooked through. At this stage the beets should be barely cooked through. Remove from the oven, let cool to room temperature, and then remove and discard the dough sheet. Wearing plastic gloves to prevent staining your hands with beet juice, peel the beets, cut them into bite-size pieces, and transfer them to a large glass jar with an airtight lid.</div>
<div class="method">In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the vinegar and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Add the remaining pine twig and bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat, add the rose petals and the remaining 4 teaspoons of salt, and stir gently until the salt has dissolved. Let cool to room temperature. Pour the cooled mixture over the beets, immersing them. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 24 hours before using. The beets will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</div>

<div class="headnote1">This recipe is the ideal composition for a holiday feast or for any other festive cold-weather occasion. Here, Gunnar creates his version of a Nordic spring roll, with the goose tucked inside a pickled beet casing for an appetizer guests won’t soon forget.

<div class="method"><a id="page267"/>To make the pickled beets, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the beet slices, blanch for a few seconds, and, using a slotted spoon, transfer to a small heatproof glass jar. Combine the cherry vinegar, sugar, water, and pine twig in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the beets, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cap tightly and refrigerate for 1 week. Drain and discard the pickling liquid just before serving.</div>
<div class="method">To make the goose, melt enough butter with oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat to coat the pan bottom lightly. Season the goose legs with salt, add to the hot pan, and fry, turning once, until just golden on both sides. Preheat an immersion circulator to 172°F (78°C). Place the salt, sugar, water, cinnamon stick, juniper, cloves, pine twig, stock, and goose legs in a vacuum bag and seal at the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for 16 hours. Remove the bag from the circulator, then remove the legs from the bag and discard the remaining contents. When the legs are cool enough to handle, bone them, discarding the bones and skin, and finely shred the meat.</div>
<div class="method">Heat the burned butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté for about 7 minutes, until caramelized. Add the goose meat and stir to combine. Season with salt and beer vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pine tree oil, combine the oil and pine needles in a blender and process on high speed for 10 minutes, until steaming hot and completely blended. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for 12 hours. Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and strain the oil through it. Transfer to a squeeze bottle and refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the blackberries, whisk together the sugar and water until the sugar has dissolved. Place the berries in a bowl, pour the sugar syrup over the top, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour, then drain.</div>
<div class="method">To make the red beet juice, combine the beet juice, honey, pine twig, and cherry vinegar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for 15 to 17 minutes, until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, and keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the raw beets, prepare an ice bath. Using a cutter 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, punch out 1 disk from each beet slice. Transfer the disks to the ice bath until ready to serve.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pine salt, heat a small, dry frying pan over medium-high heat, add the pine needles, and sauté until blackened. Let cool, transfer to a spice grinder, add the salt, and grind to a powder. (If your spice grinder is small, you will need to grind the salt in batches.) The salt will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 month at room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, roll up the goose meat in the pickled red beet slices, as you would roll a spring roll. Arrange 2 rolls on a plate with the raw beets and blackberries alongside. Drizzle with the pine tree oil and beet juice, sprinkle everything with a light dusting of pine salt, and garnish with arctic thyme.</div>

<div class="headnote1">Gunnar likes using the offcuts of animals that many other chefs discard. For him, the most symbolic of these is the heart, with its pronounced notes of iron and its rich, dark meat. Because of the cultural significance of the heart, many people shy away from eating it. But if you try it just once, you will discover just how tasty it is. The good news is that the heart is a fairly lean cut. The bad news is that its interior contains bits of sinew and connective tissue that you need to remove before cooking.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">You will need to plan ahead to make the <a id="ind112a"/>salted cabbage, as it must sit for a few months. You can substitute sauerkraut in its place, draining it well and seasoning it with rapeseed oil. Icelandic moss and heather (<em>mosi og lyng</em> in Icelandic) are also called for in this recipe. The moss <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_bm1_r1.htm#bm1-K16">isn’t really a moss at all</a>, but a lichen that has sustained Icelanders through many cold winters. It can be difficult to source outside of Iceland but is available online. No good substitute exists, so if you cannot find it, you can simply omit it. Heather grows in some parts of Iceland and should be fairly easy to find elsewhere in the world. It can be ordered online, as well, and is a beautiful garnish for savory dishes and desserts alike.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the salted cabbage, in a large bowl, toss the cabbage with the salt until evenly coated, then transfer to a crock, small bucket, or other container. Select a heavy plate or similar weight that is the same diameter as the container and place it on the cabbage. Let stand at room temperature for 5 hours.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page271"/>Remove the plate, cover the crock with a cotton cloth or a double layer of cheesecloth, and store in a cool, dark place for 3 months, occasionally skimming off any scum that collects on the surface beneath the cheesecloth, and replacing the cheesecloth once every 2 weeks. It should not need any additional liquid since the cabbage will release liquid on its own, but should it become dry, add a saltwater solution with a ratio of eight parts water to one part salt until the liquid covers the cabbage completely. Drain the cabbage before seasoning it with oil. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. Before serving, season with more oil if needed.</div>
<div class="method">To make the lamb heart, using a paring knife, trim the exterior of each heart of any excess fat or connective tissue, then cut each heart in half lengthwise. Cut away any additional fat, tough tissue, and knobby bits, working as deeply as possible with breaking apart any ventricles. Preheat an immersion circulator to 136°F (58°C). Place the hearts, burned butter, pomegranate seeds, and ½ teaspoon of salt in a vacuum bag and seal on medium. Cook in the circulator for 1½ hours. Remove the bag from the circulator, and when cool enough to handle, remove the hearts from the bag and discard the remaining contents. Slice the hearts into ¼-inch (6-mm) strips and season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cabbage puree, melt the butter in a <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass2">pressure cooker</a>. Add the cabbage, garlic, shallot, baking soda, and a little salt, lock the lid in place, bring to medium pressure, and cook for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are caramelized and tender. Let the pressure release naturally, then remove the lid and drain the contents well, reserving the solids and liquid separately. Transfer the solids to a blender and process on high speed to a puree, adding a little of the cooking liquid if necessary to achieve a smooth consistency. Season with salt and beer vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the raspberry sauce, put the sugar in a small, heavy saucepan, place over low heat, and heat, swirling the pan, until caramelized. Do not stir the sugar to prevent scorching. When the sugar is a good amber, slowly and carefully add the cherry vinegar while stirring constantly. Simmer over low heat until syrupy, then add the berries and stir until well coated. Stir in the burned butter and season with salt and with more vinegar, if needed.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the salted cabbage on plates and spoon the cabbage puree alongside. Place the lamb heart slices on top of the salted cabbage and drizzle everything with the raspberry sauce. Garnish with a sprinkle of heather and moss ash and a little arctic thyme.</div>

<div class="headnote">Gunnar uses his own <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-s79">homemade salt</a> or, if he does not have enough on hand, kosher salt, to bake the celery root in this dish. The salt is added to a simple flour-and-water dough that he uses to cover the celery root as it slowly caramelizes in the oven to a juicy-sweet conclusion. Rutabaga or parsnip can be substituted for the celery root. Other flavors in this recipe include pickled celery root for brightness and a spiced glaze that lacquers the lamb belly in a cloak of birch and thyme.

<p class="IL_item"><strong>Cider vinegar, for seasoning</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled celery root, bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the celery root, blanch for 1 minute, and drain. Transfer the celery root to a small heatproof glass jar. Combine the cider vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the celery root, immersing it. Let cool to room temperature, then cap tightly and refrigerate for 1 week before using. Just before serving, drain, cut into bite-size pieces, and sprinkle with the fennel and salt.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page273"/>To make the lamb belly, trim the belly until it is about ½ inch (12 mm) thick. Lay the belly flat on a work surface and sprinkle evenly with the thyme and birch. Roll up the belly tightly. Lay the rolled belly, seam side down, atop 4 evenly spaced lengths of butcher’s twine long enough to tie around the rolled belly. Securely tie each length of twine around the roll, then snip off any loose ends.</div>
<div class="method">To make the brine for the belly, combine the salt, granulated sugar, and water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place the belly and the brine in a vacuum bag and seal on the highest setting to ensure that the belly is completely covered with brine (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-note44">see notes</a>). Refrigerate for 12 hours.</div>
<div class="method">Remove the belly from the refrigerator, then remove the belly from the bag and discard the brine. Pat the belly dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Rub the belly with the oil, place in a roasting pan, and roast for 4 hours.</div>
<div class="method">Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, add the brown sugar, and cook until the sugar has dissolved (the sugar may still be slightly granulated even after it has dissolved). Brush with about half of the butter-sugar glaze over the lamb belly and continue to roast for another 2 hours. Brush with the remaining glaze (it might have to be reheated to melt the butter), turn up the oven heat to 400°F (200°C), and roast for 5 more minutes. Let the belly rest for 10 minutes before removing the twine and thinly slicing for serving.</div>
<div class="method">To make the sauce, put the sugar in a small, heavy saucepan, place over medium heat, and heat, swirling the pan, until an amber syrup forms. Add the beer vinegar and cook until reduced by three-fourths (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-note44">see notes</a>). Remove the pan from the heat and add the schnapps. Return the pan to the heat and add the stocks, bay leaf, thyme, and birch twig and cook until reduced by half. You should have just over ½ cup (120 ml) of liquid. Stir in the butter until incorporated, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, and let cool to room temperature. Season with salt and cider vinegar. Reheat just before serving.</div>
<div class="method">To make the baked celery root, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Arrange the celery root in a single layer on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan. In a bowl, stir together the salt, flour, and water to form a dry dough. Dust a work surface with flour and transfer the dough to it. Roll out the dough ¼ inch (6 mm) thick and wide and long enough to extend beyond the rim of the pan by 2 inches (5 cm) on all sides (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#c11-note43">see note</a>).</div>
<div class="method">Carefully transfer the dough sheet to the pan, covering the top and then pinching the edges of the dough to the rim of the pan to seal securely. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to 350°F (180°C) and continue to bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until the dough sheet is cooked through but not golden. Remove from the oven and let cool until you can safely remove the dough sheet, then remove the dough and discard. Using a cutter of choice, cut the celery root slices into the size desired. Season with fennel, salt, oil, and cider vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange thin slices of the lamb belly on plates. Arrange the pickled celery root and salt-baked celery root alongside. Drizzle the sauce in between the elements on the plate.</div>
<div class="note" id="c11-note44">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">THE <a id="ind235a"/><a id="ind290a"/>HÁKARL TRADITION</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">When people hear that you’re writing a cookbook about Icelandic food, one of the first questions they often ask is if it includes a recipe for rotten shark. Iceland’s notorious <a id="ind553a"/>preserved shark tradition trumps nearly everything else people know about Icelandic food, and they usually assume that Icelanders eat the strong-smelling fish every day. It couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Although opaque ivory cubes of <em>hákarl</em> are sold in most supermarkets, this specialty is primarily appreciated by the older generations, who recall a time when eating in Iceland meant trying to survive the long winters and regular vegetable shortages.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The process of making <em>hákarl</em> is not a pleasant one. It calls for catching the shark, hacking up its white flesh into large rectangles, fermenting the flesh in a lye solution, and then hanging it to dry in an open-air wooden house on the edge of the ocean. It dries there for several months, and in the process, it rots.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The flesh of the Greenland shark contains unusually high levels of urea and of trimethylamine oxide, which turns into toxic trimethylamine (TMA) in our digestive process. The flesh of a shark cannot be eaten raw due to this TMA; the only way to make it edible is to allow it to decay, eliminating the toxicity. The process results in an odor that smells like the dirtiest cat litter box imaginable. The mildest <em>hákarl</em> tastes like an extra-strong Stilton cheese, but this is only if you brainwash yourself into believing that before you try it. It is unappetizing to most palates and noses, but for some, it is a reminder of when food meant survival, and survival meant being clever with the few resources available.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent"><a id="page275"/>Iceland’s earliest settlers did not find the country’s fierce winds and large stretches of unfarmable terrain a welcoming environment. The conditions forced them to be inventive with how they prepared their foods, which include pickled lamb testicles; fermented seal blubber; whale blubber preserved in whey; lamb heart wrapped in lamb intestines and covered in suet, then eaten raw; liver sausage either smoked or preserved in whey; sheep’s head cut in half and either eaten raw or preserved in whey; and blood pudding.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Younger generations rarely eat these foods today, but for the older generations, they remain symbols of perseverance in difficult times. Today, at the festival of <a id="ind627a"/>Thorrablot, traditional foods—meats, fish, and pickled vegetables—are washed down with the caraway-spiked schnapps known as <em><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-eass22">brennivín</a></em>.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Thorrablot is a relatively new tradition, thought to have been started by a <a id="ind504a"/>Reykjavík-based restaurateur who wanted to give tourists a taste of the foods of the past. The idea took off, and Thorrablot celebrations are now held in nearly every town and village in Iceland during late February. They pay tribute to the older generations who were resilient and tenacious enough to survive and pass on to their descendants an easier life.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">A few <em>hákarl</em> producers are still working in Iceland today. One of the most revered is <a id="ind308a"/>Hildibrandur Bjarnason, a seventy-year-old-plus gentleman with a white shock of hair, a ready smile, smooth skin that he attributes to shark oil, and a gleam in his eye that illustrates how much pleasure he derives from keeping an ancient Icelandic tradition alive.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">He dries his shark on a windy peninsula in the mosscovered lava fields of the <a id="ind588a"/>Snaefellsnes Peninsula, just as his family has done for decades. There is a shark museum on the property filled with relics that date to when Hildibrandur’s grandfather and father hunted the massive Greenland shark from a wooden boat not much longer than the fish they were catching.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Today, Hildibrandur doesn’t fish for the shark himself. He instead relies on fishing trawlers that accidentally catch a shark in their nets to drop one off occasionally. Due to the introduction of new regulations, the fishermen are no longer allowed to sell <em>hákarl</em> producers their bycatch. They must dump them back into the sea, even though they are dead. It is an unfortunate policy that has caused a shortage in <em>hákarl</em> and is one more step toward the tradition disappearing forever. Hildibrandur must now source closer to home, but as interest in the <em>hákarl</em> tradition wanes, so too does the availability of Greenland shark, since fewer people are fishing for them.</p>

<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you source your shark?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The boats don’t go out to fish shark specifically. When the larger German boats were fishing for other things, they would sometimes catch shark in their nets near Greenland, but now due to a conflict between Greenland and Germany, the shark they used to save for me is thrown back into the sea, already dead. The shark is a very clean animal and catches very few diseases, so it is a waste to be throwing it away when it could be used instead to make <em>hákarl</em>.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Did your family ever hunt for shark themselves?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, when my father hunted shark, the best time to fish for them was in January or February, when the sharks, who usually hunt in the deepest parts of the ocean, would come up closer to the surface because of the extreme cold and darkness of the season. My father would hunt for them in the wooden boat you can see in my shark museum. It was a cold and dangerous job, but it is our tradition and the only thing we know. My father and grandfather were both <em>hákarl</em> producers. At the age of twelve, I started fishing with my father, but every time I went out, I got seasick. I eventually got over it, but it was a difficult time for me.</p>
<p class="Answer">I came here to the <a id="ind589a"/>Snaefellsnes Peninsula from northern Iceland. My parents had a farm there, but they started fishing more than farming. One day the fish stopped coming, so we moved to a place where we could find them again, and along with this move came the shark. My father was getting old, and he wanted to move to an easier place to live. I am the oldest of ten siblings, five boys and five girls, and we all moved here together. I was the only one in my family left here. The others relocated abroad to receive an education, but they all eventually returned.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Are there any health benefits to eating <em>hákarl</em>?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I grew up eating <em>hákarl</em> every day and I still do. Sometimes I eat it in a rye bread sandwich with butter. When we were sitting down for dinner as children, each of us would be given a piece of it. We often ate it spread with skyr. Sometimes we also ate sour blood pudding with it.</p>
<p class="Answer"><a id="page277"/>Whenever I’m cutting it down after drying, I taste a sample from each portion to make sure it is good to eat. We compress the shark in a cooler for about six weeks before hanging it, and this compression can sometimes cause the shark to go bad. Shark is very nutritious and good for you, and I attribute my strong health to it. The oil from the shark is very good for arthritis, but that’s not all. It’s also good for bronchitis and for your skin. I believe shark is good for whatever ails you.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Is there a growing interest in the <em>hákarl</em> tradition?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, tourists do seem to be more interested. Icelanders are still purchasing <em>hákarl</em>, although it is mostly the older generation. It will take the younger generation to keep the tradition alive. But I believe in them and know they will not let it disappear. I just hope that once I am gone, there will be someone here to continue making it.</p>
