<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0003421"><a id="pg16" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>MY FAVOURITE INGREDIENTS</h2>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003422"><span class="small">GARLIC</span> <span class="font">&amp;</span> <span class="small">PARSLEY</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003423">Garlic and parsley are probably the two most important ingredients for me. There was a very famous Basque TV chef, Karlos Arguiñano, who I used to watch every afternoon. He always used to finish the plate of whatever he’d cooked with some parsley leaves: that’s a very Basque thing. In the north of Spain, we add garlic and parsley to everything. When you go to the butcher, they chuck a bunch of parsley into your bag for free; my mum would always keep a bunch of parsley in the fridge in a glass of water. Picking parsley leaves and peeling garlic were the first things I learned to do in the kitchen, and 90% of the savoury recipes in this book contain garlic and parsley, whether whole, or in the form of my special oil, <em class="calibre9">ajillo</em> (see <a href="part0212.html#pg283" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>). Why do I use garlic and parsley so much? Because they enhance the flavour of whatever I’m cooking, without dominating it – unlike smoked paprika (<em class="calibre9">pimentón</em>), which is typically associated with Spanish cooking but has a very prominent flavour. You might not be able to discern them but they lift everything they are added to.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003424"><span class="small">WINE</span> <span class="font">&amp;</span> <span class="small">ALCOHOL</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003425">When you add alcohol to your cooking, it changes everything. In Spain, we use a lot of alcohol in our cooking, because there’s always half a bottle knocking around. A splash of wine or sherry adds an extra element of flavour.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003426"><span class="small">TINNED GOODS</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003427">In Spain, our tinned produce – particularly fish – is of very high quality and is priced accordingly. Open any kitchen cupboard and you will be sure to find salted anchovies, <em class="calibre9">ventresca</em> (tuna belly), sweet <em class="calibre9">piquillo</em> peppers and white asparagus. Make a baguette with <em class="calibre9">ventresca</em> and you will be in heaven. Preserving these ingredients is labour-intensive. That’s why they are expensive. People have a better understanding of this now, but before they would be like, ‘£20 for a tin of tuna … what?’</p>
<p id="sab0003428" class="calibre10">Anchovies are hugely important in northern Spain. The season is short (from May to August), so after the fish are caught, time is spent readying them to be preserved. I visited one of the most famous suppliers in the region, Don Bocarte, who produce 4.8 million anchovies a year. Amazingly, their female employees do everything by hand – there are no machines. First, the anchovy heads are removed one by one, then the fish are placed in neat rows in buckets, layered with sea salt. These buckets are kept in a dry store – not a fridge – for a year before they are removed. The smell of the cured anchovies is unbelievable. It’s nutty, almost like <em class="calibre9">jamón</em>. I leant in to smell them, and I didn’t want to take my nose away! The salt, which turns a deep brown, is shaken off, and the anchovies are then carefully separated by size before being skinned, deboned and filleted and tinned – careful, painstaking work. At the end of the process, each of the workers places a label that looks like a raffle ticket with her personal number in the tin. That way, if anything is wrong with the anchovies in the tin, the company knows who filled it!</p>
