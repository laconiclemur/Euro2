<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">In Catalan,</span> escalivar <span class="italic">means “to grill”; another name for this dish is</span> rustifaci, <span class="italic">which means “roasted.” It was usual in Catalonia to cook all kinds of vegetables over wood embers in the fields and on beaches; that is also how they were cooked in the fireplace at home. Some, like onions and potatoes, were wrapped in foil and left in the ashes. This way of cooking gives vegetables a delicious smoky flavor, but today they are most often roasted in the oven.</span> Escalivada, <span class="italic">now usually made with eggplants and peppers alone, has become popular throughout Spain. It is dressed simply with olive oil and salt.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 medium-small eggplants</p>
<p class="qun">4 fleshy red bell peppers</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the eggplants and peppers on a sheet of foil on a baking sheet and prick the eggplants in a few places with a pointed knife to prevent them from bursting. Put the tray in a preheated 350°F oven. Take the peppers out after about 45 minutes, when they are soft (leave the eggplants in). Put them in plastic bags, and twist to seal the bag. Let steam and cool for 10 to 15 minutes to make the skin come away more easily. Take the eggplants out after about 1 hour, when they are soft.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel them, remove the seeds, and cut them into 8 strips each. Reserve the juices. Peel them and cut them into similar strips.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Arrange the vegetables in one layer on a serving plate, alternating the peppers and eggplants, and sprinkle with the olive oil and a little salt.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Cook the peppers and eggplants under the broiler or on a grill over glowing embers. Turn them occasionally until they are soft and blackened all over, then continue as above.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Cook 4 medium onions, not peeled, along with the eggplants and peppers. They will take longer to soften, about 1¼ hours. Peel them, cut them into wedges, and add them to the peppers and eggplants.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Garnish the dish with black olives and chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• In Aragon, a version of <span class="italic">escalivada</span> called <span class="italic">frigolla</span> uses tomatoes. Roast 4 tomatoes for about 10 minutes, until they are slightly soft. Peel them, and cut them into wedges, and add to the other vegetables.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• In Murcia, a similar dish called <span class="italic">ensalada asada</span> includes roasted eggplants, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and garlic cloves, all cut into small pieces. The vegetables are put in a low oven for up to 1½ hours, and each type is taken out when it is soft. They are dressed with olive oil and lemon juice.</p>
