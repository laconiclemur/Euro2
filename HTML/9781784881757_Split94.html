<h1 class="chapter">pasta &amp; gnocchi</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Just over the border into Lazio is the small town of Cerveteri where there are a collection of Etruscan tombs. Far from a dry and dull museum, the Italians have turned these tombs into a piece of theatre as they immerse you in a recreation of Etruscan life. It is brilliant and well worth a visit. It is here that you can see a relief sculpture of what seems to be early pasta making. The carving shows figures mixing flour and water next to a rolling pin and a cutting machine. The Etruscans created <i>pici</i>, a hand-rolled pasta still massively popular today.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">We watched Vincenzo Longhitano make <i>tortelli</i> (pasta parcels) in the Tuscan way as he has done for 40 years. He runs the tiny trattoria in Roccatederighi in the Grosseto area. He makes his pasta fresh every day for his customers as otherwise he feels it loses its flavour and texture. He seals the <i>tortelli</i> with a fork so that the grooves catch the <i>sugo</i> (sauce). Then he cuts <i>tagliatelle</i> (ribbons) with a knife to show it is made by hand and not by a machine. Finally, any off-cuts are made into <i>maltagliati</i> (misshapen pieces). Nothing is wasted.</p>
<p class="tx">Pasta and gnocchi are economical to make and actually not that difficult. Over the years, Giancarlo and I have taught hundreds of people to make them in our cookery school. If you have a small pasta machine you can make and cook pasta from start to finish in 30 minutes. Stuffed pasta takes a little longer, but in this chapter we show you how to make it.</p>
<p class="tx">As for the sauces, always have them hot and ready in a frying pan waiting for the pasta and not the other way around. If they are too dense, let them down with a little hot pasta water, or stock if you have it. Drain the pasta when it is just al dente (firm to the bite) and let it finish cooking in the sauce.</p>
