<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">The Canary Islands are different from the rest of Spain. These</span> seven volcanic islands and six islets lie in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, near the border between Morocco and Western Sahara. They were conquered by the kingdom of Castile during the fifteenth century, and settlers from the peninsula started occupying the land that had been inhabited by the Guanche, people of Berber origin. They built cities and planted sugarcane and grapevines initially using native slave labor. The islands became a stopping point on the way to and from the New World and a place for foreign merchants to trade.</p>
<p class="para">Today the main economy of the islands is tourism. The fantastical landscape, which ranges from volcanic desolation to green jungle, and the eternal spring weather attract millions of holidaying Europeans, along with workers from the Spanish mainland, South America, and Africa. Dishes with Spanish, North African, and Latin American influences appear in the Canary kitchen. The settlers were quick to plant products from the New World like the potato (they have twenty different varieties), corn, tomatoes, and chile peppers. The islands are famous for their <span class="italic">papas arrugatas,</span> or wrinkled potatoes (page 279), and for the Moroccan-style spicy sauces—green, red, and peppery <span class="italic">mojos</span> (page 280)—that accompany potatoes, vegetables, fish and seafood, and meat. <span class="italic">Gofio,</span> a porridge of ground barley, wheat, chickpeas, or corn, or sometimes a combination, was the staple food of the Guanche and is still an important part of the local cuisine.</p>
<p class="para">The subtropical climate allows the cultivation of oranges and lemons, apricots, peaches, almonds, wheat, barley, and corn. There are huge plantations of extra-sweet dwarf bananas, which were introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. More recently, the islanders have started to grow exotic fruits such as avocados, papayas, mangoes, kiwis, and pineapples. Palm honey is a rich golden syrup made from the sap of palm trees. Goats are a source of meat and of a variety of good cheeses. <span class="italic">Almogrote</span> is a soft paste of aged goat cheese with garlic, chile pepper, and olive oil, served on toast.</p>
<p class="para">The Canaries produce red and white wine. Their sweet Malmsey (Malvasia) wines were popular in England long ago—Shakespeare mentioned them often. They also make a high-quality rum from sugarcane.</p>
