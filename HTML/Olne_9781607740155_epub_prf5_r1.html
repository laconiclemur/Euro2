    <h1 class="chapter" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page71"></a><em><span class="color">Basic Preparations</span></em></h1>

    <p class="nonindent">Any French cooking manual contains a comprehensive chapter on basic preparations. Only those recurrent in this book are presented here. Those that occur only once are relegated to specific recipes.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="rh1">VEAL STOCK</h2>

    <p class="center">(<em>Fonds de Veau, Fonds Blanc, Blond de Veau</em>)</p>

    <p class="nonindent">A pure veal stock, properly executed, is the only impeccable, all-round basic stock. Ideally, a braising liquid or a sauce base should be an essence of the basic element in the preparation (woodcock glaze for woodcocks, venison stock for venison, etc.), but this leads us into theoretical cooking, for only past royalty was able to permit itself such luxury. A Beef Stock (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c22_r1.htm#page322"><em>pot-au-feu</em></a>) remains the best braising stock for beef, and its full-bodied flavor, less marked in personality than that of furred game, renders it satisfactory as a braising liquid for the latter. By the same token, chicken stock may be used in certain preparations of feathered game. Only veal stock, by virtue of the essentially anonymous character of the meat, can lend body and support to all other flavors without altering their basic personalities. It is a solid vehicle and catalyst that is never self-assertive. It serves also as a base for other stocks for, although one may not be able to sacrifice several pheasants to the preparation of an essence for one pheasant <em>salmis</em>, one may very easily enrich a veal stock by the addition of leftover carcasses (or heads, necks, giblets) from roast birds. The many recipes for braised vegetables may be properly made only with veal stock. Covered, it may be kept indefinitely in the refrigerator if one is careful to boil it every few days and transfer it to a clean <a id="page72"></a>container. I have never tried freezing it but see no reason why it should suffer from this treatment.</p>

    <p class="indent">The specific quantities of ingredients, although given, are of no importance. The important thing is that the result be as concentrated in aromatic essence as possible. For this reason, anything that takes up room in the stock pot without lending flavor should be eliminated—bones, in particular, with the exception of veal hock, which gives readily of its gelatin. For bones to be serviceable, one must make, first, a stock of bones which is allowed to cook for a good eight to ten hours, then use this liquid for moistening the veal.</p>

    <p class="indent">A veal stock that is moistened with another veal stock rather than water is, naturally, that much finer. A veal half-glaze (<em>demi-glace de veau</em>) is clear veal stock reduced to a light syrupy consistency. A veal glaze (<em>glace de veau</em>) is the half-glaze reduced (with regular changes to smaller saucepans) to its ultimate intensity. Although valuable, even essential, for certain preparations, these refinements, because of the time and expense involved, do not occur in the recipes in this book.</p>

    <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="prf5_01"><em><span class="color">Veal Stock</span></em></h2>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 4 pounds inexpensive gelatinous cuts of veal</em> (<em>rib tips, shank, neck, trimmings</em>)</p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 veal hock</em> (<em>knuckle</em>), <em>broken into pieces</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 1 pound carrots</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 large onions, one stuck with 2 cloves</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 leek (or 3 or 4 small—if not available, do without)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large sprig fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 branch celery</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large bouquet parsley (including roots, if possible)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful coarse salt (salt lightly because of the eventual reduction)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3–4 quarts water, depending on the form of the stock pot</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Ask your butcher to break up the veal hock with a cleaver. Keep the meat in fairly large pieces. Peel the carrots and the onions, leaving them whole (if the carrots are very large, cut them across in two). Stick one onion with the cloves. Slice off the roots of the leek, remove <a id="page73"></a>the tough, dark-green sections of the leaves and, with a small, sharply pointed knife, pierce the flesh halfway down, slitting upward through the tips of the leaves. Repeat this procedure two or three times so that the upper half of the leek is coarsely shredded but well intact. Wash well, swishing it around in a basin of water. Wash the celery branch and the parsley (scraping the roots, if there are any). Tie the leek, doubled in two, the branch of celery, the bay leaf and the parsley (plus the thyme, if it is in branches) into a bundle.</p>

    <p class="indent">Put the bones into the stock pot (preferably one of heavy enameled ironware or earthenware). Place the pieces of veal on top, and add enough cold water to cover generously (about 1½ inches above the meat). Place over a medium flame (if using earthenware, protect it with an asbestos mat and place over a high flame) and when just below boiling point, begin to skim. The scum will continue to rise to the surface. You may help it along from time to time by displacing slightly the pieces of meat and bones with a wooden spoon, but without stirring. Continue to skim as it rises. When a full boil is reached and no more scum rises, pour in a small glassful (about ⅓ cup) of cold water. Scum will begin to rise again. Continue to skim until the boil is reached again and pour in more cold water. Repeat the process twice more, or until no more scum rises after the addition of cold water. Add all the other ingredients, making certain that everything is submerged. Continue skimming until the boil is reached again, and regulate the heat so that, with the lid slightly ajar, the tiniest suggestion of a simmer is constantly maintained. (Even if you are on intimate terms with your stove, unless you are accustomed to this kind of preparation and know the precise intensity of flame necessary, this regulation will require 15 minutes to ½ hour of turning the fire slightly up or down and rechecking a few minutes later.) Leave to cook for a good 4 hours. Skim off the surface fat 3 or 4 times during this period, but never stir the contents or otherwise disturb them in any way.</p>

    <p class="indent">Gently pour the contents of the stock pot into a sieve lined with a couple of layers of cheesecloth, which has been placed over a large mixing bowl. Do not press or mash the debris in the sieve, but allow to drain well so that all the clear liquid passes through. Leave the broth to cool, and skim off all traces of fat from the surface.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page74"></a>BEEF STOCK</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Because the <em>pot-au-feu</em> produces a stock that is one of the basic elements in other culinary preparations and is also a meal in itself, the recipe is given in the main body of the book (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c22_r1.htm#page322">this page</a>). If it is prepared essentially for use as beef stock, cabbage and the refinement of adding tender spring vegetables will find no place in its preparation, nor need it undergo the double preparation recommended in the recipe. It may be made exactly like the veal stock, substituting gelatinous pieces of beef (tail, shank, chuck) for the veal.</p>

    <p class="indent">The <em>petite marmite</em>, or <em>poule au pot</em>, one or the other sometimes garnished by the appellation “Henri-IV,” is merely a <em>pot-au-feu</em> to which a hen has been added. A classical consommé is a <em>petite marmite</em> moistened with a <em>pot-au-feu</em> bouillon, completely degreased, and clarified by an additional couple of hours’ cooking with a mixture of egg whites and lean ground beef. Although it is truly ambrosial in character, none of the soup recipes in this book will require an equivalent expenditure of time or material.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="prf5.19">MIREPOIX</h2>

    <p class="nonindent"><em>Plats cuisinés</em> (which means, vaguely, those preparations that contain a number of elements and require a more or less involved cooking process—the term might be translated, “dishes cooked with art”) rest generally on an aromatic foundation of onions, carrots, thyme and bay leaf. Other aromas, quite as valuable, may too often be excluded, but these mentioned, in any case, lend the primary support to all stocks, <em>court-bouillons</em> and braised preparations, and, although the latter often require a stock as braising liquid, it is nonetheless reinforced by a new addition of these same elements. For those preparations in which the carrots remain as part of the garnish, the vegetables are simply cut up, but for the many dishes that are garnished otherwise, or only sauced, a <em>mirepoix</em> (or <em>matignon</em>, which is the same thing except that the vegetables <a id="page75"></a>are finely sliced rather than chopped) is used as the aromatic base. Some recipes (none in this book) call for an addition of chopped ham or salt pork. For preparations in which the sauce is passed separately, the vegetables may be chopped more coarsely. If the <em>mirepoix</em> is to remain in the body of the sauce, the vegetables should be chopped very finely and the woody core of the carrots should be first removed. The <em>mirepoix</em> may be prepared in quantity and kept in the refrigerator, but the preparation is so simple that it seems hardly worthwhile. I personally feel that it gains by a substitution of mixed herbs for thyme, but that is an affair of taste, and the following recipe is classic.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="mire"><em><span class="color">Mirepoix</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 large carrots (approximately 4–5 ounces) with cores removed</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 onions (equivalent weight to the carrots)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ bay leaf and a large pinch of thyme, ground to powder in a mortar, or merely crumbled if the sauce is to be passed through a sieve. (Do not use herbs already powdered—they have no flavor)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon finely chopped parsley (including roots, if possible)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of salt</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">Peel the carrots and the onions and chop them finely. To chop the carrots, cut them in two lengthwise, pry out the core with the help of a small knife, and slice each half lengthwise as finely as possible. Flatten these slices out on the chopping board and continue slicing through them lengthwise until they are reduced to tiny sticks, then, holding them together, slice finely crosswise. Rechop this mass several times until very fine. For those who dislike chopping there is a useful device, a <em>mouli-julienne</em>, through which the carrots may first be passed, then chopped through a couple of times.</p>

    <p class="indent">Melt the butter in a small, heavy saucepan, add all the ingredients and cook very gently, stirring regularly, for about ½ hour. The <a id="page76"></a><em>mirepoix</em> should be thoroughly cooked, but absolutely not browned. If it is to be stored in the refrigerator, pack it into a glass or small jar, pressing well with a fork to eliminate all air pockets, and cover the surface with a buttered round of kitchen paper, aluminum foil or wax paper.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">DUXELLES</h2>

    <p class="nonindent"><em>Duxelles</em> is occasionally used, like <em>mirepoix</em>, as an aromatic braising element, but more often as a stuffing, either alone or as one of several ingredients in a forcemeat, and as the base for <em>sauce duxelles</em> (boiled with white wine, reduced, brought to consistency with tomato purée and half-glaze and buttered away from the heat). It, too, may be prepared in advance and kept in the same way as <em>mirepoix</em>, if desired. To save time and effort, the mushrooms are often passed through a grinder. The result is still flavorful, but the fine, clean texture that may be attained only by chopping with a sharp knife is sacrificed to that of a mashed, coarse purée.</p>

    <p class="indent"><em>Duxelles</em> is usually made with cultivated mushrooms, but they may be replaced advantageously by any wild mushroom. For reasons of economy, stems alone may be used (the heads, if not designed to serve immediately, may be boiled for 3 or 4 minutes with ¼ cup of water, a chunk of butter, salt, pepper, and a bit of lemon juice, and kept in their cooking liquid, which is also a valuable flavoring agent). A particularly elegant <em>duxelle</em>s is that made of truffle peelings. It should be subjected to a shorter and less violent cooking process.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="rh6"><em><span class="color">Duxelles</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large onion, finely chopped</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil (or 4 tablespoons butter)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound mushrooms or mushroom stems, finely chopped</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page77"></a><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon finely chopped parsley</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>nutmeg</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a few drops of lemon juice</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Cook the chopped onion in the fat until it is soft and yellowed in color. Add the mushrooms and turn the flame up. Stir and toss until their liquid has evaporated and the mixture is fairly stiff. Turn the flame low again, salt and pepper to taste, stir in the parsley, and continue to cook for a minute or two, stirring regularly. Grate in a tiny bit of nutmeg, add the lemon juice and remove from the heat. If the <em>duxelles</em> is to be stored, eliminate the lemon juice, which may be added just before using.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="rh2">THE PREPARATION OF ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Artichoke bottoms may be cooked and kept submerged in their cooking liquid for several days before using (if they are to be canned, the cooking time should be reduced to a minimum since they must be sterilized afterward). Served cold, the following recipe represents the complete cooking process. Served hot, artichokes always gain in flavor by a final cooking in butter. (If one has the luck to find them young and tender, they may be cooked directly in butter after having been rubbed with lemon.) The lemon—both the rubbing and its presence in the cooking liquid—is designed to keep them from turning dark, but should not be overdone, for although a slight lemon flavor is agreeable, a delicately flavored grayish artichoke is preferable to one that is acid in flavor, though impeccable in color. Also, to avoid discoloration, artichokes should not be cooked in any metal except stainless steel or enamelware, nor “turned” (pared in spiral fashion) with a carbon knife.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="heading_id_5"><a id="page78"></a><em><span class="color">Artichoke Bottoms</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>artichokes</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>lemon halves for rubbing them</em></p>

      <p class="extract"><em>Cooking liquid:</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>for 1 quart water, the juice of ½ lemon, pinch of thyme, salt</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Break off the stems, which permits any fibrous strings to be pulled out. If the stems are sliced off, the strings remain in the bottom. Tear off all the tough outer leaves, pulling each backward, then down toward the base. When the leaves appear white and tender at the base, cut across the artichoke, leaving the tender bases attached to the bottom. Using a small, well-sharpened stainless steel knife, neatly pare the bottoms where the stem has been torn off, then continue, in a spiral fashion, all the way round to the top, removing all dark green parts. The finished product will be a pale-green and white flattened sphere. The pared surface of an artichoke darkens rapidly in contact with air, and, unless one’s work methods are extremely efficient, it is best to rub it with the cut surface of a half lemon several times during the process. Don’t worry about the chokes at this point.</p>

    <p class="indent">Plunge them into the boiling liquid and cook, covered, at a simmer. The cooking time may vary from 10 to 40 minutes depending on the qualities of the artichokes. They are done when the flesh no longer resists a sharply pointed knife. They should remain firm, for they will continue to cook slightly while cooling in their liquid and, unless they are to be served cold, they will be subjected later to an additional cooking. Cool them in their liquid and keep them well submerged, the receptacle covered, refrigerated, until ready for use. Before using them, carefully remove the chokes, using a teaspoon to gently pry them loose, and sponge the artichoke bottoms dry with a towel.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="rh14">MOUSSELINE FORCEMEAT</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">A mousseline forcemeat is the ultimate in a stuffing. It is most often made from fish (such as pike, sole, flounder, whiting, salmon, lobster), <a id="page79"></a>chicken, veal, feathered game, wild rabbit, or hare. The first time one launches oneself into its preparation it may seem complicated, but the basic principles are simple. It is a fine purée of raw flesh, bound by a bit of egg white and mounted with heavy cream.</p>

    <p class="indent">The younger and fresher the flesh, the less albuminous support is required in the form of egg white. The less egg white used and the more cream—up to a certain point—the finer the result. The trick is to find the point at which the <em>farce</em> still holds, and the usual method is to decide on a given amount of egg white, and to then test it 2 or 3 times while adding the cream by poaching a tiny <em>quenelle</em> in a pan of simmering water that is kept ready. As long as the little dumpling poaches firmly, more cream can be added. With an excess of egg white, all the delicacy is lost, and the stuffing is heavy and rubbery. With too little egg white, or too much cream, it collapses during the poaching process. <em>Quenelles</em> that are poached in hot water require more egg white than those that are poached “dry” in a gentle oven, or than a molded mousseline forcemeat. Fish can support more egg white than chicken—a young chicken, freshly killed, needs none at all.</p>

    <p class="indent">The testing method will, no doubt, seem discouraging to the reader, as it often does to me, and the following recipe is a good, standard one that takes no chances. There is, perhaps, particularly for chicken or veal, a bit too much egg white, and most materials may support a bit more cream than the quantity given. Assuming the cream to be absolutely fresh, which is no problem in America, and the instructions followed to the letter, it cannot go wrong.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="prf5.1"><em><span class="color">Mousseline Forcemeat</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound raw meat, fish or poultry</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper, nutmeg</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg white</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Remove any traces of skin or fat from the flesh, scrape strips or fillets with the blade of a sharp knife, holding the tip with the other hand <a id="page80"></a>and scraping away from you, with the grain of the flesh, removing all the ligaments and membranous material possible—it is impossible to eliminate it entirely, but the more is removed at this point, the easier will be the final passage through the sieve. After scraping it to shreds, pound the flesh in a mortar until it is completely reduced to a purée—the more it is pounded, the better. Add salt, pepper and the slightest suspicion of freshly grated nutmeg, and continue working the purée with a pestle, adding the egg white, in very small amounts at a time. When the final addition has been completely incorporated into the mixture, start passing it, about a tablespoonful at a time, through a fine-meshed nylon drum sieve, using the plastic disk (<em>corne</em>); scrape all the debris (nervous, membranous material) from the surface after each passage.</p>

    <p class="indent">Pack the purée into a bowl (if time presses, it will chill more rapidly in a metal bowl—an hour on cracked ice is sufficient), smooth the surface of the purée, cover the bowl and embed it in cracked ice. Put into the refrigerator until needed.</p>

    <p class="indent">Mount the purée, keeping the bowl still on ice (having poured off the water and replaced it by more ice, if necessary), by adding the cream, well chilled, in small amounts at a time and working it vigorously with a wooden spoon. At first it is hard to work, for the mixture is very stiff, then it becomes somewhat more supple, and, though it is still firm, it is possible to beat it. After the addition of about ½ cup of cream, it should be quite malleable. At this point, whip the remaining cream until fairly firm, but not stiff, and stir and fold it gently into the mass until the whole is intimately combined. It is ready to use.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_6">RICE</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Plain rice is the automatic accompaniment to numerous stews or other dishes whose sauces are generally either tomato-flavored or creamed, and often thickened with egg yolks. Assuming the rice to be of quality, any of the methods of preparation are good. Do not use precooked or “treated” rice. The latter, in particular, is slippery-textured and distinctly chemical in flavor. A rice with a large, long grain and a mat surface usually seems to be the best. In France, the best riceavailable <a id="page81"></a>comes from Madagascar; in America, Carolina rice may be the best on the market. The short, round-grained Piedmont rice can be of excellent quality, but requires a special <em>risotto</em> treatment. For my purposes, I have found a pilaf type of preparation to be the simplest and the most satisfactory: The rice need neither be washed before cooking nor dried (steamed) after; its natural flavor remains intact and its grains separate; it may be kept warm for long periods of time without suffering any loss in quality. Classically, chopped onion is first cooked in the butter to heighten the flavor, and the rice is moistened with a bouillon or stock, but these seem questionable supports, for they mask the delicate natural flavor of a good rice. Different rices are capable of absorbing slightly different quantities of water and may require a few minutes more or less of cooking time, but this is no problem, for a rice that is slightly undercooked or overcooked is not bad as long as it is dry and the grains remain separate; after a couple of tries your timing and liquid measure will adjust themselves to your rice. Acceptable results may be produced in a thin aluminum pot with a plate for a cover, but a pilaf is perfect only if prepared in a heavy saucepan, preferably copper, with a tight-fitting lid. Count one cup of rice for four people.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="rh3"><em><span class="color">Rice Pilaf</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup dry, unwashed rice</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups boiling water</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Melt the tablespoon of butter in the saucepan over a low flame, add the rice, sprinkle with salt, and allow it to cook gently in the butter, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon, for a couple of minutes, or until the grains lose their slightly translucent quality and become milky and opaque. Add the boiling water, stir once to be certain no grains are sticking (done correctly, no grains will be browned andnone will stick), <a id="page82"></a>and cover tightly. Leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 25 minutes, either on top of the stove or in a preheated slow oven. If left on top of the stove, it may be necessary to use an asbestos mat underneath the pot to help regulate the heat—the liquid should present only the slightest suggestion of a surface movement. The rice is done when the water has been completely absorbed. Mix in the remaining butter, cut into small pieces, manipulating the rice delicately with the prongs of a fork so as not to break or crush the grains, and turn it out immediately into a warmed serving dish (or, if it is prepared some time in advance, into another saucepan which will then be kept, covered, in a warm, but not hot, place).</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_7">CREPE BATTER</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Crêpes are unleavened, paper-thin pancakes. Depending on the use to which they are put, they may be called “crêpes” or <em>pannequets</em>. They form the “shirts” in <em>en chemise</em> preparations and the crisp surfaces of some <em>cromesquis</em> when stuffing enveloped in a crêpe is fried in deep fat. Under certain circumstances, they may replace the sheet of paste used to enrobe <em>cannelloni</em>.</p>

    <p class="indent">The following recipe will serve for all the preparations in this book. For unsweetened dishes, the sugar should be eliminated. One may count on 18 to 20 small crêpes or 10 to 12 large with these proportions.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is not terribly important to remain loyal to precise ingredients or measurements. Crêpes are good made with milk or beer, with or without the addition of cognac or liqueur, and perfectly acceptable made with water. The batter may be enriched by the addition of cream, may contain more or fewer eggs, and olive oil may replace the butter. Finely chopped <em>fines herbes</em> added to an hors d’oeuvre or main-course crêpe batter is an attractive refinement.</p>

    <p class="indent">The batter should be thin—the consistency of very fresh cream. The pan should be in impeccable condition. If a large number of crêpes must be made, one may save a great deal of time by working with 2 or 3 pans over different burners. Crêpes may be made in advance, in which <a id="page83"></a>case they must be stacked on a plate neatly, one on top of the other, and covered with a towel, to avoid their drying out.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="crpes"><em><span class="color">Crêpes</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 heaping tablespoons flour</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon sugar (include only in dessert crêpes)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>small pinch salt</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon cognac</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons (1½ ounces) melted butter</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Sift the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and break in the eggs. Stir, keeping to the center, until all the flour is gradually absorbed into the eggs, then slowly add approximately ⅔ cup of milk, stirring all the while. Stir in the cognac and melted butter and thin the batter with milk until it is no thicker than fresh cream. I do not find it essential to let the batter stand before cooking, but this may of course be done.</p>

    <p class="indent">A small ladle of a capacity of about 3 tablespoons is practical for pouring. For large crêpes (approximately 7 inches in diameter at the bottom of the pan), count about 3 tablespoons of batter, for small (5 inches), about 2 tablespoons. If the batter refuses to cover the bottom of the pan, it is too thick, and more milk should be added.</p>

    <p class="indent">Heat the pan, lightly buttered (it need be buttered only once, assuming the batter to be sufficiently lubricated), over a low to medium flame (after the first 2 or 3 crêpes, adjust the heat if necessary). If the pan does not sizzle at contact with the batter, it is not hot enough. Lift the pan from the flame and, holding it with one hand, pour in the batter with the other. At the same time, give the pan a rolling motion, turning it rapidly in all directions, so that the batter spreads immediately over the entire surface. Return it to the flame, and after 30 seconds or so, delicately lift an edge of the pan cake with the rounded tip <a id="page84"></a>of a table knife to check its progress (after one or two times, you will have the feeling and everything will go automatically). Ease the knife blade all the way under and flip the crêpe over. Toss it if you prefer—it is a pretty piece of theater, but requires a certain amount of practice, and the result is the same. After about 15 seconds, remove the pan from the flame, lift the crêpe out with the knife and begin the operation all over again. It is essential to remove the pan from the flame for several seconds each time, for, with the flame at the correct intensity for cooking the crêpes, the pan heats progressively and rapidly becomes too hot. The batter should be stirred each time just before being poured, as the flour has a tendency to settle to the bottom and the butter to rise to the top. If, partway through, the batter is noticeably thicker, more liquid may be added.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_8">HERBS</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">For my own purposes, I have settled, finally, on the following herbs. Among those to be used fresh: parsley, chives, tarragon, chervil (the traditional <em>fines herbes</em>, alone or in combination), basil, dill, wild fennel, and savory.</p>

    <p class="indent">Those to be used dried: thyme, bay leaf, rosemary, oregano (wild marjoram), savory and wild fennel.</p>

    <p class="indent">Others are in my garden, but usually remain untouched. Hyssop I occasionally use—sparingly—when receiving erudite curiosity seekers. Borage, sage, and mint find their place mostly in bouquets (not <em>garnis</em>), and coriander (whose seeds are essential in many brine and vinegar conserves) I planted only once (its tender green leaves, known in French as <em>persil chinois</em>, and in the United States as Chinese parsley, are much used in Arab and Oriental cooking); I found the odor so intensely repellent that I could never bring myself to try it. The only two that I regret not having are cultivated marjoram, neither the seeds nor plants of which I have been able to find in France, and <em>serpolet</em>, a variety of wild thyme, the perfume of which resembles savory more than thyme but is more fragile and delicate than either. In the past, the mountainsides of Provence were covered with it, but for a reason that none can explain it is rapidly disappearing.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page85"></a>A <em>bouquet garni</em> is a bundle of herbs tied together in order to simplify their removal from a dish at the end of its cooking process.</p>

    <p class="indent">For those who are in a position to raise or collect their own herbs, the following things should be kept in mind:</p>

    <p class="indent">1. Thyme flowers are finer in flavor than the leaves, but at the moment that the plant is in flower (April through June, depending on the climate), the leaves also have a stronger and more characteristic perfume. The year’s provision is best made at this time.</p>

    <p class="indent">2. Oregano must be collected when in full flower (July and August). It may be bought in dried bouquets from Italian grocers and, in this form, is always fresher and more fragrant than that found in jars or cans.</p>

    <p class="indent">3. Perennial savory has a more pungent but finer flavor than the annual variety, which, although useful in the absence of the former, has a vague suggestion of kerosene to its scent.</p>

    <p class="indent">4. Rosemary is always powerful and may be collected at all times of the year. Although delicious, it should be used with circumspection. Curiously, the smoke of burning or smoldering rosemary is a far more voluptuous and delicate incense than that of any other herb. Any fish, meat, fowl, or vegetable grilled over coals is enhanced if, during the last few moments of the grilling process, a small handful of rosemary leaves is sprinkled over the coals.</p>

    <p class="indent">A jar of mixed herbs of one’s own confection (for not only does one not know what is contained in the commercial mixtures, but they are always too old, with the result that they lend only a vague, powdery, peppery quality) is practical. Nearly all recipes that call for a complicated dosage of several different herbs are happily supplied by a single pinch of the mixture. The mixed herbs should be dry, but as nearly as possible of the year’s production. Do not be tempted by the miraculous blender to reduce your mixture to powder—the flavor will very rapidly be lost. For those recipes that require a pinch of powdered herbs, it is much the best to pound them in a mortar at the last minute.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_10">KITCHEN GARDENS</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">A garden can alter the entire aspect of one’s kitchen and table. Even without a garden, most herbs can still be raised in pots or window boxes, but with a few square yards of garden space, one can plant such hard-to-find and easy-to-grow things as chervil (in French, <em>cerfeuil</em>). For constant production it should be planted every two or three weeks from early spring to early fall—in a shady corner at the hottest part of the season. Sorrel (French, <em>oseille</em>) requires no particular care or special soil, and with a bit of protection during the winter, will produce all year round for four or five years. Wild fennel (<em>fenouil</em>) is another good garden possibility, as are all the semi-wild salads: rocket (<em>roquette</em>), lamb’s lettuce (<em>mâche</em>), burnet (<em>pimprenelle</em>), purslane (<em>pourpier</em> <em>à</em> <em>salade</em>), basil (<em>basilic</em>), borage (<em>bourrache</em>) and many others. In France, seed packages of mixed wild salads (<em>mesclun</em>) are commonly sold. In the list of useful addresses (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf4_r1.htm#page68">this page</a>) I have given the name of a French seed house that mail-orders to America.</p>

    <p class="indent">If space allows, a few artichoke plants (the violet variety, if possible) will permit the discovery of the marvelous raw artichoke, eaten with a vinaigrette at a tender young age before the choke is even developed. Other useful plants are the common gray shallots (<em>échalotes grises</em>)—I have substituted onions for shallots in most recipes in this book, for the only shallot that I have ever found on the American <a id="page87"></a>market is the ugly, coarse-flavored red shallot. Also useful are leeks (<em>poireaux</em>), and broad beans (<em>fèves</em>)—one of the most exquisite of all vegetables, hard to find and nearly always too mature when offered for sale. To import the seeds, a customs permit is necessary. And, of course, there are green beans, which are never picked young enough and never sold fresh enough. Nasturtiums will grow anywhere with no care, and the flowers are as pretty as they are useful in salads. A rich soil will produce too much foliage and few flowers.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_11">SALADS</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">The indications for salads in these menus is deliberately vague. With the exception of iceberg lettuce, all easy-to-find salad materials such as romaine, Boston lettuce, leaf lettuce, chicory, escarole and endive are possible in salads described as “tossed green” or “mixed green.” A salad garnished with <em>fines herbes</em> should be light in flavor, hence escarole or chicory are excluded from the choice. These light salads occur often in the more elegant menus, with the exception of those menus in which game is the climactic point. Chervil is the most delicate of the <em>fines herbes</em> and may be used in quantity. A light lettuce caressed by its ephemeral scent provides the perfect accent after a <em>suite</em> of more or less intricate and subtly flavored dishes, but only a fairly pungent green can hold its own after the rich savor of game.</p>

    <p class="indent">Robustly flavored, rustic dishes are marvelous followed by salads flavored with “wild” or uncultivated greens, such as watercress, field cress, purslane, burnet, lamb’s lettuce, young dandelion greens, wild chicory, <em>arugula</em>, rocket—alone or in mixture. Chopped fresh savory and fresh basil leaves add a splendid accent. Tender young nasturtium leaves and nasturtium buds and flowers have a fine, cleansing, peppery taste, and a décor of the multicolored flowers against the dark-green leaves of wild salads is, to say the least, ravishing. A salad for which I have a particular affection is composed of approximately half lettuce and half rocket with a healthy handful of fresh basil leaves added, decorated with nasturtium flowers. Rocket (in French, <em>roquette</em>) is a “wild” salad that one may cultivate—and which I am never without. <a id="page88"></a>It resembles somewhat the green called <em>arugula</em> handled by Italian greengrocers, but is spicier and more “personal” in flavor. When planted in rich soil and kept watered, it grows rapidly and is nevertoo strong.</p>

    <p class="indent">Any salad must be well dried. Nothing is more repulsive than a bowl of salad dripping in water and vinegar with a few globules of oil floating here and there. A salad basket is useful for drying tougher leafed greens, but lettuce should be carefully dried between two towels. Many of the wild or semi-wild greens are small-leafed and escape from the whirling salad basket. They, too, must be dried in a towel, but may be treated with less care. Nasturtium flowers should, of course, never be treated with insecticide; they should be freshly picked and used unwashed.</p>

    <p class="indent">Nothing can replace the fresh, clean, fruity flavor of young, virgin olive oil in a vinaigrette salad dressing. The vinegar should be made of good wine and it should be used sparingly. For a lettuce and <em>fines herbes</em> salad, one part of vinegar to five parts of olive oil is about right. Only salt and pepper should be used as seasoning. For the more pungent salads, the bowl may be rubbed with garlic, and a bit of mustard absorbed into the vinegar. These salads can also take a stronger dose of vinegar. The easiest and most attractive way to prepare a salad is to prepare the dressing directly in the salad bowl (not a sticky, wooden one), rubbing the bowl first with garlic (if that is to be included), then adding the seasoning and vinegar, stirring until the salt has been dissolved, and, finally, adding the oil. The serving fork and spoon may then be crossed in the bowl, and the salad leaves arranged on top, so that they do not contact the dressing. In this way, the salad may be prepared before the meal, presented, untossed, the surface sprinkled with <em>fines herbes</em> or decorated with flowers, then tossed the instant before serving.</p>

    <p class="indent">A pleasant occasional change from vinaigrette is a lemon and cream dressing. This, too, may be heightened with a touch of mustard, and gains by an addition of chopped fresh dill leaves or <em>fines herbes</em>.</p>

    <p class="indent">A concentrated aromatic vinegar allows a salad to profit from the basic virtues of a good vinegar without suffering from either the acidity or the excessive moisture that are inevitable with a vinegar of normal constitution. Only a few drops need be used in conjunction with <a id="page89"></a>the other seasonings. Although serviceable immediately, it improves with age, and if one makes a certain quantity each year, it is interesting to compare “vintages.”</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="rh12"><em><span class="color">Aromatic Vinegar</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart of good wine vinegar</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 crushed cloves of garlic</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon of <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>few grains of coriander</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Reduce the vinegar by half over a high flame (the fumes are choking—close kitchen do or and open a window). Remove it from the heat, add all the aromatic ingredients and leave it, covered, for several hours or overnight. Place a cloth or several thicknesses of cheesecloth over a funnel and strain the vinegar into a bottle.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_12">AROMATIC PEPPER MIXTURE</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">So-called “aromatic pepper” is nothing more than the whole grains of allspice. They are slightly larger than peppercorns and reddish-brown in color.</p>

    <p class="indent">Although black and white pepper come from the same plant (the black being picked before maturity and dried with its hull, the white picked ripe and hulled), they are very different in flavor. About 3 parts of black to 2 of white and somewhat less than 1 of the allspice is a good mixture. For some few preparations, this mixture can replace neither white nor black pepper, but for most things I prefer it. It will, no doubt, not please all readers.</p>

    <p class="indent">Fresh, tender green peppercorns are now marketed either frozen or canned. They are useful in the preparation of certain game dishes in sauce.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_13"><a id="page90"></a>SKIMMING</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">There are three distinctly different kinds of skimming, for which, in French cooking terminology, there are three verbs: <em>écumer</em> (to scum); <em>dégraisser</em> (to degrease); and <em>dépouiller</em> (to skin). The first two are generally understood and respected. <em>Dépouillement</em> (skinning) is too often misunderstood or merely sidestepped, even by professional cooks, in the mistaken belief that it does not make that much difference. It makes, among others, the supreme difference between a sauce that is absolutely digestible and one that is not. It is a combined purification and reduction, traditionally practiced with all sauces based on stock that have been thickened by a <em>roux</em>. The flavor and the qualityof the thickening are dependent on the flour’s being first cooked in butter or another fat, but the fat, cooked over a long period of time and indigestible, inevitably remains in suspension in the sauce. It and other impurities are eliminated by skinning. The duration of time may be from a quarter of an hour to two or three hours, but the process is always the same: the liquid is brought to a boil and the saucepan is placed over a small flame (on a gas stove, the central part of a burner or the smallest burner—on an electric stove, the saucepan is simply pulled partway to the side of the smallest burner) so that one side of the bottom is heated and a steady, but very slight boil is produced at only one point to a far side of the liquid’s surface. A thin skin will slowly develop over the remaining surface, collecting and growing thicker at the edge of the saucepan that is farthest from the simmering area. The skin should, at regular intervals (every two or three minutes for a sauce that is <em>dépouillée</em> for a short time, every ten or twenty minutes for one that remains in the process over a long period of time) be carefully gathered to the side of the saucepan with the edge of a spoon and removed. Each time, a certain amount of loose, floating fat remains. This, too, should be carefully skimmed off.</p>

    <p class="indent">Simple stews (lamb ragouts, veal <em>sautés</em>, fricassees, <em>boeuf bourguignon, coq au vin</em>, etc.) are rarely treated in this manner, but they gain in quality and in digestibility if, when the meat is cooked, the sauce is passed through a sieve and subjected to this process rather than to <a id="page91"></a>the rapid reduction over an intense heat which is more common. The latter method may bring a sauce to the correct consistency, but the violent boiling throws the fat and other impurities back into an emulsion in the sauce. Often, with dishes of this kind, even the reduction is not respected and the “sauce” is nothing but a watery, greasy, dirty brown beverage—half the restaurants in France have a dish that answers this description on the menu every day.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_14">USING A DRUM SIEVE</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Drum sieves come in standard sizes, the most practical of which, for home use, is “08.” The inside diameter of the high wall is 9 inches—exactly that of a standard soup plate.</p>

    <p class="indent">For semiliquid material, place it on a fiat surface, high wall down, with the soup plate underneath to collect the purée. The plastic disk (<em>corne</em>) should be held firmly between the thumb and four fingers, with the fingers reaching almost to the lower edge of the disk. The disk should be held flat (at something less than a 45° angle) and firmly against the surface of the sieve and drawn toward oneself in regular repetition while the drum is turned in a circle with more or less regularity by the other hand. The thicker the food substance, the less regularly the drum need be turned, until, finally, when working with a small quantity of stiff substance, it is no longer useful to turn the drum. Fairly liquid materials pass easily and are no problem. The stiffer the material, the greater care should be taken in its preliminary preparation to reduce it into as consistent a purée as possible to facilitate its passage through the sieve, and the smaller quantity one should work with at a time. In passing pounded, raw meat for forcemeats, no more than a tablespoonful at a time should be attempted. A plate is no longer necessary. The sieve may be placed directly on a chopping board or a clean table top. Draw the disk flat across the sieve’s outer surface from time to time to spread out the material that collects on its underside. After each passage, scrape the surface of the sieve clean with the disk and discard the residue. Clean off the purée clinging to the underside of the sieve and begin again.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_15"><a id="page92"></a>SLICING AND CHOPPING</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">For slicing, a knife with a blade 5 or 6 inches long is easiest. The article to be sliced should be held in place on the chopping board with the tips of one’s thumb and fingers held closely together and turned inward, clawlike, to keep them clear of the blade’s edge. The side of the blade should rest constantly against the farthest joint of one’s middle finger, which serves as a guide. Articles to be chopped (an onion, for instance) should be first cut in two to create a flat surface against the chopping board, each half sliced through finely, then given a quarter-turn on the board and sliced through again. Thus one has a mass of material already reduced to tiny cubes to start with. To chop it more finely, use a “French chef’s” type of knife, holding it in such a way that the tip of the thumb and the curled knuckle of the forefinger touch the base of the blade and rest the fingers of the other hand against the top of the blade toward the tip. This creates an easy leverage and one need not press or force the knife with the chopping hand.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_16">TO PEEL AND SEED TOMATOES</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">To loosen the skin, dip them first in boiling water (if they are very ripe this may not be necessary), cut out a small cone from the stem end, peel off the skin, and cut them across horizontally. Squeeze the halves to rid them of seeds and excess water (this liquid may be passed through a sieve to be added to a sauce if one likes). If the tomatoes need to be kept whole, remove seeds and liquid with your finger or the end of a teaspoon handle rather than squeeze them.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_17">TO PEEL GARLIC</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Unless the clove must remain undamaged (as for rubbing the interior of a casserole or salad bowl), place the clove on the chopping board, hold the blade of a knife on top of it and give the blade a smack with <a id="page93"></a>the palm of your hand. The clove will be slightly crushed and the skin may simply be lifted off.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_18">BREAD</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Good bread is made of nothing but flour, salt, water and a leavening agent. Its quality depends on the quality of the flour, which should not be over-refined), the quality of the leavening agent (sourdough being the best), and the quality of the oven. A perfect bread oven radiates heat regularly from all points—some professional ovens, like those in old-fashioned cookstoves, are heated by a system of hot-air circulation all around the body of the oven. Most modern home ovens are heated directly from below. With these, it is wise to install a metal plaque in the bottom of the oven to diffuse the heat, encourage an even coloration and prevent burning on the bottom.</p>

    <p class="indent">One may, with American “all-purpose” flour and dried yeast, make a better bread than anything to be found on the market. To attempt to enrich it in any way will ruin it. Add no sugar, no milk and no shortening. The following recipe will produce one fairly large loaf of firm, crusty bread, which is better a day or two old than fresh from the oven, and resembles country bread (<em>pain de campagne</em>).</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="heading_id_19"><em><span class="color">White Bread</span></em></h3>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 slightly mounded teaspoon dry yeast</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups water</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>5 cups flour (plus flour for dusting the board, the tray and the loaf)</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>something over ½ teaspoon salt</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Put the yeast into ½ cup of tepid water and leave for 10 or 15 minutes to ferment slightly.</p>

    <p class="indent">Sift the flour and the salt into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and pour in the remaining 1½ cups of water, also tepid, <a id="page94"></a>and the yeast mixture. First stir out from the center until a thick paste is formed, then work it thoroughly with your hands until all of the flour has been absorbed. Form the dough into a ball in your hands, dust it with flour or roll it in flour, sprinkling a bit of flour inside the bowl also; put dough back into the bowl, cover with a towel, and place in the warmest part of the kitchen (but not on the stove). When it has more than doubled in size (after an hour, more or less, depending on the temperature of the kitchen), turn the ball out onto a floured board, punch it down to force out all the air, kneading it well, form it again into a ball, and leave it, floured, in the bowl as before. When again risen (it should rise a bit faster the second time), repeat the punching down and kneading process, form it into a ball (or a thick sausage shape, depending on the form of loaf desired), and place it on a lightly floured (but not greased) heavy metal baking sheet. Cut deeply into the surface of the loaf with a sharp, pointed knife, forming a simple design (a deep, central slash with rays cut out to either side, for instance, or, for a round loaf, curved slashes cut out from the center, or repeated diagonal slashes for a long loaf). This not only makes a more attractive loaf, but creates a greater surface to be transformed into crust. Dust the loaf with flour and leave it on the baking sheet, covered with a towel, to rise again for about ½ hour.</p>

    <p class="indent">Bake it in a preheated oven, adjusted to medium-low (about 325° F. at the moment of putting the loaf in) for 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Check its progress after about 50 minutes after the first time, you will know exactly how to adjust the oven. Baked for 1 hour and 10 minutes at an even, regular heat, the crust should be an evenly colored, rich golden brown and should resound when thumped.</p>

    <h2 class="section" id="rh7">ALMOND COOKIES</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">One of a variety of simple cookies (petits-fours), although never mentioned on a menu, are as automatic an accompaniment to most desserts (with the exception of pastries or crêpes or particularly starchy puddings) as is bread to the main body of a meal.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page95"></a><em>Tuiles</em> (literally, “tiles,” a reference to their flat, thin, “warped” shape) are good, all-around dessert cookies and permit one to dispose of leftover egg whites. The cookies may be kept crisp in a tightly closed tin box.</p>

    <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="heading_id_20"><em><span class="color">Almond Cookies</span></em></h3>

    <p class="center3">Tuiles</p>

    <div class="block">
      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg whites</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon flour</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch salt</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons cream</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) melted butter</em></p>

      <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup slivered almonds</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">Whisk the sugar and the egg whites together in a mixing bowl, thick paste flour and the salt and continue whisking until well mixed. Incorporate the cream and the melted butter. Stir in the almonds.</p>

    <p class="indent">Butter a <em>heavy</em> cookie sheet, cast iron if possible (the cookies are more easily removed from a heavy sheet), dust it with flour and give it a smart rap, upside down, to rid it of excess flour. Distribute the batter on the sheet in teaspoonsful, leaving enough space between each mound to allow for spreading, and bake in a gentle oven (about 325° F.) for about 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown around the edges and the center is only slightly yellowed.</p>

    <p class="indent">They must be removed from the sheet the moment they leave the oven, to avoid sticking. Scoop each up with a deft, clean movement of the spatula and press it onto a rolling pin, or other cylindrical object, to give it its characteristic form. While still hot, the cookie is soft and pliable, but turns crisp upon cooling. After a few minutes on the rolling pin, remove the cookies to a cake rack and leave them till completely cooled.</p>
