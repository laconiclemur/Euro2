<p class="normal"><b>Chocolate fondant is often served in restaurants in many different ways with many different flavors or spices added to it or infused into it. The main idea, however, is always the same—when the fondant is baked and turned out, the warm chocolate in the middle must find its way out, running slowly like lava coming down the slope of a volcano. That is a must, but there is also not any compromising when it comes to the chocolate you are using. It must be good quality, not too sweet, not too bitter, and it must be dark, not semisweet. In this recipe I’ve scented the chocolate with ginger, which I love. If that is not to your taste, try it with star anise, cinnamon, cardamom or even Szechuan pepper. Whatever the spice, however, you just want a hint of it, so use it sparingly.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">a little good-quality, unsweetened dark cocoa powder, for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ ounces dark chocolate, 70% cocoa solids, broken into pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons cornstem</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 ball preserved ginger, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">Chili Crème Anglaise (see <a href="024_9781848991583_Recipe18.html#pageid_23">page 23</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Butter four 3½-ounce ramekins or ovenproof molds and dust with cocoa powder. Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and rest it over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate melts. (Alternatively, melt very gently in short bursts in the microwave, stirring regularly.) Remove the pan from the heat and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Beat together the eggs and sugar, using an electric mixer, for at least 15 minutes until they are almost white in color, very shiny and almost forming soft peaks. This will give a really light, crusty outside to the fondant, with a meltingly soft inside. Pour the melted chocolate and butter into the batter and beat to combine. Sift the cornstarch over the top and fold it in, then finally fold in the preserved ginger, taking care not to overmix the batter at this point. Divide the batter into the prepared ramekins, filling them only three-quarters full. Put them on a cookie sheet in a cool place and leave to rest 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat the oven to 425°F. Bake the chocolate fondants 5 to 6 minutes until the fondant rises above the rim of the ramekins and forms a light crust on top and around the edges. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and turn out the fondants straight onto serving plates. Serve immediately with chili crème anglaise.</p>
