<p class="bodytext-center"><span class="smallcaps">ALEX MACKAY</span> is, first and foremost, a brilliant chef. Yet at the same time he’s also much more than that. He has a quite rare and very special gift which goes beyond simply creating beautiful dishes. That gift is the ability to teach, inspire and enthuse others who want to learn how to cook creatively. This is something I personally admire a great deal and is why I have asked him to lead the food and wine workshops in the restaurants at my beloved Norwich City Football Club.</p>
<p class="bodytext-centera">There is, though, another connection here, as Peter and Di Knab are two of my husband Michael’s and my oldest friends, and we have watched with delight their dazzlingly beautiful house in deepest Provence being transformed into Le Baou d’Infer cookery school, and becoming an internationally famous centre of good food, wine and the warmest hospitality. Now added to all this is a very fine and beautiful cookery book indeed, which I am proud to present as a fitting tribute to all they have achieved.</p>
