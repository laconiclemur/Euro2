<p class="boxtitle"><a id="description"/>WHAT WENT ON BEHIND THE SCENES AT ELBULLI?</p>
<p class="noindent">When elBulli closed its doors in 2011, it marked the passing of an institution whose patrons were drawn like pilgrims from around the world to its location in northeastern Spain. Elected best restaurant in the world by <span class="agaramondproitalic">Restaurant</span> magazine an unprecedented five times, elBulli was—and will again be when it reopens as a culinary think tank in 2014—the laboratory of Ferran Adrià, the maverick creator of molecular gastronomy. <span class="agaramondproitalic">The Sorcerer’s Apprentices</span> reveals for the first time the remarkable system of apprenticeship that Adrià used to run his restaurant and, in the process, train the next generation of culinary stars. Granted unprecedented access, Lisa Abend followed the stagiaires of the 2009 season as they struggled to master the grueling hours, cutting-edge techniques, and interpersonal tensions that came with working at the most revered restaurant on earth. What emerges is an irresistible tale of aspiring young talents caught, for good or ill, in the opportunity of a lifetime: creating the ultimate dining experience.</p>
