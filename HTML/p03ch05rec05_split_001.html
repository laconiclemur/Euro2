<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is made with the thin wild asparagus called</span> trigeros<span class="italic">, after the word</span> trigo, <span class="italic">which means “wheat,” because they grow wild in wheat fields. I ate it in a restaurant in Jaén, where they also had scapes in the dish—these are the young tender garlic shoots or stalks of the flowers of the garlic plant (</span>ajetes <span class="italic">in Spanish) that are harvested just as they begin to grow in a curl, before they straighten into a stem. They are also known as garlic spears. They are discarded by farmers in most of the United States, but you can find them in farmers’ markets. Theirs is a mild garlicky taste. Serve the</span> revuelto <span class="italic">with thin toast.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound thin asparagus</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic shoots (scapes), cut into 1-inch lengths, or garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound small shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">4 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Cut the asparagus into 1-inch pieces and discard the tough ends. Boil them in salted water until they are soft; drain.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the oil with the garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Before the garlic begins to color, add the asparagus and sauté for ½ minute, stirring and turning them and adding a little salt. Add the shrimp and cook, turning once, just until they turn pink. Pour in the eggs, add the parsley and a little salt, and stir for a few seconds—the eggs should still be slightly liquid. They will turn creamy off the heat.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Fry 4 slices bacon, coarsely chopped, in the oil in the skillet, then add the garlic and the asparagus and continue as above.</p>
