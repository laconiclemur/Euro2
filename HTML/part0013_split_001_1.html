  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_135" class="calibre1"></a>For centuries, bread has been the staple of virtually every country and culture worldwide. The basic ingredients of flour, yeast and water and the ritual of kneading and proving the dough remains the same whether you make your dough by hand or use a machine.</p>

  <p class="center-para">My mother used to bake bread once a week in the big wood-fired oven; she would make enough to last the week. On bread-baking day, I would wake up to the wonderful aroma and rush downstairs to tear open a loaf of warm, freshly baked bread. Often she would make savoury breads, adding bits of leftover salami and cheese, similar to <em class="calibre4"><a href="part0013_split_002.html#ch7sec1" class="calibre1">pane contadino</a></em>, or sometimes she would sweeten dough with some sugar and dried fruit as a treat for <em class="calibre4">merenda</em> (tea time).</p>

  <p class="center-para">In Italy every town and village has at least one <em class="calibre4">panetteria</em> (bakery) that bakes an array of breads and dough-based products each day – by lunchtime they have usually sold out. Years ago, if you did not have your own oven, boys would carry their family’s precious cargo of bread dough to the <em class="calibre4">panetteria</em> on planks of wood covered in tea towels, to be placed in the hot oven and returned home as hot loaves.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Like most Italians, I enjoy bread with all my meals, from breakfast to supper, and could not imagine life without this most basic of foods. Italians consider bread to be almost sacred and never allow it to be thrown away; stale bread is always used up as bruschetta, fillings or made into breadcrumbs.</p>

  <p class="center-para">For me, making dough and baking bread is deeply satisfying. I love to wake up early and light the wood-fired oven in my garden. I then prepare the ingredients – I usually use fresh yeast, which I crumble into the flour, add water and watch the big bubbles explode as I mix it together. While the dough is rising I check the fire, add a few more logs if necessary, have my breakfast and get on with other things. This is the slowness when making bread. When the moment comes to shape the dough I like to be creative and use up leftovers such as grilled vegetables in <em class="calibre4"><a href="part0013_split_007.html#ch7sec6" class="calibre1">girelle</a></em> or use herbs from the garden in <em class="calibre4"><a href="part0013_split_006.html#ch7sec5" class="calibre1">panini al rosmarino</a></em>. I love the smell of bread baking and it never fails to overwhelm me with sweet, nostalgic memories.</p>
