    <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps">I</span>n my kitchen, I’ve stocked sections of my pantry and fridge with ingredients I use to cook Portuguese dishes. Through trial and error, I’ve discovered American ingredients that are either identical to or successful substitutes for those in Portugal. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking one thing when an author intends something else, so in these entries, I’ve described the exact variety of onion, the precise kind of bay leaf, and the perfect cultivar of potato to use for making the recipes in the United States, so that we’re—literally—on the same page. It’s not an exhaustive list; it includes only those ingredients you’ll need to cook from this book. For those few harder-to-find items, such as Portuguese sausages and bottled sauces, I’ve provided a list of stores and online purveyors in the <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources section</a>.</p>

    <p class="indent">Without a doubt, though, the biggest contributor to the success of your dishes is to buy the best-quality ingredients you can afford. Gently poke a few tomatoes in the name of comparison shopping, drum up the courage to speak to your fishmonger about salt cod, and ignore the bargain bin and splurge on well-priced port wine you wouldn’t mind sipping after an enjoyable evening of cooking.</p>

    <p class="indent">Oh, and considering Portuguese is tough to wrap your lips around, I’ve included a handy pronunciation guide. <em>Boa sorte!</em></p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s027"><span class="small2">BACON</span> <em>toucinho</em> (tow-<em>seen</em>-yoo)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Pork is the undisputed king of meat in Portugal, and nose-to-tail eating is the rule. But for decades, authors and translators of Portuguese recipes have left cooks banging their heads against kitchen cabinets with the indiscriminate use of the word <em>bacon</em> to mean <em>toucinho.</em> There are three types of <em>toucinho,</em> only one of which is similar to bacon as we know it, and each one has a different cooking use.</p>

    <p class="indent"><em>Toucinho gordo</em> (“fat bacon”) is pure pork fat, similar to our fatback, with no striations of meat and with the skin often attached. It’s cut from most any part of the animal and, like all <em>toucinho,</em> is traditionally salted (<em>salgado</em>) rather than smoked, although nowadays it’s possible to buy smoked versions of <em>toucinho magro</em> and <em>toucinho entremeado</em>. Chunks are added to dishes such as <em>feijoada</em> (bean-meat casserole), <em>cozido</em> (a one-pot meal of boiled meats and vegetables), and even some desserts.</p>

    <p class="indent"><em>Toucinho magro</em> (“skinny bacon”) has significantly more meat than fat. In the past, this type of <em>toucinho</em> was chunked, fried until crisp, and placed in a clay pot until ready to be added to recipes as a flavor booster. I don’t call for this type of bacon in these recipes, but if you stumble upon particularly lean farmstead bacon, definitely try it.</p>

    <p class="indent"><em>Toucinho entremeado</em> is half fat, half meat and is usually preferred smoked rather than salted. This is the closest to our bacon, and it’s what I used in developing the recipes for this book. To mimic the taste, pass over packaged sliced bacon and reach for slab bacon or pancetta, even though it’s not smoked. Whatever you do, avoid flavored bacons, such as maple or mesquite.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s028"><span class="small2">BEANS, DRIED</span> <em>feijão</em> (fay-<em>zhowhn)</em></h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Dried beans have played a long and important role in Portuguese cooking and history. They were used to feed sailors who traveled west to the New World for riches, as well as those who navigated round the Cape of Good Hope on their voyages east for spices. The attraction, obviously, is that dried beans keep a long time and pack a nutritious wallop. Back home, beans carried peasant farmers through fallow growing seasons, bolstered late-winter meals when pantries were bare, and served as barter when pockets were empty.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="page20"></a>Walk through any open-air market in Portugal today, and you’ll still see rows of woven baskets filled with beans of just about every size, shape, and color. For the recipes in this book, stock up on dried black-eyed peas, Great Northern, navy, and red kidney beans. While you’re at it, grab frozen and fresh fava beans when you find them; they’re preferable to their dried counterpart.</p>

    <p class="indent">The best kind of dried beans to buy are fresh, which isn’t an oxymoron. In today’s jumbo-marts, with their huge inventories, beans can sit indefinitely. But at farmers’ markets and stores with high turnover, it’s possible to buy dried beans that aren’t ancient. Before using beans, rinse them well and sort through them, plucking out any stray pebbles. Keep in mind that cooking times in this book are merely guidelines. Depending on the size and age of your beans, timing can vary dramatically, so always nibble a few beans as you cook to determine doneness.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s029"><span class="small2">CHEESE</span> <em>queijo</em> (<em>kay</em>-zhoo)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">For such a small country, Portugal can rival France or Italy in sheer number of cheeses. But, alas, variety and nuance are limited, as the lion’s share of cheeses are made from either sheep’s or goat’s milk. A few are a mixture of both, with even fewer adding cow’s milk to soften and round out the flavor. A handful of cheeses are made from just cow’s milk, but only one ranks up there with the best, and that’s São Jorge, from the Azorean island of the same name.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, since Portugal joined the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union (EU), in 1986, its cheese production has improved immeasurably, and quite a few varieties now share winners’ circles with other world-class cheeses. The finest have been given <em>Denominação de Origem Protegida</em> (DOP) status, which guarantees that the cheeses have been produced and processed in a specific area using local traditions and techniques. (Portugal now has more than one hundred foods with protected status.) Of the countless cheeses Portugal produces, most are made in such small quantities that they never make it beyond the borders for foreigners to enjoy. The ones you’re most likely to find online or at gourmet shops in the United States are listed below.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s030">Queijo Serra da Estrela (DOP)<br />
    (<em>kay</em>-zhoo <em>seh</em>-ruh duh esh-<em>trel</em>-luh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">This is the reigning monarch of Portuguese cheese and has been for more than eight hundred years. Produced from the raw milk of Bordaleira sheep that graze on Beira Alta’s soaring Serra da Estrela mountain range, hence the name, queijo da Serra is still a handmade, artisanal cheese. Because of the work involved, each maker can turn out at most three wheels a day, but the EU is pressuring makers to automate the process. The cheese is produced in colder months, primarily from November to March, and it undergoes a four- to six-week maturation process. Initially the cheese is sumptuously, creamily soft, and the linen-wrapped wheels are traditionally served with their tops shorn off and spoons are passed around for scooping. As it ages, the cheese firms up but never hardens.</p>

    <p class="indent">When I was visiting Quinta do Vallado, a winery in the Douro region, my host told me a queijo da Serra secret that I’ve taken full advantage of since: after most of the cheese has been scooped and scraped from the wheel, boil up some spaghetti, drain it, and dump it into the hollow wheel. A quick stir and a good dose of freshly ground black pepper is all you need for an exquisite dinner.</p>

    <p class="indent">To pick a perfect wedge or wheel, definitely poke. The rind should yield under even the slightest pressure. And always serve the cheese at room temperature, taking it out of the fridge up to three hours in advance if necessary. If you’re bereft of queijo da Serra in your area, you can order it online (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>) or for these recipes you can substitute Spain’s queso de la Serena or an imported Brie or Camembert.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s031">Azeitão (DOP) (ah-zay-<em>towhn</em>)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Some Portuguese swear by Azeitão, claiming it’s even better than queijo da Serra. This raw sheep’s-milk cheese is produced on small <em>quintas,</em> <a id="page21"></a>or estates, cut into the vertiginous slopes of Estremadura’s Arrábida mountains on the Setúbal Peninsula, about twenty-five miles south of Lisbon. As Azeitão ages, it moves elegantly from unctuously soft in its youth to firmer but eminently spreadable in later life, never losing its characteristic earthy tang and sweet floral overtones.</p>

    <p class="indent">If you come up empty-handed at your cheese monger, ask for a soft or semi-soft sheep’s-milk cheese such as Spain’s queso de la Serena.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s032">Serpa (DOP) (<em>sair</em>-puh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">One of the Alentejo’s triumvirate of cheeses (the others are Nisa and Évora), Serpa is a raw sheep’s-milk cheese. Traditionally it was made from the milk of merino sheep, but nowadays the milk of the more prolific Lacaune sheep is often used. Serpa, like most of Portugal’s great cheeses, isn’t coagulated with rennet but rather with the flowers of the cardoon thistle, a popular tradition on the Iberian Peninsula. The resulting paste is a light straw color with a distinctive buttery texture and a complex sweet-pungent taste when young; it matures into a firmer feel and spiky bite when aged.</p>

    <p class="indent">If you can’t find Serpa, ask your cheese monger for a semi-soft sheep’s-milk cheese along the lines of a Spanish Torta del Casar.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s033">Nisa (DOP) (<em>nee</em>-suh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">The second Alentejan sister is Nisa, a semi-firm raw sheep’s-milk cheese that ranges from mild and nutty in its youth to intensely flavorful with tangy, barnyardy overtones in maturity. To mimic the flavor and piquancy of Nisa, substitute a lovely young Spanish Manchego, Malvarosa, or Roncal.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s034">Évora (DOP) (<em>eh</em>-vuh-rduh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Another noteworthy Alentejan cheese is Évora, from the UNESCO city of the same name. In fact, these small wheels were once so coveted they were used as currency. Considered by many to be the best of the Alentejan trio, this old-style raw sheep’s-milk cheese is occasionally eaten young, when it’s soft and has a creamy, slightly salty edge. But more often it’s preferred aged, when it’s firmer and can bite back with its characteristic spicy tang. A good stand-in for Évora, both in texture and saltiness, is Pecorino Romano.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s035">São Jorge (DOP) (sowhn <em>zhorzh</em>)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Hailing from the impossibly lush volcanic island of São Jorge in the Azorean archipelago, queijo de São Jorge (also commonly known as queijo da Ilha) is a holdover from fifteenth-century Flemish settlers who took cows with them from mainland Europe. Until recently, the cheese was made in the traditional manner, by small farm families; now a cooperative, which includes all but one farm, produces it. Still, by comparison to other countries, the production is extremely small. Aged two, three, or four months (only São Jorge that’s three months or older is considered DOP-worthy), the cheese ranges from mild and sweet to nutty and mouth-tinglingly piquant. It’s also surprisingly versatile: it can be set out as an <em>acepipe,</em> or pre-dinner nibble; chunked into salads; or grated on top of gratins. Substitute an assertive English Cheddar or Cantal.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s036">Requeijão (reh-kay-<em>zhowhn</em>)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Made from the whey of sheep’s milk, Requeijão is similar in texture to Italy’s famous ricotta, another whey cheese. The best Requeijão by far is made from the whey of queijo da Serra. In Portugal, you can find Requeijão everywhere, but at farmers’ markets and small <em>mercados,</em> or markets, the artisan-made cheese is still sold nestled in little baskets. The Portuguese eat Requeijão as both a savory snack, sprinkled with salt and spread on bread, and a dessert, dusted with cinnamon and sugar or drizzled with honey.</p>

    <p class="indent">If you can’t find Requeijão at your local gourmet shop, pick up some excellent-quality ricotta. Before using it, drain it in a cheesecloth-lined colander to remove some of the excess moisture; Requeijão is a bit drier than ricotta. Be careful of Requeijão cremoso, if you see it—it’s as soft as yogurt and isn’t suited for the recipes in this book.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s037"><a id="page22"></a><span class="small2">CLAMS</span> <em>amêijoas</em> (uh-<em>may</em>-zhoo-izh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Clams are the great codependent ingredient of Portuguese cuisine. They’re found in classic dishes that pair them up with pork, such as the famous <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c005_r1.htm#page135">Alentejan-Style Pork with Clams</a> and the equally well-known <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c003_r1.htm#page92">Clams in a Cataplana</a>. They’re also part of <em>açorda de marisco,</em> a shellfish and bread soup studded with mussels, shrimp, and sometimes scallops, which are prohibitively expensive in Portugal.</p>

    <p class="indent">The most commonly eaten clams in the country are in the family that includes the Carpet Shell and Venus varieties. Small, delicate, and deliciously sweet, they also have a unique characteristic: they have two necks! Excellent substitutes are cockles, Manila clams (often marketed as Japanese cockles), and butter clams. But make sure to buy the smallest you can—about 1½ inches across. In a pinch, tiny East Coast littlenecks will do, but they’ll have to be served the moment they pop open, or they’ll quickly turn to rubber.</p>

    <p class="center" id="new03"><img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_008_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s038"><span class="small2">CURED MEATS</span> <em>carnes curadas</em> (kahnizh koo-<em>rah</em>-thizh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">If the symbol of working-class prosperity in this country was once, as Herbert Hoover said, a chicken in every pot, then, unquestionably, in Portugal it’s a dry-cured smoked sausage in every pan. So ubiquitous are sausages, as well as hams, that until very recently nearly every country household made its own. My family still does here in the States. My uncle even built a smoker the size of a minivan in the middle of Somerville, Massachusetts, so we all could enjoy my grandmother’s and aunts’ truly incomparable sausages.</p>

    <p class="indent">If you have the chance to buy Portuguese sausages at the market, make sure they’re firm, not squishy. Spongy links mean a lot of fillers, and bloated ones are waterlogged. True artisanal sausages are bumpy with dry skin—sometimes with a harmless white bloom on it—and a deep smoky aroma. If your local specialty store doesn’t carry them, see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a> for purveyors.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s039">Chouriço (show-<em>rdee</em>-soo)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">It’s my experience that chouriço is the favored link in Portugal. Made from chunks of pork loin with a good amount of added fat—the proportions are always the secret of the maker—plus loads of paprika, garlic, red or white wine, and hot piri-piri sauce, chouriço is first air-dried and then heavily smoked. It’s served boiled, grilled, fried, or roasted. One of the showier presentations is firemen’s sausage, where a link of sausage is doused with <em>aguardente,</em> a powerful distilled spirit, and set ablaze. Amid a great whoosh of flame, and shrieks from the table, the sausage’s skin chars and blisters and the meat takes on a sweetness when dipped in the liquor.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s040"><a id="page23"></a>Linguiça (leen-<em>gwee</em>-suh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Some Portuguese may have conniptions when they read this, but nonetheless it’s true: there’s virtually no difference between chouriço and linguiça. They’re made from the same basic ingredients in the same exact manner. Still, some Portuguese insist that linguiça is spicier, yet I’ve had some chouriço so hot it blisters your lips. Others maintain that linguiça is more finely ground or leaner than chouriço. Not necessarily true. After a decade of asking questions on two continents, I’ve come to the conclusion than any slight difference tends to be the result of the producer as opposed to nationally accepted categorization. The only consistent distinction is that linguiça is smaller in diameter, because it’s made from the small intestines of the pig, while chouriço is made from the large. Oh, one other misconception: linguiça is not made from tongue, even though <em>lingua</em> is the Portuguese word for tongue.</p>

    <p class="indent">For both sausages, you can substitute Spanish chorizo, but make sure it’s the dry-cured version; Spain also makes a raw product. Be forewarned, though: Spanish links can be much fattier than chouriço or linguiça, so the fat will need to be drained or skimmed during cooking. Regarding the skin, you can leave it on or remove it—your choice.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s041">Presunto (preh-<em>zoon</em>-too)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">This dry-cured ham of Portugal has few equals. Its supremacy comes from allowing the pigs to gorge themselves for up to sixty days on cork oak acorns before meeting their fate, as well as from the laborious process of quick-salting, rinsing, long-term salting, and natural airdrying. This leaves the sublimely silky meat a deep red purple with superb marbling, ringed by a layer of opalescent ivory fat.</p>

    <p class="indent">The country’s two finest areas for presunto production are the towns of Chaves and Lamego, in the Trás-os-Montes region in the north, which rubs its hams with a coating of sweet paprika and olive oil before smoking; and the Alentejo, in the south, which prefers to keep its hams uncoated and unsmoked. For the Alentejan presunto, the hoof is left on to prove it comes from the famous <em>porco preto,</em> or black pig. <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_itr2_r1.htm#page28">Presunto</a> is served in thin slices on its own, in sandwiches, and alongside fresh fruit. It’s also used in cooking to add a depth of flavor and a bit of a salty bite.</p>

    <p class="indent">Unfortunately, because Portugal is still grappling with the United States over exporting presunto here, you’ll have to settle for some excellent domestic versions (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>) or you can substitute Spain’s jamón serrano (serrano ham) or Italy’s prosciutto di Parma.</p>

    <p class="indent">Note: If the cured ham you get is too salty, soak it in cold water for 5 minutes. Also, some of these recipes call for a ⅛- or ¼-inch-thick slice of presunto. Depending on what part of the leg it’s cut from, and therefore how big the piece, you may not need all of it for the recipe. It’ll keep for several weeks in the refrigerator or up to two months in the freezer, tightly wrapped. Add it to cheese platters, omelets, or salads, or cut it into small cubes, fry, and sprinkle on baked potatoes.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s042"><span class="small2">GARLIC</span> <em>alho</em> (<em>ahl</em>-yoo)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">The Portuguese can’t put enough garlic cloves, called <em>dentes,</em> or teeth, into their dishes. It’s even part of <em>refogado</em> (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c009_r1.htm#page240">Lightly Sautéed Onions and Garlic</a>), the foundation for nearly every savory dish in the Portuguese repertoire. Forget buying pre-minced stuff. Buy heads that feel firm and full for their size. If you happen to slice into a clove and see a slender green tendril, called the germ, growing in the middle, pop it out with the tip of the knife. It makes for a bitter bite.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s043"><span class="small2">HEAT</span> <em>calor</em> (<em>cuh</em>-lord)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Heat is without a doubt the most taken-for-granted, and overlooked, ingredient in cooking. But it’s, perhaps, one of the hardest ingredients to deal with. Throughout this book, I’ve specified precise degrees of burner heat and oven temperatures, as well as cooking times. But nothing’s more variable than heat: my medium-high <a id="page24"></a>flame or 350°F oven inevitably won’t be exactly like yours. Think of my instructions as guidelines. What you need to do is use your five senses. Does the <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c008_r1.htm#page220">Orange Cake</a> look deeply golden brown and spring back when touched? If not, let it stay in until it does, even if it takes 10 minutes longer in your oven. If the onions for the <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c001_r1.htm#page42">Tuna Spread</a> are cooking too quickly, nudge down the heat or take the pan off the burner for a while. Smell, touch, taste, listen, and watch: it’s how my grandmother learned to be a great cook. She was illiterate, and she couldn’t write a recipe—or even read this cookbook if she had wanted to—yet the memories of her food still haunt my family.</p>

    <p class="center" id="new04"><img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_009_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s044"><span class="small2">HERBS AND SPICES</span> <em>ervas e especiarias</em> (<em>aird</em>-vuhz ee eh-shpee-suh-<em>ree</em>-izh)</h2>

    <h3 class="section" id="s045">Allspice <em>pimenta de Jamaica</em> (pee-<em>man</em>-tuh duh zhuh-<em>may</em>-kuh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Because of its complex flavor, allspice is often thought to be a combination of warm aromatics that include cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. But it’s a spice unto itself. Although not often used in mainland Portuguese cooking, allspice, frequently in its whole-berry form, is a staple of Azorean cooking. Make sure to have it on hand for an excellent twist on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c005_r1.htm#page144">Alcatra</a>, a classic beef braise from the island of Terceira.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s046">Bay leaf <em>louro</em> (<em>low</em>-rdoo)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Another classic ingredient, bay leaf is found in many Portuguese soups, stews, and braised dishes. But a little bay goes a long way. Make sure to buy Turkish bay leaf if you can, rather than the more pungent and overpowering California variety. If all you have is the latter, use only half a leaf for each whole one called for in the recipe. All the recipes in this book were developed using the more easily found dried leaves, which don’t have the bitter bite of the fresh version. Before serving, always remove the leaf from any dish except <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c009_r1.htm#page232">Amped-Up Red Pepper Paste</a> which pulverizes the herb in a food processor. To order Turkish bay leaves online, see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s047">Cinnamon <em>canela</em> (ka-<em>na</em>-luh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Although the spice was first taken to Europe from Sri Lanka in the thirteenth century by Arab traders and returning Crusaders, no one has made better use of, or had a more insatiable appetite for cinnamon than the Portuguese. It has insinuated its way into savory dishes as well as countless egg sweets, many of which hark back to the Moors. If you can find “true” cinnamon from Ceylon, pick it up. Sweeter, lighter in color, and floral in scent, it simply trounces the closely related cinnamon stand-in spice, cassia, which is more widely available in the States. Make sure to have both ground cinnamon (<em>canela em pó</em>) and cinnamon sticks (<em>canela em pau</em>) on hand.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s048">Cilantro <em>coentro</em> (koo-<em>ayn</em>-troo)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Although it’s indigenous to southern Europe, cilantro is almost all but ignored by everyone on the continent except the Portuguese. And that’s one of the great differences between Portuguese and Spanish cooking. Traditionally used extensively in the cooking of the southern provinces of the Alentejo and the Algarve, cilantro now takes the prize as the most popular herb nationwide.</p>

    <p class="indent">When buying cilantro, root out the most tender, most fragrant bunches possible. At home, soak the herb well in a bowl of cold water to remove all traces of grit; lift out, leaving the dirt behind; then roll the bunch in a damp paper towel and store in a plastic bag in the fridge. It should last for at least a week.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s049">Paprika <em>colorau</em> (koo-loo-<em>rahw</em>) and páprica (<em>pah</em>-pree-kuh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Ah, another conundrum. The pepper family has always caused great confusion throughout the world when it comes to nomenclature. Considering that the Portuguese were responsible for distributing the fruit around the rest of the globe, after Christopher Columbus took it back <a id="page25"></a>from the New World, you’d think there’d be some sort of a unified naming system for them. Alas, there’s not.</p>

    <p class="indent">It’s best to think of paprika on a scale from mild to hot. On the mildest end is <em>colorau doce</em>, which is made from ground, dried red bell peppers. Inching toward the hot end is <em>colorau.</em> Even closer to the hotter end of the spectrum is what the Portuguese call <em>páprica,</em> made from more piquant peppers in the same family. In Portugal, these spices aren’t always used interchangeably. Many cooks prefer to use <em>colorau</em> for adding a terra-cotta color and just a touch of flavor to dishes. My maternal grandmother, vovó Costa, never let her soups or rice dishes leave her kitchen unless they were blushing with <em>colorau. Páprica</em> is reached for when more heat is required.</p>

    <p class="indent">As you flip through these recipes, you’ll notice I use Spanish smoked paprika a lot. I do this for two reasons. First, because it’s been slowly showing up on spice shelves in Portuguese homes. But more important, because it’s a gamble whether domestic smoked chouriço or linguiça will have the requisite brio to make a dish stand out, I call on smoked paprika to do some of the heavy lifting. It mimics that musky smokiness that pervades so many popular Portuguese dishes.</p>

    <p class="indent">While living in Portugal, I was surprised to discover that <em>páprica,</em> and even <em>colorau,</em> can vary not just in heat but also in bitterness. Experiment a bit with different brands. For best results, I suggest buying the sweetest, least bitter paprika—both regular and smoked—you can find.</p>

    <h3 class="section" id="s050">Parsley <em>salsa</em> (<em>sahl</em>-suh)</h3>

    <p class="nonindent">Parsley is second only to cilantro as Portugal’s favorite herb. It’s steeped in soups, tucked into braises, and sprinkled over entrées. When shopping, look for the flat-leaf variety with lush, tender stems and leaves. Rinse the herb well in water, then roll the bunch in a damp paper towel and store in a plastic bag in the fridge. It’ll last for at least a week.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s051"><span class="small2">KALE</span> <em>couve</em> (kove)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Arguably the leafy vegetable most associated with Portugal, kale is what lends the “green” to <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c002_r1.htm#page69">Green Soup</a> or Caldo Verde, which many consider to be the national dish. While several varieties of kale are grown in Portugal, the most popular, and the only one used in caldo verde, is <em>couve galega.</em> The leaves, which grow on tall woody stalks, are broad and flat—perfect for cutting into the whisker-thin shavings for the soup. To this day, cooks can find bags of pre-slivered clippings at markets such as the Bulhão in Porto, filled with bawdy farmers’ wives and feisty fishmongers, or the Mercado da Ribeira, in Lisbon.</p>

    <p class="indent">I find the kale sold in the States to be tougher and less tasty than that in Portugal. I’ve had greater success using collard greens.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s052"><a id="page26"></a><span class="small2">LARD</span> <em>banha</em> (<em>bah</em>-nyuh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent"><em>Banha</em> is identical to our rendered leaf lard, the fat found around a pig’s kidneys. It’s pristine white and still widely used when cooking meats. Although it’s a saturated fat, it’s a far cry from the hydrogenated products loaded with trans fats so often used in this country. In fact, it’s sublime. And with the recent studies undemonizing saturated fats, lard, used with a light hand, can add tremendous flavor to your cooking. Resist those commercial bricks lingering on grocery shelves, though. Instead, <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c009_r1.htm#page247">render your own</a>. The taste is infinitely better.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s053"><span class="small2">OLIVE OIL</span> <em>azeite</em> (uh-<em>zayt</em>)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Until recently, when cooks thought of olive oil, Portugal didn’t rush to mind. And for good reason. For quite a long time, many producers would leave heaps of the harvested olives sitting for days before pressing, kicking off anaerobic fermentation deep inside the mounds, a process that gave the oil a fusty odor and taste—something prized by the Portuguese. To add insult to injury, the Portuguese have always loved oils with high acidity (read: rancidity). I don’t, nor do, it seems, the European Union and the International Olive Oil Council. The two groups clamped down, and now growers from the Alentejo, Ribatejo, the Beiras, and Trás-os-Montes—the four largest oil-producing regions—are turning out oils that can hold their own on the world market.</p>

    <p class="indent">But rather than shelling out big bucks for bottles of top-shelf extra-virgin olive oil for the recipes in this book, pick up a bottle of less expensive extra-virgin oil or fine-quality virgin olive oil. Either is perfectly acceptable for the skillet, where its flavor is changed by the heating process and the foods being cooked. High-end olive oil should be reserved for drizzling over salads, vegetables, and soups just before serving so its flavor shines (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>).</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s054"><span class="small2">OLIVES</span> <em>azeitonas</em> (ah-zay-<em>taw</em>-nizh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">The Portuguese have what could be described as a love affair with olives. At parties, I’ve seen people moan when a bowl is set out and sneak an extra handful when the host or hostess isn’t looking.</p>

    <p class="indent">So in love with their olives are the Portuguese, they have many methods of preparing their favorite ones.</p>

    <p class="indent">The beloved olive of the Alentejo is the Maçanilha, which gets the spa treatment around the town of Elvas, a stone’s throw from the Spanish border. There the olives are washed daily in water for two weeks, then nestled in salt along with marjoram and plenty of fresh bay leaves. In the same region, the Cordovil and, sometimes, the Maçanilha olives are pitted and stuffed with almonds, garlic, red bell pepper, or capers. In Vila de Rei, in the dead center of the country, they’re fond of stuffing their brined olives with bits of salt cod, cheese, or leftover pork, and they happily gild the lily by <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c001_r1.htm#page36">coating and deep frying them</a>. The folks in Vila Real and Bragança, in the north, prefer their olives, the black DOP Negrinha de Freixo, straight up—with nothing but a bowl for the pits.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the sunny Algarve, in the south, the Maçanilha is used to create the delicacy <em>azeitonas britadas</em> (cracked olives). For this the green olives are split using stones and rinsed each morning in water for several weeks before being submerged in brine and flavored with lemon zest, garlic, and whatever herbs please the cook.</p>

    <p class="indent">I’ve had good success substituting Spanish manzanilla for Portuguese green olives and Greek kalamata, Italian gaeta, and French niçoise for Portuguese black olives.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s055"><a id="page27"></a><span class="small2">ONIONS</span> <em>cebolas</em> (seh-<em>bow</em>-lizh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Hands-down, the most popular onion in Portugal is the familiar yellow onion with its brown papery skin. Walking down the hill near my apartment in Lisbon in the morning, I’d see bags of them slumped against the doors of all the restaurants in the Alfama section.</p>

    <p class="indent">Yellow onions have a more pungent kick than the seasonal sweet varieties such as Vidalia and Maui, which are better for eating raw. When cooked, though, yellow onions become marvelously sweet and add texture and layers of flavor to a dish. They’re so important to Portuguese cooking that they’re the base of countless dishes. Nearly every savory recipe begins with “<em>Faz</em> (make) <em>um refogado.</em>” <em>Refogado</em> is onion, and sometimes a bit of garlic, slowly cooked in olive oil until meltingly tender. I always have <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c009_r1.htm#page240">a jar on hand</a> so I can plop a few tablespoons of the golden mixture into a pan and be on my way. Saves a lot of time during the week.</p>

    <p class="indent">Considering that many supermarkets don’t distinguish between yellow onions and the gigantic softball-size Spanish onions, here are the general diameters of onions called for in this book: small are 2 inches, medium are 3 inches, and large are 3¾ inches. When buying onions, pick those that are firm, feel heavy for their size, and have no soft spots. Store them in a basket in a cool, dry, dark place. Whatever you do, avoid the crisper of your fridge, which will cause them to spoil.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s056"><span class="small2">PEPPERS</span> <em>piri-piri</em> (<em>pee</em>-rdee <em>pee</em>-rdee)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Piri-piri are fiery-hot little bird peppers from Mozambique, a former colony, that made their way to Portugal aboard the ships returning from the African coast and points farther east. Immigrants from Mozambique and Angola, another former colony, with their insatiable appetites for the pepper, sparked an interest in all things piri-piri on the mainland. Dishes from the classic repertoire include <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c004_r1.htm#page118">Grilled Chicken Slathered in Hot Sauce</a> and <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c003_r1.htm#page97">Grilled Shrimp with Piri-Piri Sauce</a>.</p>

    <p class="indent">Because fresh piri-piri peppers are impossible to find in North America, choosing the right chile to substitute can be a challenge. Chileheads will automatically reach for the hottest of the hot, but hold off: piri-piri peppers vary enormously. The ones used in Portuguese cooking clock in at about the 40,000- to 60,000-unit mark on the Scoville scale, developed to measure the heat in chiles. While piri-piri peppers are most definitely hot, they won’t blow off the top of your head. Substitute fresh or dried red cayenne, tabasco, pequín, or santaka peppers. In your supermarket, look for those that rank a heat rating of 7 or 8 (on a scale of 1 to 10).</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s057"><span class="small2">PORK</span> <em>porco</em> (<em>poor</em>-koo)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">From the Minho in the north to the Algarve in the south, as well as in Madeira and the Azores, pork rules. It’s the national meat, and only in the Azores does pork have a rival, for there the beef is so exceptional it holds DOP status.</p>

    <p class="indent">At the top of the pork pyramid is the Alentejan <em>porco preto,</em> or black pig, officially designated in Portugal as Porco de Raça Alentejana. It’s an ancient, dark-skinned breed descended from wild boars, and the pigs are distinctive because they’re allowed to forage for food, most notably acorns from the area’s cork trees. The result is dark flesh full of sweet flavor and striated with succulent fat.</p>

    <p class="indent">The greatest difference between Portugal’s pigs—both black and not—and our own is that we’ve bred every last ounce of flavor and fat out of ours. The “other white meat” may be lean, but it can’t stand up to the dishes in this book. I’ve made appropriate substitutions in the recipes by, for example, opting for pork tenderloin or even pork shoulder instead of hockey-puck-dry loin. In Portugal, pork loin is exceptionally tender and juicy. To get the most out of the pork recipes in this book, I suggest talking with your butcher. He may sell heritage pork, from free-roaming breeds of pigs that root out their own food and, as a result, produce better meat. You can also order excellent cuts of pork from online suppliers; see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s058"><span class="small2">POTATOES</span> <em>batatas</em> (buh-<em>tah</em>-tizh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">What would Portuguese cooking be without potatoes? They’re served everywhere in just about every form—boiled, puréed, fried, sautéed, and “punched.” And while I risk making enemies by saying this, I happen to find the potatoes of the mainland superior in taste to those of Madeira and the Azores. Those of the continent are deep yellow with an incomparable earthy, nutty flavor. According to my friend, gentleman farmer Luís Vasconcellos e Souza, the most highly prized is the Dutch cultivar Mona Lisa, and, when planted in the rich soil of the Ribatejo region, it’s the one reached for when making <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c006_r1.htm#page173">Punched Potatoes</a>.</p>

    <p class="indent">To simplify things, there are two major types of potatoes in Portugal: “red” and “white,” which refer to their skin color (a misnomer because the white potato actually has a yellowish skin) and correspond more or less in texture and taste to our Red Bliss and Yukon Gold, respectively. If you can’t find Red Bliss, any round red boiling potato will do, as will any all-purpose yellow potato for the Yukon Gold. Floury potatoes, such as our Idaho spuds, are rarely seen in Portugal.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s059"><a id="page29"></a><span class="small2">RICE</span> <em>arroz</em> (uh-<em>rawsh</em>)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">A staple of the Portuguese table, rice is the country’s favorite starch. The average Portuguese eats thirty-six pounds of rice a year—versus thirteen pounds for other Europeans. In fact, it’s so adored it’s not unusual to have rice <em>and</em> potatoes on the same plate. My grandmother often made her soups with both, and my aunt Irena still serves creamy <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c006_r1.htm#page185">Tomato Rice</a> with roasted pork and potatoes.</p>

    <p class="indent">What comes as a surprise to many people is that Portugal has been a large producer of rice for close to four centuries. The Ribatejo region and the area near Figueira da Foz, in Beira Litoral, are renowned for their rice paddies. One of Portugal’s most common rices is the short-grained Carolino, a product of the Lezírias Ribatejanas area just north and south of the Tagus River. The rice, which sops up flavors and liquid superbly and is called for in many classic dishes, now carries the Indicação Geográfica Protegida (IGP) designation, meaning only rice from this region that undergoes a particular process can be called Carolino. Arroz Agulha is long-grained, and some Portuguese prefer it for use in side dishes.</p>

    <p class="indent">With the exception of the <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c008_r1.htm#page214">Rice Pudding Redux</a> and the risottos, which call for Carolino, Carnaroli, or Arborio rice, any high-quality long-grain rice works well in these recipes.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s060"><span class="small2">SALT</span> <em>sal</em> (sahl)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">The most important thing I can say about salt isn’t what kind to buy but rather how to use it. Too many cooks hold off salting—and peppering—their food until it’s minutes away from being served. The results: negligible. You have to salt as you go. And don’t forget to taste! Salt is so important because it brings out the flavors of food. Correctly salted food will never taste salty; it will taste only of the other ingredients.</p>

    <p class="indent">I use coarse kosher salt in cooking because it’s widely available and because I can control exactly how much I’m using when I pinch some between my fingertips. There are excellent salts in central Portugal, but I find the best are in the Algarve. One of the finest is Belmandil (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>). The company has salt pans in the Parque Natural da Ria Formosa, a protected national park filled with marshes and lagoons that stretches from Faro almost to the Spanish border. The salt is still hand-harvested in the same backbreaking way it always has been, using salt rakes. Belmandil’s two most sought-after products are <em>flor de sal,</em> a finest-grade sea salt for topping food at the table, and <em>sal marinho tradicional</em>, a coarser salt perfect for cooking and grilling.</p>

    <p class="center" id="new06"><img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_012_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s061"><span class="small2">SALT COD</span> <em>bacalhau</em> (buh-kul-<em>yow</em>)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Because salt cod is one of Portugal’s iconic foods, many think the Portuguese were instrumental in its discovery, which, alas, they weren’t. Nearly five hundred years before the Portuguese began fishing for cod in the Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland, the Vikings had stumbled upon one of the world’s largest caches of cod and figured out how to air-dry the fish. Not long after, the wily Basques cornered the cod market because not only did they have an uncanny ability to keep mum about where they were getting such top-shelf stock, they also figured out that salting the fish before drying it made it last even longer. Of course, they had a global (and unwitting) partner: the Catholic church, whose laws demanding a staggering number of meatless days practically lined Basque pockets with gold. Nonetheless, once the Portuguese, excellent seamen themselves, discovered the secrets, they wasted no time in catching up.</p>

    <p class="indent">But salt cod today isn’t like the cod of centuries ago—or even several decades ago. I remember when I was six years old walking into the local grocery, the floor strewn with sawdust, and watching my grandfather flip through big boxes of <em>bacalhau,</em> turning over massive hard <a id="page30"></a>planks of the stuff, trying to find the right cut, the right thickness. He’d thwack his hands together every once in a while to clean them, so thickly encrusted with salt were the pieces. Nowadays, the cod is mildly salted and in some cases, such as pieces that are sold in plastic bags, isn’t even entirely dry. While it took two, sometimes three, days to desalt and rehydrate a loin of cod when I was a kid, it can now be done in as little as a day, depending on the piece and supplier.</p>

    <p class="indent">The reason why salt cod is so prized in the Portuguese community, besides being a cheap and shelf-stable staple, is because the drying and salting gives a superior taste and texture to an otherwise characterless fish. When a meaty slab of <em>bacalhau</em> is properly desalted and cooked, it will flake perfectly and have just the slightest toothsomeness.</p>

    <p class="indent">But what exactly <em>is</em> properly desalted cod? To some, it’s cod without any trace of salt. To others, like my father, it still has a bit of a salty bite. I prefer to remove almost all of the salt, so I’m left with something resembling a well-seasoned piece of fish.</p>

    <p class="indent">Look for salt cod, preferably from Norway, in Portuguese, Italian, Greek, Spanish, or Latin markets. I’ve also had very good luck with several online purveyors (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>). Buy the thickest, firmest pieces possible; they’ll make for a more substantial meal and a prettier presentation.</p>

    <p class="indent">To reconstitute the fish, rinse well under running water to remove surface salt. Place the pieces in a large bowl and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Stretch plastic wrap over the top and refrigerate, changing the water several times, until the fish is sufficiently desalted for you. Take a nibble—it’s perfectly safe to eat. If it’s too salty, change the water again, and let it sit for a few more hours. The process can take anywhere from 12 to 48 hours, depending on the size of the fillet. Above all, bear this in mind: you can always add more salt, but you can’t remove it from a finished dish.</p>

    <p class="indent">To cook <em>bacalhau,</em> bring a saucepan filled with water—or, if you prefer, milk—to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, add the soaked cod, and simmer gently until it flakes easily when poked with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness. Drain in a colander and let cool. Remove any bits of skin, bones, and spongy ends, and the cod is ready to use.</p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s062"><span class="small2">TOMATO</span> <em>tomate</em> (toh-<em>maht</em>)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Since the Spanish and Portuguese voyages to the Americas, tomatoes, a New World fruit, have been worshipped in the Iberian kitchen. They’re pressed into service in an enormous <a id="page31"></a>number of dishes, from hors d’oeuvres to desserts. My personal favorite sweet treatment is <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c008_r1.htm#page225">Tomato Jam</a>. But the Portuguese draw very particular—and peculiar—lines when it comes to their tomatoes. For cooking, they prefer the drop-dead ripe <em>chucha</em> (sometimes spelled <em>xuxa</em>) variety, which is similar to our plum tomato. But for salads, sandwiches, and eating out of hand, they reach for firm globe fruit with a goodly amount of green tinge to them. One day when walking through the Mercado 31 de Janeiro in the Saldanha district of Lisbon, I asked my friend Teresa why the odd preference. She said simply, “We like the sweet and sour flavor and the firmness.” For the recipes in this book, use the ripest, juiciest plum tomatoes you can find. If they’re out of season, canned San Marzano are an ideal substitute.</p>

    <p class="indent">Also you may notice I call for double-concentrate tomato paste in some recipes. And that’s exactly what it is—a stronger, more flavorful paste. I find it lends a dish the kind of depth of flavor that Portuguese tomatoes do.</p>

    <p class="center" id="new07"><img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_013_r1.jpg" /></p>

    <h2 class="section1" id="s063"><span class="small2">TURNIP GREENS</span> <em>nabiças</em> (nuh-<em>bee</em>-sizh) and <em>grelos</em> (<em>greh</em>-loosh)</h2>

    <p class="nonindent">Many authors and cooks have stated incorrectly that <em>grelos</em> is the Portuguese term for turnip greens, sending generations of American cooks on disappointing trips through the supermarket. After speaking to many farmers and <em>engenheiros agrónomos</em> (agricultural engineers) and digging though countless produce cartons in markets, I discovered there are three major forms of <em>grelos</em> used in Portuguese cooking—and none is identical to our greens.</p>

    <p class="indent">First are <em>nabiças</em>, the shoots of young turnips that are harvested for their leaves; the turnip isn’t given a chance to develop. If a recipe requires them, you can safely reach for plain old American turnip greens. While not the same, they offer up a similar flavor and texture.</p>

    <p class="indent">Next are <em>grelos de nabo,</em> by far the most popular <em>grelos,</em> which are formed when the turnip matures and its energy is sent into the stalks, causing them to start to bud with tiny yellow flowers. If a recipe calls for <em>grelos de nabo,</em> grab a bunch of broccoli rabe, which is more closely related to the turnip family than to the broccoli clan. It has the same mini heads, pleasant crunch, and slight bitterness of the Portuguese green.</p>

    <p class="indent">Last are <em>grelos de couve.</em> Grown in a few regions in Portugal, they’re the green shoots of particular cultivars of kale. Young collard greens are a suitable substitute.</p>
