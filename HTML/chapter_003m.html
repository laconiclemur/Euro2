<h2 class="h2b">CHAPON DE MER FARCI</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Stuffed Scorpion Fish</em></h3>
<p class="normall0">Chapon farci <em>is a great Provençal dish that I hope the adventurous among you will try. It is less well known than bouillabaisse or</em> bourride <em>only because of the scarcity of the fish and the cooks who can prepare it. For me</em>, chapon de mer – <em>which we know as scorpion fish – is unquestionably the greatest Mediterranean fish: the slightly spiny and actually dangerous orange-red exterior revealing exciting flesh that is as firm, pale and tender as can be. The taste and texture are said to be similar to that of capon, hence the name; but I disagree: it is unique. I have eaten</em> chapon <em>grilled simply with lemon and sage, roasted with artichokes and potatoes, and gently cooked in saffron and olive oil. All are wonderful, but braised, as here, in a stock slightly redolent of bouillabaisse that gains flavour with each gentle baste, it has no equal</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1 large scorpion fish, about 1.5kg (3lb 5oz)<br/>
4 tiger prawns, peeled (keep the shells for the stock)<br/>
2 small white onions, peeled and chopped<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped<br/>
1 small red pepper, seeded and chopped<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) olive oil<br/>
1 tbsp tomato concentrate<br/>
100ml (3fl oz) white wine<br/>
1 pinch saffron threads<br/>
100g (3½ oz) Swiss chard leaves (or spinach or rocket)<br/>
250g (9oz) recipe <em>Confit de Tomates</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006b.html#page166">see here</a></em>), chopped<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) dried breadcrumbs<br/>
8 sage leaves, finely sliced<br/>
1 egg yolk<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO SERVE</span><br/>
4 tbsp <em>Rouille</em> (<em><a href="chapter_003d.html#page77">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut off all of the fins then scale the <em>chapon</em>. Remove the central bone by cutting down each side of the backbone, stopping just before the tail and the head. With a pair of strong scissors cut through the bone just before the tail and the head. Empty the fish, reserving the liver. Remove any pin bones with a pair of tweezers. Reserve all of the bones for the stock. Remove the black threads from the prawns, and chop the flesh.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the onion, garlic and red pepper in the olive oil for 5 minutes until soft. Separate this mixture into two and add the bones from the fish, the prawn shells and the tomato concentrate to one half. Fry for about 2 more minutes until the bones begin to caramelise, then add the white wine and reduce it by half. Cover with water, bring to the boil and boil for 15 minutes, topping up the water if necessary. Strain first of all through a colander, bashing the bones and shells with the back of a ladle to extract every last bit of flavour. Bring back to the boil, then strain through a fine sieve and add the saffron. It seems like a lot of trouble but you get more volume and flavour this way.</p>
<p class="normala">For the stuffing, slice the Swiss chard leaves, add them to the second half of the onion–garlic mixture and cook for 5 minutes until soft. Add the chopped prawns, <em>confit</em> tomatoes, breadcrumbs and sliced sage. Remove from the heat, add the egg yolk and season well with salt and cayenne.</p>
<p class="normala">Season the flesh of the <em>chapon</em>, and stuff it, pressing the mixture in well. Tie it up at least three times, then put the <em>chapon</em> in an ovenproof dish that just holds it. Pour over the stock, put in the preheated oven and braise, basting regularly, for 45 minutes. Check if it is ready by poking a skewer into the thickest part of the fish. If it comes out piping hot, the fish is ready.</p>
<p class="normala">Lift the <em>chapon</em> on to a warmed platter, cover it with foil and let it rest in a warm place for 15 minutes. Pour the stock into a saucepan, adding a little water to help scrape off any caramelised bits if necessary. Purée the reserved liver with a little of the stock and add it to the <em>rouille</em>.</p>
<p class="normala">Transfer the <em>chapon</em> to a chopping board, remove the string, present it to your guests to get them salivating, and return to the kitchen. First remove the head, scoop out the cheeks, and dip these in a little <em>rouille</em>. They are the best, most tender part, and yours as the spoils for taking so much effort. Bring the stock to the boil and keep hot.</p>
<p class="normala">With a very sharp, fine-bladed knife, cut through the middle of the fish, then across each fillet, which will give you four servings. Put each piece on top of the stuffing on a warmed plate. Whisk the <em>rouille</em> into the hot stock and make sure it doesn’t come back to the boil. Season well and pour over the fish. Serve with plenty of basmati rice.</p>
