</h2>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0003187">The mad midweek meals are the ones that can make me or break me! If I can go a full week and manage the meals without falling apart completely, well, that for me is an achievement. It was very different back before life got hectic. Then, I could leisurely cook my dinner while dipping in and out of ironing, texting, talking to my sister on the phone … oh, and drinking cups and cups of Yorkshire tea. But eating and feeding has changed over the years. These days, things are busy enough without worrying about what we’re going to eat. Mealtimes are no longer just about nurture, they are also about being thrifty, being inventive, being creative, and most of all, cooking something that causes everyone to make yummy sounds and keeps them going till the weekend.</p>
