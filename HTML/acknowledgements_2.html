<p class="flush-left">What a terrific journey this has been, not just for the book but since we started this modest revolution. I would like to thank everyone who has helped me along the way on this crazy mission to spread the word about the food I love the most. It has being tough but I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. With friends like you I can only beg for more …</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Ken Sanker: a huge thank you for believing in me from the start and helping me with every step, I wouldn’t have made it this far without you.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">I am immensely grateful.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Douglas and Mac: you guys are awesome, I feel privileged working with you every day. With a team like us, I’m happy to face whatever comes our way.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">El equipo: gracias a todos por poner toda la carne en el asador y querer compartir con todo el que pasa por nuestras barras nuestra particular forma de hacer las cosas. Gustavo y Eric, sois el alma de esta historia, gracias por el continuo esfuerzo y entendimiento, espero que sigamos juntos mucho tiempo.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Sarah Lavelle: I know my easy, laid-back approach to life disappears when it comes to work – SURPRISE! But I hope it has all been worth it! Thanks for joining the Tapas Revolution and publishing this book. Thanks for your understanding, for bouncing back ideas and your guidance. It has been great!</p>
<p class="flush-left1">The Ebury Team: maybe one too many meetings I know, my fault, it’s my socializing nature you see … Seriously, thank you so much for the team effort, I have felt very supported, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Clare Sayer: Thank you for translating my Spanglish into English. I love the way you made it all sound very much like I normally speak and communicate. It wasn’t an easy one and you literally nailed it.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Emma, Alex and team: thank you for convincing me to keep it simple, keep the essence – I now understand why. You have created a truly great look for this book. Very well done, guys.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Mr Poole: mate, nothing to do with me, I am not saying this because it’s my book, you know how critical I am of myself. I honestly think (and I have done my research) that you have captured the magic of Spanish food better than anyone else in the history of photography. Standing ovation for you! (APPLAUSE). Thank you.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">Nicole and Rachel: thank you for the fine and precise job. These outstanding photos wouldn’t have been possible without your skill. What a great pleasure it has been working together.</p>
<p class="flush-left1">And of course a huge thank you to everyone who, through all the years, has helped me shape my cooking skills, as well as who I am today in one way or another. There is a bit of all you within me, I feel very lucky and I am very proud of it.</p>
