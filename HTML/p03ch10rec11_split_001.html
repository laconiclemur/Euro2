<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">I had eaten pork cooked in milk in Venice, but the idea of caramel seemed strange (there is also a Spanish version of this recipe without it); the beautiful flavor was a delightful surprise. The milk sauce will curdle, but that is how it is. This is good both hot and cold. Serve with sautéed mushrooms.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 boneless pork loin roast (about 2 pounds) or 2 or 3 pork tenderloins</p>
<p class="qun">About 6 cups whole milk, heated</p>
<p class="qun">Peel of 1 lemon or orange, removed in strips with a small knife</p>
<p class="qun">2 cinnamon sticks</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">6 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ cup water</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the butter and oil in a large casserole, and brown the meat on all sides over medium heat. Pour in enough milk to almost cover it. Add the citrus peel, cinnamon sticks, a little salt, and the peppercorns and bring to a boil—watch it, because it can boil over very suddenly. Put the lid on slightly ajar and cook at a bare simmer for 1 to 1½ hours, until the meat is very tender, turning it so that it cooks evenly. The milk will gradually curdle. Remove the meat, and discard the citrus peel and cinnamon sticks.</p>
<p class="summary">To make the caramel, put the sugar and water in a small pan over low heat until the sugar dissolves. As the syrup begins to color, swirl the pan continuously so that it browns evenly, and cook until it turns a deep golden brown and the smell of caramel fills the kitchen. Remove from the heat and pour in a ladleful of the hot milk. Be very careful, as it spits. The caramel will harden. Return the pan to the heat and stir until the caramel has melted and dissolved, adding a little more milk if necessary.</p>
<p class="summary">Pour this milky caramel into the milk sauce, stir well, and cook 10 minutes over low heat to reduce the sauce. It will be a milky brown coagulated mass, which is as it should be, but if you like, blend it to a cream using an immersion blender. Remove the peppercorns before blending.</p>
<p class="summary">Return the meat to the pot and heat through, adding salt if necessary. Cut the meat into slices, and serve with the sauce poured on top.</p>
