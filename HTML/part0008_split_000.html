Lola had no instinct, no natural inclination when it came to cooking. But already, Lola was following her. “Why don’t you sit on the couch and relax with the kids. I’ll make dinner,” she told Lola.

Lola was in charge of the vinaigrette, a simple enough task she had instructed her on several times.
