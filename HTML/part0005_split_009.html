			<p class="rec-intro">Real extravagance in terms of work, ingredients and satisfaction, this recipe dates back to the late 1800s. It is very good to eat and one of my father’s great favourites. The filling can be fish, meat or vegetable, but the batons must be served immediately or the breadcrumb coating may become soggy.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4 as a starter</p>
			<p class="for-the">Filling</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 shallot, peeled and sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 free-range chicken supremes, skin removed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50ml truffle juice (available in cans)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500ml chicken stock (see <a href="part0010_split_002.html#chicken-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bay leaf</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">120ml double cream</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">4 tbsp flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 free-range eggs, beaten</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">400g white breadcrumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1kg clarified butter (see <a href="part0010_split_018.html#butter-sauce" class="calibre4">here</a>) or ghee</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1kg clarified dripping or frying lard</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">First make the filling. Sweat the shallot in a little butter, then add the chicken supremes, season well and add the truffle juice, chicken stock and bay leaf. Simmer gently until the supremes are cooked, turning them after 4 minutes. Take the chicken out and set aside, then reduce the poaching liquid over a high heat. Once it’s become almost a glaze, add the cream and bring to the boil, then pass the sauce through a fine sieve. Dice the chicken and fold it into the cream sauce. </p>
			<p class="body">Check that the rolls of butter are really cold. Cut them in half and roll them in flour, then beaten egg and finally the seasoned breadcrumbs, pressing a little to ensure a good coating. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat the clarified butter and the dripping or lard to 140°C in a deep-fat fryer. Add the coated butter cylinders and fry them for about 7–8 minutes so the interior is as golden as the exterior. Remove them from the fat and leave to drain and cool for a few minutes, then carefully cut the top off each baton and pour out any hot melted butter. </p>
			<p class="body">Stuff the batons with the filling and top each one with some diced truffle before serving. </p>
