  <p class="nonindent">Anyone who is trying to avoid sauces and gravies will certainly have his work cut out for him in Germany. Hardly any fish, meat or vegetable dish comes to the table without this final embellishment, and, as a rule, these sauces are as hearty and substantial as the rest of that country’s fare. As in all Europe, it is considered very bad form (downright sinful, in fact) to leave any sauce on the plate; the wide array of dumplings, potato and noodle dishes and breads are used to absorb every last drop of these velvety concoctions.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cold fish, meats and salads are always accompanied by some version of mayonnaise or a vinaigrette dressing; whipped cream is often folded into the former, sweet or sour cream into the latter. Hot and cold fruit or wine sauces, piquant dressings flavored with capers or caraway, anchovies or herring, sauces made with bacon and others spiked with beer, all are popular throughout the country. The most typically German of all are sweet-and-sour sauces, a tantalizing interplay of contrasting flavors arrived at through the judicious use of sugar, lemon juice, vinegar or the pickling liquid of sweet gherkins. Many sauces included here, such as the basic white and brown, hollandaise, béarnaise, tomato, remoulade, mayonnaise, etc., are, of course, the standard European classics. But since they are always found on German menus, and since many of them are changed in some way to make them more suited to the German palate, this book would be incomplete without them.</p>

  <p class="indent">Most German sauces resemble what we think of as gravies, and are <a id="page329"></a>thickened and enriched with flour, egg yolks and sweet or sour cream. They are usually quite a bit thicker than those we are used to, and I have adjusted the recipes slightly with that in mind. If you find they are still too thick to suit you, increase the amount of liquid called for, or decrease the flour. If you use 1 cup of liquid, 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour, you will have a thin sauce; ½ to 2 tablespoons of each make a medium sauce; 3 tablespoons of each result in a thick sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">A wire whisk is the most practical utensil you can have for making sauces that are smooth and free of lumps. Always use a saucepan large enough to allow room for beating without having the sauce spill over the sides. A 6-cup <em>(1½</em> quarts) saucepan is a good size for making 2 to 3 cups of sauce. Use a heavy-bottom saucepan to prevent scorching, preferably one made of porcelain, enameled cast iron or tin-lined copper. Aluminum or uncoated iron will darken or discolor sauces that have egg yolks, wine or vinegar in them; this is especially true when making white sauces but it is best to abide by this rule for any sauces you might make.</p>

  <p class="indent">Let the flour sauté in the fat for close to 5 minutes so it will not have a raw flavor when added to the sauce. Do this over a very low heat, stirring constantly; remove pan from heat once in a while to prevent burning. Hot sauces generally taste better if a little extra butter is melted into them just before serving. Sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar, wine and horseradish should be stirred into the sauce for the last few minutes of cooking time, and should not be boiled. Add fresh herbs after sauce is finished cooking, just before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">Any of the sauces here that do not have egg yolk in them can be made in advance and reheated before serving. If you make a sauce an hour or two before serving time, you can simply leave it at room temperature. Reheat slowly over a low flame or in the top of a double boiler. If you want to make a sauce the night before you will serve it, store it in the refrigerator and reheat slowly. A reheated sauce may need a little seasoning added, or additional liquid to thin it down. If a sauce is to have egg yolk added to it, and if it must be made in advance, add the egg yolk after it has been reheated, beating it in as described for Variation 2 in the White Sauce recipe.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sweet dessert sauces are not included in this chapter. They can be found in the one that follows.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>MELTED BOTTER (Zerlassene Butter)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This is about the only clear “sauce” I ever came across in Germany, except when an occasional slice of roast meat was served in its own pan juices. Hot melted butter is most often served on fish or vegetables and it may be flavored with minced parsley, chives or other herbs, a dab of prepared mustard or some anchovy paste and a dash of lemon juice.</p>

  <p class="indent">Brown Butter (Braune Butter) is also served very often on steamed or sautéed fish, or with such vegetables as steamed asparagus, cauliflower, spinach and Brussels sprouts. Brown butter slowly over very low heat, or it will burn and blacken. Capers, with or without a dash of lemon juice, are often added.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>THE EINBRENNE</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This is the basis of almost every German sauce and is used also as thickening for soups and vegetable cooking liquids. It is exactly what the French call a roux. Flour and fat (usually butter) are blended together, cooked and then mixed with the liquid that is to be thickened. When butter and flour are sautéed to a very pale yellow, the result is a white or light (weisse or helle) sauce; when it is done to a medium tan color it is a medium brown (mittelfarbene) sauce; when it is browned to a deep cocoa color and brown stock is added, it is a dark (braune or dunkle) sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">The feature that makes this classic roux taste typically German, however, is the use of finely minced onion sautéed with the butter and flour. If it is a light sauce, the onion is added to the hot butter, sautéed until pale yellow and then the flour is sprinkled in. If it is a dark sauce, the onion is usually added when the flour is half brown so it will not <a id="page331"></a>blacken and taste bitter. Though in northern Germany one finds these sauces made without onion fairly often, it is practically unthinkable in Bavaria and in most of southern Germany to make an Einbrenne without it.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>WHITE SAUCE (Helle Sosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion, finely minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups cold milk or white stock, or 1 cup each (depending upon the food to be served with the sauce)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and black or cayenne pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt butter in a 6-cup saucepan. When hot, add minced onion and sauté, very slowly, stirring constantly, until onion is soft and pale yellow. Sprinkle flour into butter, stir and sauté, slowly, about 5 minutes, or until flour begins to take on a pale yellow color. If it seems to fry too rapidly, remove pan from heat for a few seconds. Pour in cold milk or stock, beating sauce with a wire whisk until smooth and well blended. Cover and simmer over low heat 10 minutes. Season to taste before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Onion may be omitted if you think its flavor will spoil the food to be served with the sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. To make an especially rich and luxurious sauce, thicken sauce with egg yolks. Beat 2 yolks into ½ cup cold heavy sweet cream and gradually stir into this about ½ cup of hot white sauce. When blended, turn back into saucepan with rest of sauce. Heat for a few seconds but do not boil. Check seasoning and serve.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. A dash of lemon juice or dry white wine and 1 tablespoon drained capers improve this sauce greatly, and are quite a good touch if it is to be served with a fish, chicken or veal dish.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>MEDIUM BROWN SAUCE (Mitteifarhene Sosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for White Sauce (above), but sauté onion until it begins to take on a light golden-brown color. Add flour and sauté slowly until <a id="page332"></a>it turns cocoa tan. Use white or brown stock, not milk, as the liquid. This sauce is often flavored with 1 tablespoon well-drained capers, white wine, lemon juice and sugar.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_8"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BROWN SAUCE (Dunkle Sosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion, finely minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups cold brown stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt butter in a 6-cup saucepan and in it sauté flour slowly, stirring constantly until it begins to brown. Add finely minced onion, sauté a few seconds until onion begins to brown and flour has become a deeper brown. Stir in cold stock all at once, beating with a wire whisk until smooth and well blended. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Season to taste.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Crushed caraway seeds or 1 minced dill pickle and a dash of vinegar are often added just before serving. If pickle is used, also add a little sugar to taste.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Two or 3 tablespoons sweet cream and/or same amount of burgundy or madeira may be stirred in just before serving.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BROWN SAUCE WITH SUGAR (Dunkle Sosse mit Zucker)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 CUPS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups water, meat or vegetable stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt butter in a 6-cup saucepan and in it sauté flour slowly, stirring constantly until medium brown. Add sugar, sauté and stir until mixture is deep coffee color. Be very careful that sugar does not burn as <a id="page333"></a>this can happen very suddenly. Stir in cold water or stock, beating with a wire whisk until smooth and well blended. Add bay leaf, peppercorns and salt to taste. Cover and simmer slowly 25 to 30 minutes. This is an excellent way to darken sauces made with the cooking liquid of stews and pot-roasted meats such as Sauerbraten.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_10"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CHEESE SAUCE (Käsesosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for White Sauce, using milk as the liquid. Stir in 2 generous tablespoons grated Gruyère or Parmesan cheese and heat (do not boil) a few seconds more. Cheese may be added in same way to a sauce thickened with egg yolks. Add cheese before egg yolks and cream have been stirred into hot sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_11"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>WHITE ONION SAUCE (Helle Zwiebelsosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for White Sauce, using 3 medium-sized onions finely minced. A dash of sugar may be added if necessary and a little extra cream just before serving. If you would like this to be an extra fine sauce, press it through a sieve and reheat before adding final dash of cream.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_12"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BROWN ONION SAUCE (Dunkle Zwiebelsosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for Brown Sauce, using 2 medium-sized onions finely minced. Just before serving, season with salt, sugar and a little vinegar and/or red wine. This can also be made using 3 tablespoons bacon fat instead of butter. It is then flavored with a dash of vinegar and served over boiled potatoes. If a little beer makes up part of cooking liquid, this becomes an excellent sauce for fried Bratwurst.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for Medium Brown Sauce, and when it has simmered 10 minutes, add 1 tablespoon sharp German mustard, a dash of sugar and 1 small dill pickle, finely minced. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes more and finish off with a dash of apple wine and/or cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is especially good with fried herring, as well as with pork or tongue.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_15"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>/HAM OR BACON SAUCE (Schinken-oder Specksosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Add ½ to ¾ cup cooked minced ham, or fried minced bacon to basic White Sauce, and simmer 5 minutes. Minced parsley can also be added just before serving. This is excellent with vegetables, chicken or potatoes.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_16"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>TOMATO CREAM SAUCE (Tomaten-Rahmsosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for White Sauce, and add ¼ pound mushrooms sliced and lightly sautéed in butter about 5 minutes. Simmer 20 minutes. This sauce may then be thickened with the egg-yolk-cream mixture and flavored with a dash of lemon juice after sauce has been removed from heat.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_18"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BROWN MUSHROOM SAUCE (Dunkle Champignonsosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare Brown Sauce, and add to it ¼ pound mushrooms, sliced and lightly sautéed in butter 5 minutes. Simmer 15 minutes and season to taste with salt, a dab of butter and a little madeira.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_19"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>LOBSTER OR CRAB SAUCE (Hummer- oder Krabbensosse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Add 1 cup cooked, diced lobster meat or 1 cup crabmeat, cooked and picked-over, to basic White Sauce, and let it simmer. Season with a little madeira and 1 tablespoon paprika. Proceed to thicken with egg-yolk-cream mixture, if you want to. For a stronger shellfish flavor, the raw, diced crab or lobster meat can be cooked right in sauce, but in that case simmer for 15 minutes, or until shellfish meat is thoroughly cooked. Serve over steamed fish, boiled chicken, cauliflower or asparagus. This sauce can also be made with Crab Butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow recipe for White Sauce, using stock instead of milk. Add 8 anchovy filets, rinsed in cold water and pounded to a paste. Simmer 5 minutes. A dash of cream and lemon juice can be added before serving. This is a wonderful sauce with steamed fish, boiled potatoes or veal. It is also sometimes made with Medium Brown instead of White Sauce. If you prefer this slightly stronger flavor and deeper color, sauté the Einbrenne until flour turns to light cocoa color. Add brown stock, simmer and add anchovy paste. Capers and lemon juice are often added, especially if sauce is to be served over roast veal.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Although mayonnaise is thought to be a very tricky thing to make, it is actually quite easy to do successfully if just a few simple basic rules are remembered. The oil and egg yolk should not be colder than room temperature, and both should be as nearly as possible of the same temperature. Take eggs out of refrigerator, separate yolks and place in a bowl 20 to 30 minutes before using them. If oil is very cold, set bottle in warm water until chill is off. Do not use more oil than egg yolks can absorb—½ to ¾ cup of oil is all you should try to beat into a single egg yolk. Do not add too much oil at once, especially in the beginning. If you want to store mayonnaise in refrigerator, beat in 1 to 2 tablespoons boiling water after it has been made. If mayonnaise should curdle (the egg yolk and oil separate), drop a fresh egg yolk into a warm bowl, beat lightly with a little salt and a drop of vinegar or lemon juice, and then gradually beat in the curdled mayonnaise.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rinse a large porcelain, glass or stainless-steel mixing bowl in hot water and dry thoroughly. Drop egg yolks in, add salt, pepper, mustard and a little lemon juice or vinegar and beat well. Using a bottle or any narrow-necked pourer, or a teaspoon, drop oil very, very slowly into egg mixture, beating with a wire whisk between each addition. Do not <a id="page344"></a>add more oil before the previous addition is absorbed. Add a little lemon juice or vinegar from time to time to keep mixture workable. When dressing has reached consistency of sour cream, add oil in a thin stream, beating as you do, until desired consistency is reached. Continue adding lemon juice or vinegar to taste. Check for seasoning, and if you plan to store mayonnaise, beat in hot water.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The list of flavorings used in mayonnaise in Germany is almost endless. Holsteiner Mayonnaise is mixed with 1 cup slightly sweetened whipped cream and then flavored with a dash of lemon juice and tomato ketchup. Mayonnaise “Alter Schwede,” Old Swede, is mixed with about 4 tablespoons thick applesauce and a teaspoonful grated horseradish, and is then served with cold boiled beef, roast pork or herring filets. Some mayonnaise is spiked with a little orange juice; others are mixed with crushed, drained canned pineapple, and one is mixed with some mashed banana and lemon juice. Mayonnaise flavored with fruits or chopped nuts is served with cold poultry, game dishes or fruit salads, while mayonnaise flavored with a little anchovy paste, some minced chives and capers is a favorite with hard-cooked eggs or cold chicken slices. All amounts given here are meant to be used with the amount of mayonnaise made by following the basic recipe on the preceding page—about ½ cups.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Horseradish is one of the favorite flavorings for hot and cold sauces throughout Germany. It is popular with meats, poultry and fish dishes. Usually fresh horseradish root is used. It must be peeled and grated and as it is very tough, it requires a very sharp steel grater. It can also be grated in an electric blender after it has been peeled and cut into small pieces. As horseradish blackens quickly, it should be cut with a stainless-steel knife and sprinkled with lemon juice or vinegar, or stirred into a sauce as soon as possible after being grated. Grate near an open window, as horseradish is very peppery.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bottled prepared horseradish-vinegar sauce is a substitute for the freshly grated root in some cases. It has been suggested in those recipes where it is usable, but should always be pressed free of excess vinegar. No additional vinegar is needed when the bottled sauce is used, and you may have to use a little extra sugar.</p>

Melt currant jelly over some hot water and mix with citrus peel and juice, cayenne pepper and ginger, wine and mustard. Season with sugar. Beat well and chill thoroughly. Serve with roasted game and ham.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">This sauce is sometimes made thicker and sharper by adding 1 tablespoon freshly grated horseradish. In that case, use dry red wine and only half the amounts of orange and lemon juice. Omit cayenne pepper and ginger.</p>

  <p class="right">¾ <span class="small">TO 1 CUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 hard-cooked egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon prepared sharp mustard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup olive oil or salad oil</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>10 juniper berries, finely crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rub hard-cooked egg yolks through a sieve. Blend with prepared mustard and gradually stir in oil and vinegar alternately, beating well between each addition to keep the sauce smooth. Stir in crushed juniper berries and season with salt and pepper. This sauce has a sharper, richer flavor if it is made 5 to 10 hours before it is to be used. If made a day or two in advance, check seasoning to see if it has become too sharp, in which case beat in a little more oil and another sieved hard-cooked egg yolk.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Although most of the fruit compotes are served as condiment sauces with meat courses in Germany, I have included them in the following chapter on desserts. However, this one is strictly a condiment sauce, and so seems more logical here.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is far and away the most popular fruit sauce in Germany and is almost always served with game, pork, turkey, etc. Preiselbeeren are smaller, darker cousins of our cranberry, and though they can sometimes be found fresh in this country, they are scarce and expensive. <a id="page351"></a>On the other hand, excellent preserved Preiselbeeren compotes, jams and conserves are available in jars and crocks, both in German markets and in gourmet food shops. Swedish lingonberries are an almost exact substitute, if they are easier to get. Use the preserves as they are or mix with a little lemon and/or orange juice. If you like, they can be melted slightly over hot water, seasoned with white wine and/or the fruit juices and rechilled.</p>
