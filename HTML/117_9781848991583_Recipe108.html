<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_182"/><b>Slow-roasted Beef Ribeye Roast</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Carrot</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Horseradish Puree</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>This is a wonderful way of eating beef, and roasting it in a really low oven is an excellent way to get that melting texture. I like to serve this with a carrot puree, but with a really gorgeous twist—a little freshly grated horseradish. Make sure that you use a good blender so the puree is very smooth. Just drizzle a beef or red wine sauce on it and it’s perfection.</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 2½ hours</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¾ pounds beef ribeye roast, trimmed and tied, bone reserved</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 carrot, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 onion, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons dry red wine</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¾ cups Beef Stock (see <a href="008_9781848991583_Recipe2.html">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxta">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CARROT PUREE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2¼ pounds carrots, peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons finely grated horseradish</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 200°F. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and beef and roast 10 to 12 minutes, turning until it is a golden brown on all sides and taking care not to burn it on any side. Put the carrot, onion, garlic, thyme and reserved beef bone in a flameproof roasting pan and put the sealed beef on top. Cover loosely with aluminum foil, then roast 1½ to 2 hours. Check with a meat thermometer that the temperature in the middle of the beef is 131° to 140°F, which will give you medium-rare to medium. If you don’t have a thermometer, insert the tip of a sharp knife into the meat, then carefully touch it on the inside of your wrist; it should be medium hot.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> To prepare the carrot puree, melt half the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the shallot and carrots and cook 10 to 12 minutes until they are just tender and the edges are soft, but not coloring. Add the milk, cream and horseradish and bring to a slow simmer, then cover with plastic wrap tightly so no air escapes, turn the heat down as low as it will go and cook 1½ hours. The carrots will be overcooked and create a delicious confit. Check occasionally and add 2 tablespoons water, if necessary.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Use a slotted spoon to put the carrots into a blender, then blitz to a fine puree, adding half the cooking liquid as you go to make a light, shiny puree. Add the remaining butter and blitz again to incorporate, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Transfer the beef to a large plate, cover with aluminum foil and leave to rest in a warm place. Put the roasting pan over medium heat and stir until the juices start to bubble. Add the red wine and deglaze the pan by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Simmer until there is barely any liquid left. Add the stock and bring to a boil, stirring up any sediment, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 8 to 10 minutes until it reduces by half and is shiny and thicker.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Remove the string from the beef, then cut it into slices. Spoon the sauce over the beef and serve with the carrot puree, putting any spare sauce into a bowl to serve at the table.</p>
