<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003665">This is such a versatile recipe: you can eat it on a Saturday morning on a piece of toast, by itself as a salad (with bread, of course), or alongside grilled fish or meat. It’s particularly good with lamb, especially if you add a couple of anchovies. It will keep for up to 3 days in the fridge if you want to make it in advance. It’s important to use ripe, good-quality vegetables – I find that Spanish or Italian peppers are the best in terms of flavour. My mum always prepares this salad with her hands. It’s key that everything should be very soft, and that you keep all the vegetable juices.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003666">Whenever I roast peppers I keep their skins and juices and add them to olive oil. I heat the oil very gently, then drain it: you’re left with the most amazing smoky, roast-pepper-infused olive oil. Drizzle it on top of meat, fish, eggs – anything and everything.</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003678">Preheat the oven to 180°C. Roast or barbecue all the vegetables and garlic until they are charred and juicy. The tomatoes and peppers will cook the quickest; the onions will take twice as long to become soft and sweet.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003679">When the tomatoes are soft and glazed-looking, chop them, including the skins. Set aside. When the skin of the red peppers has caramelized, remove them to a bowl, cover with cling film, and leave to steam. Peel while still warm, then slice in half, remove the seeds and cut lengthways into 3cm-ish strips. Keep the pepper juice and strain it in a sieve, pressing it through with the back of a spoon or ladle.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003680">When the aubergines are completely soft, cut them in half and remove the flesh with a spoon. Dress with half the olive oil, salt and pepper and chop roughly. When the onion is really blackened, remove the skin and cut into thick strips, similar in size to the peppers.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003681">Squeeze out 3 or 4 of the roast garlic cloves into a bowl. Add the pepper juices and any other veg-cooking juices, along with the remaining olive oil, vinegar and herbs, and whisk together.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003682">In a large bowl, gently fold together the aubergine, tomatoes, onions, red peppers and garlic dressing, then serve.</p>
