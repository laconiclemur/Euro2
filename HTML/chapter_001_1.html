<h2 class="h2-a">Les Jardins de Provence</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">PROVENCE IS ONE</span> huge and beautiful garden. The vegetables and fruit bask in the sunshine and ripen as they should, on their vines or trees. The freshness and abundance of vegetables is proudly displayed in weekly markets and in the many greengrocers which, at least for now, are still found in most village streets. My regular greengrocer, Bruno, has a great little shop in Cogolin with a boat in the middle of it that comes halfway out into the street. I’m not sure why, and for some reason have never asked; maybe it used to be a fishmonger’s. In any case, the care which he and his four staff take with the vegetables and fruit and the beauty of his shop are astonishing.</p>
<p class="normala">On the right as you enter are carefully lined-up aubergines, peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as red, white and yellow onions, garlic in plaits, and loose and huge banana shallots, most of which are larger than the onions. There are many different types of potatoes, and Bruno will be able to tell you what to use each for. The relative merits of Rattes and Grenailles for salad is a matter more for personal choice, but he’ll happily scrape and cut a few in the shop so you can see and feel which have the firmest, yellow-tinted flesh. Big baskets of herbs, rocket and the mixture of tiny salad leaves known as <em>mesclun</em> run down the centre. Alongside these are great bunches of artichokes, their leaves tightly bunched and stalks carefully tied, and often up to five varieties of green beans. On the left there are all of the fruits. Figs – which have two seasons, first in spring and another that coincides with the harvest in September – sit in their paper wrappers like cupcakes, as do any of the more delicate and very ripe stone fruit. There is a big basket of lemons with their leaves still attached, which are knobbled, natural and richly scented. In Provençal folklore the lemon is said to fill you with the sun’s energy. When added to your food it causes a bright, positive force to flow throughout and charge your body and mind. This is possibly why the basket is always half full!</p>
<p class="normala">Whichever vegetable or fruit there is an abundance of spills out on to trestle tables in the street, and is usually snatched up early as the price and quality reflect the height of the season. In July and August the boat, which is very pretty with blue and white stripes, is often full of piles of fat, juicy, bright red local tomatoes. None is perfectly formed but all are perfectly flavoured. There are also little pots of red and yellow cherry tomatoes still attached to their heavily scented vines and bursting with ripeness. For me, the true, sun-filled taste of these tomatoes is a massive part of the beauty of cooking and eating in Provence.</p>
<p class="normala">Wonderfully named <em>pomme d’amour</em> (I prefer this to the more common <em>tomate</em>), the tomato is my favourite of all ingredients. Especially when attached to its vine, rounded, plump and blushing bright red, this vegetable-fruit holds more sway over most Mediterranean cuisines than any other. Nowhere more so than in Provence, where it is involved in most of the famous dishes: it’s added to bouillabaisse, it lifts and enriches a daube, and is a main ingredient in a <em>salade niçoise</em>. But at the height of summer, they are best neither peeled nor seeded, just cored and cut, salted, left for half an hour or so, and eaten with olive oil and basil. It is also the perfect time to make tomato tarts, using a massive quantity of rich, densely coloured fruits which, cooked slowly, dry out and concentrate to a sweet sticky mass.</p>
<p class="normala">The vegetable dishes of Provence are often very simple. The main ingredient is majestically shown off, enhanced by a shower of herbs or a little lemon and olive oil; or by anchovies, salted or cured, and a few olives or tapenade. Much more than just accompaniments, vegetables stand out and sparkle in their own right. I’ll often find myself having gone days without meat or fish because the vegetables on offer were so appealing. In this chapter there are recipes for everyday eating, dishes that are relatively quickly prepared and suit being either starters in a more formal meal, or a light lunch. Most of the dishes, particularly the salads, are perfect as part of a buffet. I love to eat this way: first of all trying a bit of each dish, next going back for a little more of your favourite. Then, relaxing and just grazing, spearing the last slice of aubergine with your fork, scooping up a courgette flower and dunking a bit of bread in the rich tomatoey olive oil that oozes out of the dish, sipping at another glass of wine, and whiling the afternoon or evening away.</p>
<p class="normala">For any such meal, as for any cuisine that concentrates on fresh and honest flavours, the high notes are provided by herbs. As you will notice throughout this book I have my favourites, notably basil, which I would cheerfully put with almost anything if not for the need for a little variety. In Provence herbs, wild and cultivated, fresh and dried, are treasured. Fresh, soft herbs such as basil are sold in enormous bunches or great pots the size of small trees (the thought of them always makes me want to get on a plane when I am buying half a dozen very expensive leaves at my local supermarket in Britain). The scent of herbs at any market-place is often so overpowering that you can follow your nose to piles of peppery basil and fragrant mint. Basil, parsley and mint are the most commonly used; chives are generally passed over for spring onions; chervil is not really robust enough for the Provençal palate but sometimes adds a little anise flavour to <em>mesclun</em> mixtures; and tarragon is generally restricted to Béarnaise. The most vital ingredient in the use of soft herbs is timing. They should always be added at the last possible moment. This way they give a wonderful fresh burst and their flavours are let loose by the contact with heat rather than being dulled and greyed by too much exposure to it.</p>
<p class="normala">Wild thyme, savory and rosemary are found all over the sun-beaten hillsides. They are cut, in bunches, already almost completely dry, and kept at the side of the oven to flavour slow-cooked dishes or to crumble into sauces and breadcrumbs. It is unexpectedly difficult, I have found, to get any of these herbs fresh during the summer. Savory, known in old dialect as <em>pebre d’ase</em> or ‘ass’s pepper’, whether fresh or dried, is the most typical of Provençal herbs. Fresh, it is a perfect partner in spring for small beans and artichokes and is used fresh or dry throughout the year with lamb. I don’t think I’d ever come across it before coming here. But now I add it to dishes with no restraint whatsoever. It will scent any stew or daube that I make, be included in all bouquets garnis, and I’ll crumble it into herb breadcrumbs or infuse it in olive oil to braise or roast red peppers and courgettes. The stalks and fronds of wild fennel are widely used as well, mainly when baking or grilling whole fish, but they also make a good trivet to roast a leg of lamb on.</p>
<p class="normala">In spring and summer I love to make <em>soupe au pistou</em>. The vegetables I use often vary, as they should, depending on what catches my eye. It may be a bunch of carrots with their greens still attached, along with some little turnips and young leeks which have no woody centre and can be used complete, apart from the very tops. I’ll take the best of the beans, young <em>fèves</em> if available, peas, thick string beans which I’ll chop, or runners. I leave out the traditional pasta, and always make it with water. The clear, fresh flavour of the vegetables is only muddied by a chicken or meat stock.</p>
<p class="normala">Whenever I go to Bruno’s shop he greets me with an enthusiasm that he somehow maintains throughout his six-and-a-half-day week. He’ll take me around the shop telling me which fruit is best for the table, cutting off pieces of each with his little pocket knife, perhaps peaches or fat white nectarines, little greengages or figs. I once asked him for some tropical fruit and he was excitement itself, telling me that a box of rhubarb had just arrived. I made a very acceptable tart, but anything from too far away may not always suit the gardens and cuisine of Provence. Both of these are rooted in deep tradition and warm familiarity.</p>
