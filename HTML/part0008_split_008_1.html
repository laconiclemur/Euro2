  <h3 class="h3a">Tagliolini with pheasant</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This is one of my favourite dishes after a morning’s shooting; I love getting together with all the other hunters and tucking into this tasty pasta dish. I often don’t bother to marinate the pheasant, as I like the gamey flavour. As the sauce is <em class="calibre4">in bianco</em> (‘white’, or without tomato) the dish is quite light and shows off the full flavour of the meat. The sauce can be made in advance and reheated thoroughly before adding the pasta.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 pheasant, cleaned, boned and cut into chunks (ask your butcher to do this)</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 sprig of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing1">350ml/12fl oz/1½ cups hot vegetable</p>

  <p class="ing1"><a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">350g/12oz fresh or dried tagliolini pasta</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ onion, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 sprig of rosemary</p>

  <p class="para">Put the chunks of pheasant in a bowl together with all the marinade ingredients, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge overnight.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat from the marinade, carefully remove the skin and discard. Dry the meat with kitchen paper, season with salt and pepper and dust with flour. Discard the marinade.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat half of the olive oil in a frying pan on a medium–high heat, add the pheasant and brown well all over, then add the wine and allow to evaporate.</p>

  <p class="para">In another frying pan, heat the remaining olive oil and sweat the onion, celery, carrot and rosemary until the vegetables have softened. Add the browned meat to the vegetables and mix together. Add the stock, some salt and pepper and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook gently for 50 minutes. Check from time to time and if necessary add more hot stock.</p>

  <p class="para1">When almost ready to serve, cook the tagliolini in lightly salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, reserving a little of the cooking water, and add the pasta to the pheasant sauce, then toss well with a few tablespoons of the cooking water. Serve immediately.</p>
