<h1 class="chapter">sautéed leaves with chilli &amp; garlic</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Simple sautéed green leaves are on every <i>contorni</i> menu in Italian restaurants. They are sometimes eaten as part of antipasti or to go with grilled meats or fish. I could eat a plate of these for breakfast, lunch or dinner, on their own or with a poached egg on top. For how to cook greens, see <a href="9781784881757_Split21.html#page_38">cooking greens</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>fresh red chilli, to taste, roughly sliced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>generous pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) cooked and drained green leaves (see <a href="9781784881757_Split21.html#page_38">cooking greens</a>), such as spinach, chard, curly kale or cavolo nero, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil with the garlic, chilli, salt and pepper in a large frying pan over a low heat for 2–3 minutes until you can smell the flavours in the oil, but watch carefully to make sure they don’t burn. Add the cooked leaves and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Serve in a warm bowl.</p>

<p class="txc1"><b>Note:</b> If you are using baby spinach leaves you can toss them with the oil, garlic and chilli in the pan until softened without cooking them first. Season to taste.</p>
