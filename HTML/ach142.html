<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pollo al rosmarino</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">When my mother decided to eat food that is lower in fat and cholesterol, she created this simple and healthful chicken dish that can be prepared in under thirty minutes. This tasty recipe calls for sautéed chicken breasts flavored with lemon, lime, and rosemary—her favorite herb. Serve with a crisp, dry white wine, a tossed salad, and some warm Italian bread.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter or margarine (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 300° F. Place a serving platter in the oven.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Remove the white tendons from the chicken meat and discard. Remove the tender chicken pieces (the fillets) that are not part of the whole breast, and freeze them for <a class="nounder" href="ach141.html#page_278">Chicken Cutlets</a> or other recipes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Place each piece of chicken between two sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Lightly pound the breasts until they are uniformly about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch thick. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until it is slightly colored, about 2 minutes. Remove the garlic and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Place the chicken breasts in the pan and brown them, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the cooked chicken to the warmed platter in the oven. Drain off any oil in the sauté pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the wine, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan. Add the rosemary and return the garlic to the pan. Cook, stirring <a id="page_281"/>frequently, to flavor the wine, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Return the chicken to the pan, along with any juices that have accumulated on the platter. Add the lemon and lime juices and cook to flavor the chicken, turning frequently, about 1 minute. Transfer the chicken back to the warm platter.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Increase the heat to high and add the butter to the pan. Briskly stir the butter to emulsify the sauce. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately.</p>
