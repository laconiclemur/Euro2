			<p class="rec-intro">I remember an old Brittany saying that goes something like this: ‘When God made sole the devil made skate, and when God made lobster the devil responded with crab’. That’s certainly not my opinion. Although the little velvet crabs that live on the coast and in rock pools have little or no meat to be picked, their flavour is intense and sweet – perfect for this classic soup. You can kill the crabs painlessly by putting them into the freezer for an hour; they just go to sleep. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4kg velvet crabs </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp vegetable oil </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 onions, peeled and sliced </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 pinches of saffron strands </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bouquet garni, made up of thyme, bay leaf, parsley stalks, celery and leek (see <a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes" class="calibre4">here</a>) </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">12 ripe tomatoes, peeled and deseeded </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 potatoes, washed (Charlottes or Rosevals are best) </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g seaweed (dulse or kombu)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 tbsp crème fraiche </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 baguette</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Rinse the crabs in cold water. Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and cook them until soft. Turn up the heat and add the crabs, stirring them around in the pan until they turn red. Using a rolling pin or meat mallet, crush and break up the crabs in the pan.</p>
			<p class="body">Add the saffron, bouquet garni, garlic cloves, half the tomatoes and some seasoning. Pour in enough water to cover everything well and bring it to the boil. Skim any scum off the surface, then simmer the soup for 30 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Remove the pan from the heat and strain the soup through a metal colander into a large bowl, pressing it carefully to extract all the flavourful juices from the crabs. Then pass it through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan.</p>
			<p class="body">Put the potatoes in a pan of water with the seaweed, bring it to the boil and cook until tender. Drain, then peel and dice the potatoes. Cut the remaining tomatoes into small dice.</p>
			<p class="body">Warm the soup through in the pan, then stir in the crème fraiche and check the seasoning. Put some diced potato and tomato in each bowl, then pour in the soup and serve with some thin slices of baguette dried in the oven. Alternatively, serve with fried, garlic-rubbed croutons and cheese but a purist would not approve of such frivolity.</p>
