</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Mediterranean Spain is the Spain of the deep blue sea, luminous sky,</span> and fragrant air. It is dry, with hot summers and mild winters, with occasional bursts of rain. People promenade and meet in open-air cafés. It is the Spain of the <span class="italic">alegría de vivir</span> (joy of living). Gastronomically, it is the colorful sensuous Spain of strong flavors and aromas. The Mediterranean has been my world since I holidayed in Alexandria when I was a child, and it has been my “patch” since I started writing about food. I feel at home here.</p>
<p class="para">The Spanish Levant: Catalonia, Valencia, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands, and Andalusia, too, share a culinary culture with the countries around the Mediterranean, most particularly with southern France, Italy, and Morocco. Catalonia had a major role in creating and spreading that distinctive food culture; for hundreds of years, it was the undisputed “Queen of the Mediterranean” as a great seafaring mercantile nation, and it was the dominant partner in the Catalan-Aragonese kingdom, which had an empire around the Mediterranean Sea. Before Catalonia and Aragon were united by royal marriage in 1137, a count of Barcelona had acquired Provence and part of the Pyrenees through marriage to the heiress of Provence. The Catalans, in the name of the joint Crown, took Valencia and the islands of Majorca and Menorca from the Muslims, and received Sicily through marriage. The Pope granted James II of Aragon sovereignty over Sardinia and Corsica, and the joint Crown went on to acquire Naples, Macedonia, parts of Greece, the North African island of Jerba, and the French Roussillon and Cerdagne. It also established trading posts or consulates in port cities as far away as Alexandria. The old Catalan lands, as they were called, of Valencia and the Balearic Islands, were largely repopulated by Catalans when the Muslims left. This explains why the people there today speak a Catalan language and have many dishes in common. You can see why the <span class="italic">coca</span> is like pizza and the Provençal <span class="italic">pissaladière,</span> why <span class="italic">samfaina</span> is like ratatouille, and why the Spanish tomato sauce is the ubiquitous signature sauce of Mediterranean cooking.</p>
<p class="para">Despite the similarities, every region, province, and village on the long coast and on the islands has its own take on the Mediterranean style. It is a style rich in grains, vegetables, fruit, and nuts as well as fish, and olive oil is the main cooking fat. The Romans planted wheat, olives, and grapevines; the Arabs introduced rice and a large number of vegetables and fruits; and many more fruits and vegetables came from the New World. Mediterranean vegetables include zucchini, eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, broad beans, spinach, asparagus, green beans, artichokes, and pumpkins, among many others. The fish stock in the Mediterranean has been much depleted, but the Spanish coast boasts the most glorious fish and seafood dishes.</p>
<p class="h">CATALONIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Catalan cuisine is the richest, most complex, and most sophisticated of Spain. The fish and seafood dishes are magisterial. Catalonia has a new foie gras industry and more wild mushrooms than anywhere else in Spain. Catalans are known for mixing savory with sweet and sweet with sour, for pairing meat with fruit and seafood with meat. A dish of chicken and lobster is an example of the <span class="italic">mar i muntanya,</span> or “sea and mountain,” style. Raisins and pine nuts are common garnishes. Wine and brandy are much used in cooking, and chocolate appears too.</p>
<p class="para">Catalans describe some of their dishes as <span class="italic">barroco e sabroso</span> (baroque and tasty). Many dishes begin with a <span class="italic">sofregit</span> (<span class="italic">sofrito</span> in Castilian), a sauce of fried onion, garlic, and just a little tomato. <span class="italic">Picada,</span> a garlic, parsley, and almond or hazelnut paste, is often added at the end of cooking to thicken stews. <span class="italic">Romesco</span> (page 143), a nutty sauce made with almonds or hazelnuts, garlic, tomato, and dried sweet red peppers, all blended to a thick cream, accompanies all kinds of dishes. <span class="italic">Alioli,</span> or <span class="italic">allioli</span> in Catalan (page 141), is a garlicky olive oil sauce. A mix of olive oil and pork fat is the traditional cooking fat (goose and duck fat were also used), but now most people have dropped lard, for health reasons and because today’s commercial lard is not as good as the one peasants once lovingly produced for their own use. Catalonia’s fruity extra virgin olive oils, in which Arbequino is the predominant olive, are among the finest of Spain. The <span class="italic">frutado,</span> a fruitier oil made with green olives, has a hint of apple and a slight bitter-almond flavor; the <span class="italic">dulce,</span> made with ripe black olives, is yellow, sweet, and mild. Some of Catalonia’s olive trees are the oldest in Spain. There is one in Tarragona that is said to be more than a thousand years old.</p>
<p class="para">Along the narrow coastal plain and in the wide valley of the river Ebro, the produce and the cooking are Mediterranean, but the Catalan interior is all high mountains with a gastronomic culture of the Pyrenees. Cows and goats are raised for butter and cheese, and intensive pig farming provides a huge variety of <span class="italic">embotits</span> (sausages and salamis). The city of Vic is famous for its fresh <span class="italic">botifarres,</span> salami-type <span class="italic">salchichón,</span> the spiced <span class="italic">longaniza,</span> and <span class="italic">fuet</span> (see page 494).</p>
<p class="para">Catalans have always been hardworking and proud of their industrial and trading activities, which resulted in the growth of a wealthy bourgeoisie that had no counterpart in Castile, where that type of work was never seen as compatible with an artistocratic lifestyle. It was a bourgeoisie that aspired to live well and eat well. In the nineteenth century, the manufacture of cotton cloth from fibers imported from Latin American plantations started an industrial revolution. Other industries included the production of wine and brandy, which were exported to Europe. Spaniards who had grown wealthy in Cuba, the <span class="italic">indianos,</span> came back to start manufacturing businesses, and Andalusian peasants from the south came to work in the mills. Barcelona become the hub of Spain. The Catalan language, which hadn’t been taught in school since the Bourbons, regained its literary nobility, and the glorious imperial Catalan medieval past was celebrated.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p117.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">But Catalan gastronomic traditions were neglected in favor of French haute cuisine. The dispossessed French aristocrats and cooks who had flooded in from the start of the French Revolution profoundly influenced the new Barcelona bourgeoisie, which adopted French ways in the kitchen. Italian immigrants arrived at the same time and opened the first inns. Many French and Italian dishes were Hispanicized: béchamel made with fried onions and tomato paste and Spanish <span class="italic">canelones</span> (cannelloni) are two examples. By the end of the nineteenth century, a large number of exclusive, flamboyant French-style restaurants had opened in cosmopolitan Barcelona. Catalan chefs learned French haute cuisine by working with French chefs and in cooking schools. The wealthy Catalan elite expected its home cooks to make the exquisite and sophisticated French-style dishes that became its <span class="italic">cuisine bourgeoise.</span></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p118.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t until the late twentieth century, after Franco’s crushing of the culture and the growth of industrialized food products, that Catalans began to value their own rural and popular home cooking. The prolific writer and gastronome Manuel Vázquez Montalbán (1939–2003) was one of the first to begin chronicling “the signs of resistance of Catalonia’s gastronomic identity.” If it was a priority to save the language, it was also, he believed, important to save the cuisine. In 1977, he published <span class="italic">L’Art del Menjar a Catalunya</span> (<span class="italic">The Art of Eating in Catalonia</span>). But by 1994, it was clear that <span class="italic">nueva cocina</span> was threatening Catalan cooking traditions. Although proud that the most innovative cuisine in history, which put Spain on the gastronomic map and created demand for its products, came from their own superstar Ferran Adrià, at his restaurant El Bulli in Roses, Catalans also saw it as a tragedy, because young chefs in thrall to Adrià only wanted to make mousses, gelatins, foams, and terrines of everything and to appear on television. As a result, a group of food historians, gastronomes, nutritionists, sociologists, and others got together with chefs to form the Fundació Institut Català de la Cuina (Catalan Culinary Institute) in 1996, dedicated to researching the history and roots of Catalan cooking and to collecting and recording recipes from both professionals and home cooks in every town, village, and fishing port before the recipes disappeared. Over five years, with the help of four hundred chefs and many home cooks, they collected nine hundred recipes and organized them alphabetically in a heavy tome, <span class="italic">Corpus de la Cuina Catalana,</span> intended to be the bible of classic Catalan cooking. They are also encouraging chefs to revisit and update traditional Catalan dishes by making them lighter and simpler. My friend Pepa Aymami (see page 267) has been involved in the project from the start. When I stayed with her in Barcelona, she invited some of her colleagues to lunch. They talked passionately about the food of Catalonia and its history.</p>
<p class="para">Many Catalan dishes go back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when there was a court cuisine and Catalans were rich from trading and from their Mediterranean empire. For centuries, their cooks were the most highly regarded and influential in Europe, and recipe collections written in Catalan are proof that medieval Catalan cuisine achieved widespread fame in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. I had a taste of that medieval cuisine many years ago at the home of the late Rudolf Grewe, who was translating from ancient Catalan a now-famous anonymous Catalan cookbook, <span class="italic">Libre de Sent Sovi,</span> presumed to have been written in the fourteenth century, and researching its background. When Rudolf had come to London earlier and consulted me about medieval Arab cooking, I cooked dishes for him from the thirteenth-century Arabic culinary manual known as <span class="italic">A Baghdad Cookery Book</span> (see page 22). And when I was in New York City, where he lived, he invited me to eat dishes from <span class="italic">Libre de Sent Sovi.</span> A giant crucifix bought from an old church hung on a big white wall over the table. Rudolf made a <span class="italic">sofregit</span> of slowly fried onions with garlic, and an almond sauce, both quintessential cornerstones of Catalan cooking today; baby eggplants stuffed with a herby goat’s cheese; and fried fish <span class="italic">escabeche,</span> followed by chicken with almond sauce. For dessert, we had fresh cheese with rose water and honey.</p>
<p class="para">Another medieval Catalan cookbook, <span class="italic">Libre del Coch,</span> was written by Ruperto de Nola, who was head cook to Alfonso V, count of Barcelona and king of Aragon, who became king of Naples in 1443. Nola also later cooked for Alfonso’s son, King Ferdinand. His sumptuous dishes symbolized the cultural apogee of the old Catalan lands. Some of his recipes claim to be in the style of Genoa, Venice, Lombardy, and France. Some are recognizably Arab in that they mix sweet with sour, savory with sweet, and marry meat with fruits such as pears and quinces. They use ground almonds, rose and orange blossom water, and sour pomegranate juice and are garnished with raisins and pine nuts. Almond pastries and fritters with sprinklings of sugar and cinnamon are among the sweets. There is an early <span class="italic">crema catalana.</span></p>
<p class="para">Many Spanish chefs today cite <span class="italic">Sent Sovi</span> and <span class="italic">Libre del Coch</span> as sources of inspiration. A few have even based menus on them. Chef and food writer Josep Lladonosa, who was for many years head chef at the famous restaurant Set Portes in Barcelona, was one of the first to use these old books and to popularize the old dishes. He told me how well they were received and how quickly they were adopted by other establishments.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p120.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">Catalans are extremely proud of their cheeses and wines. Among their well-known cheeses, Garrotxa is a firm but creamy slightly tangy goat’s-milk cheese covered by a light blue-gray mold; Montcerda is a semi-hard aromatic cow’s-milk cheese; Serrat, a sheep’s-milk cheese, has an intense piquant flavor; and Mato, from cow’s or goat’s milk, which is soft, fresh, and unsalted, is great with honey. A creamy curd called Tupi, made from sheep’s milk, is sold in little clay pots and served as a dessert. In the Basque Country, it is called <span class="italic">mamia;</span> elsewhere it is called <span class="italic">cuajada,</span> which means “curd.”</p>
<p class="para">Catalan wines are among the most varied and exciting in Spain. Priorat’s rich, complex, and full-bodied fruity reds are outstanding. The Penedès region makes wonderful red and white wines and is famous for its cava, made with local grapes by the Champagne method into sweet, semisweet, dry, extra dry, brut, and extra brut sparkling wines. Alella produces good dry and sweet whites, and Conca de Barberà produces rosés. Other good vineyards are Terra Alta, Montsant, Coster de Segre, Empordá, Tarragona, Pla de Bages, and Catalunya. Rum; <span class="italic">anis,</span> an anise-flavored liqueur; and <span class="italic">vin ranci,</span> a type of fortified wine like sherry, are much used in cooking.</p>
<p class="h">VALENCIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Valencia is a land of oranges and rice fields and market gardens that produce vegetables all year round. Roman legionnaires from southern Italy founded the city of Valencia in 137 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> One of the Roman legacies is the outdoor stone ovens that many people have in their gardens today. Some local products, like dried salted fish and vegetable preserves, are said to have been introduced by the Phoenicians, Greeks, or Romans. When James I conquered Valencia from the Muslims in 1238, he made it an autonomous kingdom within the Crown of Aragon and colonized it mainly with Catalans, the reason why the region has many dishes in common with Catalonia. But a large part of the population remained Muslim, of mainly Berber descent. When they were forced to convert to Christianity in the sixteenth century, the nobility protected them because they depended on their labor. Their eventual mass expulsion in 1616 caused a catastrophic economic decline of the region.</p>
<p class="para">Village names in rural areas beginning with <span class="italic">beni</span> (“son of” in Arabic) conjoined with names of Berber tribes are evidence of the spread of North African settlements, which also left a mark on the agriculture. Their systems of irrigation from rivers and springs allow the production of several harvests a year on the coastal plain and in river valleys. Even today a “water court,” the Tribunal de las Aguas, set up by the Muslims to resolve conflicts about water, meets every Thursday in the center of Valencia. The Arabs planted rice in the watery marshlands and lagoons, or <span class="italic">albuferas.</span> You can still see the traditional houses, <span class="italic">barracas,</span> made from wood, reeds, clay, and mud, where the workers slept on the first floor, while the owner and his family lived on the floor above, where the grain was also kept.</p>
<p class="para">Valencia has the widest repertoire of rice dishes in Spain: paella was born here. <span class="italic">Fideuà,</span> essentially a seafood paella with pasta instead of rice, is relatively new. Fish and seafood are cooked on a grill or a griddle and served with <span class="italic">alioli,</span> or simmered in the soups and stews called <span class="italic">cassolas, sucs,</span> and <span class="italic">suquets.</span> There is chicken and rabbit, wild game from the scrublands, and duck from the lagoons and marshlands. Vegetables are roasted or simply boiled and dressed; they are also stuffed or used in omelets. Among the region’s distinctive dishes are the pizza-type <span class="italic">cocas</span> and <span class="italic">empanadas,</span> savory pies. In the countryside and mountain hinterland, meat stews made with lamb (there are no cows), chicken, cured pork and sausages, chickpeas, beans, and vegetables are festive specials. What makes them different from the stews in the rest of Spain are their large meat or chicken dumplings, called <span class="italic">pilotes</span> or <span class="italic">pelotas.</span></p>
<p class="para">The usual dessert is fresh or dried fruit. Apart from the Moorish convent pastries, Valencians make sweets with fruits and vegetables: sweet potatoes, a kind of squash called <span class="italic">cabello de angel</span> (angel’s hair), like spaghetti squash, that falls apart into threads, oranges, and pumpkin. They also have delicious ice creams with almonds (page 518) and with the nougatlike <span class="italic">turrón</span> (page 514).</p>
<p class="para">Every province of Valencia has a special product. Black truffles are found in the Maestrazgo mountains, and the Marina Alta district produces honey. Jijona (or Xixona) is the world capital of <span class="italic">turrón,</span> made with ground almonds and honey. La Vila Joiosa is famous for its chocolate. Other mountain products include the long thin pork sausage <span class="italic">llonganissa, botifarra</span> (blood sausage), a white sausage called <span class="italic">blanquet,</span> peppery chorizos, and the soft paprika-flavored spreadable pork sausage <span class="italic">sobrassada.</span> The region’s cheeses made from goat’s or sheep’s milk or a mix are bland, soft, and fresh. They include Servilleta, Cassoletta, and Blanquet. They are eaten with honey as a dessert.</p>
<p class="para">Valencia’s best-quality wines are Utiel-Requena, Valencia, and Alicante. There are white, red, and rosés, as well as sweet Moscatels; the Alejandría Moscatel is well known. Famous local drinks are the very refreshing milky tiger nut <span class="italic">horchata</span> (page 587), which I adore, and <span class="italic">agua de Valencia</span> (Valencia water), which is cava or other sparkling wine mixed with Cointreau and orange juice (page 585).</p>
<p class="h">MURCIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Murcia is a small mountainous region with fertile river valleys, a coastal plain, and a saltwater lagoon called the Mar Menor (Small Sea). It has the same semi-arid Mediterranean climate as its neighbor Valencia, and the two share an early history of Roman settlement and a long Muslim presence. But the Catalan influence on the cooking is missing, because the Castilians conquered the Muslim kingdom in 1243, before the Catalans and Aragonese got there. The land was divided among military orders and knights from Castile and the north, and as in Valencia, the Muslims stayed on to work the land.</p>
<p class="para">Dishes here are less flamboyant than in Valencia or Catalonia. Murcia is known as the <span class="italic">huerta</span> (vegetable garden) of Spain and has more vegetable dishes than any other region. Vegetables are cooked with rice and are put into omelets, pies, soups and stews, and salads. They are also stuffed. The region is famous for the high quality of its rice, particularly in Calasparra (see page 440). Murcia’s rice dishes, like its game dishes, with rabbit and hare, partridge and quail, are hearty, herby, and full of flavor. Baby lamb and kid are the grand festive dishes. <span class="italic">Caldo con pelotas,</span> a Christmas special, is a stew made of turkey or chicken with meatballs as big as oranges. The Mar Menor yields lobsters and prawns and a rich variety of fish. Fish baked in a salt crust—a Phoenician legacy—is one of the specialties.</p>
<p class="para">Murcia is full of orange and lemon groves, and it also grows melons and watermelons, apricots, plums, and pomegranates. In the almost-desert areas, there are prickly pears. The region has industries of crystallized fruit, fruit preserves, marmalade, jams, and honeys. The goat’s-milk cheeses are soft, bland when fresh; cured, they have a slightly stronger flavor. Murcia al vino is a matured cheese that has been soaked in wine. Three wines—Jumilla, Yecla, and Bullas—that are made with a mix of local grape varieties and French ones are very pleasing.</p>
<p class="h">THE BALEARIC ISLANDS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The undulating hills, rugged coastline, and sandy beaches of the main Balearic Islands—Majorca, Minorca, Ibiza, and Formentera—have been attracting people from all over the world since the mid-nineteenth century. Until tourism expanded, most of the population lived in the interior, away from the sea, in fear of pirate raids. Now it is concentrated along the coast and in the big cities, where the work is.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p123.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">Majorca grew rich on Mediterranean trade. The land was divided among nobles descended from the Catalans who conquered the islands in 1229. Today their mansions in the hills, and Mudéjar (Hispano-Muslim)-style town houses built around patios, have been turned into hotels or have become the holiday retreats of international celebrities. Many of the old peasant houses scattered around the countryside have gone to painters, writers, and hippies. In village squares where women once washed their laundry and pigs were slaughtered, hordes of tourists sit in the cafés. I stayed in Palma de Majorca with my cousin Steve Afif, who is an artist. I can understand why he lives there: it is the good life.</p>
<p class="para">What surprised me is that researchers have recorded no less than six hundred regional dishes in the archipelago of islands. Although the islands are small, they are strategically located and were an important trading center. Settlers and occupiers have been coming for centuries, and the islands have always been open to foreign influences. The gastronomy, like the culture, is primarily Catalan—<span class="italic">cocas, suquets,</span> toasted bread smeared with tomato, <span class="italic">alioli</span>—but the Arab influence is important. You can feel the old Arab presence in the poultry stuffed with almonds and dried fruit just as you do when you see the old waterwheels and mills.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p124.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">The islands are fantastically rich in products of the land and sea. A hundred years ago, the Catalan painter Santiago Rusiñol described the vegetation in these words: “The fruit trees spread themselves. . . . Everything grows, blossoms, and fructifies as if to relieve its heart of some burden, and to bestow homage and gifts on the little houses around.” Apart from the usual wheat, grapes, and olives, there are apricots, peaches, pomegranates, figs, and carobs. Peasant dishes are based on vegetables: eggplant is a favorite. Rabbits, hares, and partridges inhabit the islands, quails stop there on their migrations, and there are sheep, but the most important dishes are fish and seafood. Majorca’s <span class="italic">caldereta de langosta</span> (page 345) is a stupendous lobster stew. Mayonnaise accompanies many dishes, and there are theories that claim it was born in Mahón.</p>
<p class="para">As in Catalonia, olive oil and lard have an important role in cooking and pastry making. Balearic oils are more astringent and bitter than the Catalan. Rusiñol described the oldest olive trees as “twisting themselves into such intricate knots and rolling about in such hysterical convulsions that they could hardly be called trees”; they were, he said, more like epileptics. The main varieties of olives are Empeltre, Arbequina, and Picual.</p>
<p class="para">The English occupied the island of Minorca in 1708, and they stayed for almost eighty years. They brought Friesian cattle over from England, and the fresh Minorcan cow’s-milk cheese <span class="italic">queso de Mahón</span> is used to make a cheese tart called <span class="italic">flaó</span> (page 520). The aged semi-hard variety has a delicious strong, slightly salty flavor. <span class="italic">Flor de sal,</span> sea salt harvested by hand from salt flats along the coast, is a new product of the island.</p>
<p class="para">The foremost Majorcan specialty is <span class="italic">sobrasada,</span> an orange-colored semi-cured pork sausage that is a soft, spreadable paste, flavored with <span class="italic">pimentón</span> and other spices. There is a mild variety and a hot one. The paste is pressed into pigs’ intestines or into large bladders. The traditional meat used is from a special breed of fat black local pigs with long ears called <span class="italic">porc negre</span> (these are not the <span class="italic">ibérico pata negra</span>). The paste is eaten on toasted bread, often with something sweet and fruity such as quince paste or honey, or ripe figs. It is also fried with eggs. For the Majorcan peasantry, <span class="italic">sobrasada</span> was the main, and for some the only, source of meat. The sausages are described in Spanish documents of the seventeenth century, when they were already a major product.</p>
<p class="para">Majorca is also famous for a fabulously light, melt-in-the-mouth yeast-based puff pastry called <span class="italic">ensaimada,</span> made with lard (<span class="italic">saim</span> in the local dialect). Small <span class="italic">ensaimadas</span> are eaten for breakfast and with drinks, and a huge coiled-serpent-like <span class="italic">ensaimada</span> stuffed with custard is eaten as a dessert. I could eat it every day.</p>
<p class="para">In the nineteenth century, the Majorcan aristocracy sent their cooks to France to learn the art of confectionery. They came back with chestnuts in brandy syrup, meringues called <span class="italic">baisers</span> (“kisses” in French), and almond cakes covered with chocolate. The island has the sweetest, tastiest almonds, and tourists arrange visits to coincide with the blossoming of the almond trees because the sight and fragrance are such a wondrous experience. The almonds go into traditional Moorish pastries, and there is an almond cake and an almond ice cream (page 518).</p>
<p class="para">Majorca is the only one of the islands to produce wine. Binissalem and Pla i Llevant are made from native grapes—Manto Negro and Callet for red wines and Moll for whites. Palo de Mallorca is a celebrated digestive made from cinchona bark (a native of the Western Andes of South America), brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The English introduced gin in Minorca, where it is distilled from fermented grape skins and seeds and flavored with juniper berries and aromatic herbs. <span class="italic">Pellofa</span> is gin with a dash of soda and lemon peel; <span class="italic">pomada</span> is a mix of gin and lemonade. Ibiza makes a strong herb liqueur that must be watered down with ice. The islands’ hot <span class="italic">sangrí</span> is a punch with red wine, lemon or orange peel, and a dash of nutmeg; it is served over toasted bread. <span class="italic">Punys</span> is rum or brandy diluted with water, with added sugar and lemon peel.</p>
<p class="h">ANDALUSIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Orange trees line the streets of Andalusia, and the scent of jasmine is in the air. It is the home of bullfighting, flamenco, and Gypsies, and it is where the tapas tradition was born. It was as the imperial Roman province of Baetica that it produced grains, wine, and olive oil for the Roman Empire. But it is the ghosts of Al-Andalus that haunt the land, with its Moorish castles and palaces, its mosques and white-washed villages that the Muslims left behind. Ziryab, a lute player and poet who came from the court of Harun al Rashid (the Abbasid Caliph who was immortalized in <span class="italic">The Thousand and One Nights</span>) in Baghdad in 822 and revolutionized the cooking at the court of Córdoba, would be smiling to find that lamb with honey and fish with raisins and pine nuts are on the menus of fashionable restaurants here, and that the nuns make the greatest variety of Moorish pastries in all of Spain. No other region so captures the allure of the old Muslim presence.</p>
<p class="para">But Andalusia has many faces. Most of the region is wild and mountainous, with huge <span class="italic">sierras</span> (mountain ranges) covered with scrub or chestnut and oak forests. The sierras are pig country, with the ideal conditions for curing pork in the cold, dry winter air. The prestigious cured ham <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> is produced here from the famous black <span class="italic">pata negra</span> pigs, which feed on sweet acorns in the oak forests. Trevélez, in Las Alpujarras in the Sierra Nevada, and the village of Jabugo, in the Sierra de Aracena, are renowned for their exquisite <span class="italic">jamón ibérico.</span> Mountain cheeses are mainly goat cheeses, from the milk of the Málaga breed of goats. Grazalema, from a blend of sheep’s and goat’s milk, is slightly spicy.</p>
<p class="para">Rice grows in the desertlike stretches and in wetlands with freshwater lagoons. Irrigation and a brilliant sun allow areas on the coast and the huge basin of the great Guadalquivir River to produce a fantastic abundance of vegetables. Seville, on the banks of the river, was the gateway and port for goods arriving from the New World in the sixteenth century and so was the first city to receive the new vegetables and fruits. Almond groves dotted around the countryside are important to confectionery and pastry production throughout Spain.</p>
<p class="para">Between the river valley and the mountains, gently rolling hills are covered by seas of wheat and sunflowers, orange and lemon groves, and vineyards. As one drives from Granada toward Jaén, they all eventually give way to olive trees, line after line, as far as the eye can see and however far you travel. Olives and olive oil are the culinary symbols of Andalusia, and the province of Jaén is the greatest producer of olive oil in the world. Its extra virgin oils, made from Picual olives, are fruity and fragrant. Three sensational Andalusian extra virgin oils, mainly from Picual and Hojiblanca olives, are the fruity, mildly bitter, and slightly pungent Priego de Córdoba, the slightly bitter Sierra Mágina, and the intense Sierra de Segura.</p>

<p class="para">With both Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts and an extraordinary variety of fish and seafood from the two waters, it’s not surprising that the cooking of the sea represents some of the region’s greatest dishes. Andalusians are famous for deep-frying fish and seafood, but they also have many other coastal specialties. Among them are sea bream Cádiz-style with sherry (page 332) and fish in onion and saffron sauce from Málaga (page 333).</p>
<p class="para">Andalusia has always been a region of great wealth and extreme poverty. The majority of the population was illiterate until the mid-twentieth century. As the land was gradually reconquered at the end of the fifteenth century, it was shared among warrior nobles from Castile, Galicia, and Asturias and the Church, and divided into large estates called <span class="italic">latifundios.</span> Peasant families from Asturias who came to work on the land brought with them the culture of chestnuts, as well as the culture of the pig, from the north.</p>
<p class="para">Most of today’s big estates date from the nineteenth century, when the land held by the Church and the municipalities was put up for sale. At the same time, landowners began to sell some of their land to the workers who lived on their estates. All the members of peasant families worked and saved up to buy a plot. Generations spent most of their life economizing, and those who emigrated sent money from abroad to help their families.</p>
<p class="para">The landless rural poor lived in small villages and were taken on as day laborers; they would hang around the village square to be picked. They depended on the charity of the Church and the philanthropy of the elite. Peasant revolts and uprisings did not change their conditions. Their mass migration to the cities, to the industrialized north and abroad, began in the nineteenth century. But some have come back to buy their dream bit of land and to plant olive trees. Today tourism provides seasonal work, and it is migrant workers who do the laboring in the fields. The old life of the peasants has only recently disappeared, and their <span class="italic">gazpachos</span> (page 170), <span class="italic">salmorejos</span> (page 172), and <span class="italic">ajo blancos</span> (page 177) have become famous around the world.</p>

<p class="para">Sherry and locally brewed lager beers are the favorite aperitifs of Andalusia. Its sherry, now officially called Jerez-Xerez-Sherry, is one of the most well-known wines of the world. It is made in the area lying between Jerez de la Frontera, Puerto de Santa María, and San Lucar de Barrameda in the province of Cádiz. It is fortified, after fermentation, with grape-distilled brandy. The juice of mainly Palomino grapes is fermented and left to age in oak barrels. What is unique about sherry production is the <span class="italic">solera</span> system, by which wines from different harvests are blended and aged at the same time: rows of barrels are stacked in at least three layers, the ones with the oldest wine at the bottom and the ones with the newest at the top. Wine ready to be bottled is drawn off from the bottom-row barrels, the <span class="italic">solera,</span> which contain the oldest blend. Then each barrel is topped up with wine from the row above.</p>
<p class="para">Several different styles of sherry are produced. For fino, the driest and palest, a natural yeast called <span class="italic">flor</span> is allowed to grow on the surface to protect the wine from oxidation, and this affects the taste. Pale, crisp, and moderately dry manzanilla sherry is also aged with <span class="italic">flor.</span> Oloroso is fortified to a higher strength, in which the <span class="italic">flor</span> cannot survive. Aged oxidatively for a very long time, it becomes a dark-gold rich and mellow wine with a caramel undertone. Amontillado is aged first under a cap of <span class="italic">flor</span> and then exposed to oxygen, which produces an amber wine, lighter than oloroso, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Sweet and medium sherries have added sweet wine from Pedro Ximénez or Moscatel grapes that are dried in the sun. Cooking with sherry characterizes Andalusian dishes. Every kind is used—fino, manzanilla, oloroso, amontillado, and Pedro Ximénez.</p>
<p class="para">Other Andalusian denominations that produce both dry fortified wines and sweet wines are Montilla-Moriles, Málaga–Sierra de Málaga, and El Condado de Huelva. Sweet wines made from Pedro Ximénez (also labeled PX) are often dark-coffee-black, intensely sweet and syrupy, with raisin flavors. Those made from Moscatel grapes are white and have orange blossom aromas. The best are from Málaga.</p>
<p class="para">Andalusia also produces most of Spain’s brandies, which are drunk as digestives and much used in cooking; they are sweeter than French Cognac. An anise-flavored spirit, <span class="italic">aguardiente de anis,</span> that can be sweet or dry is used in pastry making.</p>
<p class="para">A variety of vinegars are made here too. Dark brown sherry vinegar, <span class="italic">vinagre de Jerez,</span> is strong and complex in flavor. There are also sweet vinegars from Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel grapes. A new product, Pedro Ximénez Wine Reduction, is the wine reduced to a dark thick syrup. It is added to vinegar in dressings and drizzled over desserts and ice cream.</p>
