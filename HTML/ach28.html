<p class="author1"><span class="txit">zuppa di patate e cavoli</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a meal typical of ones that my mother’s family would eat on Fridays, when they abstained from eating meat as part of the Catholic tradition. I serve this as a lunch dish or as a vegetable course that comes before the entrée, accompanied by bread, olives, and cheese.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 small head Savoy or green cabbage, trimmed, cored, and quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh or canned plum tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 small potatoes, quartered</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Place the cabbage in a medium-size saucepan. Add the garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour in enough water so three quarters of the cabbage is immersed in water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the potatoes, pushing them down into the water. Cover and continue to simmer until the cabbage and potatoes are just tender, about 25 minutes. Distribute the vegetables and broth among four shallow soup bowls and serve.</p>
