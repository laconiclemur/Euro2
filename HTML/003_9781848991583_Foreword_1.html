<p class="tab" style="font-size:100%;">Daniel’s new cookbook is well named, because we’re in the midst of a cooking revolution, especially here in Britain, where Daniel and I both cook. A few years ago some colleagues and I published a statement describing this revolution under the headings “excellence,” “openness” and “integrity.” Daniel, naturally, has categorized it under “liberté,” “égalité” and “fraternité,” but he identifies many of the same characteristics as typical of modern cuisine: respect for both tradition and innovation; enthusiasm and curiosity about the whole gamut of ingredients; and a determination to pursue excellence, but also to demystify cooking.</p>
<p class="tab" style="padding-top:1em; font-size:100%;">Such sentiments are typical of Daniel. His cooking style is different from mine, but when I first met him I immediately recognized a kindred spirit—warm, energetic and completely caught up in the romance of cooking and the pleasures of the table. So, when he became head chef at Cliveden, which is just a short drive from the Fat Duck, we would meet up regularly for a coffee and a chat about every aspect of cuisine.</p>
<p class="tab" style="padding-top:1em; font-size:100%;">Sadly, the ever-increasing pressures on our time mean we aren’t able to do this any more. But in the pages that follow you’ll get a taste of what it’s like to hang out with Daniel, and experience his brilliant cooking and infectious enthusiasm for anything to do with food.</p>
