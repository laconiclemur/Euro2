 pasta</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">pasta</h2>
<p class="parab1">Pasta is an essential part of all Italian families’ diets and mine was no exception. My mother made fresh eggless pasta at least once a week, usually on a Sunday. The process was a magical and exact performance from beginning to end. First, I would be sent up to the mountains to collect the jars of spring water needed for making the best pasta. I would get into such trouble if I used one of the jars to bring down the newts or frogs I caught up there. Spring water creates the most wonderful, tasty, shiny pasta with the right firm texture.</p>
<p class="parab1">The area around us was so mountainous that it was useless for growing wheat, so my father would bring back great sacks of the best wheat from his travels around the region. Much to my mother’s frustration, he would insist on grinding it himself. The first press was done with a pestle and mortar, then the rough mixture was put between two massive grinding stones, which he turned slowly. When I was good, my father would let me have a go. It was all very primitive but I loved it; I thought it was real man’s work. My mother, on the other hand, hated it. It would drive her crazy. Bits would fly off from the machine and make the most terrible mess, and in any case the resulting flour was too coarse to make good pasta. She went along with it, though, for tradition and to keep my father happy. But when he wasn’t looking, she would send me off to the village mill with a sack of wheat to have it ground to the perfect texture – neither too fine nor too coarse. It was a small, incredibly noisy place. They would take your sack of wheat and grind it for you for virtually no charge.</p>
<p class="parab1">Making pasta was second nature to my mother. She knew instinctively how much water to add, how thick the flour and semolina mixture should be and how it should be kneaded. She was the keeper of the secret of pasta in my family. She always made the pasta in the evening. It was a relaxing family time and we would gather around the big table and chat while she worked away. She used a rolling pin to roll out the dough and she stuck to three different shapes. The one I most liked watching her make was fusilli. <a id="page_28"></a>
 I collected the long, thick canes she needed to shape it (I found these were also good for making kites, although my mother was never too happy when I poached her pasta-making equipment for kite making!). She would roll the dough out into a long sausage shape, then roll this around the stick – it looked such fun to do. She would also make maccheroni and orecchiette using these sticks. On Sundays we had fusilli, but not the short type, a long shape which was handmade. We ate it with a <a href="text00009.html#page_100">ragu</a>
 , which would take about two hours to cook.</p>
<p class="parab1">I love dried pasta as well as fresh, and there are some recipes for which only dried pasta will do. It supplies a good, <em>al dente</em>
 texture that is impossible to achieve with fresh pasta. When buying dried pasta, always choose one from a traditional Italian manufacturer.</p>
<p class="parab1">An unofficial but considerable pasta trade went on between families in my village. Certain individuals became renowned for their pasta-making abilities and their services were always in demand. When my mother was too busy to make her own pasta, rather than go to the shop to buy some I was sent around the village to barter for it. It has to be said that this was a job I enjoyed. One of the families that made great pasta also had a number of very pretty daughters. Needless to say, I was a very willing errand boy to this house.</p>
<p class="parab1">My family used to turn up their noses at commercially made pasta but I was strangely drawn to the village’s pasta factory. I was fascinated by the massive machines and the dusty bags of flour that were scattered around the floor. The pasta made there seemed to taste better than other commercial pasta. I think it was the combination of fresh sea air, sunshine, spring water and the care put into making it. The factory was right on the sea front, with big doors that opened out to overlook the beach. I used to hover in the entrance and watch the teams of men and women at work. Despite the machines, it was still a manual job. The pasta was pushed through the machines by hand and people waited underneath them to catch the pasta as it came out.</p>
<p class="parab1"><a id="page_29"></a>
 After shaping, the pasta was strung across long canes and hung from the ceiling to dry. It was amazing to see so much pasta in one place, all hanging down from the ceiling with people working below. Once it had dried, it was put outside in the sun to harden off. It’s unbelievable now to think that the pasta was put on an area outside the factory that was really just part of the pavement, but people accepted it as part of life then.</p>

 pasta fresca</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">basic pasta dough</h3>
<p class="para1">Making fresh pasta is not as difficult as it may seem. I make it twice a day at the restaurant, in the morning for lunch and in the afternoon for dinner. I am well equipped there with electric pasta machines and large work surfaces, so it is obviously much easier to make large quantities twice a day. At home I still enjoy making pasta and I do it the traditional way, by hand, then use a small Imperia pasta machine to roll it out. I recommend you purchase one of these before making your own pasta, as it will make life much easier. They are not very expensive and are widely available these days – although when I first came to England, I had to bring my own from Italy. A small pasta machine is compact enough for the tiniest of kitchens and easy to store when not in use.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Makes about 300g/11oz</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz Italian ‘00’ pasta flour</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz semolina</p>
<p class="ingre1">2 medium eggs</p>
<p class="para1">Mix the flour and semolina together on a clean work surface or in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and break in the eggs. With a fork or with your hands, gradually mix the flour with the eggs, then knead with your hands for about 5 minutes, until you get a smooth dough; it should be pliable but not sticky. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and leave for about 30 minutes or until you are ready to use.</p>
<p class="para1">Divide the pasta dough into 4 portions and put each one through your pasta machine, starting at the highest setting. As the pasta gets thinner, turn down the settings until you get to number 1 and the dough is almost wafer thin.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the sheet of pasta on a lightly floured work surface and use according to your recipe.</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Eggless fresh pasta</strong>
 This is invaluable for vegans or anyone who cannot eat eggs. Simply substitute 120ml/4fl oz warm (not boiling) water for the eggs and make as above.</p>

 agnolotti ripieni di carne macinata</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">agnolotti filled with meat</h3>
<p class="para1">In Italy this is traditionally made from leftover roast meat mixed with chopped herbs and grated Parmesan. If you want to make meat ravioli but don’t have any leftover roast meat, follow this simple recipe using minced beef and pork. Serve with melted butter and fresh sage leaves, or with a tomato <a href="text00010.html#page_142">sauce of your choice</a>
 .</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 quantity of Basic <a href="text00006.html#page_30">Pasta Dough</a>

<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove, crushed but left whole</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz minced beef</p>

<p class="ingre">4 tbsp white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a small pan, add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add the meat and cook until well browned all over. Then add the thyme and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Raise the heat, pour in the wine and let it bubble until completely evaporated. Remove from the heat, discard the garlic and allow the mixture to cool a little. Place in a food processor with the Parmesan and whiz for about 30 seconds, until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and check the seasoning.</p>
<p class="para1">Divide the pasta dough into quarters and use one portion at a time, keeping the rest wrapped in clingfilm so it doesn’t dry out.</p>
<p class="para1">Roll the pasta out in a pasta machine, or roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface until it is so thin you can almost see through it. Cut it into rounds with a 3cm/1¼in cutter and put a small amount of the filling on each one. Fold each circle in half to make a pasty shape and press the edges with your fingertips to seal. Press the filling down a little with your finger, roll it gently over in half and then fold back the corners <a href="text00006.html#page_32">here</a>

<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil, drop in the agnolotti and cook for about 3 minutes, until <em>al dente</em>
 . Drain and serve with a sauce of your choice.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Alternative meat fillings</strong>
 You could use minced lamb and follow the above recipe, omitting the thyme, or use leftover roast meat with a flavouring, for example, roast lamb and mint, roast duck and chestnuts, or roast beef with thyme. Simply shred the leftover meat and chop it very finely in a food processor. Add the appropriate flavouring, plus some grated Parmesan cheese. Bind the filling ingredients together with an egg.</p>

 conchiglioni ripieni al forno</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">baked pasta shells filled with cheese</h3>
<p class="para1">Baked pasta (<em>pasta al forno</em>
 ) is very common throughout Italy and includes the popular lasagne and cannelloni. In southern Italy there is a baked pasta dish made for special occasions that is based mainly on rigatoni, with a variety of other ingredients including meatballs and boiled eggs. It is very rich, as most baked pasta dishes tend to be, but I would like to share my lighter version of <em>pasta al forno</em>
 , which is simply based on cheese and tomato sauce. Here I have filled large pasta shells with cheese and fresh basil. You could also fill them with leftover <a href="text00006.html#page_34">roast meat</a>
 , as an alternative to agnolotti (this way you don’t have to make the pasta dough).</p>
<p class="para1">If you don’t want the hassle of filling shells, you can make baked pasta with any cooked short dried pasta mixed with tomato sauce and topped with cheese. It is also a good way of using up leftover pasta – again, just mix with a little sauce and cheese and bake.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">16 conchiglioni rigati (large pasta shells)</p>
<p class="ingre">1 quantity of Salsa di <a href="text00010.html#page_142">Pomodoro Leggara</a>
</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">1 ball of mozzarella cheese, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">1 ball of mozzarella cheese, very finely diced</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">16 large fresh basil leaves</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6. Cook the pasta shells in plenty of lightly salted boiling water until <em>al dente</em>
 . Drain well, making sure you empty the shells of water, and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the filling, mash the ricotta with a fork, stir in the diced mozzarella, Parmesan and some salt and pepper to taste and mix well. Shape the mixture into 16 balls, wrap each ball in a basil leaf and place in a cooled pasta shell.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour a layer of the tomato sauce over the bottom of an ovenproof dish and place the filled shells on top. Pour over the remaining tomato sauce, sprinkle over the Parmesan and top with slices of mozzarella. Cover with aluminium foil and bake for 35 minutes. After this time, remove the foil and bake, uncovered, for a further 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>

 ravioli ripieni di ricotta e limone con salsa di burro e menta</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">ravioli filled with ricotta and lemon, served with butter and mint</h3>
<p class="para1">This recipe comes from Minori, my home village, and was given to me by Antonio, the local pasta maker. Lemon and pasta may seem a strange combination but it is actually very good, and dishes like spaghetti and lemon and black pepper are quite common. When I tried this recipe in England, I found that I had to keep adding more lemon zest and juice. The lemons in Italy are much more pungent, so less is needed. When you make the filling, taste it and, if necessary, add more lemon – the zest only, otherwise it might become mushy.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 quantity of Basic <a href="text00006.html#page_30">Pasta Dough</a>
</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">225g/8oz ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp finely grated lemon zest, plus a little extra to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tsp lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">salt</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">30 fresh mint leaves, plus a few sprigs to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tsp lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingre1">4 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="para1">To make the filling, place the ricotta in a bowl and crush it with a fork, then mix in the lemon zest and juice, Parmesan and some salt to taste. With the help of 2 tablespoons, form the mixture into balls about 2cm/¾in in diameter and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Divide the pasta dough into quarters and use one portion at a time, keeping the rest wrapped in clingfilm so it doesn’t dry out. Roll the pasta out in a pasta machine, or roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface into a paper-thin rectangle. Lay the pasta sheet on the work surface with a short edge nearest to you. Put balls of the filling in a line down the pasta sheet about three-quarters of the way in from one side, spacing them about 2.5cm/1in apart. Fold the sheet lengthways in half and press with your fingertips between the balls of filling to seal. Cut round the filling with a ravioli wheel or a sharp knife. Gather up all the trimmings, re-roll and repeat. (It’s important to work quite quickly, so the pasta doesn’t dry out.) When you have finished, repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil, drop in the ravioli and cook for about 3 minutes, until <em>al dente</em>
 .</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the butter in a large frying pan with the mint leaves. Add the lemon juice and cook on a gentle heat until the butter begins to bubble.</p>
<p class="para1">Quickly drain the pasta, reserving a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the frying pan, together with the reserved cooking water to help give the sauce a little more moisture. Mix in the Parmesan and serve immediately, garnishing each portion with some grated lemon zest and a sprig of mint.</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Alternative potato, cheese and mint filling</strong>
 This filling is traditionally used in a Sardinian speciality known as <em>culurzones</em>
 . They are quite a complicated shape but the filling is delicious, and perfect for simple ravioli. As a sauce to accompany this pasta, I would choose either <a href="text00010.html#page_143">Pomodori in Bottiglie</a>
 or simply melted butter and sage topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Mix 2 large boiled and mashed potatoes with 1 egg, 50g/2oz each of provolone, Pecorino and Parmesan cheeses and a handful of finely chopped fresh mint leaves. Use to fill ravioli, following the instructions above.</p>

 spaghetti con fave, pomodorini e caprino</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">spaghetti with broad beans, cherry tomatoes and goat’s cheese</h3>
<p class="para1">This is a light, spring/summer dish that is extremely simple to prepare and looks lovely and colourful. Without meaning to, it has the colours of the Italian flag – green, red and white. For maximum flavour, do use fresh broad beans if possible. However, if they are out of season, you can use frozen broad beans. I use soft Italian caprino cheese, which you can find in good Italian delicatessens. Alternatively, you can use any soft, mild Welsh or French goat’s cheese but avoid strong goat’s cheeses, as they will overpower the delicate flavours of the other ingredients.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>

<p class="ingre">300g/11oz fresh broad beans (shelled weight)</p>
<p class="ingre">300g/11oz cherry tomatoes, quartered and deseeded</p>

<p class="ingre">2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">20 fresh basil leaves, plus a few extra to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre">½ red chilli, finely chopped (optional)</p>

<p class="ingre">100g/4oz mild goat’s cheese, diced</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Blanch the broad beans in a large saucepan of lightly salted boiling water for 1 minute, drain, rinse in cold water and drain again. Slip the skins off the broad beans and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, basil, chilli (if using) and some salt and pepper in a large bowl and mix well. Then stir in the broad beans and leave to marinate while you cook the pasta.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti until <em>al dente</em>

<p class="para1">I used to fish for crabs quite a lot as a child but the crabs found on my shore were very small, so to get a meal out of them you had to catch plenty and spend many hours cleaning them. It was not until I came to England that I discovered the large, meaty crabs on the shores of Cromer in Norfolk. I believe England’s crabs are excellent quality and what better way to enjoy them than with pasta?</p>

 <span class="big">‘</span>
 One of the greatest adventures I ever had was while I was trying to catch a tuna fish. I was 15 years old and had gone out with two friends for a day’s fishing. We set out to sea in a tiny boat with a box of sardines. It was a lazy, sunny day and we were all just taking it easy when, out of the blue, the thick, brown line we had hanging off the side of the boat started to pull. I took hold of it and realised the enormity of the situation. Whatever was on the other end of the line was huge. The three of us tried to pull it in, but it started dragging the boat down. It was terrifying but exciting. We fought with the fish for about three hours, until it was too exhausted to fight any more.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Together, we tried to pull the 95-kilo tuna on to the boat but it was just too big. So we finished it off and dragged it in behind the boat on a hook. I felt sad for this amazing old fish but very proud of myself. I had always wanted to catch a really big fish.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Some fishermen on a motorboat had stopped and made fun of us when we were struggling with the tuna, but I think they were just jealous of our gigantic catch. By the time we got back to shore, word had spread that we had caught an enormous fish and a big crowd had gathered on the beach to witness our return. We were heroes. My mother and father were at the front of the crowd. I jumped on to the beach, my head held high, and my mother stepped forward and gave me a clout round the head, then launched into a public tirade about how stupid I had been. She had been worried sick about me and my father just thought it was funny. Still, it was the biggest fish I’d ever caught and it made me a hero in the village.<span class="big1">’</span>

<p class="para1">Mushrooms and prawns may seem an unusual combination but they are quite delicious together and remind me of my hunting days in the autumn. I would pick mushrooms, go fishing and take it all home where my father would make a similar pasta dish to this one. The base sauce can be prepared a day or two in advance and kept in the fridge. Don’t be alarmed about using the prawn heads and shells – this is what gives the sauce so much flavour.</p>

Add the mushrooms and parsley and stir-fry for a minute. Then add the strips of prawn, season and stir-fry for another minute. Add the wine and simmer until it has reduced by half, then add the base sauce and simmer for a couple of minutes. Drain the pasta and add to the sauce, still on the heat. Stir well and cook for about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, stir in the saffron and serve immediately.</p>

 trofie con pesto, fagiolini e patate</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">trofie with pesto, green beans and potatoes</h3>
<p class="para1">I came across this dish when I was in Liguria a few years ago. Trofie pasta is made with durum wheat flour and water (no eggs are used), then shaped by hand into small spirals that have pointy ends and are thicker in the middle. This type of pasta takes longer to cook than most; check the instructions on the packet but you will find it usually takes 15–20 minutes. The thicker middle bit always remains <em>al dente</em>
 .</p>
<p class="para1">Pesto also comes from Liguria, where delicate olive oil is produced and lovely sweet basil grows in abundance. You can find ready-made pesto everywhere these days but it really is worth making your own. You could use a food processor but when the sauce is made by hand with a pestle and mortar it is slightly crunchier, and you can taste all the ingredients much more. Fresh pesto keeps in the fridge for about a week.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">350g/12½oz trofie</p>
<p class="ingre">4 small new potatoes, scrubbed and cut into quarters</p>
<p class="ingre">20 green beans, trimmed and cut in half</p>
<p class="ingre">freshly grated Parmesan cheese, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the pesto:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz fresh basil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove</p>
<p class="ingre">½ tsp coarse sea salt</p>
<p class="ingre">100 ml/3½fl oz/7 tbsp olive oil (Ligurian, if you can get it)</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for sprinkling</p>
<p class="ingre1">30g/1oz freshly grated Pecorino cheese</p>
<p class="para1">First make the pesto. Remove and discard the stalks from the basil and set the leaves aside. Place the pine nuts, garlic and salt in a mortar and grind to a paste with a pestle. Add a few basil leaves and some of the olive oil and grind and stir with the pestle. Continue like this until you have used up all the basil leaves and about half the olive oil – the sauce should become silky in consistency. Then add the remaining oil and the cheeses and mix well together.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and add the pasta, potatoes and green beans. Cook until the pasta is <em>al dente</em>
 and the vegetables are tender. In a large bowl, combine the pesto, drained vegetables and trofie and a couple of tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Serve immediately with some grated Parmesan, if desired.</p>

 tagliatelle con tonno, limone e rucola</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">tagliatelle with tuna, lemon and rocket</h3>
<p class="para1">This needs hardly any cooking and tastes delicious. When I was growing up in Italy, we didn’t have tinned tuna but in late spring/early summer my mother would buy fresh tuna from local fishermen and preserve it in oil, so we could have it all year round. Tinned tuna in extra-virgin olive oil has the best flavour; don’t buy it in brine or spring water.</p>
<p class="para">

</p>
<p class="ingre">350g/12½oz tagliatelle</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">½ red chilli, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">2 x 160g/6oz tins of tuna in extra virgin olive oil, drained and lightly mashed with a fork</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of rocket, plus a little extra to serve</p>
<p class="ingre">grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta until <em>al dente</em>

<p class="para1">Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic and chilli and sweat for 1 minute. Drain the pasta, add to the pan along with the tuna and half of the rocket and toss together well.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the heat, stir in the lemon zest and juice. Serve immediately with the remaining rocket scattered over the top.</p>

 tagliolini al tartufo nero</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">tagliolini with black truffle</h3>
<p class="para1">A truffle is a fungus, found underneath the ground, which can be detected only by specially trained dogs. There are three types of truffle in Italy: the very expensive white truffle from the Alba region in Piedmont (<em>Tuber magnatum</em>
 ), the black winter truffle from Umbria (<em>Tuber melanosporum</em>
 ), and the black summer truffle (<em>Tuber aestivum</em>
 ), again mainly from Umbria. They are quite ugly to look at and resemble small potatoes, with a hard, black skin. For a special occasion, do splash out on a small fresh truffle and try this recipe.</p>
<p class="para1">I dedicate this recipe to my eldest son Michael, who appreciated the subtle but sophisticated taste of this fungus from an early age.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">400g/14oz fresh or dried tagliolini (or tagliatelle)</p>
<p class="ingre">400ml/14fl oz vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">40g/1½oz black truffle, shaved on a small mandoline or with a very sharp knife</p>
<p class="ingre">40g/1½oz/3 tbsp butter</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tsp truffle oil</p>
<p class="ingre1">grated Parmesan cheese to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the pasta until almost <em>al dente</em>
 .</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, put the stock in a large frying pan with a few shavings of truffle and bring to a gentle simmer, just to infuse the stock with the truffle. Drain the pasta and add to the stock. Turn up the heat and continue to cook the pasta for 1 minute, until about three-quarters of the stock has evaporated. Stir in the butter and truffle oil and mix in about half the truffle shavings. Remove from the heat and serve immediately, with the remaining truffle shavings on top. Serve with freshly grated Parmesan, if desired.</p>

 pennette con fiori di zucchina</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">pennette with courgette flowers</h3>
<p class="para1">I find courgette flowers a real treat. When I first came to England, I discovered that the flowers were destroyed here so the courgettes would grow bigger. I was distraught! I remember asking an old neighbour if he wouldn’t mind giving me the flowers from his courgette plants. He looked at me suspiciously and I told him they were to decorate the kitchen. I think he would have thought I was mad if he knew I ate them. Fortunately, you can now find courgette flowers during the early summer in some good greengrocer’s, or you could grow your own courgettes. Picking the flowers regularly will help the plants to grow. <em>Pictured on <a href="text00006.html#page_48">here</a>
