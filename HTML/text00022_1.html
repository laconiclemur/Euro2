 CHERRY, ALMOND &amp; NUTMEG TARTS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0002509">
<em>Pop Tarts: we’ve surely all heard of them, and I imagine most people have probably tried one too. Or do I only speak for myself when I say that Pop Tart curiosity once got the better of me and as a teenager I felt I just had to taste this American breakfast phenomenon? It was quite something watching it pop out of the toaster like the biscuit equivalent of a 5-year-old on sugar. But it became an entirely different tale when my eagerness led to a very burnt mouth. This recipe is my more grown-up interpretation. The tarts are sweet, easy to make and have a hint of spice. But like my encounter with their 1999 counterpart, these too can scald an unsuspecting mouth if served hot. So please eat with caution.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Dust the surface of the worktop with plenty of icing sugar and roll out the pastry to a 30 x 35cm rectangle. Place it on a piece of baking paper and then on a tray. (This will help you move the pastry in and out of the fridge.)</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002523">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Cut right down the middle of the pastry lengthways, giving you two long equal rectangles. Now make three cuts across widthways to give you eight equal rectangles. Place in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002524">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Put the jam in a bowl, add the ground nutmeg and mix.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002525">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Have a baking tray lined with baking paper ready. To each rectangle of pastry, add 1 teaspoon of jam on one side, making sure to avoid the edges. (Don’t be tempted to add extra jam – I once learned this the hard way!)</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002526">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Brush the edges with the eggwash and fold over the other half of the pastry. With the tip of a dinner knife, press down to seal the edges. This is crucial unless you enjoy flowing molten lava jam.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002527">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Do the same with the remaining seven pastries. Brush the tops with the eggwash and place in the fridge for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002528">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002529">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Take the pastries out of the fridge and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 20–25 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002530">
<span class="red">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 To make the icing, put the icing sugar, water and almond extract into a bowl and mix to a smooth paste. Cover the tops of the pastries with icing and sprinkle with crushed toasted almonds.</p>

<span class="tip_head_red">Tip:</span>
 <em>If you want to eat these warm, I don’t recommend using the toaster, but you can quickly zap them in the microwave.</em>
