<h5 class="center1">Alex</h5>
<p class="centera">To Jess with all my love for all your love and support.</p>
<p class="centera">Special thanks to Pete and Di for their great friendship, for being the most wonderful photographer and stylist to work with and, not least, for putting up with me every summer.</p>
<p class="centera">Thanks to Delia for her lovely foreword and very generous encouragement.</p>
<p class="centera">Thanks to my editor Susan Fleming; Mum; Raymond Blanc for the huge part he’s played in my career; my former assistants at Le Baou, Mary O’Hare and Florence.</p>
<p class="centera">Heartfelt thanks to Fiona MacIntyre, Carey Smith and Imogen Fortes at Ebury Press for bringing this book back to life. Also to Tony at Estuary English for the new design.</p>
<p class="centera">Thanks to my old suppliers Jacky, Doume and Bruno for their glorious produce.</p>
<p class="centera">Lastly, thanks to all of our guests and friends who made the five years of Le Baou so special and who have tried, tested and tasted all of these recipes with bubbling enthusiasm and barrels of laughter while living and cooking in Provence.</p>
<h5 class="center1">Peter</h5>
<p class="centera">This is the easy part: saying thank you to everyone who helped in making this book a reality. Easier still is saying a special thank you to Diana who has made this corner of Provence so special.</p>
<p class="centera">The hard part is having to cope with all those endless days of glorious sunshine.</p>
<p class="centera">Harder still is having to eat all the wonderful meals Alex is able to invent with such evident skill and <em>laissez-faire</em>.</p>
