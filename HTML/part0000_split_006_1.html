   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">1.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Short and sweet conversations</span><span class="calibre46">.</span><span class="calibre9"> Each week’s lesson is bite size French concept that you can review during a five minute conversation. Resist the impulse to drill, if your child forgot a word, just provide it for them. The repetition of language will help their vocabulary grow. Great places for bite-sized conversations are:</span></p> 
   <ul type="square" class="calibre29"> 
    <ul type="square" class="calibre47"> 
     <ul type="square" class="calibre48"> 
      <li class="calibre49"><span class="calibre9">In the car…all parents spend plenty of time in the car! Use this time to squeeze in some language learning.</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre49"><span class="calibre9">At mealtimes…many of the lessons in this book are perfect to review before breakfast, lunch or dinner…or snack at the pool…or a snack in the mall…..</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre49"><span class="calibre9">Bedtimes…start with “Je t’aime”</span><span class="calibre9">” and move on from there!</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre50"><span class="calibre9">“Downtime”…Waiting in the pediatrician’s examination room, waiting for yo</span><span class="calibre9">ur food to be delivered at Chili’s, anytime or place you need to kill five minutes, use it to review French!</span></li> 
     </ul> 
    </ul> 
   </ul> 
   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">2.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Put on the radio.</span><span class="calibre51"> </span><span class="calibre9"> By putting on French language CD or podcast in the car or kitchen while you make dinner, you acclimate your ear, and your children’s if they are listening, to the rhythm and cadence of French speech. You are hearing native or fluent speakers provide an accent model as well.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">3.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Find a French language children’s TV show.</span><span class="calibre9"> Children’s television shows are not terribly complicated in terms of character and plot, and you can derive meaning just by watching. Many local cable companies offer a French channel for an additional (modest) charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">4.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Read a bilingual storybook.</span><span class="calibre51"> </span><span class="calibre9">In the Resources section of this book, I list websites that can help you locate children’s picture books in both English and French. The plots are simple so you can get a lot of meaning from the picture clues. Also, reading aloud to your children helps you work on your accent. </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">5.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Say hello!</span><span class="calibre9"> One of the hardest parts of learning a new language is overcoming our own embarrassment and communicating with native speakers. If you can get over this hurdle you will have conquered a challenge that turns many people away from learning a second language. In certain areas of the world, it may be easy to meet French speaking people. In others, it is difficult to find anyone who speaks French at all. Utilize the internet to locate groups of fellow Francophiles.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">6.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Make friends.</span><span class="calibre51"> </span><span class="calibre9">One of the benefits of being learning about a new culture and language is meeting new friends. Whether you meet a local mother who hails from Paris or you need to utilize the internet to find language partners, you will surely enrich your life with the new and interesting people you will meet.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre43"><span class="calibre44">7.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Start a playgroup.</span><span class="calibre9"> If you are a take charge kind of person, start your own playgroup! No matter where in the world you live, you can guarantee there are other parents interested in teaching their children French. Internet sites like Meetup.com are great tools for creating playgroups.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre52"><span class="calibre44">8.</span><span class="calibre45">      </span><span class="calibre38">Play.</span><span class="calibre9"> Have fun with French. The Resources section lists lots of fun games, books and CD’s to support your learning. In addition, try playing the following vocabulary review games with your kids:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre53"><span class="calibre9"> </span></p> 
   <ul type="square" class="calibre29"> 
    <ul type="square" class="calibre47"> 
     <ul type="square" class="calibre48"> 
      <li class="calibre54"><span class="calibre55">Où est-ce?</span><span class="calibre9">  Ask your children where different items in the room are. They recognize the vocabulary word and point to the item.</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre54"><span class="calibre55">Chaud ou froid</span><span class="calibre55">?</span><span class="calibre9">  This is your basic game of hot or cold except instead of hiding an object in the room, you </span><span class="calibre25">think</span><span class="calibre9"> of an item in the room. You then direct your children toward it with cues of </span><span class="calibre25">chaud ou froid.</span><span class="calibre9"> The child who figures out which item you were thinking of ( lamp, television, etc.) must call out the name of the item in French.</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre54"><span class="calibre55">Maman (Papa) dit, “</span><span class="calibre55">Touche ton/ta/tes..” </span><span class="calibre9">Here is a version of Simon says. Mommy (or Daddy) says to touch different body parts, items in the room, items of clothing etc. Children must understand the vocabulary they are hearing in order to act accordingly. They are out if they touch something and Mama didn’t say!</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre54"><span class="calibre55">Vingt questions</span><span class="calibre55">. </span><span class="calibre9">Children are given the opportunity to ask twenty questions to figure out the item you are thinking of. They can ask questions about it in English (or French as their knowledge increases) but they have to guess what it is in French.</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre54"><span class="calibre55">Je vois quelque chose…</span><span class="calibre55"> </span><span class="calibre9">Play this game the same way you would play </span><span class="calibre25">I Spy</span><span class="calibre9">. As your vocabulary increases you can use more and more French describing words to help your children puzzle out what you see.</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre54"><span class="calibre55">Puppets.</span><span class="calibre51"> </span><span class="calibre9">Puppets are an invaluable tool for teaching language. Buy or make a hand puppet, name your puppet (Try French names to go with your theme!), and make the puppet your French teacher’s helper. Anytime you want to review dialog, take out your puppet and talk away. Older children can help put on the puppet show for younger children.</span></li> 
      <li class="calibre56"><span class="calibre55">Beanbag Toss</span><span class="calibre9">. This is simply another way to review vocabulary. Get a beanbag (or soft, small ball, or stuffed animal, anything that won’t go through a window or cause a concussion). The first person says a word or phrase in French and tosses the beanbag to the next person who then has to give the translation. If they don’t get the correct answer, they are out. If they do get the correct answer, they come up with another French phrase and toss the beanbag to the next person. You can reverse this activity and say the words or phrases in English and have the children provide the French translation. That is always a little harder!</span></li>
