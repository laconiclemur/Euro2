			<p class="rec-intro">We love making terrines at the restaurant and we’ve been serving this one since the early nineties. Full of rich flavours, it never disappoints and it’s perfectly possible to make at home too. All the ingredients are readily available and it is really impressive. You’ll need a terrine dish measuring about 25 x 8cm or you could use a loaf tin. I like to use black trompettes for their colour, but any good wild mushrooms will do. This terrine keeps well in the fridge for about a week.</p>

			<p class="serves">serves 12</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 savoy cabbage </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 boneless, free-range chicken supremes, skinned</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp duck fat </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml port </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">5 gelatine leaves </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">24 sage leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300g wild mushrooms, wiped or washed and any grit removed </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 smoked duck breasts</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper </p>

			<p class="body">Separate the cabbage leaves, discarding the toughest and any that are damaged. Trim out the stalks and wash the leaves well. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the leaves and cook until tender. Drain, then refresh the leaves in iced water to stop them cooking and drain again. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="body">Season the chicken. Heat a tablespoon of the duck fat in a frying pan and sear the chicken on both sides. Add the port, cover the chicken with a piece of greaseproof paper and simmer gently until cooked. Remove the chicken and set aside, keeping the liquid. Soak the gelatine leaves in a dish of cold water to soften. Remove, squeeze out the excess water and add the softened gelatine to the pan with the port. Stir until it has dissolved, then set aside. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat another tablespoon of duck fat in a large pan and add the cabbage leaves. Season with salt and pepper, add the sage and cook the cabbage until soft. Pour in the port and gelatine mixture.</p>
			<p class="body">Melt the remaining tablespoon of duck fat in a frying pan and sauté the mushrooms until tender. Season and set aside. Remove the skin from the smoked duck breasts and cut them into fine strips. </p>
			<p class="body">Line the terrine dish with cling film and place a layer of port-soaked cabbage in the bottom. Now add a layer of mushrooms, more cabbage, then chicken, mushrooms, duck, cabbage and mushrooms. Finish with a layer of cabbage leaves. Wrap the cling film tightly over the top and add a weight on top to press the terrine down. Place the dish in the fridge overnight to set. The next day, use the cling film to help you lift the terrine carefully out of the dish. Slice and eat with toast or garnish beautifully and serve with truffle dressing (see <a href="part0007_split_018.html#Endive--apple-and-truffle-salad">here</a>) or herb mayonnaise (see <a href="part0010_split_020.html#Herb-mayonnaise">here</a>).</p>
