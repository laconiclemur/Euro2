<h1 class="chapter1"><a id="page_119"/>CROSTINI CON PATÈ DI FEGATINI DI POLLO</h1>
<h1 class="chapter">toasted bread topped with chicken liver pâté</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>When our good friend Giancarlo Barbafieri’s cook, Daniela, kills a chicken they keep the liver in the freezer. When she has collected enough chicken livers she makes this pâté. This <i>crostini con patè</i> is made differently all over Tuscany. In my husband Giancarlo’s area, the crostini are called <i>crostini neri</i>, meaning ‘little black toasts’, and Vin Santo is added instead of white wine for a sweet touch. Some people add anchovies and leave out the salt; others hand chop the livers with the capers for a coarse finish (you can pulse them in a food processor if you wish). Daniela showed me a trick to soften the bread a little: she dipped each crostini in stock before topping it with pâté. A little fresh sage on top was a lovely addition by our son, Giorgio.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES 10–15 CROSTINI</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small red onion, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>8 sage leaves, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>300 g (10½ oz) chicken livers</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) white wine or Vin Santo</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) capers in salt, well rinsed</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 country-style loaf</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>approx 2–3 tablespoons room-temperature <a href="9781784881757_Split15.html#page_32">Chicken Stock</a> to dip the bread in</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of freshly chopped sage (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil in a medium non-stick frying pan over a low heat. Add the onion and roughly chopped sage. Cook for around 10 minutes or until the onion is soft. Meanwhile, prepare the chicken livers by removing the tough connective tissue. Add the livers and seasoning and stir until they are browned all over. Pour in the wine or Vin Santo and continue to cook for 15–20 minutes until the liquid has reduced by half and the livers are cooked through.</p>
<p class="tx">Put the mixture into a food processor with the capers and blend to a rough or smooth consistency, depending on how you like it. Taste and season again as necessary.</p>
<p class="tx">To serve, make the crostini: preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Cut the bread into 1.5 cm- (½ in-) thick slices and lay them on a baking tray. Bake in the oven for around 5 minutes until lightly golden brown and crisp. Cut the bread into canape-sized pieces and dip one side of each piece briefly into a saucer of stock, then top with the pâté. (The bread shouldn’t become soggy – the stock just softens it a little as often slightly stale bread is used.) Scatter over the finely chopped sage (if using) and serve straight away.</p>
