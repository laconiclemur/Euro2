ou can’t fail to be impressed by the huge mounds of vegetables in a Spanish market. The climate is perfect for growing peppers, tomatoes and aubergines – that sunshine trio associated with summer days and long Mediterranean lunches. The hothouse varieties can never begin to compare with the flavour of naturally ripened produce. And yet, many tourists are at a loss as to where all those glorious fresh vegetables end up; not in the <em>tapas</em>
 bars or restaurants it would seem.</p>
<p class="indent">Vegetables are relatively cheap, usually simple to prepare and play a background role in the professional kitchen. Who would go out and pay for a chef to grill a few peppers when you could prepare them just as well at home? Yet a vegetable <em>sofrito</em>
 of onions, tomato and garlic is the starting point of many of the popular fish and meat stews enjoyed in restaurants all over the country. The fact is that vegetables are not seen as accompaniments, the notion of “meat and two veg” is just non-existent. They are used in sauces or served as a dish apart, often pepped up with a touch of cured pork. Of course there are a few aristocrats on the vegetable patch that break all the rules, commanding high prices and being savoured as a delicacies in their own right. Amongst these are the <em>Piquillo</em>
 pepper of Lodosa, the artichoke from Tudela and, perhaps the most eagerly awaited, Vall’s delectable <em>calçot</em>
 that resembles an oversized spring onion. Back at home vegetables are an everyday staple. Many meals begin with a salad, soup, or plate of simple boiled or grilled vegetables.</p>
<p class="indent">Climate and terrain vary massively across the country and consequently, so does the produce on offer. Turnip tops, cabbages, chard and potatoes are not the first vegetables that spring to mind at the mention of Spain. Yet in damp Galicia these are the mainstays of all the traditional soups and stews. Head east to the sun-drenched Ebro Valley of Rioja and Navarre and you find artichokes, cardoons, asparagus and peppers. Here cultivation is only possible with the vast scale of irrigation, much of it dating back to the time of the Moors. The Basques and the Catalans are wild mushroom fanatics, and collectors will often turn up at local markets with a basket of woodland jewels. If you are an enthusiast too then you should look up Petràs at his stall in the depths of Barcelona’s Boqueria with an extraordinary range of mushrooms both fresh and dried. Valencia is known for its oranges and rice but a surprising discovery is the local infatuation with green beans. Entire stalls are devoted to countless varieties of French beans, broad beans, butter beans and peas. Ladies are industriously podding between customers so that the lazier ones among us can buy beans by the bag, ready for the pot or <em>paella</em>
. Meanwhile, down south, long summers see avocados sitting alongside autumnal pumpkins and sweet potatoes.</p>
<p class="indent">Fresh, ripe vegetables straight from the <em>huerta</em>
, vegetable plot, are always the best. Tomatoes, fully ripened on the vine, that have never seen a refrigerator or a glut of courgettes, brought straight to market. There is often a huddle of small-scale producers with their baskets and buckets of home-grown potatoes, garlic, peppers, or whatever the season brings. In springtime Gerona there are bunches of the spindly wild asparagus collected from hedgerows while strings of deep red onions are the highlight at an October market in Potes. These are the surprises that give markets their magic. Menus miraculously evolve as you become increasingly laden with all the unexpected treats that weren’t on the shopping list.</p>

alcachofas en escabeche</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">artichokes with wine and vinegar</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This edible thistle flower is yet another crop that was popularized by the Moors. Today the tender, oval Blanca de Tudela is the most highly esteemed variety but the larger, spherical Alcachofa de Valencia has a wonderful flavour too. Artichokes are available from October through to late spring, becoming more economical as the season progresses, worth keeping in mind when you consider that only about a quarter of their weight is edible.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4 as a starter</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 kg/2¼ lb artichokes</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 lemons, 1 halved and 1 juiced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½ fl oz white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bay leaf</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 sprig of fresh thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>10 whole black peppercorns</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Prepare the artichokes (see right), cutting them in half or quarters depending on their size, and place in a bowl of acidulated water.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic and fry over a medium heat until just golden. Do not burn it or the entire dish will be bitter. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon, every last slither, and set aside in a large saucepan.</p>
<p class="extract">Next remove the artichokes from the acidulated water a few at a time, dry off with some kitchen paper and fry in the garlic infused oil. Do not crowd the pan or they will not caramelize. Once beautifully browned, place the artichokes with the garlic.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the flour to the frying pan and stir over the heat for a couple of minutes. Pour in the wine, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming. You may need to add a little water too if the mixture becomes too thick.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the wine sauce over the artichokes together with the bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, a pinch of salt and enough water to cover them and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the sherry vinegar and simmer for a further 5–10 minutes, or until the artichokes are meltingly tender. If the sauce seems extremely thin you may like to remove the artichokes and reduce it over a high heat for a moment or two.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve hot or at room temperature.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Toasted pine kernels or fried strips of <em>jamón Serrano</em>
 would make a delicious garnish.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying artichokes</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">The Spanish pick their artichokes deliciously young and tender. The size will depend on the variety but look for tightly closed, shiny leaves.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>To prepare artichoke halves or quarters</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Half-fill a large pan with water and add the juice of 1 lemon, you will need to submerge the cleaned artichokes as you prepare them to stop them oxidizing and turning black.</p>
<p class="indent2">Next trim the stalks and peel off the rough outer skin, then remove the tough outer leaves. Chop across the remaining leaves, about a third of the way down, you should now be able to delve into the centre with a teaspoon and scrape out the hairy choke. Halve or quarter the artichokes, rubbing any cut surfaces with a halved lemon and then placing in the acidulated water.</p>
<p class="indent2">Whole artichokes may be soaked upside down in salty water for an hour, in order to remove any insects, before being roasted or placed on the barbecue. Once the base is tender – test with a knife or skewer – they are ready to be enjoyed with some extra virgin olive oil. Remove a leaf at a time, dipping its succulent base in the oil, until you reach the centre. Discard the hairy choke and savour the heart.</p>

crema de pimientos</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_5">red pepper soup</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The subtle spicing and sweetness of this soup is typical of much southern Spanish cooking, reflecting it’s Moorish heritage. The recipe comes from Granada, a city crowned by the palace of the last Nasrid sultans: the legendary Alhambra. Watching the sunset cast its fuchsia glow over the fortress walls is spectacular. Rhythmic clapping and wails of Flamenco resound around the narrow alleys of the Medieval quarter and modern Spain seems a world away.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 red peppers, roasted and peeled (see page 144)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 onions, diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp ground cumin</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp sweet paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp <strong>
<em>miel de caña</em>
</strong>
 (see note on page 156) or dark muscovado sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>850 ml/1½ pints home-made chicken stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of ½–1 lemon to taste</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp single cream</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the peppers, onions and garlic and fry gently until the onions become soft and translucent.</p>
<p class="extract">Sprinkle with the spices together with the <em>miel de caña</em>
, or sugar, and stir over the heat for 1 minute.</p>
<p class="extract">Next add the chicken stock, the real thing please, a stock cube will leave the soup tasting thin and salty, and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Transfer the soup to a blender and process until smooth, then strain, if you like and season with salt and lemon juice to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">Reheat the soup with the cream just before serving. Take care not to let it boil or your cream will split. If you are a scatty cook, and I speak from experience, then perhaps a dollop of double cream is a safer option – you can boil it to death with no ill effect.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying peppers</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Peppers should be firm and shiny with no sign of a wrinkle. Green peppers have a sharper, fresher flavour than their red counterparts and can sometimes cause indigestion when eaten raw. Hardly a surprise when you consider they are unripe red or yellow peppers.</p>
<p class="indent2">Red peppers are delicious raw or roasted. I find even the less exciting hothouse varieties can be transformed to deliciously rich and creamy success stories when roasted. But there is no doubt that nothing can beat their deep red, sun-ripened cousins.</p>

ensalada de pimientos con naranja</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_7">red pepper and orange salad</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This is a truly sunny salad from Andalucia, which is best eaten in late autumn with the new season oranges and the last of the sun-ripened peppers. The dish bursts with colour and zippy flavour, making a glorious accompaniment to simply grilled fish.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 red peppers, roasted, peeled and sliced into ribbons</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ sweet onion, halved and finely sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 oranges, peeled, halved and sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tomatoes, halved and sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz green, marinated olives</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp cumin seeds, roasted (see page 108)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>lemon juice or vinegar, to taste (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a few fresh coriander leaves (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Place the sliced pepper, onion, orange and tomatoes in a bowl with the olives.</p>
<p class="extract">Next you can make the aromatic dressing. Crush the cumin seeds in a mortar with a pestle, then add the garlic and salt. Pound to a paste before adding the extra virgin olive oil, drop by drop as you stir, creating a creamy emulsion.</p>
<p class="extract">You may need to add a little lemon juice or vinegar if the oranges are particularly sweet.</p>
<p class="extract">Toss the salad in the dressing and leave to macerate for about an hour. You could add a few fresh coriander leaves too.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Substitute 1 small can <em>atún blanco</em>
 (white albacore tuna, see page 39), drained, for the oranges and proceed as above. Garnish with parsley in place of the coriander.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Roasting peppers</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Roasting rather than grilling a pepper to remove its skin brings out its natural sweetness. The slower the roast the more fabulous the flavour, no oven temperatures or timings required! The only rule of thumb is that the skin should look bubbly and blistered. Once cooked leave the peppers to cool – I tend to cover them with an upturned bowl, the steam seems to help the skins slip off. Slip off the skins over the bowl – not under cold running water – it would be sacrilege to wash away those delicious juices. Strain off the juices and reserve; they are ideal for adding to a salad dressing or soup. Keep the cooked peeled peppers for a few days in the refrigerator covered in olive oil.</p>

fritá de calabaza</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_9">fried pumpkin with peppers and almonds</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Pumpkin is immensely popular in Southern Spain and very conveniently it can be purchased by the slice in most local markets. The subtle, creamy flesh is used in many vegetable stews while sweet and fibrous winter varieties are cooked with sugar to produce <em>cabello de angel</em>
, angel hair, a delicious filling for pastries and pies such as the famous <em>pastel de Córdoba</em>
.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz floury potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz pumpkin, peeled and finely sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 green pepper, de-seeded and sliced</strong>
</p>

<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray">for the <em>picadillo</em>
</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 garlic cloves, peeled</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 slices of yesterday’s white bread</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1–2 tsp cumin seeds, roasted (see page 108)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a pinch of salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>10 almonds, roasted (see page 108)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by starting the <em>picadillo</em>
. Heat the 2 tbsp olive oil in a large pan, add the garlic and fry until golden, then remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, using the same oil, fry the bread until golden then set it aside too.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the 4 tbsp olive oil to the pan and fry the potatoes over a low heat for about 10 minutes. Add the pumpkin and the green pepper and stir to coat in a little oil. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and continue to fry until the pumpkin and green pepper begin to soften, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, you can make the <em>picadillo</em>
. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the cumin seeds, then add the golden garlic with a little salt and crush, followed by the almonds and lastly the fried bread. You could, of course, whiz everything in a small food processor or blender with a tablespoon of water.</p>
<p class="extract">Stir the <em>picadillo</em>
 into the pumpkin mixture and serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;You could garnish the vegetables with some finely chopped parsley, mint or coriander.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing pumpkin</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">A whole pumpkin, free of cracks or soft spots will keep for months in an airy place. Look for specimens that are heavy for their size.</p>
<p class="indent2">It is extremely convenient to buy pumpkin by the slice, escaping the perilous task of hacking through the tough skin and also avoiding mountains of leftovers. But, once cut the flesh will lose flavour and nutritional value in a trice so use within a day of purchase. If you must keep it for any longer make sure to remove the seeds and fibrous centre, as these will go off quickly.</p>

chilled garlic and almond soup</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Those strings of garlic that sing of Mediterranean markets, are more likely to be snapped up by the tourist than the passionate cook. Years ago when each family had their own vegetable patch plaiting the garlic was the ideal way of drying and preserving the bulbs for winter. They were stored in a cool outhouse, cellar or larder until needed. Today these decorative plaits find their way into the hot, steamy kitchen of the modern home where the garlic turns stale and rancid in a trice. So, unless you are warding off vampires or feeding the five thousand, best buy your garlic one bulb at a time.</p>
<p class="indent">The fresh, young bulbs of summer garlic, sometimes known as wet garlic, are ideal for this recipe. The cloves are sweet, mild and less likely to cause indigestion than the more pungent dried variety.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 6</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 slices of stale white bread, crusts removed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz blanched almonds</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1.2 litres/2 pints chilled water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1–2 tbsp white wine vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>18 sweet white grapes or 9 tiger prawns, cooked, peeled and halved lengthways, to garnish</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Process the bread, almonds, garlic and half the water in a blender or food processor until smooth.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, with the motor still running, drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil. Add a little vinegar, a pinch of salt and enough water to give a milky consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more vinegar or salt if necessary.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve garnished with the grapes, which are traditionally peeled – true dedication – not a quality I possess, or three prawn halves per serving. The garnish should be sweet to counter balance the bite of the garlic.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing garlic</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Purchase garlic in small quantities, the sooner you use it the better. The flavour becomes increasingly acrid and pungent as the garlic ages.</p>
<p class="indent2">Should your garlic begin to sprout it is no longer fit for the pot. You could always plant the cloves and then harvest their chive-like shoots. These <em>ajetes</em>
 are often thrown into a <em>revuelto</em>
, scrambled egg.</p>

ajotomate</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">tomato and garlic salad</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Sunlight streams through stained-glass windows onto the mountains of luscious produce in Valencia’s Art Deco style market place. The <em>huerta</em>
 or vegetable garden of Valencia is famed throughout Spain. The fertile plains have been intensively cultivated since medieval times using irrigation channels designed by the Moors. Should the quantity of raw garlic seem a little daunting, then try blanching the cloves first (see the tip on the right) to mellow their flavour.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2–4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 large, very ripe tomato, peeled and diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>sugar (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4–6 tomatoes of varying ripeness and size, sliced, try using a couple of green streaked Raf, salad tomatoes, to add texture and flavour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp toasted cumin seeds (see page 108)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Using a mortar and pestle, grind the garlic and a large pinch of salt into a creamy paste.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the diced tomato and continue to work the mixture until it is smooth.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, pour in the extra virgin olive oil and vinegar, stirring all the time. Taste and add more salt if necessary. You may even like to add a pinch of sugar.</p>
<p class="extract">Arrange your sliced tomatoes on a serving platter and tip over the dressing. Sprinkle with cumin seeds and leave to stand for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavours to develop before serving at room temperature.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;This dressing also works fantastically well with fresh French beans.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing garlic</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">The more finely you chop garlic the more the pungent compounds are released and thus the more intensely flavoured your dish will be.</p>
<p class="indent2">Garlic crushed in the mortar or under the flat blade of a knife gives the most potent results. Slices of garlic are a gentler option while, for a more subtle flavour altogether, cook with whole cloves and remove them before serving.</p>
<p class="indent2">Blanching whole garlic cloves in boiling in water for 2–3 minutes is a useful way of reducing the potency of garlic before crushing in sauces or dressings. Roasting the cloves or even the entire bulbs of garlic until meltingly soft and creamy also gives a deliciously mellow result (see Aubergine Caviar on page 156).</p>

gazpacho</h1>
<p class="nonindent">High summer in Southern Spain is a stifling affair, rubber soles become tacky on red-hot paving stones and even the shady narrow streets offer little respite from the oppressive heat. On days such as these there is nothing more appetizing than a deliciously chilled bowl of fresh gazpacho.</p>
<p class="indent">After an hour pottering around the weekly market in Trujillo, Estramadura, I virtually crawled into a restaurant to escape the asphyxiating midday sun. The gazpacho was glorious, cooled with a rather unorthodox basil ice cube. You could try it; just throw finely chopped basil into the ice-cube tray, cover with water and freeze.</p>
<p class="indent">The tomatoes must be very ripe for this recipe: bursting with sun and flavour; the mass-produced cotton wool variety just won’t do.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 6–8</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 slices of white, country bread</strong>
</p>

<p class="extract">Place the bread in a small bowl and cover with water. Leave to soak.</p>
<p class="extract">Next put all the vegetables in a food processor or blender and process well.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the soaked bread to the vegetables together with the extra virgin olive oil and process, adding just enough water to get a soupy consistency. Remember that if you add ice cubes when you serve the gazpacho you will dilute it further. Season with the salt and vinegar to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">If you are a true perfectionist you may like to strain the soup, but I am just too impatient.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve well chilled with a few ice cubes and a selection of the garnishes above. The garnishes are traditionally served from tiny bowls or ramekins for guests to help themselves, but for a more contemporary twist, you could arrange them attractively in the bowls and pour the soup from a jug at the table.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Peeling and de-seeding tomatoes</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Score a small cross through the skin at the base of each tomato. Place them in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave for about 10 seconds for very ripe tomatoes and more like 20 for a harder salad tomato. Drain the tomatoes, cool under the cold running water and strip off the skin using your cross as an easy starting point.</p>
<p class="indent2">De-seeding tomatoes is only really necessary if you are making a raw sauce or soup where they might affect the texture; the seeds tend to break down during cooking. If you are straining your recipe you will remove the seeds in any case.</p>

<strong>caster sugar (see below)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of, and 1 strip of zest from, 1 unwaxed lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Peel the tomatoes by scalding them in a bowl of boiling water for about a minute. Tip away the water and the skins should slip off the flesh easily.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the seeds from the tomatoes and chop finely. Now weigh the tomato flesh and weigh out an equal quantity of sugar.</p>
<p class="extract">Place all the ingredients in a large saucepan with plenty of room for the mixture to boil without spilling. Bring to a rolling boil, but be careful it will erupt like a volcano, and let it bubble away, uncovered for about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring once in a while, for about 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">To test whether your jam is ready place a spoonful on a cold saucer, preferably chilled from the refrigerator. Leave the jam for 1 minute and then slowly tip the saucer, if the jam has begun to set and formed a skin it is ready. If not, then keep simmering until it does. In any case this jam will be a little runnier than most.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour into sterilized 450 g/1 lb jars (see right) and cover with lids or greaseproof paper.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Storing tomatoes</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Tomatoes become tasteless when refrigerated so keep them in the fruit bowl where they will continue to ripen and gain in flavour.</p>
<p class="indent2">Should your tomatoes become a little overripe and soft you could squeeze them over country bread as alternative to butter. Just add a little olive oil and salt and hey presto you have the Catalan classic <em>pa amb tomàquet</em>
, tomato bread.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Grating tomatoes</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Should you require a sizeable quantity of fresh tomato flesh for the Catalan tomato bread, or any casserole or sauce, then grating is the way to go. Just cut the tomato in half around its equator and use a traditional cheese grater. The skin miraculously remains intact, protecting your fingers, whilst the flesh is reduced to a pulp.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>To sterilize jars</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Wash the jars thoroughly then place in a deep pan and cover with boiling water. Boil for 10 minutes and then drain, upside down on clean kitchen paper.</p>

<p class="nonindent">A tropical storm had hit Tenerife. The bus veered dangerously along the road, palms were bent double and tourists had resorted to dancing the Conga around the hotel bar. La Laguna’s market had been plunged into darkness in the ensuing power cut, but a few resolute stallholders continued trading. So, I had my first lesson in potato appreciation in the shadows. There were countless classes such as the Red Colorada, the romantically named <em>ojo de perdiz</em>
, the Partridge Eye, but the king of the castle was undoubtedly the <em>papa negra oro</em>
: a black potato grown in the island’s volcanic soil with famously creamy golden flesh. The most expensive potato in the world! You’ll probably have to make do with a more common variety.</p>

<p class="extract">Place the salt in a saucepan and add enough water to a depth of about 5 cm/2 inches. It’s a good idea to use an old pan, as the salt and steam treatment does not do your cookware any favours.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the potatoes and cover them with a piece of damp greaseproof paper or a tea towel, then the saucepan lid. Boil for about 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender when skewered.</p>
<p class="extract">Next drain the potatoes and return to the pan along with a large pinch of salt. Place the pan over a low heat, shaking and tossing the potatoes until they are dry and wrinkled.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_24">stuffed aubergines</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Pyramids of aubergines are a common sight in Spanish markets. Their dramatic purple skins seem almost too good to be true. In fact in the old days they were more prized by Europeans for their ornamental than culinary qualities. The Moors introduced the aubergine to Spain, unleashing its delicious potential – heaven combined with olive oil, aromatic spices such as cumin and cinnamon, fresh mint or coriander and sublime with lamb.</p>
<p class="indent">This is one of the most versatile dishes – an ideal way to give leftovers a new lease of life. Adapt to suit the season or the contents of your refrigerator.</p>

<p class="extract">Cut your aubergines in half lengthways and remove as much of the flesh as possible without piercing the skin. Oil an oven tray and line the aubergines up ready to fill them.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>For the lamb stuffing:</strong>
 heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the aubergine flesh, onion and red pepper and fry until soft. The aubergine will soak up the oil at once, but soon turns translucent and releases it again, so there is no need to add any more oil or you may end up with a rather greasy result. Add the garlic and cook until you are inhaling its wonderful scent. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lamb, spices, seasoning and egg.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>For the vegetarian stuffing:</strong>
 fry the aubergine flesh, the onion and pumpkin together with the olive oil in a large pan until the aubergine becomes translucent and soft. Add the garlic and the mushrooms and stir over a high heat until the mushrooms release their moisture. Continue to cook until the liquid has evaporated and then add the paprika, pine nuts and parsley. Season with a little salt.</p>
<p class="extract">Fill the aubergine skins with either mixture and sprinkle with grated cheese. Bake in the oven for 30–40 minutes until golden.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying aubergines</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Aubergines should be gloriously shiny and firm when you buy them, any wrinkles or bruising and they are past their best.</p>
<p class="indent2">Size is of no importance as far as flavour is concerned so select the aubergine to fit the dish. The smaller egg-shaped variety, hence their American name, are wonderful stuffed and served among a selection of other vegetables as a first course. Larger aubergines are more convenient for dicing.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing aubergines – to salt or not to salt? that is the question</strong>
.</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Today’s aubergines are mostly hybrid varieties that lack any of the bitterness of their forerunners, so time-consuming salting seems unnecessary on this count. However, the honeycomb flesh does collapse and loose some of its sponge-like qualities when salted and thus it maybe worthwhile prior to frying. Personally I never bother, as it seems a great palaver.</p>
<p class="indent2">When it comes to the cooking I am more pedantic; the flesh must become soft, creamy and translucent. The hideous polystyrene-like texture of undercooked aubergine is an all too common experience.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is a fabulous purée to serve with toast as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to lamb cutlets. I sometimes like to char the aubergines over a gas flame or barbecue before baking them in the oven, giving a fabulously smoky result.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 aubergines</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3–4 garlic cloves, whole but skin left on</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of 1 lemon, or to taste</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the aubergines and garlic cloves in a roasting tin, drizzle with 1 tbsp oil and bake in the oven. Check the garlic cloves after 20 minutes, once the flesh inside feels soft they are ready, they should on no account burn. Set the garlic aside to cool.</p>
<p class="extract">The aubergines will be cooked in anything from 20–40 minutes depending on their size. They are ready when they begin to collapse and feel like feather pillows when pinched. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the tips off the garlic cloves and squeeze out the flesh into a large bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Peel the aubergines. This is a thoroughly messy job and best done over their roasting tin. Place the aubergine in the bowl with the garlic. Using a fork, mash everything together, then begin to add the extra virgin olive oil, little by little, stirring all the time, as if you were making a mayonnaise. Once you have a wonderfully silky emulsion season with lemon juice, salt and pepper.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The microclimate around Motril, on the Mediterranean coast, to the South of Granada is subtropical. This was once Europe’s great sugar cane plantation but today roadside stalls sell mangoes, papayas and, another relative newcomer, the avocado instead. There were baskets of the tiny, egg-sized local variety at the nearby market in Órgiva, Spain’s hippy haven. Plentiful organic produce and some wonderfully hearty home-baked bread were other rare rewards to be found in this land of tepees and tie-dye.</p>

<strong>½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted (see page 108)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Cook the quail’s eggs in a saucepan of boiling water for just over 2 minutes, then plunge them into a bowl of cold water. The yolks should remain an appetizing creamy yellow. Remove the shells and cut the eggs in half.</p>
<p class="extract">Slice the peppers into thin ribbons, cut 2 oranges into segments or slices and squeeze the remaining orange, setting the juice aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Halve the avocados and remove the stone and skin (see right). Cut the avocado into cubes, place it in a bowl and pour over the orange juice immediately.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix all the ingredients for the dressing together in a bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Just prior to serving toss the spinach in the dressing and place on a platter or individual plates. Now arrange the quail’s eggs, pepper strips, orange segments and avocado on top, if you toss them all together the eggs and avocado tend to break up and look unattractive.</p>
<p class="extract">Sprinkle with the mint leaves, almonds and cumin seeds.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Selecting and storing avocados</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Most of the avocados grown in Southern Spain are of the Hass variety with their characteristic bubbly black skin. Many of them are unusually small, barely bigger than a hen’s egg, but size is certainly not everything. I have never come across such consistently creamy and delicious avocados in my life.</p>
<p class="indent2">Touch is the only way to gauge ripeness; the flesh should give a little when pressed gently. If the fruit is rock hard and incidentally much easier to get home safely, then a few days in a warm kitchen will soon ripen it up. If you are in a hurry, with a particular event in mind, 24 hours in a paper bag with a ripe banana should do the trick.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing avocados</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Left to its own devices the flesh will oxidize and turn brown almost instantly once cut and, although this will not affect the flavour, it certainly doesn’t look very appetizing. Having some lemon, lime or orange juice at the ready and pouring it over the avocado will stop it from discolouring and tastes good too.</p>
