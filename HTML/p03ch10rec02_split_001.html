<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is a specialty of northern Spain, in the regions where the Ebro River flows. It is good to make for a large party, as it can be prepared well in advance. The peppers are sometimes fried with the onion, but roasting gives them a finer taste and texture.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 6 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound bacon, cut crosswise into thin strips</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds boneless lamb, such as neck fillet or trimmed boneless lamb shoulder, cut into large pieces (2½ to 3 inches)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">5 bell peppers, preferably 3 red and 2 green, roasted (see page 128), peeled, seeded, and each cut into 8 strips</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun1">Pepper</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onion, garlic, and bacon in 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wide casserole or saucepan over medium heat, for about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring, until soft and just beginning to color. Add the tomatoes and sugar and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="summary">Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the meat, sprinkle with salt, and turn the pieces to brown them all over. Lift them out and add them to the tomato sauce.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the peppers, stir in the wine, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, over low heat for 1 to 1½ hours, until the meat is very tender and the sauce reduced; turn the meat a few times to keep uncovered parts from drying out.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> You may prefer to add the roasted peppers to the stew 15 to 30 minutes before the end of cooking.</p>
