<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">I love this easy-to-make soup, a specialty of Málaga. The garlicky mayonnaise stirred in at the end gives it a creamy texture and adds to the mysterious, delicate, slightly winey flavor. Hake or another firm white fish can be used instead of monkfish. Small clams are usually added (see the variation), but small or medium scallops are perfect in this soup. Serve with toasted or fried bread.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound monkfish fillet</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups fish stock or water</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine or sherry</p>
<p class="qun">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">4 waxy or new potatoes (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into ¼-inch-thick slices</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon sugar (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">16 medium or large shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">8 small scallops</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup store-bought mayonnaise (I use Hellmann’s)</p>
<p class="qun">3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the monkfish in a large saucepan and add the stock or water, wine or sherry, onion, bay leaves, and a little salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 5 to 6 minutes, until the fish is just barely opaque throughout. Lift out and put it aside.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the potatoes to the pan and simmer until they are tender but not falling apart. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning. If the wine is very dry, you might like to add a tiny bit of sugar.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cut the monkfish into chunks and return them to the pan. Add the shrimp and scallops and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the shrimp turn pink and the scallops are no longer translucent.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Put the mayonnaise in a bowl and stir in the garlic. Add a few tablespoonfuls of the fish broth and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon, then pour into the soup, stirring very gently so as not to break up the potatoes and fish, and heat through. Stir in the parsley.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Use ½ pound clams instead of scallops. Wash and soak in cold salted water for 1 hour to clean them (see page 127). Put them in a pan with about ½ cup of water, cover, and steam over medium heat. The shells will open very quickly. Take the clams out of their shells and add them to the soup. Strain the clam cooking water, pour it into the soup, and heat through. Add a drop of vinegar or lemon juice to the broth.</p>
