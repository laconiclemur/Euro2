  <p class="chap-para">I love rabbit and can’t understand why it is not more widely available. The meat is tender, light and very digestible; in Italy, rabbit is given to weaning babies, convalescents and the elderly. You can order rabbit from good butchers, or if, like me, you shoot, the countryside is full of them. I often marinate rabbit because it rids the meat of that slightly gamey taste it can have; it can be marinated the day before and left in the fridge overnight. Once cooked, the rabbit is finished with a tangy sweet and sour sauce, giving the meat a real kick. Delicious served with slices of toasted country bread. If you prefer, chicken can be substituted for the rabbit.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz rabbit pieces on the bone, cleaned with a damp cloth</p>

  <p class="ing1">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">5 tbsp vegetable stock</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">175ml/6fl oz/¾ cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp thyme leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the agrodolce</p>

  <p class="ing1">20g/¾oz/1½ tbsp caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">a knob of butter</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp red wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz/3 tbsp sultanas (golden raisins), soaked in lukewarm water for about 20 minutes, then drained</p>

  <p class="ing2">15g/½oz/2 tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p class="para">Put all the marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave to cool. Put the rabbit in a dish, pour over the marinade, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the rabbit from the marinade, pat dry and dust with flour.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and sweat for a minute, then add the rabbit and brown all over. Pour over the marinade and cook on a low heat, uncovered, for about 15 minutes until the liquid has evaporated. Add salt, pepper and stock, cover with a lid and cook for 25 minutes on a medium–low heat until the rabbit is cooked through and the sauce has reduced.</p>

  <p class="para1">Meanwhile, for the agrodolce, put the sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan on a medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the butter until melted, then the vinegar and sultanas and bring to the boil for a minute. Pour this over the cooked rabbit, mixing it with the sauce, sprinkle with the pine nuts and serve.</p>
