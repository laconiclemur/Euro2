<p class="nonindent1"><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">Many people helped to produce this book.</span></span> Without their generosity, assistance, and encouragement, it would have never materialized. First and foremost, we wish to thank our families, including Freyja Ros Oskarsdóttir and our children, Hildur Gunnarsdóttir, Gísli Sigurgeirsson, Eric Schatzman, Mary Eddy, and Peter and Evelyn Bragelman.</p>
<p class="indent1">We must thank the producers who met with us during the course of our research. Without them and their tireless efforts to preserve the culinary traditions of Iceland, we would not have been able to write the book.
