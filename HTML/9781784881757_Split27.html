<p class="tx1">Small pots of sage, rosemary, parsley, basil and thyme sit outside every Tuscan’s house or flat where there is a little space. These provide essential flavours to Tuscan food. Only a few dried herbs will be found in the Tuscan cupboard, such as sage, oregano and fennel seeds. Parsley is easy to grow and used in abundance, and someone who is always hanging around is called <i>prezzemolo</i> (parsley) – it was Giancarlo’s nickname when he was young as he was always in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="tx">To dry herbs at home, pick them at their peak and tie them in bunches by their stems. Hang them in a dry, airy place until completely brittle and crumbly. Put them into a bag and crush them with your hands. Pull out the stems and tip the leaves straight from the bag into jars. To dry fennel seeds, pick the yellow flower heads of wild fennel when the seeds have begun to dry on the plant. Tie, dry and store them like the herbs. The seeds and herbs will keep until the following year but will gradually lose their strength.</p>
