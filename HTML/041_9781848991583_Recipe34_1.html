<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_51"/><b>Tomato Farci</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Lamb</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Lavender</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>In this book you’ll come across a few farci (stuffed) dishes, because it’s a very typical style of cooking in France, and in this recipe I have given the technique a modern approach. I do like lavender with lamb, so I decided instead of simply sprinkling roast lamb with lavender flowers, I would use them to flavor ground lamb, then stuff the mixture into large beefsteak tomatoes before roasting them. It’s important to use lavender that hasn’t been sprayed with chemicals, so try to buy from an organic source. This makes a great family dish that only needs a mixed salad to serve alongside.</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 35 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 beefsteak tomatoes</p>
<p class="acktxt">14 ounces ground lamb</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 edible lavender sprigs, young leaves only from the tips</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">mixed salad, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 325°F and line a small baking dish large enough to hold the tomatoes upright with parchment paper. Cut the top off each tomato, about one-quarter of the way down, and reserve to make 4 lids. Turn the tomatoes upside-down and press to squeeze out the seeds, then discard the seeds. Scoop the flesh out of the inside of each tomato, then season the insides with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Roughly chop the tomato flesh, then mix it with the ground lamb. Add a pinch of the blue tips of the lavender, then season well with salt and pepper. Divide the lamb mixture into 4 equal portions and roughly roll each portion into a ball, then press each into a tomato shell so the filling comes a little above the top of the tomatoes. Put the reserved tomato lids on top, then put the stuffed tomatoes in the prepared baking dish.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Drizzle the tomatoes with the oil and bake 35 minutes, or until the lamb is cooked through. To check that the lamb is ready, insert a skewer into the middle and if it comes out clean, the meat is cooked. If not, return the dish to the oven and cook 5 minutes, then test again. Serve with a mixed salad.</p>
