Stocks are made from bones, fish, beef, veal, poultry, game and vegetables. To round off the flavour, soup vegetables, a bouquet garni and/or a studded onion may be added.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Soup vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">These consist of equallysized pieces of leeks, celeriac, carrots and sometimes Hamburg parsley or a sprig of flat or curly-leaved parsley. These are also sold prepacked. The actual ingredients and weight used may vary according to the season. The standard amount is about 200–300/7–10 oz, which is enough for 1–2 litres/1</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">3</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">4</span></span><span class="calibre6">–3</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">1</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">2</span></span><span class="calibre6"> pints (4</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">1</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">2</span></span><span class="calibre6">–9 cups) of stock, but in some cases the selection may weigh up to 500 g/18 oz.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Bouquet garni for soup</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">This is a soup flavouring consisting of soup vegetables and herbs, for instance 1–2 sprigs thyme, 1 sprig lovage, 1–2 bay leaves and 1 sprig parsley. The bouquet garni ingredients are cleaned, washed and tied together with kitchen string, so that the bunch can easily be removed at the end of the cooking time.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Onion studded with bay leaf and cloves</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">The inedible outer skin of the onion is pulled off, then a diagonal cut about 2 cm/</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">3</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">4</span></span><span class="calibre6"> in deep is made and 1 bay leaf is pushed into the slit. Then some cloves are pushed into the onion, sharp end first.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Making stock (broth)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1. Prepare the ingredients and put in a saucepan. (For a vegetable stock, the vegetables, cut into coarse dice, are sometimes first browned in hot cooking oil before the water is added. The browning process forms cooking products that give the stock a stronger flavour.)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2. Fill the pan with cold water to cover the ingredients and bring to the boil.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3. With a ladle, skim off the foam of coagulated protein and cloudy particles.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 4. Add the soup vegetables only after skimming.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 5. Reduce the heat and leave the ingredients to simmer uncovered over a low heat for at least 60 minutes.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 6. Pour the finished stock through a fine sieve (perhaps a sieve lined with a cooking cloth) and use as directed in the recipe. If desired the half-cooked vegetables and meat or fish may be finely chopped and returned to the stock.</span></p><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Tips </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">If the ingredients are put in cold water, their flavour is more strongly extracted so that the flavour of the stock becomes fuller and stronger.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">If the ingredients (particularly meat) are put directly into boiling water, the pores close up immediately, that is, less meat juice escapes into the stock and the meat remains juicier. This method is employed if the meat is intended for further use.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Do not add salt to stock until is being used in a soup, because pre-salted stock tastes even saltier when it has been kept.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Do not cook any dough, rice or dumplings in clear stock since they will make the stock cloudy. Such garnishes should be cooked separately.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">A more concentrated stock can be made by increasing the amount of meat added, browning the ingredients before adding the water, or by reducing the stock.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Removing fat from the stock</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">If the hot stock is to be used immediately, you can </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">skim off the specks of fat with a large, flat spoon, or</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">draw absorbent kitchen paper over the surface of the stock, so that the paper lifts off the layer of fat.</span></li></ul></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">If more time is available, let the stock cool down. The fat floating on the surface solidifies when it becomes cold and can then be easily lifted off with a large, flat spoon.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Freezing stock</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">Clear stock can be frozen, ideally in separate servings, (perhaps in ice cube trays), so that it is quickly available when required.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Instant products</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">If time is short, a commercial instant product such as bouillon powder or stock cubes may be used. The quantity to be used is given in the instructions on the packet. Another possibility is concentrated liquid stock, but this is quite expensive.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cream soups</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">These are based on a stock thickened with a binding medium such as flour, starch, crème fraîche, vegetable purée, egg yolk or an egg yolk-cream mixture. Cream soups thickened with egg yolk, on its own or mixed, must not be brought to the boil after the yolk mixture has been added or the yolk will curdle.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Garnishes for soup</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">Suitable garnishes for soup include chopped herbs, diced tomato made from peeled tomatoes with the pips removed, small crisp noodles, diced ham, whisked egg, cooked pasta or rice, steamed vegetables, fried diced bread (croutons), toasted almonds, semolina dumplings, meatballs, pancake strips, filled pasta, cooked egg garnish, or steamed, finely shredded vegetables (julienne). Pasta, rice or dumplings should never be cooked in stock since they will make it cloudy. These garnishes should be cooked separately in salted water and only added to the stock shortly before serving. Pasta and rice should be only barely cooked, since they continue to cook in the hot stock or soup.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Thick soups</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">Thick soups contain a large quantity of meat or dumplings, making them more of a meal in themselves. It is a good idea to cook a larger quantity than is needed immediately and freeze what is left.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_4"></div>
