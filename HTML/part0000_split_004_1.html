   <p class="calibre24"><span class="calibre9">Learning a foreign language is a wonderful goal, and it can also be a fun and rewarding experience.  What stops many people from attempting to learn a foreign language is their own fear of speaking, of looking foolish in front of another person. They may be comfortable studying vocabulary lists or grammar rules, but without actually speaking a language, no one can really progress. </span><span class="calibre25">52 Weeks of Family French </span><span class="calibre9">is designed to get you speaking French from the very first day! </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre26"><span class="calibre9">Not only will you build on your own success as you</span><span class="calibre9"> learn to communicate in French, you will take your children along on this exciting journey. Children are naturally curious and full of enthusiasm. They haven’t yet faced a conjugated verb or a double negative. They have no idea that learning to speak a foreign language is supposed to be difficult. What better study partners could you ask for? For most of us, our inhibitions about pronouncing foreign words disappear when we practice with our children. Using the simple lessons provided in this book, you and your children will be speaking to each other (and hopefully other people) in French quickly and easily.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre26"><span class="calibre25">52 Weeks of Family Frenc</span><span class="calibre25">h </span><span class="calibre9">is designed to be a relaxed, self- teaching guide. Each week you focus on a simple conversational concept that you and your children can practice together. The conversations were chosen based on their relevance to real, everyday family life. The lessons are short and simple and will get you and your family practicing French in the many of the moments modern families share together: mealtimes, morning “rush hour”, carpools, bedtime. This is an oral introduction to the French language, so there are no spelling rules to memorize or flashcards to flip. Grammar is touched on throughout the curriculum but the main goal is to get you and your family speaking this beautiful language.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre28">Features of the Book</span><span class="calibre28">              </span></p>

   </ul> 
   <p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre9">This is the heart of it all, and when you see how simple each week’s lesson is, you may be surprised. Certain weeks focus on only one phrase! The fact is that fifty-two small, achievable lessons add up to quite a store of conversational skills, and conversation is the ultimate goal of this book. It was written to provide a family with a respectable oral vocabulary in about a year. Exactly how fast your family progresses is entirely up to you. If you and your kids are in a groove and you want to move ahead, by all means follow the momentum. On the other hand, if you are dealing with an ear infection, an impending dance recital and a huge deadline at work, stretch one week’s lesson into three weeks. The pace is yours to decide. You and your family will be successful if you simply </span><span class="calibre25">keep talking</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
