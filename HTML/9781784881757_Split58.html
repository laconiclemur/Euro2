<h1 class="chapter">pasta with caffè caldesi sauce</h1>
<div class="covser1"><a id="page_95"/><img alt="images" src="images/p95.jpg"/></div>
<p class="tx2"><b>The most popular pasta at our restaurant in London, Caffè Caldesi, is Giancarlo’s favourite, the Linguine Caldesi. In this case, the <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">tomato sauce</a> is given a touch of heat with chilli and then cooled down with double cream, before being stirred into hot linguine. Our children still love it this way, so I often make it with linguine for them and roasted vegetables for us. We often use roasted vegetables as a base for sauces in place of pasta. It makes for a lighter meal at lunchtime and is a really delicious way to eat traditional Italian sauces such tomato or ragù, if you can’t eat pasta.</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>1 quantity of <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">Homemade Tomato Sauce</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ teaspoon dried chilli flakes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons double (heavy) cream</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>480 g (17 oz) dried pasta, such as linguine</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good-quality extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a few basil leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the tomato sauce with the chilli and cream in a frying pan until bubbling and hot. Taste and season, adjusting the heat of the chilli as necessary.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions (see <a href="9781784881757_Split24.html#page_41a">cooking dried pasta</a> for how to cook dried pasta) and time it so the pasta will be just cooked when the sauce is ready.</p>
<p class="tx">Once the sauce is ready, stir in the freshly cooked pasta and serve in warmed bowls. Dress with a swirl of good-quality olive oil, top with a basil leaf, and scatter over the grated Parmesan.</p>
