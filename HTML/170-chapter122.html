<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">One spring day, driving through the rolling, red-soiled, and olive-studded hills east of Jerez de la Frontera, the landscape broken by hilltop <em>pueblos blancos</em> (white towns) huddled around ancient Moorish castles, I stopped at a simple <em>venta</em> (roadside eatery) and had this pork for lunch. The loin had been cooked, chilled, and then very thinly sliced like a cold cut. Served as a first course, the owner brought it out with a small dish of flaky sea salt and an ample bottle of heady local extra-virgin olive oil to drizzle over the top. At home, look in the pantry for inspiration—I like a dollop of pear compote</span> <a href="171-chapter123.html#page_245"><span class="red">(see page 245)</span></a> <span class="red">or some sweet-and-sour onions</span> <a href="231-chapter169.html#page_329"><span class="red">(see page 329)</span></a><span class="red">.
