It divides sausages by the size of the minced meat. You may say that the the size of the grinder plate establishes sausage type:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Homogenized.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Finely minced - meat particles below 5 mm (3/16”).</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Finely minced uncooked.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">Finely minced “wysokowydajne” - gain of the finished sausage is more than 135% in relation to the original meat weight.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="5"><span class="calibre_2">Medium minced - meat particles between 5-20 mm (3/16 - 3/4”).</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="6"><span class="calibre_2">Medium minced uncooked.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="7"><span class="calibre_2">Medium minced, high yield (“wysokowydajne”) - gain of the finished sausage is more than 120% in relation to the original meat weight.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="8"><span class="calibre_2">Medium minced semi-dry.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="9"><span class="calibre_2">Coarse minced - meat particles over 20 mm (over 3/4”).</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="10"><span class="calibre_2">Coarse minced uncooked.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="11"><span class="calibre_2">Coarse minced.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="12"><span class="calibre_2">Coarse minced, high yield - gain of the finished sausage is </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">more</span></span></span><span class="calibre_2"> than 115 % in relation to the original meat weight.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="13"><span class="calibre_2">Coarse minced dry.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Note:</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> a finished high yield sausage </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(“wysokowydajna”)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> weighs more than the original weight of the meat. This is due to the addition of water and chemicals that will hold this water inside. Note that there is no upper limit.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Almost all sausages are called by the general word Kielbasa (“sausage”) which is followed by its proper name, for example: Kielbasa Szynkowa, Kielbasa Wiejska, Kielbasa Serdelowa, Kielbasa Krakowska, Kielbasa Mysliwska etc. As explained earlier the word “kielbasa” (a sausage) has little meaning if you do not follow it with the proper name.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre_2">Then there is a more practical classification:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Dry and semi-dry sausages - cold smoked, not cooked.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Dry and semi-dry sausages-smoked and cooked (baked or poached).</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Regular smoked sausages-smoked and poached in water.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">Emulsified sausages - like American hot dogs or bologna.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="5"><span class="calibre_2">Fresh sausages-not smoked, need to be cooked before consumption.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">plus a special group of sausages:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Head cheeses.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Liver sausages.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Blood sausages.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Sausages in the special group are made with offal meat: liver, heart, lungs, brain, spleen, tripe, casings, jowls, dewlap, skins, snouts and blood. When you see the word “kiszka” in the name it signifies the fact that organ meats and often the blood were used as materials. The special group of sausages are cooked in water and usually are not smoked so the entire process can be accomplished in the kitchen. However, at your discretion after cooking and cooling they may be briefly </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">cold</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> smoked to extend their keeping qualities. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">There are very few books that explain how to make those unique products so we provide detailed information in the corresponding chapters. Once a reader understands the process he will not be intimidated by the recipes and he might give them a try. This is a much simpler process than it looks. In addition these sausages are usually not smoked. A peculiar characteristic of the special group sausages is that the cooking process is employed twice: </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> To cook meats and materials in water before grinding and emulsifying. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> To poach sausages in water to the safe internal meat temperature.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">The casings are filled loosely as the semi-cooked groats or rice often expand further and the sausage casings may burst.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Names of Sausages</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">An average person is not really aware and could not care less about this technical classification as all sausages have their own names and people know them. Most Polish sausages derive their name from:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">The part of Poland where they were once originally made: Bydgoska Sausage, Lithuanian Sausage, Krakowska Sausage.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">The name of the meat part or spice that plays a dominant role in the recipe: Bacon Sausage, Garlic Sausage, Juniper Sausage.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">It is possible to make different types of a particular sausage not changing its original recipe but employing different manufacturing techniques. And the same sausage will have a different texture, will have a different degree of saltiness and will have different preservation qualities. White Sausage and Polish Smoked Sausage (cold or hot smoked) are made up of the same ingredients but are different products. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">A very interesting group of sausages were cold smoked products made in Poland and Russia. When thinking about Russia, a picture of a poor farmer laboring his land often comes to mind. Well, there were also aristocrats, Tzar families and royalty who liked good food, sausages not being an exception. The same happened in Poland and continued during the communist regime when the privileged class (party members) had access to the special state run stores where the best domestic and imported foods were available. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Processed meat products had to exhibit superior quality and last a long time as there was no refrigeration. Such requirements forced the development of a manufacturing process which guaranteed that the end product was microbiologically stable, and had an almost indefinite shelf life. Many of these sausages were naturally fermented cold smoked products which could have been called salami. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Starter cultures were not around yet and the final product exhibited none of the sourly flavor so common today. The procedure was as follows:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Top quality meats were selected and cured for 3-4 days with salt and nitrate at low temperatures. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Sausages were cold smoked for weeks at the time. This allowed natural fermentation and drying to take place inside of the smokehouse. Due to the action of the smoke, there was no mold on sausages and if it developed, it would be wiped off.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Sausages were left hanging in a smokehouse or in a different chamber and were consummed on a need basic. The sausages kept on drying out and during this ”ripening” process were developing salami like flavor.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">We could classify these sausages as:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Cold smoked sausages - as salami, </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Metka sausages - spreadable fermented sausages.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Authentic Polish Sausage Recipes and What You Need To Know to Understand Them </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">“Internal Regulations # 16 for Making Meat Products and Sausages”</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> printed in 1959 in Warsaw, was the first official government guide for making processed meats. This 300 page internal guide was reserved for personnel employed in the production of meats and sausages. It covered meat curing and salting, brine preparation, meat selection and official recipes with detailed instructions for making and smoking products like hams, butts, loins, ribs and sausages. A lot of research was based on Russian Meat Technology which was very advanced even in the years before the war. For instance one of the best early books on meat technology that we have seen anywhere is the </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">“Meat Technology and Making Meat Products”</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> by A.A. Manergerger and E.J. Mirkin, printed in Russian, 1949 Moscow edition.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In 1964 the Polish Government issued “Internal Regulations # 21 for Making Meat Products and Sausages” (760 pages long) which was the expanded version of the 1959 guide. In the following years more guides followed, however, in the later editions starting in 1982 additives which were never used before started to appear. The situation deteriorated further when Poland joined the European Common Market in 2004 and had to submit to new common regulations. The meat industry had to accept new additives and chemicals and Polish sausages were never the same. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The recipes presented in this book come from 1959-1964 archives so they do not contain any chemicals, save sodium nitrite which is required in smoked products in every country. They are a treasure chest of sausage history and sausage making secrets. One can learn a new trade by just studying their composition and detailed instructions of their making. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The recipes were prepared for meat plants and the original formulas were for 100 kg (220 lbs) and 1000 kg (2,200 lb) of sausage. As this is too large of an amount for even the hungriest families we have scaled them down to 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of meat. Original instructions were left intact and even though the purchase of some parts such as hearts, tongues or head meat are beyond the reach of an average hobbyist, the recipes were left in the original form and will provide an excellent reading on the art of sausage making. You will notice that some sausages were smoked on three separate times and about 3 weeks of time was needed to produce them. This resulted in a product with a long shelf life. It is unlikely that a modern meat plant could afford itself the luxury of so much time to make a sausage. Most of those sausages are still made today using modified and faster methods of production. Once the sausage is fully cooked it is done and may be placed in a refrigerator. Because refrigerators were not common when the war ended, additional drying steps followed to make products stable at room temperature. Many people still make those original products at least from time to time. And of course in Poland those times will be Christmas and Easter when only the best of the best qualifies to be displayed on the dinner table. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Herbal Pepper </span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_7">(Pieprz ziołowy)</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Spices like pepper, nutmeg, or allspice do not grow in cold Polish climate and had to be imported. Poland had salt mines but shortages of pepper were quite common. Human ingenuity came to the rescue and the herbal pepper was invented. Although it was not as potent as the original pepper, it had an advantage: it was mainly made from locally grown herbs.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">As a rule of thumb a double amount of herbal pepper is needed to replace regular pepper. It has also been said that in meat products the full effect of herbal pepper use is noticeable after about 48 hours. Herbal peppers are used in many countries, for example French Quatre-èpices: (pepper, nutmeg, cloves) or Italian seasonings (marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory, sage, oregano, and basil).</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Different combinations were created and the herbal pepper became such a hit that it is still being sold in every store in Poland. The table lists the herbal pepper formula that was approved for use in meat products. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre_2">Another herbal pepper typical formula: white mustard seed, caraway, marjoram, chili, hot and sweet paprika, bay leaf.</span></p><table border="1" class="calibre4" valign="top"><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_27" valign="top"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_28">Spice Name</span></span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_27" valign="top"><p class="calibre_"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_28">% used</span></span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_29" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">coriander</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">26.6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">dry horseradish</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">17.6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_29" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">caraway</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">8.8</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">cayenne pepper</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">4.3</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_29" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">white mustard seed</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">17.6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">marjoram</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">0.9</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_29" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">black mustard seed</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">17.6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">gentian</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_31" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">0.004</span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre_29" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">fennel</span></p></td><td border="1" class="calibre_30" valign="top"><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">6.6</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Buckwheat and Barley Groats </span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_7">(Kasza gryczana and jęczmienna)</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Those groats are used in many blood sausages. They are very popular in Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain and England. Barley is big in Scotland too but for a different reason: Scotch Whiskey is made from it.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Bread Crumbs and Dry Rolls </span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_7">(Bułka tarta i czerstwa)</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Bread crumbs need very little introduction as they are used for general cooking. Only rolls baked from pure wheat flour were used in the meat industry. Except for wheat, no other ingredients like rye or sugar were permitted in the manufacturing. Dry rolls were soaked in leftover meat stock or just in plain water. Bread crumbs were made by slicing dry wheat rolls through a grater. Bread crumbs that are sold in supermarkets today are a poor choice for making sausages as they contain too many foreign ingredients that may go sour. You are better off buying a few Portuguese wheat rolls and leaving them on a shelf to dry out. The practice of adding rolls to meat was widely used after the war and it was the question of economics. There was no meat and sometimes there were leftover rolls and bread that nobody would throw away. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">It was a cardinal sin to throw away any kind of food, especially bread. When a piece of bread was dropped people would pick it up and kiss it as the way of saying I am sorry. We are talking about times when the diet consisted of stinging nettle soup, wild mushrooms or dandelion wine. If you add soaked rolls or bread crumbs to your hamburger meat, add raw egg to bind it together, fry some finely diced onions until glassy, and mix it together you have created a whole new dish. Ever heard of Wiener Schnitzel? It is basically a veal fillet, soaked on both sides in beaten egg, then dipped on both sides in bread crumbs and fried on a frying pan. You can do the same with a pork chop or a boneless and skinless chicken breast.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Semolina</span></span><span class="calibre_2">
</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(kasza manna)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> is made during the grinding of wheat to make flour. The particles are round, 0.60-0.65 mm (1/32”) in diameter and white with a yellow tint. Healthy, high caloric food (325 cal per 100 g) semolina was often given with milk and sugar to children for breakfast. When making sausages it is used to bind meats together in products like Liver Sausage, Jowl Sausage and Blood Head Cheese. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Skwarki</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Skwarki are basically ¼ cubes of pork fatback fried on a pan, until becoming light brown in color. Kind of bacon bits. Skwarki is the by product of making lard (</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">smalec</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> in Polish) by fat rendering. They are remaining bits of pure fat or very fatty meat, about ¼” in size, which are obtained by melting down back fat. The melting process must be stopped when they become gold or light brown otherwise they will burn and taste bitter. They are often added to blood sausages. Skwarki are usually present in home made lard. In the early 20th century lard’s popularity was equal to butter and it was commonly used as a cooking fat or as a spread. Today its use has diminished by its negative image among health conscious consumers. But if one can put this perception aside for a minute and look at lard’s chemical composition, it will become clear that lard has less saturated fat and less cholesterol than an equal amount of butter. At the last moment, when skwarki are almost done, a finely chopped onion may be added into the melted lard and when the onions acquire a golden color the heat must be turned off. A small amount of salt may be added. The lard with skwarki is poured into containers where it will last a long time even at room temperature. Such lard when spread on a slice of bread became a high calorie food. You can made lard and skwarki from back fat or belly slabs.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_62" src="../images/00070.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 4.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Lard rendering.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_63" src="../images/00112.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 4.2</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Lard cracklings (skwarki).</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Spices</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">You will easily notice that by today’s standards these recipes call for a small dosage of spices. With high quality meat available and no chemicals or binders used it was sufficient to produce a great sausage. Today, extra water and the whole array of extra ingredients are added which dilutes the flavor. To make up for that we need to add flavor enhancers and more spices. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Sugar</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Less crucial, normally used to offset the harshness of salt. Amount used is about 10 % of the salt used in the recipe. Sugar is normally used with salt when curing meat. As a flavoring ingredient, sugar plays a little role in making sausages. No more than 3 g of sugar is added to 1 kg of meat otherwise it can be noticeable. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Fat</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The meat needs about 25 - 30% fat in it. This will make the sausage tender and juicy, without fat it will feel dry.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Salt</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Sausage needs salt. The proper amount of salt in meat (tastes pleasant) is 2 – 3%, though 1.5 – 2% is usually an average. Poland lies on a similar latitude to Quebec in Canada which provides good conditions for storing food at room temperatures for the most of the year. Those conditions plus the right amount of salt, nitrate and proper manufacturing procedures (curing, cold smoking) allowed the creation of stable meat products with a very long shelf life. The original recipes called for about 2.3% of salt which was needed when the main objective was meat preservation and refrigerators were unheard of. We all have access to refrigerators and most typical sausages contain about 2% or less of salt. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Salt perception can be an acquired taste. If you decide to go on a low sodium diet and start decreasing the amount of salt you consume, in about three weeks time you may reach a point when your food tastes enjoyable, though you use less salt than before. This is fine as long as you prepare those meals for yourself. When smoking meats, sausage or fish for your friends try to adhere to the amount of salt the original recipe calls for as other people will probably like more salt than you.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">When smoking large amounts of meat that will be kept for a week or longer in the kitchen or refrigerator, remember that </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">it will keep on drying out</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> (losing moisture). </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Salt will, however, remain inside and your sausage will now taste saltier and will be of a smaller diameter. </span></span><span class="calibre_2">The meat flavor will also be stronger now. In such a case you may use less salt than originally planned for, let’s say 1.5 mg/kg. That will not apply when making a fresh sausage which will be consumed in a matter of days and 1.8 - 2.0 mg salt per one kilogram of meat will be fine. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Pepper</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The most popular spice “pepper” comes in two forms:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">black pepper - unripe seeds of the plant with the skin left on</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">white pepper - ripe seeds with the skin removed </span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Pepper is available as whole seeds but you have to grind it. Like in the case of coffee beans, the advantage is that you get a fresher aroma when grinding seeds just before use. It is available as coarse grind, sometimes called butcher’s grind or fine grind. A recipe will call for a particular grind but the final choice will be up to you. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">The dividing line is whether you want to see the pepper in your product or not. </span></span><span class="calibre_2">Otherwise it makes no difference and you can replace black pepper with the same amount of white pepper, although the black pepper is a bit hotter.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">General Notes </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">By studying the recipes one will notice that most are made of pork and different proportions of beef, sometimes veal. In Israel or in Muslim countries pork will be omitted on religious grounds as in those times it was thought to be an inferior meat. The reason was not the meat itself but the insufficient knowledge we had on the subject as the meat was often infected with </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">trichinae worms</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> due to eating raw garbage and dead rodents. The climate in those countries was much warmer than in Northern Europe and pork meat did not last long either. If you follow cases of food recalls in the USA, you will see that they were mainly created by beef that was infected by </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">E.coli.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Geographical location plays a significant role when making up new recipes. Mountain people or highlanders raise animals such as sheep or goats and in their recipes those meats will play a dominant role. They would probably love to eat more pork but the rocky terrain was ill suited for pigs to prosper.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Choosing only lean meat will not produce a high quality sausage. It will be a poor quality sausage as it will not have enough fat in it. We may think of all those little scraps of meats with gristle and sinews as inferior meats, but they are rich in collagen and will produce gelatin which will bind all ingredients together. Those scraps are processed in a bowl cutter until a fine paste is obtained. Rotating knives generate so much heat that flaked ice is added to keep the temperature under control and all those scraps of meat, skins included, can swallow large amounts of ice and water and hold it thus making the product feel juicy. Fat carries the flavor, in addition it provides a pleasant mouth feel. Fat foods such as ice cream, cream cheese, mayonnaise, butter, sauces, fat hamburger; they all feel pleasant to our palate. Remove the fat and the sausage feels like bread crumbs. There are low fat equivalents of ice cream, yogurt, cream cheese and other foods that to a certain point they can imitate the original flavor of the product, but they are made with special ingredients known as hydrocolloids, for example microcellulose or a variety of gums. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">People like to apply double standards to whatever they consider to be good food. Mention smoked eel to a friend and he is already shaking seeing in his mind a nasty rattler going after him. He does not even want to hear that quality smoked eel can be spread with a knife on a roll like butter. Until the 1970’s one could not find a single eel in a fish store in New York City. Then an influx of immigrants from the Far East had brought new customs and cuisines. The eels started to swim in fish tanks everywhere.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Take “carp” for example, the fish originally came from Japan to China, then to Europe and finally to the USA. Served in aspic or cooked Jewish style, in Poland carp has been the traditional Christmas Eve dish for centuries. In 1985 when I was trained in New York as a scuba diver, my manual stated that the fish was non-edible. The probable cause was that the fish being a bottom dweller, could develop a slight muddy flavor especially as it grew larger. It also contains more bones than other species and ourselves being a busy species today, we expect to order our meal, swallow it and rush out to watch a baseball game. In Poland there were no stores nor proper distribution systems when the war ended and live carp was sold on street corners before Christmas. People would buy a few fish a week earlier and keep them swimming in a bathtub full of water until they were ready to process and cook them.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">How many of us ate Steak Tartare which is a raw ground beef (originally horse meat). It is is served with an egg, chopped onions, and a pickle, not forgetting a glass of cold beer. Most of us will eat a bloody rare steak, but will not touch a fully cooked blood sausage. Mention to someone that skins and tongues are used to make a head cheese and he’ll never touch it. In the meantime, all his life he eats hot dogs not realizing that they are made from tongues, skins, organs, head meat and bone scraped meat. Special machines are designed to scrape off the tendons and remaining pieces of meat from the bones until they are bare. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In European countries the consumer accepts head cheese or blood sausage as a fine product. You can buy sausages made from horse meat in Europe and nobody is surprised. Here in the USA there is a lot of prejudice, but we are very practical people. In order not to confuse folks with names like head cheeses or blood sausages, we dump all parts of animal into bologna, hot dogs and frankfurters. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Sausage Names </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Where practical the English name was substituted: Kielbasa Litewska (Lithuanian Sausage), Kielbasa Ukraińska (Ukrainian Sausage) or Juniper Sausage (Kiełbasa Jałowcowa). In other instances due to the established popularity of the sausage the Polish name was left intact, even though it sounded difficult to pronounce: Krakowska Sausage, Mysliwska Sausage or Rzeszowska Sausage (Kiełbasa Rzeszowska). We have tried to avoid creating names that are neither English nor Polish. Where possible we are providing a particular sausage history and you will be able to understand that Zywiecka Sausage (Kiełbasa Żywiecka) means a sausage that comes from the region of Żywiec, the same region where the popular Polish beer “Żywiec” is made. Many sausage names contain words or letters that are common to different languages, notably German. For hundreds of years certain areas in Poland were populated by different ethnic groups living either together or next to each other. This has recently changed as fresh meats and sausages are kept in refrigerators. Barbecue and grill units are everywhere and fresh sausages are cooked outside and immediately eaten. This has made the manufacturing process easier compared to traditional methods of food preservation.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00091.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 4.3</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> A section of a typical Polish meat store.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Recipe Guidelines</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">As all of original Polish sausage recipes ask for pork, beef or veal meat class I, II, III or IV we have faced a little dilemma. We could have substituted pork, beef or veal meat grades with names like ham, butt, loin and other cuts but this would not be a true representation of the original. In addition most sausages require some connective tissue and one cannot just walk into the store and ask for one pound of connective tissue meat. You have to trim it out yourself. A recipe might call for pork class II B but it really </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">does not matter whether this meat comes from ham, butt, picnic or from meat trimmings</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> as long as it fulfills the requirements of the recipe.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In order to select right meat cuts it is absolutely essential that one studies Chapter 2, especially </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">meat classes.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Lean ham or butt can be used for pork class I. Pork butt will do fine for class II. Keep in mind that ham and butt will provide meats of all classes. To make a quality sausage you need to understand Chapter 2, that simple.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Many recipes call for the addition of </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">dewlap</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> which is seldom mentioned in American sausage recipes. Instead the word </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">jowl</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> (cheek) is predominantly used and it covers dewlap and jowls at the same time. When one ends and the other begins depends how the head is separated from the body but the meat itself remains pretty much the same in both cases.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_64" src="../images/00023.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Fig. 4.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Jowl/dewlap.</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">In the Polish meat industry a clear distinction is made between the two. The front part (cheek) is called jowl and the back (lower) part is called dewlap. The jowls look very much like bacon and sometimes you will meet a definition of “jowl bacon.” The difference is that bacon is a soft belly fat and jowls fat is a hard one. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Many recipes call for garlic. Too much garlic may be sensed in a fresh sausage which is eaten within a day or two, but its potent flavor dissipates rapidly in time. Because of that more garlic can be added to smoked sausages. Fresh garlic is applied in a minced or crushed form.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Many sausages are smoked-</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">cooked</span></span><span class="calibre_2">-smoked-dried. The sausage is finished when cooked to safe temperature. Those additional steps were performed to make a drier sausage that would last for a longer time at room temperature. They may be omitted when a sausage is kept refrigerated.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">You should use a thermometer, however, you can estimate cooking time in </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">water</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> at 176° F (80° C): allow 10 minutes for 10 mm (1 cm) casing diameter, 36 mm casing requires 36 minutes of cooking time. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="5"><span class="calibre_2">You can be flexible with casings. Stuff into any casings - the main criteria is whether they are permeable to smoke. Casings for head cheeses, liver and blood sausages may be waterproof and not permeable to smoke. You can be flexible with the diameter of the casing, however, if you change casing diameter you may need to readjust smoking and cooking time.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="6"><span class="calibre_2">You could probably use pork butt for most of the sausages. You should, however, trim it into separate classes and finely grind/emulsify trimmings rich in connective tissue. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="7"><span class="calibre_2">When smoking times are long you should periodically re-arrange smokesticks to allow uniform smoke distribution. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="8"><span class="calibre_2">Occasionally you may find salted meats only, soak them in cold running water for 3 hours or change water 2-3 times. Fresh back fat is very hard to find, but supermarkets usually carry it in the form of salt pork. It is very salty, however, you could desalt it in water in a refrigerator. You will need at least 24 hours. Taste it to see how salty it is. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="9"><span class="calibre_2">Get into the habit of tasting every sausage mixture before it is stuffed into a casing.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">If you follow safety rules and the proper manufacturing methods it does not really matter how close to the original recipe the amount of spices in your sausage is. It is like roasting chicken in a rotisserie, as long as you add salt and pepper to it, the chicken will come out beautifully. You may add paprika to it, lemon juice, garlic or any other spices you like but it will still remain a fine meal. But if you roast it too long, now it is a different story. The same applies to a sausage, as long as you stay within certain temperatures and times, the sausage will turn out great. Let us quote Madame Benoit, the famous Canadian cookery expert and author who once said:</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">”I feel a recipe is only a theme, which an intelligent cook can play each time with a variation.”</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Most likely you will be making sausages for yourself so use spices that you and your kids like, after all you will end up eating it. We have seen recipe books with names like these: Sausage #1, Sausage #2, Sausage #3. You can do the same but be original and name it after your kids, friends or even your dog or a cat. Just put more oregano to one recipe because John likes more oregano on his pizza and put caraway into the second recipe because Elizabeth likes bread with caraway seeds. Now you have John and Elizabeth Sausages with family history.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">I will never forget when I made my first Polish smoked sausage that turned out very well and I proudly gave it to my friend - professional sausage maker Waldemar to try. I included salt, pepper, garlic, and added optional marjoram. I also added nutmeg and other spices that I liked. Well my friend’s judgement was as follows:</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">“Great sausage but why all those perfumes?”</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">For him it was supposed to be the classical Polish Smoked Sausage and all it needed was salt, pepper and garlic. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre_2">Combining meat with salt and pepper already makes a great product providing that you will follow the basic rules of sausage making. It’s that simple. If you don’t cure your meats properly or screw up your smoking and cooking temperatures, all the spices in the world will not save your sausage.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_6"></div>
