<h3><a id="glolev13"/><span class="red">USING SAFFRON</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="method_txt">Saffron’s potent color and aroma mean that only a pinch (or, at most, two) of threads is required. The threads need to be either dry-toasted and crushed in order to fully maximize their flavor and color, or else steeped in warm liquid.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><em>To dry-toast:</em> Heat a small ungreased skillet over medium-low heat, add the saffron threads, and toast for 2 to 3 minutes, or until aromatic and the threads have turned a shade darker in color. Place the toasted threads in a small sheet of paper that has been folded in half, crumble with your fingers—be sure they are dry—from the outside, and then shake the saffron from the paper into the dish (this prevents any saffron from sticking to your fingers). Alternatively, transfer the toasted threads from the skillet to a mortar, pound into a powder, and add to the dish. Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the mortar to get all of the crushed saffron.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><em>To steep:</em> Place the threads in ½&gt; cup/120 ml hot water and infuse for 20 to 30 minutes. Incorporate the brilliant golden and highly aromatic liquid into the dish. Discard the threads.</p>
