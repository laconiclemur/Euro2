 CORONATION TURKEY JACKET POTATO</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002772">
<em>I had a friend at high school called Elizabeth who used to eat a Coronation chicken baguette for lunch every single day. There we’d all sit, at our usual table, scoffing enormous cheesy pizzas, chips and beans, and chocolate cake with pink custard for afters, while she tucked into her baguette yet again! It was the same for 5 years until the day we left school. I always wondered what was so special about that sandwich. I was tempted to ask for a bite in exchange for a soggy, vinegar-soaked chip, but it seemed too important to her. My curiosity stayed with me, even after that school and its awful bottle-green uniform were left behind, and it inspired me to create my own version, but with a jacket potato. It’s become a firm family favourite.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0002784">
<span class="blue">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put a piece of kitchen paper on a microwaveable dish and place your potatoes on top.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002785">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Microwave the potatoes on a high heat for 22 minutes. If they are still not done, keep cooking them in 2-minute intervals, checking after each blast.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002786">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, place a frying pan on a medium heat and add the oil. When it’s warm, add the turkey and a pinch of salt and gently cook, making sure to stir every few minutes. It should take 6–8 minutes to cook.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002787">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Once the turkey is cooked, set aside and allow it to cool. If we were to put the mayonnaise mixture in with the hot turkey, the mixture might split and become runny. So to avoid disaster we have to exercise a tiny bit of patience. Something I don’t have! That’s why I know it will split.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002788">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Put the mayonnaise, yoghurt, curry powder, mango chutney and two-thirds of the spring onions into a separate bowl and give it all a thorough mix.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002789">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Once the turkey has cooled and is just slightly warm, not scorching hot, add to the mayo mix and stir through.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002790">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Split the potatoes in half and add the Coronation turkey. Sprinkle with the remaining spring onions.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002791">

 This is perfect for that post-Christmas period, when there is way too much turkey left over and you are fed up with turkey sandwiches. I like to serve it with a simple green salad, and there is no need for any salad dressing when you have this lovely Coronation sauce on your plate.</p>
