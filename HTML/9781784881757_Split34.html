<p class="tx2"><b>Firstly, a little about coffee, an essential drug to every Italian I know. It was introduced to Italy through Venice from the Middle East. Initially it was thought to be an Islamic threat to the Christian world, a demon of a drink. However, after Pope Clement VIII drank a cup he proclaimed it Christian and the first coffee house or <i>caffè</i> was opened in 1683, named for the drink it sold. Fourteen billion cups of espresso are consumed each year in Italy. Each adult Italian will drink an average of four shots of coffee in a day. Coffee taken standing at the bar costs less than when it is drunk at a table as there is no clearing or service involved. Most Italians are in and out of a bar quickly, hence the lukewarm temperature of a cappuccino so you can drink and go. Ask for <i>caldo</i> if you want yours hot.</b></p>

<p class="tx1"><b>‘14 billion cups of espresso are consumed each year in italy.’</b></p>

<p class="tx2">Coffee-making by experienced baristas is taken seriously. As every Italian seems to be a coffee expert it is not surprising that the art of making the perfect espresso, cappuccino or macchiato time after time is treated with respect. Apparently, over 57 per cent of baristas have 10 or more years of experience and the majority are therefore of an older age. Scalded milk, a cappuccino served too hot to drink in a hurry, or an espresso without the thin layer of pale brown foam (<i>crema</i>) is not appreciated. Baristas have to observe the weather and adjust the grinding of the coffee appropriately. They have to constantly clean and brush away any used coffee grounds and maintain the machines which are their livelihood. The milk should ideally be served at 70°C (160°F) for a drink to be drunk straight away, and coffee cups should always be warm.</p>
