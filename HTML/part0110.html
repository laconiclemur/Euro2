<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000095">I remember my mum cooking this when I was growing up … she used to prepare the squid herself and the ink would go everywhere! If you ask your fishmonger to clean and separate everything out for you it’s a lot less messy.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000096">Each mouthful of this dish tastes of the sea: it’s rich, but delicate and smooth. When you get it right, it’s heaven.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">FOR 4–6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000097">1kg squid, no larger than 100g in size (ask your fishmonger to clean them but to keep the wings, tentacles, skin and ink), or 12 baby squid</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000098">30ml olive oil</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0000099">For the stuffing</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000100">50ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000101">the squid trimmings (wings, tentacles and skin), finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000102">3 onions, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000103">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0000105">For the ink sauce</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000106">60ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000107">4 onions, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000108">½ a large red pepper, finely diced</p>

<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000110">1 bay leaf</p>

<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000116">To make the stuffing, put most of the olive oil into a pan on a medium heat and add the finely diced squid trimmings. They will release a lot of water – cook until this evaporates. Add the onions with a drizzle more olive oil and a pinch of salt, and allow to caramelize until soft and golden brown. The onions will shrink down a lot – you want to end up with the same quantity of cooked onion as squid. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000117">To make the ink sauce, put the 60ml of olive oil into a casserole pan on a medium-low heat. Add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook until halfway caramelized, then add the peppers and bay leaf. When everything is very soft and almost paste-like, add the tomato sauce and wine. Cook until the alcohol evaporates, then add the squid ink and stock. Cook for 20 minutes, then whiz in a blender and put back on a medium-low heat.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000118">Fill the squid bodies with the stuffing, using a small spoon, and close each one with a toothpick. The squid bodies should be about two-thirds full, to allow for expansion when they cook.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000119">Put 30ml of olive oil into a pan on a medium heat, then add the stuffed squid and allow to caramelize on both sides. Add the stuffed squid to the ink sauce and cook on a low heat very gently for 30–40 minutes, until the squid is soft enough to cut through with a spoon. If the sauce looks like it is reducing too much, just add a little water.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000120">Serve the squid and sauce in a bowl, with <em class="calibre9">ajillo</em> drizzled over and bread on the side for mopping up.</p>
