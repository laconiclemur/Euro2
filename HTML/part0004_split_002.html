Add chopped onion and shallot stir until the onion becomes translucent. Remove the onion from the pot and reserve.</p><p class="calibre6">2- In the oil or pancetta residues that remain in the pot, sauté the chicken until the skin is golden. If your pan is small you might need to do this in two batches.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Sprinkle flour on the browned chicken and sauté for another minute.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Add carrots, garlic, tomatoes, herbs (except the parsley), onion, shallot, pancetta, salt and pepper. Then, in one abandoned, reckless motion of the arm, pour in all the Pinot. If needed, add water until all the chicken is covered in liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook gently, uncovered for 1 to 1½ hours. The liquid will evaporate and the sauce will thicken. Only cover if you feel the liquid is evaporating too quickly. The smell in the kitchen should be just about to die for by now.</p><p class="calibre6">5- 20 minutes before serving add the potatoes. Cover so that they cook evenly.</p><p class="calibre6">6- 10 minutes before serving, finally add the mushrooms. Cooking them longer would turn them into unrecognizable mush.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Taste. Moan with pleasure. Add more salt if desired. Place the coq au vin in a pretty dish. Surround it with potatoes. Pour in the sauce (with mushrooms and pancetta) and sprinkle with finely chopped fresh parley right before serving.</p></div></div></body></html>
