<h2 class="h2b">TIAN D’AUBERGINES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Aubergine Gratin</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>A</em> tian <em>is the dish in which the soft onions, courgettes and aubergines are cooked and served. To all intents and purposes it is a gratin dish and its use, as well as the word itself, is a real feature of Provençal cookery and life. An old saying</em> ‘Roumpre lou tian’ <em>refers to losing one’s virginity, and</em> ‘sian le tian’ <em>is ‘here we are, embarrassed again’. An interesting combination of expressions… This tian is a colourful, slowly cooked marriage of a few ingredients which concentrate in flavour to a sweet, sticky aromatic mass, perfect with lamb in any form, a roasted bass, bream or red mullet. Some, however, prefer to experience it alone. The</em> tian <em>is good cold, or can be made a few days in advance and reheated. Try making individual ones and grilling fresh goats’ cheese on top</em>.</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6 AS AN ACCOMPANIMENT</span><br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) onions, peeled and finely sliced<br/>
50 ml (2fl oz) olive oil, plus a little extra for drizzling<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Caster sugar<br/>
4 fat Roma tomatoes<br/>
1 large courgette<br/>
1 medium aubergine<br/>
Few pinches of thyme or savory leaves, dried or fresh</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 160°C/325°F/Gas 3.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the onions into a shallow pan with a tight-fitting lid with the olive oil, a teaspoon each of salt and sugar, and 100ml (3½fl oz) water. Cover the pan and cook the onions without colouring for about 10 minutes or more until completely soft and creamy. Take off the lid, turn up the heat and stand over the onions, stirring frequently, for 15 or so minutes until they are a dark caramel colour and the liquid has all but gone. Spoon out the onions and spread them evenly across the base of your <em>tian</em> dish.</p>
<p class="normala">Slice the tomatoes, courgettes and aubergines about 1cm (½ in) thick, and arrange them in slices overlapping on top, starting with the aubergines and finishing with the tomatoes. Season well with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the thyme leaves. Drizzle as much or as little olive oil as you like over the top and cover the dish with foil. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, then lift off the foil and bake for a further hour uncovered. The result should be almost dried, the tomatoes dark and all of the flavours very, very concentrated.</p>
