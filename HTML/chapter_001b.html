<h2 class="h2b">AUBERGINE A LA MENTHE ET AUX PIMENTS</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Aubergines with Mint and Chilli</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>When baking them, aubergines are like sponges, and will absorb as much good olive oil as you care to add, making them melting and almost pâté-like on the inside. They then need sharp and pronounced flavours to cut their richness: lemon, chilli and mint is a favoured combination</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2 large aubergines<br/>
80ml (3fl oz) olive oil<br/>
Juice of 2 large lemons, finely grated zest of 1<br/>
Salt<br/>
1 small mild chilli, seeded and finely chopped<br/>
1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Slice the aubergines thickly and lay the slices flat on a tray. Mix the olive oil and the juice of the first lemon and brush the aubergine slices with half of this. Turn them over and brush with the other half. Salt them well and bake for 15–20 minutes until the flesh is meltingly soft.</p>
<p class="normala">Sprinkle over the zest and juice of the second lemon, the chopped chilli and mint, and serve.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON SALTING AUBERGINES</span></p>
<p class="normala">I find it unnecessary to salt aubergines as these days they are generally good and sweet. For me, this whole process leaves them rather tyre-like in texture.</p>
