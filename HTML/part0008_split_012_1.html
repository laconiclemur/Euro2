  <h3 class="h3a">Pasta and beans</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This dish is popular throughout Italy and each region, town, village and family have their own versions. The dish was a staple in most rural homes, slowly bubbling away in large terracotta pots over the ash of the fireplace to provide a warm, nutritious meal when the family returned home from a hard day working in the fields. This particular recipe is typical of the Abruzzo region, where it is normally made with fresh eggless tagliatelle-type pasta. <em class="calibre4">Pasta e fagioli</em> dishes are not traditionally served with grated cheese, but if you prefer you can grate some Parmesan or pecorino to sprinkle on when serving.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/1¼ cups dried borlotti beans, soaked in water overnight</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small carrot, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ red chilli, finely chopped (optional)</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz can chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz tomato passata (strained tomatoes)</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing2">250g/9oz dried tagliatelle, broken up</p>

  <p class="para">Drain and rinse the beans, put them in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover with a lid and cook for about 1 hour, or until the beans are tender. Drain, reserving a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water. Take about a quarter of the beans and mash them with the cooking water. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, sweat the onion, celery, carrot and chilli, if using, for a couple of minutes, then add all the tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook on a medium heat, partially covered with a lid, for 20 minutes. Add all the beans and the reserved cooking water and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the tagliatelle until al dente. Drain, reserving a little of the cooking water, and add to the sauce, mixing well together; if necessary add a little of the cooking water. Remove from the heat and leave to rest for 5 minutes, then serve in individual bowls with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
