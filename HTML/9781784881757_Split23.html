<h1 class="chapter"><a id="page_41"/>fresh tomato passata</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is Andrea Falcone’s method of making a passata to use in soups such as the <a href="9781784881757_Split83.html#page_141">Winter Tomato &amp; Bread Soup</a>. He includes the skins as this increases the flavour of the soup. You can also use it in place of tinned tomatoes when making a tomato sauce (see opposite).</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 750 ML (25 FL OZ/3 CUPS)</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) fresh ripe, flavourful tomatoes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F/Gas 6). Cut the tomatoes in half (around the equator, not pole to pole) and put them cut side up in a roasting tray. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast for 20 minutes or until they just start to collapse and brown. Remove from the oven and put the tomatoes in a blender or food processor. Pulse to blend, until smooth. The passata will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge.</p>
