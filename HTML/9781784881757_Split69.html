<h1 class="chapter">pheasant &amp; leek risotto</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This risotto makes the most of the glorious flavours of a game stock. Pheasants are easy to buy in season but can be dry to roast. Here, the bird is poached as the stock is being made to ensure the meat remains tender. Other game birds can be used in the same way and the leek can be substituted for a white onion.</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>approx. 1.2 litres (2 pints/5 cups) <a href="9781784881757_Split18.html#page_35">Pheasant Stock</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (3 oz) butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ large leek, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 celery stalk, finely diced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>300 g (10½ oz) carnaroli rice</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 sprigs of thyme</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 ml (5 fl oz/⅔ cup) white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200–250 g (7–9 oz) cooked pheasant meat left over from cooking the stock</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>35 g (1¼ oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Warm the stock in a saucepan over a medium heat. Meanwhile, heat the oil and half the butter in a large heavy-based frying pan over a low heat. When hot, add the leek and the celery, and cook for 10–15 minutes until softened but not browned. Increase the heat to medium and add the rice and thyme. Allow the rice to crackle and toast, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for a few minutes before pouring in the wine. Bring to the boil and cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring, until the wine is absorbed. Remove the thyme sprigs. Add a few ladlefuls of warm stock and stir through with a wooden spoon. Continue adding more stock as each edition gets absorbed.</p>
<p class="tx">Add the pheasant meat to the pan after the rice has been cooking for about 15 minutes, and continue cooking for 5–10 minutes. The rice is ready when the rice grains are almost transparent. Taste it regularly to test for doneness and season to taste. When the rice has just a slight crunch in the middle, remove the pan from the heat, making sure the consistency of the risotto is loose and not cloying. It should move easily. Add the remaining butter and Parmesan and stir through with gusto to break down the starch until the risotto becomes creamy. Cover the pan for no more than 3 minutes while you prepare warmed bowls. Serve with a twist of black pepper.</p>
