    <p class="nonindent"><strong class="calibre13">Sardinia</strong> is an island of great natural beauty. Most people come to enjoy nature, and during the summer months its beaches are full of vacationers.</p>

    <p class="extract">But there are also fascinating places to explore. If you are interested in textiles, there are skillful artisans all over Sardinia worth seeking out. I particularly like the geometric patterns and soft colors woven into navy or gray backgrounds. For those interested in archaeology, the stone edifices known as <em class="calibre4">nuraghi</em>, dating back to before 1000 <span class="small1">B.C.</span>, can be seen throughout the island. Su Nuraxi di Barumini is one of the most important.</p>

    <p class="extract">Not far from the fishing village of <strong class="calibre13">Cabras</strong>, there is the early Christian Church of San Salvatore, which was built on a pagan center of nuragic origins and rebuilt in the sixth century as a church. On the walls are graffiti drawings of animals such as peacocks, panthers, and elephants, along with Arab writings that speak of Muhammad and Allah, reflecting the rich cultural crossroads of Sardinia. The small white pilgrims’ houses, called <em class="calibre4">cumbessias</em>, that surround the small church are used nine days a year, between August and September, to celebrate the feast day of San Salvatore.</p>

    <p class="extract">The Church of the Santissima Trinità of Saccargia in <strong class="calibre13">Codrongianos</strong>, built by Camaldolite monks in 1116, has a black-and-white-striped exterior. Located not far from Sassari, going toward Olbia, it is the most important Romanesque building on the island. One can see sweeping vistas of rolling hills through the double-arched windows; the interior is rather austere, with frescoes of Christ against a blue sky, the apostles and saints around him.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Alghero</strong>, famous for its lobster dish <em class="calibre4">aragosta alla Catalana</em>, is the city in Sardinia with the strongest Spanish influence (Catalan is the official language), having been colonized for a long period of time. In the town of Alghero, craftsmen working in their shops turn coral into delicate pieces of jewelry. Not far from the city is Neptune’s Grotto, an elaborate complex of sea-level stalagmite and stalactite caves, which offers a fun excursion for the whole family.</p>

    <p class="extract">The port of <strong class="calibre13">Arbatax</strong> is known for its “red rocks” in the sea. The red hue of the stone makes a gorgeous natural contrast against the water. Not far, just a short boat trip across the water, is an island known as <strong class="calibre13">L’Isolotto</strong>, where the underwater reefs are spectacular.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Carloforte</strong>, on the island of San Pietro, in the Sulcis Archipelago, is a Genovese enclave, where Ligurian traditions are maintained today. A private island nearby, <strong class="calibre13">Isola Piana</strong>, is largely a nature preserve, uninhabited except for a small village for tourists, Residenza Villamarina. The small island has no cars, mopeds, or bikes—even dogs are prohibited—in order to preserve the rich natural fauna.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
