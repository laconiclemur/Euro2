<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Back to the State Fair</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">It was so much fun going to the Minnesota State Fair that I was determined to do it again. My State Fair pals became a group of like-minded friends, so we conspired to win trips again. It took a little more planning, as we didn’t want to compete against each other. I decided to enter the dairy foods competition the next year and my friends selected other projects. We all made it to the fair again. My cheese soufflé demonstration won a blue ribbon and the Minnesota grand championship in dairy foods. Learning how to make that soufflé required a lot of studying, which seemed to me at the time less like cooking and more like a combination of physics and chemistry.</p>
<p class="psec">The next year I was again contemplating what to demonstrate in the 4-H competition. I’d done food preparation and dairy foods the previous two years. Now what?</p>
<p>One day Isä told me that he had eaten enough soufflés, omelets, and fluffy cakes. He announced that I should make some “real food.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” I replied. “What would that be?”</p>
<p>“Rye bread!”</p>
<p>So the following year, I planned a demonstration making Finnish rye bread. First I had to scale down my mother’s recipe. She would bake eighteen loaves of rye bread per batch—sometimes twice a week, even in the hot summertime.</p>
<p>I loved this bread and can recall its aroma wafting a quarter of a mile to the corner where the big yellow school bus dropped us off every day. We would run the length of the driveway, dump our books by the door, and head straight for the kitchen. When Mummy ordered us not to eat our fill of bread, and said that supper would be ready soon, we’d make a hole in the back of a loaf anyway and pull out soft warm bread. Betty Mae urged us on, saying, “Let’s hurry up and eat it before we get full!”</p>
<p>In preparation for my rye bread demonstration I studied up on yeast, ideal dough temperatures, the relative gluten content in various kinds of flours, and the history of bread baking. I made loaf after loaf of Finnish rye bread and my father was quite happy.</p>

<p class="figcap">Winning the state championship through 4-H introduced me to a wider world of opportunities. This article ran in the <i>Duluth News-Tribune</i>
 shortly after I won the blue ribbon.</p>
</div>
<p>As in past years, I again went through the process of practicing and practicing, kneading bread dough in my mind while working in the hay field, milking cows, and doing regular household chores. I explained the process of making bread to the trees, to the animals, to anything that I thought would listen. The words were so ingrained in my psyche that I could “motor mouth” to anybody about Finnish rye bread.</p>
<p>My rye bread demonstration won not only a trip to the State Fair but also a national grand championship and a trip to the national 4-H congress in Chicago! It was my first time traveling out of state.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Cheese Soufflé</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Sometimes I’d substitute a combination of other cheeses with success in this soufflé. Today the cheese selection is a combination or a singular amount of Gruyère, Swiss, or flavored jack cheese that works well in place of the sharp cheddar. The soufflé can be totally assembled up to 2 hours before baking, but after baking you should be ready to serve it immediately because once it hits cool air it likes to sink.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">Butter for coating the soufflé dish</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons fine dry bread crumbs</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup (½ stick) butter</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1¼ cups milk, heated</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon cayenne</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</p>
<p class="rpil">6 large eggs, separated</p>
<p class="rpill">¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 375°F. Generously butter a 2-quart soufflé dish and dust with the bread crumbs. Shake out any extra crumbs.</p>
<p class="rp">In a 3-quart pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add flour and stir until mixture is smooth. Stir in the milk, cayenne, and salt, and continue to whisk until sauce boils and thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
<p class="rp">Stir in the cheese until blended. Add the egg yolks and stir until the mixture is smooth. Set aside until cooled, but not cold.</p>
<p class="rp">In a clean, dry bowl, with a mixer on high speed, beat egg whites (use whisk attachment if available) with cream of tartar until short, stiff, moist peaks form and the bowl can be held upside down without the whites falling out.</p>
<p class="rp">With a flexible spatula, fold a third of the cheese sauce into whites until well blended. Add remaining sauce and gently fold in just until blended.</p>
<p class="rp">Scrape the batter into the prepared soufflé dish (or dishes). If the dish is more than ¾ full, make a foil collar* and fit it around the top of the dish. Draw a circle on the surface of the soufflé batter with the tip of a knife, about 1 inch in from rim, to help an attractive crown form during baking.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until top is golden to deep brown and cracks look fairly dry. Serve immediately, scooping portions from single soufflé with a large spoon.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 6 servings</p>
<p class="rpn">*To make a foil collar, cut a 15-inch-wide sheet of foil 4 inches longer than circumference of dish; fold lengthwise in thirds. Brush one side of the foil strip generously with melted butter. Wrap the foil around outside of dish so that at least 2 inches of foil extend above the rim. Fold the ends of the buttered foil strip over several times until snug against dish.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Finnish Rye Bread</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This is the bread most often made by Finns in Minnesota. Although my mother made a dozen and a half loaves at a time, I’ve worked the amounts down so that the recipe makes only one loaf. I’ve since also succumbed to quicker methods of mixing, so the directions include making the dough in the food processor as well as the bread machine with no reduction in the quality of the final product.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 package (or 1 tablespoon) active dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup warm water</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup additional water or warm potato water</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon brown sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 to 1½ cups stone-ground rye flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon soft butter</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="rpill">2 cups bread flour</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Combine water or potato water, brown sugar, and 1 cup rye flour to a large mixing bowl. Add yeast mixture and beat well. Stir in butter, salt, and most of the bread flour. Mix until a stiff dough forms. Sprinkle board with remaining ½ cup rye flour and turn dough out onto it. Cover with bowl and let rest for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">Knead the dough by folding it over onto itself over and over again until it is spongy and smooth, using rye flour to ease stickiness. You might not use all of the rye flour. Turn into a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled. Punch down. Shape into a flat round loaf with a hole in the center, or shape into a plain round loaf. Let rise for 1 hour or until doubled. Prick all over with a fork. Bake at 375°F. for 45 to 50 minutes. Brush the loaf with butter while still hot.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 1 loaf</p>
<p class="rpn">To mix dough in food processor, measure all of the dry ingredients (use 1 cup rye flour) into the work bowl of the food processor. Turn motor on and slowly add 1¼ cups water or potato water through the feed tube; process until dough comes together and spins around the bowl, cleaning the bowl. Let rise, shape, and bake as directed above.</p>
<p class="rpn">To mix dough in bread machine, measure all of the ingredients (use 1 cup rye flour) into the work bowl of the machine. Set machine to make “dough.” Check during the mixing cycle; if necessary, add the remaining ½ cup rye flour. Shape, let rise, and bake as directed above.</p>
