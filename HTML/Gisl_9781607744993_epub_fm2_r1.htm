<h1 class="A_head2" id="fm2"><a id="page5"/><span class="dk_blue">A NOTE ON THE RECIPES</span></h1>
<p class="nonindent1"><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">More than anything else,</span></span> Gunnar’s cooking is about a sense of place. It follows that depending on where you live in the world, the ingredients available to you and the conditions in which you are cooking will vary (sometimes widely) from those of Iceland. This is something to embrace, since contemporary Nordic cooking is about celebrating the region in which you live and sourcing from it all that it has to offer. Gunnar is always saying to “cook it until it tastes good and use what you have,” a philosophy to take with you into the kitchen and use as you re-create Gunnar’s recipes in your surroundings.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="ind609a"/>Substitutions based on your resources will make each recipe your own. Examples of ingredients that might be difficult to find outside of Iceland and suggested replacements are noted throughout the book. But before you begin cooking, here are four recommended substitutions for common ingredients: bay leaf for birch; wood chips or dried tree leaves for hay for smoking; salting and rehydrating cod or another firm white fish yourself in place of bacalao; and catfish or another white fish in place of wolf fish. We can also suggest some herb substitutions for items that might be hard to source, such as tender celery leaves for lovage, tarragon for angelica, regular thyme for arctic thyme, and spinach or arugula sprinkled with a little lemon juice for sorrel.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-sec1">Beer vinegar</a> is called for in a number of recipes, and a recipe for it appears. Gunnar almost never uses pepper to season his dishes, as he feels it overwhelms most other ingredients. He replaces the typical seasoning combination of salt and pepper with salt and beer vinegar. But if you have neither the time nor the inclination to make beer vinegar, malt vinegar is a good substitute, or you can use whatever vinegar appeals to you. Vinegar brightens a recipe, and this vibrancy is a benchmark of Gunnar’s cooking.</p>
<p class="indent1">A few ingredients are especially difficult—or even impossible—to source outside of Iceland or other Nordic countries, and these have been replaced in the recipes and discussed in accompanying notes. Calf’s liver in place of reindeer liver is one prominent example, since no matter how resourceful your local butcher is, tracking down reindeer liver is likely beyond his or her talents. Other examples include substituting a readily available herbal tea for Witch’s Brew tea, which is made from a blend of Icelandic herbs, and using a local microbrew in place of an Icelandic-made one.</p>
<p class="indent1">You can always source dairy products, but the cow’s <a id="ind377a"/>milk produced in Iceland typically has a high fat content, which sets it apart from what you find in many parts of the world. For example, the local cow’s milk tastes sweeter and richer than nearly any milk on the planet, and depending on the fat content of the butter or milk you use, you may find you need to adjust the baking times for some recipes.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page6"/>Environmental differences must also be considered when using these recipes. Iceland has extremely low humidity levels, which affect the timing of such techniques as proofing, fermenting, and aging. For example, depending on the everyday humidity level where you live, yeast activation may work faster or slower during fermentation. The best advice on how to deal with differences in environmental conditions is to keep an eye on what you’re making, tasting it every so often if possible, and then give it the go-ahead once it is, in Gunnar’s words, “to your liking.”</p>
<p class="indent1">The recipes include U.S. units of measurement along with standard metric units for ingredients, temperatures, and length equivalencies. In general, teaspoons and tablespoons are used for all ingredient <a id="ind375a"/>measurements of 3½ tablespoons or less, with the exception of some of the more finicky ingredients, such as soy lecithin and xanthan gum, which must be weighed precisely; in those cases, only grams are used. Readers are also advised to purchase a digital scale for measurement accuracy. It might seem like a pricey investment, but the confidence it instills when measuring easily transforms this gadget into a welcome kitchen companion.</p>
<p class="indent1">Kitchen <a id="ind628a"/>tools are another area where you may need to adapt. Whenever possible, alternative techniques are given for tools that may not be in the kitchen of most home cooks. These include a dehydrator, siphon, pressure cooker, and immersion circulator. One frequently used technique is smoking, which is used for everything from cheese to meat to oil to fish. Most of the time, there is no getting around smoking if you want to prepare authentic contemporary Icelandic recipes. But the good news is that smokers are extremely easy to construct using everyday kitchen equipment, such as a tiered steamer or hotel-pan setup. Instructions on <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-eass16">how to assemble a simple smoker</a> are.</p>
<p class="indent1">Finally, the recipes were tested in America in the hope that they would be user-friendly to the home cook in most parts of the world. This means that most of the recipes have been tweaked from their original version to make them kitchen ready, no matter where you live. If despite those tweaks and the information provided in this section you still encounter a stumbling block, write to <a class="hlink" href="mailto://icelandcookbook@gmail.com">icelandcookbook@gmail.com</a>. Your questions and your feedback are both welcome. Most important, remember that embracing the principles of contemporary Nordic cuisine means looking around at the resources available in your region and celebrating them in the same way that Gunnar celebrates the natural resources of Iceland.</p>
