<p class="flush_left_space_after"><strong>Home team</strong> To Rupert, very simply for being the best companion in life and in books, for writing, reading, cooking, adding so many details to this book and standing strong as it took shape. This could never have been done without you. Mum and Dad, the best parents ever, whose unfailing support, encouragement and love of family extends to the Brindisa family and never tires, powering us all on through life. My brother, Mark Lavery, for sowing the seed of the Brindisa tree and always supporting our aspirations. Michele and Moyna Lavery, my two wonderful sisters, for their continuous support, professional tips and their loyalty to me, our foods and restaurants. To Dom and Dani who have accommodated the book project within our home for so long, gracefully accepted my late nights working, welcomed me back from trips abroad and still support this endeavour in every way. And Pepper, our dog, for enjoying cheese rinds and gourmet leftovers so much!</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after"><strong>Book team</strong> Sheila Keating, whose immense experience in the world of food books made this project possible and who kept the path to completion so clear in her mind that I knew we would get there. There is not an adequate word that I know for the amount of patience Sheila is able to muster! To Louise Haines who since the word Go absolutely believed that however long it took me to manage this amongst family and work commitments it would be truly worth it. It <em>is</em> worth it and thank you for having the confidence in the project. Pippa Drummond, whose photography transports the words to another dimension and brings to Spanish foods new colour, space and focus in a totally individual way. The pictures really complete the book. Sam Wolfson, whose vision and design for the book is exactly right: fresh, happy and elegant. It was so much fun working with you. Jerry Sweet for your work on the stunning patterns that complement the pictures, Sanjana Lovekin, for setting the tone with just the right fabrics, plates and bowls and GF Smith, for generously supplying the background papers for the photography. Broo Doherty, my literary agent who set me on this road, way back when: don’t ask how long ago! Rose Prince and Samantha Clark, who encouraged me to take the leap and make this dream a reality.</p>
<p class="flush_left"><strong>Brindisa team</strong> Josep Carbonell for being ever generous and unfailing in his support of this book and for working with Leo Rivera and Nico Modad; without you this collection of recipes would never have been compiled, completed, tested, corrected or enjoyed. All the other chefs and cooks who contributed and tested recipes – Francisco Juan Martínez Lledo, Scott Boden, Esperanza Añonuevo, and Boojum von Friesen – and the shoot team of chefs, pictured below, masterminded by Leo and Eva Andrés. Many thanks too, to Javier García, Antonino Mazzeo, Luis Casado, Elizabeth Mills, Matt Bell; to young Dani Linton for making <em>melindros</em> and <em>tortas ácimas</em> for the photos and the Brindisa suppliers who kindly provided generous amounts of food for the photography.</p>
<p class="indented">The text and spell-checkers: Claire Cousins who tirelessly read and checked the drafts again and again to keep the link with our suppliers and customers totally aligned; Arantxa Monsalve, who checked countless spellings, accents and references for all of Spain’s languages as well as checking the technical accuracy of the food pages; Germán Arroyo who helped immensely on the Spanish meats sections and introduced me to our wonderful chef friend, Ana Barrera. And thanks again to Rupert and Ilaria Ceglie for finessing the cheese chapter.</p>
<p class="indented">Heath Blackford, Alberto Zurdo, Eva, Josep and Ratnesh Bagdai for keeping the Brindisa businesses on the road with immense diligence and care, watching and building, often in my considerable absences of the last few years; and massive appreciation to all Brindisa leaders currently managing the business, its projects and sites, especially Eva, for being the great enabler, taming my chaos with her diligence and method so that I can work, write and care for the family too.</p>
<p class="indented_space_after">To the early team who built the blocks of the first decade on which we now stand: Scott, who still sees us safely through projects, Mark, Rudi von Vollmar, María Cobo Díaz, James Robinson, Emma Ranson, Denis Burke and Martyn Roberton. Through thick and thin we pulled together and worked very very hard. Thank you. Thanks too, to all suppliers, customers and colleagues past and present for your hard work, support and business. You have made and continue to make Brindisa what is it today, and even though method has inevitably taken over from pure impetuous energy as we have expanded, I believe the spirit of the early days remains intact.</p>
<p class="flush_left_space_after"><strong>Friends team</strong> Late friends who longed to see the book, and remain ever present: Rafael Báez Murillo, Montserrat Fruitos and Alex Sarda. Many thanks to Vicky Hayward, my first ‘Spanish food’ friend, who I met in 1990 and who gave me so many leads and ideas in those early days. To Jordi Puigví, who introduced to me to Montserrat, lent me books and made me the best <em>mojitos</em> ever as we tried dishes and talked over food in Catalunya. To Ambrosio Molinos and Asun Gordo, Pilar Sapena and Felipe Gutiérrez de la Vega, Ana Barrera, familia Núñez de Prado and Pepa Salvador, who all let me hang around their kitchens taking notes, asking questions, helping cook and then pestering them for more details to complete the recipes. Those times will be remembered forever. Thanks, too, to all the friends of Brindisa at the Spanish Commercial Embassy who gave me so much encouragement in the very early years.</p>
<p class="flush_left">To anyone I may have left out, who has helped this book come to fruition and supported Brindisa and Brindisa Tapas Kitchens over the years – thank you.</p>
