<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is a moist cake that is good served with whipped cream. The recipe comes from a little book that Carolina Zendrera, my Spanish publisher, gave me, entitled</span> Recetas Tradicionales: La Ermitaña de la Cocina Burguesa del Siglo XX <span class="italic">(</span>Traditional Recipes: The Hermit of the Bourgeois Kitchen of the Twentieth Century<span class="italic">), published by Zendrera Zariquiey in 1999. The recipes are those of Agueda Bienzobas, who cooked for Carolina Zendrera’s grandparents and parents in Catalonia for fifty years. Agueda was born in a village in Navarre in 1907 and went to work in the Martí-Codolars’ kitchen in Barcelona as a young girl. The Martí-Codolars, Zendrera’s grandparents, were an illustrious family involved in shipping. On their farm, they kept rare animals, including an elephant that was donated to Barcelona Zoo. What Agueda learned from the family cook, and what became her repertoire gathered over the years, which her husband wrote down, is a distinctive mix of Spanish and French haute cuisine. A family friend of the Martí-Codolars called her “the hermit” because she spent so much time alone in the kitchen.</span></p>
