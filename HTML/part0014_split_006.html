  <h3 class="h3a">Elisabetta’s Sicilian baked cassata with ricotta</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This recipe was given to me by my friend, Italian food blogger and exceptional pastry cook, Elisabetta Iudica. She just loves to bake and made this lovely Sicilian dessert for me. It is a lighter, less sweet variation of the traditional marzipan cassata; fresh ricotta and chocolate chips fill a delicate sweet pastry. Delicious as an after-dinner dessert or for afternoon tea, or, for me, with a freshly made espresso. Thank you, Elisabetta, for sharing your recipe and for keeping Italian cooking traditions alive and kicking in your food blog, La Mia Kitchenette.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 8</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the pastry</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz/scant 2½ cups ‘00’ flour, sifted, plus extra to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ tsp baking powder</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/generous ½ cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, plus extra to grease</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/¾ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing">icing (confectioners’) sugar, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the filling</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/2 cups fresh ricotta, drained if necessary</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz/1 cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing2">30g/1oz dark chocolate chips</p>

  <p class="para">First make the pastry. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar, add the egg and yolks and work into a smooth dough. Alternatively, put all the ingredients in a food processor and whizz until they come together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge for a couple of hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, to make the filling, combine the ricotta, sugar and chocolate chips, but do not overmix. Cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge until ready to use.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas mark 3. Lightly grease and flour a 20cm/8-inch round loose-bottomed cake tin.</p>

  <p class="para">Take about two-thirds of the pastry, roll out on a lightly floured surface and line the bottom and sides of the prepared tin. Using a fork, prick all over the pastry to prevent bubbles. Fill with the ricotta mixture, smoothing it over. Roll out the remaining pastry and cover the ricotta mixture, flattening it with your hand; seal around the edge with a fork, ensuring there are no gaps; the cake must be flat without a raised border.</p>

  <p class="para1">Bake for 50–60 minutes, until golden all over. Leave to cool before removing from the tin and then leave for at least 2 hours before serving. Dust with icing sugar and serve.</p>
