<p class="image"><a id="page_152"/><a id="page_153"/><img alt="image" src="../images/08fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Once every year I drop everything else and go hunting on the unsheltered, inhospitable islands of the Austevoll archipelago in western Norway. It is a beautiful and exhausting hunt that features no guns and no traps, where we, the hunters, are armed with nothing but nylon stockings and unfashionable company neckties. With these somewhat unorthodox weapons, we wage a battle to conquer one of the bravest and most hardy animals—the wild sheep, a special breed of sheep with large horns and exceptional athletic abilities that thrives under extreme conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The wild sheep are an example of nature’s ability to perform magic—to get something out of almost nothing. They live by themselves, roam around the islands freely, and feed on whatever they can find of heather, grass, and small shrubs. Even in the winter, when the climate can be hostile, to say the least, the sheep stay outside, staring out into the Atlantic—waiting patiently for better times. They are never fed anything <a id="page_156"/>and must subsist on what they can find in their remote territories. When food is scarce, or when snow makes it inaccessible, they head down to the beach to feed on seaweed and kelp.</p>
<p class="indent">The meat of the wild sheep is juicier and better tasting than any meat I have ever experienced—with a rich gamy flavor that bears witness to a life unaffected by modern industrialized agriculture. Even though sheep have been domesticated for several thousand years, and the sheep on Austevoll have owners’ tags attached to their ears, their lives do not differ much from what they were when all sheep were wild. They even shed their own wool, unlike the domesticated sheep that have to be sheared.</p>
<p class="indent">The wild sheep come in contact with humans only once a year, at the annual sheep gathering, or “sheep hunt,” as it is commonly referred to. One day in October, all the people of Austevoll—business executives, teachers, engineers, farmers, and fishermen alike—come together to help each other gather the sheep, count their livestock, and pick out lambs to be slaughtered. It is a great experience, and one I never miss. For a few hours it is man against sheep, in an unarmed standoff that nearly always leads to the victory of man. But the beauty of it is that at times it seems as if the sheep have the upper hand.</p>
<p class="indent">Nowhere is the battle more magnificent than on the island of Fugløy, one of the westernmost islands of the Austevoll archipelago. The 250-acre island faces straight out into the open sea—if you set off going west, the next stop will be North America. There are no trees to give shelter, and hardly any grass—just heather, moss, and rocks. Up until the early 1960s, the island was inhabited by a dozen people, stubbornly insisting on their right to live on the outskirts of civilization. But in 1962 a powerful storm blew all the boathouses into the ocean. When the inhabitants woke up to the sight of nothingness where boats, fishing nets, and lobster pots had been, it was as if their stubbornness had been blown away, too. Shortly thereafter, they started to dismantle their houses and moved to the mainland. The only remaining living beings were one hundred or so wild sheep.</p>
<p class="indent">The first part of the sheep hunt is calm and pleasant. After a temporary enclosure has been set up on the small field on the north side of the island, where the houses used to stand, a group of about thirty of us, men and women, walks across the island in fan formation, making a human wall, pushing the shy sheep over to the relatively flat terrain near the eastern tip of the island. The rams—all sporting majestic, curved horns—are not so easily <a id="page_157"/>intimidated and alternate between trying to scare us away and running to elude capture.</p>
<p class="indent">When all the sheep have gathered in a relatively concentrated area, the real chase begins. A smaller group of young athletic men and women—the runners—approach the sheep from the south side, pushing them north toward a small ridge that will lead them straight into the enclosure. But it is never that easy: Once the sheep start running, it is hard to follow. If one of us lags behind and the sheep are able to find a big enough gap in our human wall, they will make a run for it. Some make a jump for the sea and one of us must wade out to catch them; some use their horns to fight their way out of trouble. There have been episodes where people have been rammed hard in sensitive places.</p>
<p class="indent">After about an hour of running, stumbling, shouting, and cursing, most of the sheep are safely jammed together in the enclosure. Some years we don’t succeed, though, and we are left with fewer than twenty animals. Even in good years, at least a dozen get away. A few even manage to jump the five-foot fence of the enclosure. We don’t even try to go after those. They have earned their right to freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">Exhausted and happy, we break for lunch—appropriately enough, a traditional lamb stew called lamb in cabbage, a miracle of a three-ingredient dish: Lamb, cabbage, and whole black peppercorns are cooked over low heat for several hours, until the cabbage has turned sweet, the flavors of the lamb have doubled or quadrupled in intensity, and the peppercorns have added a wonderfully rich and spicy flavor.</p>
<p class="indent">Reinvigorated by the hearty meal, we set off on the last phase of the adventure. The sheep are counted and those that are going to be returned to nature are tagged. For a few minutes, they seem subdued, even tamed, and the children come over to pat them and see if they recognize any from last year. When they are finally let loose, they greet freedom with an explosion of energy, and after a few giant leaps, they are back on their home turf. It will be another year until they see a human being.</p>
<p class="indent">Those that are destined to the mainland are then subjected to the strangest ritual I have yet come across: On their way down to the waiting boats, their feet are tied together. This is done not with rope or string, but with discarded neckties and nylon stockings. Gently, the proud wild animals are incapacitated by two of the most powerful symbols of modern civilization and conformity.</p>
<p class="indent">A young ram looks up at me. His horns are not yet fully grown but impressive enough. His eyes show neither pleading nor fear, but still stubborn resilience. He is nevertheless a comic sight, for his legs are tied up with a pair of beige nylon stockings. The ewe next to him is sporting a 1980s-style company tie—a gift from the Norwegian Farmers Union.</p>
<p class="indent">At first I assume the ties and stockings were used to symbolize the superiority of the human culture, or to signify that the animals were being taken to civilization as the property of the humans. How strange that anthropologists have not reflected upon this beautiful rite of passage, I thought. Especially when you take into consideration that the people here almost always dress casually; except for weddings and funerals, I have hardly seen an islander wear a tie. But when I ask, my speculative theory falls apart, and the answer is as sensible and down to earth as the people of western Norway: Rope and string would hurt the animals. Nylon stockings and ties—especially cheap company ties made of synthetic materials—are elastic and thus the most comfortable for the animals.</p>

<p class="image"><a id="page_159"/><img alt="image" src="../images/08fig03.jpg"/></p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST-KNOWN TRADITIONAL LAMB STEWS—A HEARTY THREE-INGREDIENT DISH (THE FLOUR AND THE BUTTER ARE JUST EXTRAS TO MAKE IT RICHER, BUT HARDLY NECESSARY).</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindentt"><small><strong>THE STEW IS SERVED WITH THE BLACK PEPPERCORNS AND BONES. THE PEPPERCORNS ARE RELATIVELY MILD AFTER COOKING, AND EATING AT LEAST A FEW OF THEM CAN BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 8 TO 10</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 pounds bone-in lamb shoulder, trimmed of excess fat and cut into approximately 1½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 pounds green cabbage (1½ heads), shredded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 tablespoons black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups cold water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Layer the meat and cabbage in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon of the black peppercorns, the bay leaves, and butter. Sprinkle with the flour and add the water. Cover and slowly bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Cook for 2 hours over low to medium-low heat, until the meat is very tender and the cabbage is soft. If you want the stew to be a bit spicier, add 1 more tablespoon black peppercorns and cook for another 15 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Remove the bay leaves and serve the stew in the pot or a deep serving dish.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">This dish is said to be better every time you reheat it. The nineteenth-century Norwegian cookbook writer Olaug Lauken claimed it was best the seventh time around.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Maybe seven is pushing it a bit, but this is definitely a dish that you can make the day before and reheat right before your guests arrive, or make it ahead and freeze it for later.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Because lamb and cabbage stew is a western Norwegian specialty, I made it the first time for the sheep gatherers on Austevoll, while shooting an episode of <em>New Scandinavian Cooking.</em> I was nervous about whether they would approve of my way of making it. Luckily, they did.</p>

<p class="image"><a id="page_161"/><img alt="image" src="../images/08fig04.jpg"/></p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS A SIMPLE RECIPE THAT MAKES THE MOST OF THE WONDERFUL TASTE OF LAMB. THE BEST THING IS TO USE A BONE-IN LEG OF LAMB; THE MEAT NEAR THE BONE IS ALWAYS TASTIER.</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindentt"><small><strong>ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE A BIT OF CARVING INVOLVED, THIS IS A GREAT DISH TO COOK FOR A DINNER PARTY BECAUSE ONCE IT IS IN THE OVEN, IT PRACTICALLY MAKES ITSELF.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 6-pound leg of lamb</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into approximately 1½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound rutabaga, peeled and cut into approximately 1½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound onions, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 pounds russet potatoes, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into approximately 1½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 plump heads garlic, separated into cloves but not peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup beer (pilsner type), or more as needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup lamb, veal, or chicken stock, or more as needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup sweet honey mustard, preferably Swedish (see <a class="nounder" href="source.html#page_294">Mail-Order Sources</a>), or 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard plus 1 tablespoon honey</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Let the meat stand at room temperature for 2 hours before roasting. (It is easier to get good, even results when the meat is not cold.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place all the vegetables in a roasting pan. Place the garlic cloves in among the vegetables. Pour the beer, stock, and olive oil over the vegetables. Sprinkle with the rosemary and season with salt.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Pat the meat dry with paper towels. Rub it all over with 1 tablespoon salt. If not using honey mustard, combine the Dijon mustard and honey in a small bowl. Rub the leg with the honey mustard or mustard and-honey mixture. Place a meat thermometer, if you have one, in the thickest part of the leg; make sure it does not touch the bone.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the leg of lamb on a rack that will fit over the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on the bottom rack of the oven and set the rack with the lamb over the pan, so the roasting juices will drip down onto the vegetables. Cook for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350°F. Cook for another 1½ hours, or until the meat thermometer (or an instant-read thermometer) reads 145°F. Make sure the vegetables do not dry; if they look dry, add another cup or so of beer or stock.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Let the meat rest, uncovered, on a carving board for at least 30 minutes. Leave the vegetables in the oven to keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">When the meat is ready, transfer the vegetables to a serving platter. I like to carve the meat at the table, but you may choose to carve it in the kitchen; make sure the serving platter is warm (but not hot). The muscle fibers on a leg of lamb run more or less parallel with the bone. For a more tender texture, slice the meat across the muscle fibers. Serve the lamb with the root vegetables; be sure to squeeze the softened garlic out of the skins and spread it on the meat as you eat.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">If you do not want to risk keeping your guests waiting, you can start cooking the lamb early. Leaving the meat to rest in a warm (120°F) oven after it is cooked only makes it more tender, without fear of overcooking it. (If you have a meat thermometer, use it to check the temperature of the roast, or use an instant-read thermometer.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">The ingredients listed here are only a starting point. Use whatever root vegetables are in season. When baked for a long time and soaked in the beer, stock, and the roasting juices from the lamb, they become wonderfully sweet and delicious, and there is no need for a sauce.</p>
<p class="noindentt">This is one of the crew’s favorites from <em>New Scandinavian Cooking</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS A CLASSIC WAY OF PREPARING A LEG OF LAMB. I AM ALWAYS SURPRISED JUST HOW MUCH GARLIC YOU CAN USE WITHOUT ITS BEING OVERPOWERING—IN THIS CASE, ONE WHOLE HEAD PER PERSON. IT IS VITAL THAT THE GARLIC BE RELATIVELY YOUNG, WITH NO TRACE OF GREEN SHOOTS.</strong></small></p>

<p class="noindents">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 6-pound bone-in leg of lamb</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup finely chopped fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 heads of garlic</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the leg of lamb with the salt. In a food processor, combine the rosemary, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice and pulse until you have a smooth puree. Press the rosemary mixture through a metal sieve with the back of a spoon. Place the lamb in a baking dish and pour the marinade over. Let marinate overnight. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours before roasting. (It is easier to get good, even results when the meat is not cold.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">To roast, insert a meat thermometer, if you have one, into the thickest part of the meat; make sure it does not touch the bone. Place the leg of lamb in a roasting pan and roast in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350°F and place the heads of garlic around the meat. Roast for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the meat thermometer (or an instant-read thermometer) registers 145°F. Transfer the meat to a carving board and let rest, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the garlic inside to keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cut the heads of garlic in half with a sharp knife. Carve the meat and place it on a large warm serving platter, along with the garlic. Serve immediately, providing a small spoon for each person to scoop out the roasted garlic.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Fill a large pot with about 2 quarts water and bring to a boil over high heat. Blanch the meat for 2 minutes. Drain and rinse the meat under cold running water; rinse out the pot. (This first step ensures a clearer stock, but it can be skipped, without much compromise of flavor, if you are in a hurry.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Add the vegetable stock to the pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the meat, return to a boil, and skim off the foam that forms on the surface with a large spoon. Add the bay leaf, white peppercorns, dill stalks, and salt. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, skimming the foam or fat from time to time.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Add the fennel and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Remove the meat and fennel with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Strain the stock, discard the solids, and return the stock to the pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until reduced to approximately 2 cups. Add the vinegar and sugar. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water until smooth; make sure there are no lumps. Gradually stir half the cornstarch mixture into the stock and bring to a boil over medium-low heat; if you would like the stock thicker, add more of the cornstarch mixture. Add the meat and fennel, stir in the chopped dill, and cook for about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and more vinegar, if necessary. Serve immediately.</p>
