<p class="author1"><span class="txit">polpette</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My father recalls that on occasion his mother would not feel like cooking a large meal. “Then we would have one of our favorite dishes: freshly fried <span class="txit">polpette</span>.” She would serve them with salad and lots of crusty Italian bread with butter. This was the only time that butter ever appeared at the table.</p>
<p class="indentb">These meatballs may be eaten as a main meal, freshly fried and served with salad and lots of crusty Italian bread with butter, or they may be lightly sautéed and added to the recipe for <a class="nounder" href="ach61.html#page_122">Tucci Ragù Sauce</a>. They are also an important ingredient in <a class="nounder" href="ach93.html#page_181">Drum of Ziti and Great Stuff</a> (<span class="txit">timpano,</span>). Dried bread is an essential ingredient in this recipe. I purchase long, thin loaves of unseeded Italian white bread. Set aside leftover bread for 2 or 3 days out of the wrapper before you plan to prepare these meatballs.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Ten 1-inch thick slices of dry Italian bread</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound ground beef chuck</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 tablespoons finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place 6 slices of the dried bread in a bowl and cover with the warm water. Set aside until the bread softens, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In another bowl, combine the meat, parsley, garlic, egg, Romano cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, using your hands to mix the ingredients. Remove and discard the crust from each slice of bread. Squeeze the water out of the bread, and breaking it into small pieces, add it to the meat. Work the bread into the meat until they are equally combined <a id="page_253"/>and the mixture holds together like a soft dough. Moisten the remaining slices of dried bread and add as needed.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large frying pan set over medium-high heat. Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of the meat mixture. Roll it between the palms of your hands to form a ball about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inches in diameter. (Meatballs that are being prepared for Drum of Ziti should be very small. Use a <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon to scoop out the dough and form it into <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch balls.) Cook one meatball until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. (A meatball that sticks to the pan is not ready to be turned.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Taste the meatball, and if needed, adjust the seasoning of the remaining mixture by adding more garlic, parsley, cheese, and salt and pepper. Proceed to cook the meatballs in small batches. As each batch is completed, remove it to a warmed serving plate. Serve when all the meatballs are cooked.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 4 —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Medium red and full red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Meatballs that will be added to Tucci Ragù Sauce should be slightly undercooked (about 6 minutes), as they will finish cooking in the sauce. Add them during the last half hour of cooking.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Some of the pan juices from cooking the meatballs may be used to flavor the ragù sauce: Discard half of the oil and cooking juices left in the pan. Pour the remaining half of the pan juices into the sauce. Add 2 tablespoons water to the pan and stir with a wooden spoon to remove any meat that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Pour this into the ragù sauce as well.</p>
