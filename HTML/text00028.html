</h1>
<p class="pf">Floodwood is a quiet, innocent town and when I was growing up, there were three general stores, a post office, a couple of filling stations, and a few little “ma and pa” businesses. All three of the general stores carried groceries, some dry goods, and a few hardware and farm supplies. Hill’s Mercantile was the “fanciest” of them and perhaps the most stylish—if anything in Floodwood in the 1930s was stylish. Ylitalo’s was a smaller store and was owned by a family of Finns. We did most of our shopping at the Co-op store, owned by a cooperative—again, mostly Finns. The Co-op had a garage, too, that sold Fords. Shipley’s garage sold Chevrolets. It was a small town, and we knew what we could get where. I could identify which store things came from by the smell of the stuff in the shopping bag. Each store was unique.</p>
<p>Across the street from Hill’s was the First State Bank, a neat block of a building with windows you could not see into. Tillie and Jack Rosendahl Sr. owned the bank. I was later offered a “good paying” job at the bank after graduating from high school but turned it down, much to my parents’ regret, because I planned to go to the University of Minnesota. It seems nobody expected a farm girl whose parents lacked “deep pockets” to have such highfalutin ideas.</p>
<p>I was awarded a one-hundred-dollar scholarship from the University of Minnesota Duluth that would be renewed each of the four years I attended and that covered my tuition and fees. I worked three jobs on campus to pay for my room and board.</p>
<p>Isä always did all of the shopping in Floodwood, so Mummy kept a slip of paper on which she wrote things that were needed and for Isä to buy on his next trip into town. I remember the time when we had a plugged-up sewer pipe and Mummy wrote on the slip “sewer diggers,” as she didn’t know what to call the tool you’d use to clean out the sewer. Isä came home with a pair of tweezers. He hadn’t been able to figure out what she had written on the slip. He had consulted with several clerks at the store, trying to make out what she had written. The best they could figure out is that she had written “sliver diggers,” and so he came home with the tweezers.</p>
<p>Ylitalo’s store was the closest to the school. We had an hour break for lunch, and often I was assigned the duty of buying something that we needed at home. One day I needed to buy myself a yellow pencil. I noticed that the pencils were marked “2 for 5 cents” so I asked the clerk, “How much is one pencil?” The answer was “three cents.” “Well,” I replied, “I’ll take the two-cent one.” I guess I was cheap even in the first grade. My mother entered this exchange in a “bright sayings” contest she heard about on the radio and won a five-pound tub of “Lan-o-Sheen” soap. I can’t remember if I got the pencil for two or three cents.</p>
<p>Main Street in Floodwood stretched from Ylitalo’s store to Hill’s Mercantile. Across the corner from Ylitalo’s was the pool hall—a place to be avoided. Then came the post office, where we had to go to pick up mail and our newspaper.</p>
<p>How the Bible Chapel earned a place on Main Street was never disclosed. It was the church of bible-thumping preachers and summertime “revivals.” Across from the Bible Chapel was Koskela’s Café. Sam Koskela made sandwiches, simmered soup, and offered short-order breakfasts and burgers. It was a hangout for farmers. The story goes that somebody entered the café one morning and asked Sam what kind of pie he had that day. His response, “I have two kinds of pie, socklat cake, and donuts!”</p>
<p>Just past Wester’s garage was the Rexall drugstore where we filled prescriptions and bought cough medicine, cosmetics, combs, and other sundries. It was a favorite gathering place for schoolkids. On the right as you entered was a long counter with stools, and from the fountain they served root beer floats and sundaes of all kinds. The air had the smell of chemicals and perfume. The sundaes were made with ice cream from the Floodwood Creamery—the same place that picked up the milk from our farm every day.</p>
<p>When it came to shopping for clothes, it was always best to wait until we took the long trip to Duluth, where you could find anything you wanted or needed. I’d shop at Three Sisters on Superior Street, or Freimuth’s or Oreck’s or even Glass Block. But shopping trips like that were few and far between.</p>
<p>One year, when I was around thirteen, the end-of-the-school-year picnic was coming up and I needed a bathing suit. The picnic was scheduled to be held at the beach in the community park situated on the Floodwood River bank (sometimes called the BAB). I searched all of the stores in Floodwood for a bathing suit, without any luck. In a last-ditch effort, I tried Rahja’s clothing store, even though they sold mainly men’s stuff. Old Man Rahja held up a pair of men’s swimming trunks and declared, “Sorry, I don’t have any women’s bathing suits, but you could wear tis and a prassiere,” he said in his heavy Finnish accent, rolling the <i>r</i>
’s. Humiliated, I left the store as fast as I could. Mummy said, “He was only trying to be helpful!”</p>
<p>Highway 2 went diagonally just on the outskirts of town. That’s where the gas stations were and a small wayside café called Larson’s that served passersby and Saturday night drunks. When I turned sixteen I got a weekend job as a waitress at the café. A long counter separated me from the stools where inebriated old men would slobber over their coffee cups and call out for more—calling me unsavory names as well. The smell of deep-fried potatoes, mixed with the men’s alcohol-soaked breath, cigarettes, burned coffee, the scream of the jukebox, and the chill of the evening made me realize this wasn’t a career for me.</p>
<p>Then, there was Two-Buck Millie who loved to entertain gentlemen who probably were not so gentle. They would call to her from across Main Street and she would respond either with an invitation or with “Got the rag on, honey, but call me next week and I’ll show you a good time.”</p>
<p>Yes, I grew up in a quiet, innocent town.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Sam’s Socklat Cake</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This is a simple chocolate cake made with Hershey’s cocoa—a rare treat for farmers who dropped into Sam Koskela’s café, which they did more for the conversation than for the coffee and a treat. Sam’s wife baked a fresh cake each morning in a large, rectangular pan, and she would spread it with her own homemade fudge frosting. When we made this cake at home we called it “boiling water” chocolate cake. Others call it “one-bowl chocolate cake.”</p>
