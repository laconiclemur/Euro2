<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Batter-coated and deep-fried squid rings called <em>calamares a la romana</em> are typical around Spain, especially in cheap bars, where they tend to be overbreaded and soggy. A much better way to fry good squid is with this coastal Andalusian method, which gives them just a light coating of flour. Here you taste not fried batter, but the squid. Given a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon, they make a quick and divine tapa.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2¼ POUNDS/1 KG SMALL OR MEDIUM SQUID (CALAMARI)</li>
<li>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR FOR DREDGING</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>MILD OLIVE OIL OR SUNFLOWER OIL FOR DEEP-FRYING</li>
<li>1 LEMON, CUT INTO WEDGES</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Clean the squid following the directions on <a href="254-chapter190.html#page_342">page 342</a>. Cut the smaller ones in half, and medium-size ones into ½&gt;-inch-/1.25-cm-wide rings. There should be about 18 ounces to 1¼ pounds/510 to 570 g of cleaned squid.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a bowl, season the flour with salt and blend with your fingers.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Preheat the oven to 200°F/95°C.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a deep skillet or sauté pan, heat at least 1 inch/2.5 cm of olive oil to 375°F/190°C. (The oil is the right temperature when a large cube of fresh bread dropped into it browns in about 60 seconds.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Working in small batches that don’t crowd the pan or bring the temperature of the oil below 350°F/180°C, flour about one third or one fourth of the squid, shake off any excess flour, and gently lower them into the oil with tongs. Fry until golden and tender, 1 to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of the squid.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Remove with a slotted spoon, and place on absorbent paper towels to drain. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm until all of the squid has been fried.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Flour and fry the remaining squid, being sure that the oil has returned to 350°F/180°C before adding the next batch.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">8.</span> Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side to squeeze over the top as desired.</p>
