<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the pastry dough, lightly grease a 7-inch loose-bottomed tart pan that is 1 inch deep. Beat together the butter, orange zest, salt, confectioner’s sugar, ground almonds and egg in a large bowl, using an electric mixer, until light and fluffy. Fold in the flour to form a dough. (Try not to overwork the dough; it is ready as soon as it comes together.) Wrap it in plastic wrap and chill 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Roll out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper until it is ⅛ inch thick, then use it to line the bottom and the side of the prepared pan, pressing it into the side without overstretching the dough. Trim off any excess dough, prick the bottom with a fork and chill 30 minutes to prevent the dough shrinking during baking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat the oven to 350°F. Line the dough with parchment paper and baking beans. Bake 6 minutes, then turn the oven down to 315°F. Remove the beans and parchment paper, then return the pan to the oven and bake the pastry 3 to 4 minutes longer until it is baked through and light golden brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> To make the filling, soak the gelatin leaves in a bowl of cold water about 5 minutes until they are soft, then squeeze out the water. Pour the orange juice into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the soft gelatin, then add the star anise. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and leave the orange juice to infuse 1 hour in a warm place. You don’t want the gelatin to set.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> After 50 minutes, beat the eggs with the sugar, using an electric mixer, 3 to 4 minutes until the mixture is pale and thickened. Beat in the butter, a little at a time, then remove the star anise and whisk in the orange juice mixture. (Blitz in a blender if you prefer a smooth filling.) Pour into the baked pastry case and chill at least 2 hours until it is set.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Meanwhile, make the candied orange zest. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the orange zest in a small saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil, then remove the pan from the heat and drain and refresh the zest in cold water. Drain again and repeat the entire process once more. Return the zest to the pan and add the sugar and 3 tablespoons water, then bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil 4 to 5 minutes until the zest becomes transparent, then remove the pan from the heat and leave the zest to cool in the syrup. Strain the zest, discarding the syrup, then spread it out on the prepared baking sheet. Remove the tart from the tart pan and decorate with the candied zest.</p>
