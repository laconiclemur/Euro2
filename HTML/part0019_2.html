<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001464">Everyone is familiar with Manchego now, but the Basque cheese Idiazabal is less well known – though you can find it in good cheesemongers, delis and food markets. Like Manchego, it is unpasteurized and made from sheep’s milk and traditional (animal) rennet. Unlike Manchego, the rind is edible. The most famous type of Idiazabal is smoked and pale yellow in colour, but it is also available unsmoked, and this is the version I prefer. It has a creamy, elegant taste and a different texture depending on how long it is aged: you can choose between 18 months, 12 months and 8 months. I’ve seen how it’s made, and the process really couldn’t be more simple. Legend has it that the method was discovered by chance hundreds of years ago, when milk was transported in animal-skin bags, causing the formation of curds. The technique of smoking was also a happy accident apparently, the result of a stored Idiazabal being caught in a house fire that was, luckily, extinguished. For whatever reason, after the cheese was rescued from its shelf someone opened it and tasted it, and discovered that it was delicious!</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001465">The classic Basque way to eat Idiazabal is with walnuts and honey – like the <em class="calibre9">cuajada</em> <a href="part0194.html#pg262" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>. You can eat it as a light starter or snack, or as a cheese course after dinner. Sometimes, if my father is tired, or eating late, he will sit down at the table and use a small knife to cut pieces of cheese on to his plate, then he’ll crack a walnut and that’s his dinner. You can also pop a slice of the cheese into your <em class="calibre9">bocadillo</em> (sandwich).</p>
