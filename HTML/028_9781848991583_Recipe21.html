<p class="normal"><b>In my first book, the French Brasserie Cookbook, I included a recipe for a classic duck rillettes, but in this book I wanted to bring a different and more modern character to this popular dish by replacing the herbs with spices, including star anise. It brings an exotic, yet delicate, scent that goes perfectly with the pork. Use the whole spice rather than ground, because the latter just doesn’t have the same depth of flavor.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes, plus 6 to 12 hours marinating and at least 24 hours chilling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 4 hours</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 pounds 10 ounces boneless Boston butt, diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup sea salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 teaspoons coriander seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 star anise</p>
<p class="acktxt">6⅔ cups goose fat</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 2 cilantro sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">toast or warm crusty bread, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the pork, salt, half the coriander seeds and 1 star anise in a large bowl and season with pepper. Turn everything until combined, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to marinate in the refrigerator 6 to 12 hours. The longer you leave the pork to marinate, the better the flavor will be.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> After the pork has marinated, heat the oven to 275°F. Rinse the marinade off the pork, reserving the star anise, then pat the pork dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Melt the goose fat in a large Dutch oven over low heat. Add the pork and turn until it is well coated, then transfer the pot to the oven and cook, uncovered, 4 hours, or until the meat falls apart when prodded with a fork. Strain the pork through a fine strainer, then put it into a bowl, leaving the fat to one side. Shred the pork using two forks, then add about ½ cup of the cooking fat to moisten.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Transfer the shredded pork to a sealable jar or small earthenware dish and press down lightly. Pour enough of the cooking fat over the top to cover the pork and seal it, then add the reserved star anise and scatter with the remaining coriander seeds and cilantro leaves. (Any remaining goose fat can be put in a jar and kept for other uses, such as roasting potatoes.) Cover the jar or dish with a lid or parchment paper and chill at least 24 hours before serving to let the flavors mingle. Serve the rillettes with warm crusty bread.</p>
