<p class="noindentb">My mother’s father maintained a large vegetable garden. Consequently my grandmother would experiment with different ways to prepare the harvest. When eggplant were in season she would pickle some of them and others she would use in recipes similar to this one. In this dish the vegetables are sautéed individually before being baked together in a casserole. This is done to maintain the distinct flavor of each vegetable.</p>
