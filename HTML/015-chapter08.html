In the region’s marketplaces all foods change from month to month, but vegetables are a kaleidoscope of the passing year</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Spring brings every imaginable shade of green, accented with delicate browns and whites. There are asparagus, wild nettle, peas, artichokes, dandelion, fava beans, new garlic, wild mushrooms, and lettuces of every description</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Colors strengthen with summer, turning primary and sharp: eggplant; tomatoes; peppers in yellow, red and green; dark green lettuces; green beans; broccoli; onions of red, gold and white; carrots; celery; herbs; and zucchini with its sun-yellow flowers intact</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Autumn moves across the spectrum to golds and purples: huge cabbages in purple and green; dark spinach, chard and chicories; brown porcini; purple beets and long-leafed black cabbage. Squashes come in yellow, orange and brown. Chestnuts look like mahogany nuggets next to russet-and-cream-striped borlotti beans</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Winter cools to maroons, whites, and the icy greens of fennel, cauliflower, leeks, potatoes, braided garlic, kale, dried beans, truffles, and olives. Radicchio appears as long leaves, compact heads, or large roses</span>.</p>
<a id="page320"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Those forms of radicchio are among Emilia-Romagna’s favorite vegetables, along with other tart greens, both wild and cultivated, to use for salads, grilling and sautéing. They are joined by sweet fennel, wild mushrooms, zucchini, cauliflower, beets, tomatoes, potatoes, colorful peppers, and onions, which serve not only as an ingredient but stand on their own as first courses and side dishes. Leafy chard, sweet squashes, cabbage, eggplant, asparagus and green beans are also especially popular</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Many of these vegetables are included in this chapter, which offers the simplest recipes in this book. They are purposely so—these are side dishes</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Italian vegetable recipes usually fall into one of two categories. There are dishes that are complex and assertive, standing on their own as first courses or antipasti. You will find them in the “The Antipasto Course” and in “Risotto, Soup, and Vegetable First Courses.” Then there are dishes of more subtle or less complicated structure, meant to complement and bring out the best of poultry, seafoods, and meats. These are the side dishes you will discover in the following pages. Sometimes the dividing line blurs between a vegetable side dish and a vegetable first course. A number of the dishes collected here could happily be enjoyed on their own, but generally these are best as accompaniments to other foods</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">This selection of recipes shares the wealth found in Emilia-Romagna’s back gardens and bustling farms. Vegetables are precious, a link to the earth and to Italy’s agricultural past that almost everyone I know there does not want to lose. Even if it means a tiny patch of earth behind a city apartment building, many of the people of Emilia-Romagna still grow their own vegetables. A corporate executive boasts of his spinach harvest, and of the green pasta his mother still makes with it. The mechanic who fills my car in a gas station outside of Ravenna tells me how he preserves his peppers each year, and how the family has Sunday dinner in his garden as soon as the weather turns warm</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The wisdom accumulated from centuries of cooking goes into preparing the precious produce. Vegetables are usually cooked in one of three ways. Boiling accents their pure, fresh flavors. Cooking them in any number of variations on the sauté/braise theme enlivens, mellows, or</span>  <a id="page321"/><span class="italic">broadens their character. Baking and grilling add the dimension of caramelization and concentrated flavors</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">I prefer steaming to boiling. This is where my American taste supercedes Italian tradition. Also I like my vegetables a little less cooked than my Italian relatives do. These recipes reflect those preferences</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Sautéing and braising do splendid things to vegetables. Browning onion in a little olive oil before sautéing cooked spinach, or another precooked vegetable, is a basic expression of the technique. Raw vegetables sautéed until cooked take on even more complex character—for example, green beans browned with onion and simmered in stock, with mortadella as their flavoring</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Build on the sautéing idea by adding herbs, tomatoes, and other aromatics. Small amounts of prosciutto, pancetta, or salt pork impart even more dimension to a dish</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Yes, there is fat, but usually in small quantities. Sautéing maximizes the fat’s usefulness and flavor, giving far more depth and character than is had by merely dabbing butter or margarine on boiled vegetables</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Grilling is another example of small amounts of fat producing big results. Rubbing vegetables with a little olive oil before grilling ensures browning and deep caramelized flavors. Baking concentrates flavors with no fat at all</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In this collection of recipes from Emilia-Romagna, a middle ground is struck in the quantity of oils and fats. I have striven to keep the flavors authentic while cutting back on the generous amounts of fat traditional in many of Emilia-Romagna’s dishes. If you wish to decrease the quantities even further, most can be cut in half. The dishes will change, but they will still make fine eating</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">M<span class="italic">ay in Romagna means new green fava beans. Their grass-colored skins are stretched so taut over the plump beans, they squeak as you pick them out of their cottony pods. Along with the fava, May brings young sheep cheeses (pecorino) from hillside herds. Pairing these green and white symbols of spring goes back further than most Romagnoli can remember. Etruscan shepherds probably rested in Romagna’s mountains, eating raw favas and new sheep cheese with coarse mountain bread</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In May and June, much of Italy shares this fondness for favas and pecorino. Restaurants usually offer the combination as a cheese course after the meat dish. But home cooks, especially in the country, still make it a meal unto itself</span>.</p>

Set out the cheese several hours ahead. The favas are best at room temperature</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> This is finger food. Set out the unshelled fava beans in a basket and the cheese on a board. Arrange the sliced bread in another basket. Set plates for everyone. Invite diners to shell their favas, eating the beans raw, and to help themselves to chunks of cheese and bread. Leisurely nibbling is the pleasure of this dish. Some like cheese and favas together, with bread as the chaser. Others eat cheese and bread with the occasional bean. Pepper is sprinkled on the beans and cheese according to individual taste. Romagnoli near the Tuscan border share Tuscany’s penchant for drizzles of olive oil over the beans and cheese. Try it as a variation on the theme.</p>
<div class="bibliography"><p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span></span> <span class="bold">Wine:</span> In Romagna a young red Sangiovese di Romagna is right with this combination—a simple local wine for simple local food. Other possibilities are a <a id="page324"/>young white Vernaccia di San Gimignano of Tuscany, Sardinia’s young Rosé di Alghero, or a young red Cabernet Franc from the Friuli region’s Collio Goriziano.</p>

You can find them in cheese shops and specialty food stores. They are <span class="italic">not</span> grating cheeses like pecorino Romano. These are younger and moister cheeses, with round, tangy flavors. The cheeses will be firm but not hard, sliceable, and good to eat on their own. Taste whatever is available in your area to decide on the ones you like best.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Finding the Fava</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Fava beans are also known as broad beans, horse beans, Windsor beans, or shell beans. They appear in different parts of the United States at different times from March to July. Depending upon your locale, favas may be as common as the green bean, or may be found only in specialty food stores and markets specializing in foods from Mediterranean countries. Look for bright green unblemished pods with no signs of wilting or withering. The amount of favas called for in a recipe may seem excessive, but much of the weight comes from the bean’s thick pods.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">The Shop of Nuta</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Ferrara’s Jewish community began growing into one of Renaissance Italy’s largest in 1275, when the ruling Este family guaranteed protection to the region’s Jews in a time of rising anti-Semitism. By the second half of the 16th century, Ferrara had become a major Jewish center, opening its gates to Jews from Germany and those escaping the Spanish Inquisition. Today the community is diminished, but its traditions and foods are still part of the city.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">One element still spoken of with longing is the shop of Nuta. Before World War II Nuta Ascoli kept a food shop and rooming house in the Jewish quarter. Caviar from Po River sturgeon was among Nuta’s specialties. Certainly caviar is an unlikely food for Italy, but evidently it was one that Ferrara had quite a reputation for producing. She also made preserved mushrooms, turkey soup with <span class="italic">farro</span> grain, Passover cookies and her own extraordinary delicious renditions of goose prosciutto and salami. My very first meal in Ferrara began with a platter of thinly sliced goose-breast prosciutto prepared in Nuta’s manner. It was moist, sweet and wonderfully rich. I was told that for centuries Jewish cooks had preserved goose as the rest of Italy preserved the pig. Every November Nuta had continued this tradition, rubbing fresh goose breast with salt, pepper and cloves. The meat cured and dried until April, when it was eaten in celebration of Passover. Nuta is gone now, but the Italian-Jewish tradition of curing goose continues.</p>

These are so slender that peeling is unnecessary; just rinse the stalks and tips well. Have a large bowl of ice water handy. If you own a special asparagus cooker, cook the asparagus in it 3 to 5 minutes, or until the stalks are just turning tender (test by piercing with a paring knife). They should still be a little crunchy. Lacking an asparagus cooker, half-fill a large skillet with water. Bring the water to a fierce boil. Making sure all the asparagus tips are pointing in the same direction, spread the stalks out in the boiling water with the aid of two wooden spatulas. Boil over high heat, uncovered, 3 to 5 minutes, or until a stalk is crisp-tender when pierced with a knife. They should still be a little crunchy. Using the two spatulas to scoop under the stalks, quickly lift the asparagus from the pan and immerse them in the ice water. This stops the cooking. After about 10 minutes remove them from the ice water and drain well.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">G<span class="italic">rill it, fry it, sauté it, or roast it—polenta takes to all these methods. As an accompaniment, it absorbs meat juices and seasonings, while at the same time it brings to dishes the soft, gentle flavor of corn. Layer polenta as you would pasta in lasagne. Bake it with braised vegetables. Or layer it with nuts, fresh cheese, raisins, and honey. Even though the people of Emilia eat more polenta than do the Romagnoli, every part of Emilia-Romagna has its favorites, and every family has its own renditions</span>.</p>

It is a revelation for those who hate the tedium of stirring 30 or 40 minutes, as the stiff porridge fights you every step of the way.

Just make sure the bowl is covered and sealed with foil. Stir every so often</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Polenta:</span> Fill a 6-quart pot three-quarters full of water, and bring it to a strong bubble over high heat. Meanwhile, fill a kettle with the 10½ cups water, and set it to boil over high heat. Have at hand a large stainless steel bowl, a whisk, and a large heatproof glass measuring cup. Measure the salt into the bowl. Have the cornmeal in another bowl, ready to pour. When the kettle comes to a boil, pour the water into the large bowl. Using the whisk, stir the water into a whirlpool as you slowly pour in the cornmeal. Keep stirring in the same direction until the cornmeal is completely blended in and there are no lumps.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cover the bowl with foil, sealing its edges securely. Set the bowl over the bubbling water in the 6-quart pot. Check that the bowl does not touch the water. If necessary, ladle off a little of the water. Cook 1½ hours, keeping the water bubbling <a id="page353"/>at a moderate rate over medium heat. Three or four times during the cooking, use a rubber spatula to stir the polenta, scooping down to the bottom of the bowl to check for sticking. Do not worry if a little sticks to the bowl’s surface. Reseal the foil after each stirring. After 1½ hours, the polenta with be thick, smooth, and have no suggestion of rawness in its taste. Use it immediately, or treat it in any of the following ways.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">The Polenta Eaters</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">For many in Emilia-Romagna, it took post—World War II affluence to finally banish polenta as the mainstay of their diet. Since the early 1700s polenta and beans had nourished peasants and laborers, especially in Emilia. The corn was brought from the New World and flourished on the Po River plain. Corn was cheap and plentiful when wheat was expensive and scarce. Before corn arrived in Italy from the Americas, thick porridges of water and ground grain were the food of laborers, foot soldiers, and farm workers. Buckwheat was popular along the Swiss/Italian border. The Romans ground dried beans and ancient strains of wheat and millet. So when cornmeal came upon the scene, its niche was already established. For many, it replaced wheat. Lamentably, corn lacked many of wheat’s nutrients, and pellagra, a disease caused by niacin deficiency, became a major problem among polenta eaters. Polenta is so identified with northern Italy that southerners disparagingly call northerners <span class="italic">mangiapolenta</span>, “polenta eaters.”</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">The Old Way: Sweet Polenta</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Until 40 or 50 years ago, polenta cooked with milk instead of water made a one-dish supper for mountain families. Slices of cooled polenta were arranged in layers in a shallow casserole. Each layer was spread with fresh ricotta and generous sprinklings of raisins and walnuts or almonds, then seasoned with cinnamon and generous drizzles of honey. Once the casserole was full, it was set to bake on the hearth in the embers, away from the hottest part of the fire. Although perhaps surprising to modern sensibilities, slivers of homemade lard were used to enrich the casserole. Where affluence took hold, butter replaced the lard and sugar stood in for honey, and more often meat dishes took the place of the cornmeal-based casserole. Then the polenta went from a main dish to a substantial winter dessert. For centuries cooked-down grape must (Fresh Grape Syrup, Pastas) sweetened polenta casseroles like this one. It is still delicious poured over hot Creamy Polenta and eaten for breakfast.</p>
