<p class="author1"><span class="txit">costicine di maiale</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Often, in advance of a holiday celebration, my mother would get together with my father’s sister Dora and his sister-in-law Teddy to cook. This recipe originated during one of those group cooking sessions. Even though this recipe isn’t classically Italian, these savory spareribs have become a staple in our family, especially at summertime parties.</p>

Place the spareribs in a single layer in a baking dish or in a tightly sealed plastic bag. Pour the sauce over the ribs, turning to coat them with the marinade. Cover and allow to marinate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Cook the ribs, turning frequently, until well browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately or at room temperature.</p>
