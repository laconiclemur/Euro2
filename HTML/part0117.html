<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000214">Traditionally <em class="calibre9">empanadas</em> are rectangular in shape. You can use pretty much anything in the filling: tuna is the classic, but cuttlefish is my favourite. One minute it’s pale, and the next everything turns the deepest black … There is no specific time to eat an <em class="calibre9">empanada</em> – though any leftovers make a good breakfast.</p>

<p class="c_head1" id="sab0000239">To make the crab filling</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0000240">If you are cooking your crab, put it into a pan of cold salted water (so that the crab cooks more gently) and bring to the boil. I normally work to 12 minutes per pound (450g) of crab weight. A crab around 500g will need boiling for 14–15 minutes. Remove from the water and leave to cool before picking the meat.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000241">Put the olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. When hot, add the shallots and leeks and cook until they are really soft but without any colour. Add the bay leaf, brandy and wine. Cook until the alcohol has evaporated, then add the crabmeat, tomato sauce, cayenne pepper and stock. Season, then cook on a very gentle heat for 10–15 minutes, until it is thick enough not to run off a spoon. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="c_head1" id="sab0000242">To make the cuttlefish filling</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0000243">Put 50ml of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. When hot, add the onions and bay leaves and let them caramelize, then add the peppers. Cook until everything is nice and soft.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000244">Put the remaining 40ml of olive oil into a separate pan on a medium-high heat and fry the cuttlefish quickly, so that it gets a little bit of colour.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000245">Add the cuttlefish to the onions and peppers and mix together, then add the cuttlefish skin, ink and guts. Break up with a spoon, making sure the ink comes out. Add the brandy and wine and cook to evaporate the alcohol, then pour in the stock. Cook uncovered for an hour and a half, until the cuttlefish is meltingly tender – like butter. When everything is very thick and reduced, season with salt and pepper and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="c_head1" id="sab0000246"><a id="pg163" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>To make the <em class="calibre9">empanada</em></p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0000247">Preheat the oven to 170–180°C, and lightly grease a 30cm x 20cm baking tray with olive oil.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000248">Roll out 2 pieces of puff pastry until they are about 2mm thick and as large as your baking tray, with 3cm overhang. Transfer one piece of pastry to the tray and prick all over with a fork. Spread the cooled crab or cuttlefish mix over the pastry – the filling should not be too thick, not more than 1cm. Cover with the other piece of pastry. Seal the pastry by folding the edge over on itself, like a huge oblong raviolo, and make a hole in the middle of the <em class="calibre9">empanada</em> to let out the steam. Roll out any spare bits of pastry and use as decoration for the top of the <em class="calibre9">empanada</em>. Brush with the whisked egg and bake for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000249">Cut into squares. Eat warm or cold; it tastes even better the next day and should keep, refrigerated, for up to 3 days.</p>
