<p class="nonindent0">Tempting crisp toast or warm fresh bread, served as a platform for smooth tapenades and warm oozy cheese, the combination is irresistible. Breads are also cunningly used to make a crunchy crumb coating around some of these bite-size treats.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Simply translated, this is a puree of fava beans, but the dish is so much more than that. Imagine sweet, sticky roasted garlic, pureed with fresh rosemary, fava beans, and olive oil, and served hot with crusty bread to spread it on. Simply delicious!</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 whole head garlic</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">leaves from 1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 lb. fresh fava (broad) beans, shelled, and boiled under tender</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the top off the garlic, season the exposed cloves with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, place on a baking sheet, drizzle with a little oil, and bake for 25 minutes, until soft to touch.</p>
<p class="extract">When cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft center from the garlic and add to a blender along with the rosemary, hot fava beans, salt, and pepper. Blend the ingredients to a fine paste while slowly pouring in the olive oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the mixture into a skillet with a splash of water and sauté for 2–3 minutes until heated through and bubbling. Serve in a bowl, drizzled with olive oil, with crusty bread to spread it on.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The Italians are renowned for their bruschetta, which is a simple tomato salad on toasted bread that has been rubbed with garlic and olive oil. The Spanish do it differently and, in my opinion, with more flair. The Spanish treat the bread the same, but when it comes to the tomatoes they literally squish really ripe fresh tomatoes into the bread.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 slices dense rustic bread</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, halved</p>
<p class="hanging">2 large, vine-ripened tomatoes, as ripe as possible, halved</p>
<p class="hanging">5 tbsp. really good extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat a griddle pan until really hot. Place the bread slices in the pan and turn after 1 minute to lightly char on both sides.</p>
<p class="extract">While the toast is still hot, rub each slice with the cut side of a clove garlic, then the cut side of a tomato, really squishing the seeds into the toasted surface.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve on a platter, drizzled with the olive oil, and sprinkled with salt and pepper.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Olive tapenade is delicious, but the addition of anchovies and capers makes the famous spread multidimensional.</p>
<p class="hanging01">5–6 oz. pitted kalamata olives, drained</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. capers, rinsed and drained</p>
<p class="hanging">squeeze of fresh lemon juice</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. really good olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 can anchovy fillets in oil, drained</p>

<p class="nonindent">Broiled goat cheese and figs on bread will not only become your tapas favorite, but will also make a super lunchtime snack.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 ripe figs, quartered</p>
<p class="hanging">4 slices rustic bread</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">7 oz. goat cheese</p>
<p class="hanging02">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the broiler to high. Place the figs and bread under the broiler, drizzle with olive oil, and cook for 2 minutes until the upper side of the toast is golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Turn toasts over (the figs do not need to be turned) and place goat cheese on top. Grill for another 4 minutes until the goat cheese is browning but still holds its shape.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the toasts on a platter with the figs piled on top and sprinkled with black pepper. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Olives are one of the most common finger foods, but when stuffed, breaded, and deep-fried, they are as far from ordinary as possible.</p>
<p class="hanging01">7 oz. cream cheese, at room temperature</p>
<p class="hanging">3 1/2 oz. (scant 1/2 cup) ricotta cheese, at room temperature</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/2 tsp. lemon zest</p>
<p class="hanging">20 pitted large green olives, rinsed and dried thoroughly</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1 egg</p>
<p class="hanging">vegetable oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="hanging02">sea salt, for serving</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a small bowl, combine the cheeses and lemon zest. Place the cheese mixture into a pastry bag. Pipe the mixture into each olive.</p>
<p class="extract">Put the bread crumbs in a food processor and blitz for about 1 minute until they have a very fine crumb texture.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the flour in a small bowl. Lightly beat the egg in another small bowl, and put the bread crumbs in a third small bowl. Dredge the olives in the flour. Using a slotted spoon, remove the olives and place them in the bowl with the beaten egg. Coat the olives with the egg and transfer them to the bowl of bread crumbs. Coat the olives with the crumbs.</p>
<p class="extract">Fill a deep skillet to half full with vegetable oil and heat to 375°F. Deep-fry the olives for 2–3 minutes, drain on paper towels, put into a serving dish, and sprinkle with sea salt.</p>

<div class="dis_img"><img alt="" src="images/9781416207306_029.jpg"/></div>
<h3 class="section"><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c02_r1.htm#page65">see variations</a></h3>
<p class="nonindent">To make these rillettes (which are similar to a pâté), the duck is slowly cooked in its own fat and then shredded, mixed with some of the duck fat and juices, and allowed to set in a terrine. Normally served with cornichons, we have given these rillettes a Spanish twist and served them with some membrillo (quince paste) and plenty of hot toast.</p>
<p class="hanging01">6 duck legs, meat cut from the bones, skin reserved</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. ground cloves</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hanging">fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup water</p>
<p class="hanging02">5 1/2 oz. membrillo, cut into 4 portions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 250°F. Place all the duck including the bones and skin, in a heavy lidded roasting pan with the salt, pepper, nutmeg, ground cloves, bay leaf, sage, and water. Set the pan in the bottom of the oven to cook for 3 hours until the fat has melted and the meat is falling apart.</p>
<p class="extract">Strain off the liquid fat and juices, saving them in a bowl. Discard the bones, any skin, and the bay leaf. Using forks, finely shred the meat. Check the seasoning, then lightly pack the meat into 4 ramekins or small lidded jars. Pour some of the reserved fat around the meat, making sure the top has a good layer of fat to seal it. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour for the fat to set. Serve chilled, in the ramekins, with thinly sliced toasts and membrillo. They can be kept chilled in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Mackerel and horseradish are a match made in heaven, with the creaminess and heat balancing perfectly. Use a ready-made horseradish sauce if fresh horseradish is unavailable.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the mackerel tartare</p>
<p class="hanging">4 mackerel fillets, skinned and boned (around 14 oz.)</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. capers, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 small shallots, finely diced</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. finely chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. finely chopped fresh ginger</p>
<p class="hanging">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the creamy horseradish</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tsp. grated fresh horseradish</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. sugar</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. salt</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tsp. English mustard</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. malt vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">5 tbsp. whipping cream</p>
<p class="hanging02">rustic bread, sliced thin and toasted, for serving</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pick over the mackerel and remove any small bones with tweezers. Finely dice the fish (into about 1/4–inch pieces). Put in a bowl with the chopped capers, shallots, parsley, ginger, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well, cover, and place in the refrigerator. The citrus juices will partially cure the fish, so allow 1/2 hour for this step. Don’t leave it any longer, as the fish will “cook” too much.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, mix the horseradish well with the sugar, salt, pepper, mustard, and vinegar. Slowly beat in the cream, one tablespoon at a time, so that the mixture does not curdle. Serve the mackerel tartare with a dollop of the creamy horseradish and hot toasts.</p>

<p class="nonindent">These croquettes are small nuggets of rich béchamel sauce that’s been thickened and flavored, left to chill, and then breaded and fried. They are scrumptious little morsels.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 small onion, grated</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">2 oz. Serrano ham, cut into 1/4–inch cubes</p>
<p class="hanging">3 oz. manchego cheese, finely grated</p>
<p class="hanging">2 eggs, beaten with a splash of cold water</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups dried bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging02">vegetable oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="nonindent">Melt butter over medium heat in a large pan. Gently fry the onion until soft. Stir in half the flour and cook another minute. Remove from heat and whisk in milk a little at a time until all the lumps are gone. Return to heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens. Add the nutmeg, salt, and pepper, followed by the ham and cheese. Remove from heat and transfer mixture to a shallow dish. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours, until solid.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the beaten egg, bread crumbs, and remaining flour in three separate shallow bowls. With two spoons, form the croquette mixture into rounded balls about 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Dip each croquette in the flour, then cover in egg, then the bread crumbs. Make sure to cover the croquette thoroughly with all three layers so that the insides of the croquette don’t seep out while cooking. Fill a heavy pan 2 1/2 inches deep with vegetable oil and heat to 375°F. Fry the croquettes in batches of about 3 at a time, turning over once, until golden on both sides; this should take about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately, topped with a sprinkling of sea salt crystals.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Finding a crowd-pleasing vegetarian version of tapas can be quite a feat, but these oozy spinach croquettes are a winner with everyone.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup flour</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup whole milk</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper</p>

Place in a large dish, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours, until set solid.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the beaten egg, bread crumbs, and remaining flour in three separate shallow bowls. With two spoons, form the croquette mixture into ovals by passing the sauce back and forth between the spoons in a rotating motion. Dip each croquette in the flour, then cover in egg, then the bread crumbs. Make sure to cover the croquettes thoroughly with all the layers so that the insides don’t seep out while cooking.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat oil in a deep pan to 375°F. Fry the croquettes in batches of about 3 at a time, until golden; this should take about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Wild mushrooms sautéed with garlic and white wine and finished with truffle oil. Sounds good, but topped with crisply fried quail eggs, it is divine.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">4 quail eggs</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small clove garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">14 oz. mixed wild mushrooms, such as porcini, chanterelles, and matsutakes, cleaned</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. medium-dry white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">4 thick slices sourdough bread, toasted</p>
<p class="hanging02">drizzle of white truffle oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a heavy pan, heat the oil until very hot and the surface is just shimmering. Fry the quail eggs, being careful, as the hot fat will spit, for 1 1/2 minutes until the white is crisped underneath and the yolk is still runny. Place the eggs on paper towels to drain off excess oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Working quickly, melt the butter on high heat in a separate pan, but don’t allow it to burn. Add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds, and then add all the mushrooms, keeping the heat up high so they cook in 2–3 minutes without wilting. For the last 30 seconds, add the wine, allowing it to largely evaporate away. Serve the mushrooms right away on a slice of toasted sourdough bread with a quail egg on top and a drizzle of truffle oil.</p>
