When eggs are mentioned in recipes, they are always chicken’s eggs.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The following information can be found on egg boxes:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Grade, size and number of eggs in the box</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Sell-by date</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Best-before date</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • The advice to “keep refrigerated after purchase”</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The grade (A, B and C) refers to the freshness and intactness of the eggs. Only class A eggs are available for sale to the public.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">
</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The size refers to the weight of individual eggs:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> XL (very large): 73 g and over L (large): 63 g up to under 73 g M (medium): 53 g up to under 63 g</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> S (small): under 53 g</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Sometimes the best-before date is printed on each individual egg.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Freshness test</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The air pocket at the blunt end of an egg increases with the age of the egg because the water contained in the egg evaporates during storage. In addition, the egg white becomes thinner. These aging processes are accelerated when the storage temperature is too high and the humidity is insufficient. This is why eggs should always be stored in the refrigerator.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The floating test</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 1 A fresh egg remains at the bottom. The egg white is firm around the egg yolk and the egg yolk is round.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 2 A 7-day old egg floats slightly upright. The egg white is runnier and less firm.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> 3 A 3-week old egg begins to float. The egg white is watery and the egg yolk is flat.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Separating eggs</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Tap the egg on the edge of the bowl, break the shell open and slide the egg yolk from one shell half to the other, catching the egg white in a bowl placed underneath.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This process is even easier if an egg separator is used. The egg white runs through a groove while the egg yolk remains in the hollow.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Stiffly beaten egg white</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Stiffly beaten egg white is used as a raising agent in many recipes, for example in soufflés, gratins, puddings, custard, cakes and flans.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • The fresher the egg white, the easier it will be to beat it stiffly.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Put the chilled egg white in a clean, fat-free bowl and beat it stiffly using a handheld mixer with a whisk attachment or just an ordinary whisk (any fat in the bowl or small particles of egg yolk will prevent the egg white from stiffening).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Beaten egg white is considered stiff when the cut of a knife remains visible.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • When adding stiffly beaten egg white to other ingredients, do not stir it in but fold it in gently. The air which has been beaten in would escape and the consistency of the food would become too solid.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • If fatty ingredients are add to the beaten egg white, it is important to fold them in very carefully and not stir them in.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Stiffly beaten egg white must be used immediately because it becomes runny if allowed to stand too long.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Important tips:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • If they are not stored properly, eggs are very susceptible to salmonella, which causes food poisoning. This is why eggs should always be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 8°-10 °C/ 46–50 °F.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Use only very fresh eggs which should be no more than 5 days old (read the laying date on the egg!) in recipes which require the use of raw eggs. Keep the prepared dish in the refrig erator and eat within 24 hours.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • If the shell is damaged, the egg should be cooked through before it is eaten.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Curd cheese</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Curd cheese is a fresh cheese (fromage frais or unmatured cheese) made from pasteurised skimmed milk by curdling it with lactic acid.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_169"></div>
