  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">O</span>ne spring evening, I was sitting in the restaurant at the Hotel Albatroz, in Cascais, with a magnificent sunset fading outside. But I barely saw it. What was stealing my attention was the soup. Until then, my fava experience—which I believed to be considerable—had consisted of enjoying them stewed, pickled, deep-fried, or tossed in a pepper-cinnamon sauce. But I had never encountered Portugal’s favorite bean in a chilled soup. This dish, with its bright-green color, refreshing taste, and cool, smooth texture, forever changed my concept of that humble, hard-working bean.</p>

  <p class="extract"><strong><span class="small">ATENÇÃO</span></strong> <img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_150_r1.jpg" /> <em>Fresh fava beans are notoriously seasonal, appearing for only several weeks in spring, but many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean grocery stores sell frozen fava beans. If you use them, there’s no need for blanching, because the skins pop right off. Frozen baby lima beans can work in a pinch and require neither blanching nor peeling.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his soup is from the south of Portugal, where the temperature can hover well over 100 degrees in summer. My friend, chef Ilda Vinagre, whose recipe this is, does something a bit heretical for a Portuguese cook: she prefers to <em>liquefazer,</em> or purée, this in the Spanish manner for a creamier texture. She also likes the taste of red bell pepper instead of the more plebeian green variety. She does maintain one tradition: she slips an ice cube into each bowl to stave off the punishing heat of the day. For something a bit different, I often add cubes of frozen tomato juice or frozen cucumber slices.</p>

  <p class="center"><strong><span class="small">SERVES 6</span></strong></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his is an iconic soup of the Alentejo region, which cuts a huge swath through the middle of Portugal from Spain to the Atlantic. Like many old dishes, it’s a paean to frugality. Traditionally the soup was made by loading a tureen of boiling water with fresh cilantro and hunks of day-old bread. Plenty of eggs were cracked in to poach—an inexpensive way of filling peasant bellies. This elegant take on the classic is made with toasted bread cubes on which the requisite eggs perch, and the broth is a blend of water and chicken stock for a richer taste.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, drop in the garlic, and blanch for 1 minute—this will mellow the garlic’s bite.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">P</span>urslane is a succulent summer herb that grows wild in Portugal, which is why this is a forager’s soup. Traditionally, farmers in the Alentejo, from where this soup originates, have scoured the countryside, looking for edible plants for their dishes. The addition of slices of sheep’s-milk cheese is my twist. Originally, hollowed-out dried cheese rinds were tossed in for extra flavor. I’ve further tweaked the recipe by adding presunto for bass notes and lemon juice for a spark of brightness, but at heart, it’s still a homey dish.</p>

  <p class="indent">For a nod to tradition, ladle the soup over a slice of toasted rustic bread and top it with a poached egg.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his is such a beloved recipe, it’s called the national dish of Portugal. And it has been the cause of plenty of fisticuffs over the years, at least in my neck of the woods. Growing up, every Portuguese kid I knew defended his mother’s <em>caldo verde,</em> insisting it was the best, lest blood be drawn.</p>

  <p class="indent">Traditionally, the soup, from the Minho region, is made with just water, and the onion and potato are dropped in raw to cook as the broth simmers. Adding chicken stock and sautéing the vegetables along with garlic gives the soup more layers of flavor. Also, rather than drizzling olive oil on top, I use the pan drippings from the chouriço to lend smokiness and a bit of color.</p>

  <p class="indent">Custom dictates the soup be served with one—and just one—slice of sausage. Big deal. I’d rather fight than stint on the tasty chouriço.</p>

Use only 6 or 8 slices of chouriço, and, instead of browning them in oil, add them to the broth when you add the collard clippings. To serve, ladle the soup into the bowls, fishing out a slice of chouriço for each. Finish the dish by drizzling each bowl with a swirl of a grassy extra-virgin olive oil.</p>

    <p class="textbox_title"><a id="page75"></a>THE FABLE OF STONE SOUP</p>

    <p class="textbox"><span class="dropcaps">O</span>ne winter’s day, a tired, hungry stranger came into a tiny village near the town of Almeirim in the province of Ribatejo and knocked on a door. A woman with a face like leathery smoked ham cracked it open and peered out.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">“Please, <em>minha senhora,</em>” said the old stranger, holding his hat, “would you have any food to share?”</p>

    <p class="textbox1">The ham-faced woman heaved her huge body against the door, closing it firmly. “No, we’re all poor here, with barely enough for ourselves,” she shouted. “Go away.” Dejected, the stranger went to another house, where, through a window, he saw a sad young man eating a small biscuit. He rapped on the glass.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">“Excuse me, <em>senhor,</em> would you happen to have another biscuit for a hungry traveler?”</p>

    <p class="textbox1">The man simply shook his head and walked away from the window. The stranger went from house to house and met the same fate. Finally, exhausted, he built a fire in the square and pulled a soup kettle from his wagon. Doors began opening, and the townsfolk slowly gathered. Only when he knew all were near did the man reach into his pocket and pull out a stone, which he ceremoniously placed in the kettle.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">“What are you doing?” asked the youngest villager.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">“Making stone soup,” he replied, pouring in a bucket of water from the town well. Some sniggered, thinking the old man a fool. “But it would certainly taste better with a bit of cabbage,” he said.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">An old woman, entranced by his work, hobbled to her house and returned, thrusting a small head of cabbage at him. “Here,” she said, “will this do?”</p>

    <p class="textbox1">“Perfectly,” he said, smiling.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">As he ran down his wish list of ingredients—sausages, pork ribs, potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, bay leaf—the townsfolk, now spellbound, brought them all to him. Slack-jawed, they watched as he ladled out some soup for himself and then filled bowl after bowl held out to him.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">When the kettle was empty, he grabbed his stone, cleaned it off, and dropped it back into his pocket. While the normally taciturn villagers were enjoying each other’s company, the stranger slipped away, only the youngest villager noticing.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>he gourd family is a favorite of the frugal Portuguese, as the fruit can be picked and then kept for months. A curious storage technique, which I discovered during an autumn trip through the vertiginous rural side of the island of Madeira, is to line up the colorful globes on a house’s tiled roof.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is an adaptation of the soup I thoroughly enjoyed while dining with Dirk Niepoort, scion of the Niepoort wine and port family, at his <em>quinta,</em> or estate, in the Alto Douro. It calls for butternut squash, the closest in taste to a Portuguese pumpkin. The spicy seeds are my father’s doing.</p>

  <ol class="arabic">
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Position a rack in the center of the oven and crank up the heat to 400°F.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Toss the squash, onions, garlic, and sage leaves with the oil on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season well with salt and pepper, toss again, and jiggle into an even layer. Roast the vegetables, flipping them occasionally with a spatula, until the squash is very tender, the onions are edged with brown, and the sage has shriveled but not burned, 50 to 70 minutes, depending on how firm the squash is.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Working in batches, scoop the vegetables into a blender or food processor, tip in a ladleful or two of the stock, and whirl until smooth. Scrape the soup into a large bowl. Stir in the rest of the stock and 3 cups of water.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Pour the soup through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan, grinding the solids with the back of a ladle to get every bit of squash. Don’t cheat here—it takes time, but, I assure you, the velvety texture is worth it. Discard the little bit of solids you can’t force through. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, sprinkle in the cumin, and let burble until hot, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper if needed, and stir in the vinegar.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">To serve, ladle the soup into warm bowls and garnish with the spicy pumpkin seeds. Rush to the table.</p>
    </li>
