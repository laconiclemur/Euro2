<h2 class="h2b">ARTICHAUTS A LA BARIGOULE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Artichokes Braised in Olive Oil</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>There is some argument over whether artichokes cooked in this fashion are meant to involve mushrooms, or if indeed the recipe is meant to resemble stuffed mushrooms. An old mushroom recipe</em>, champignons à la Bérigoule <em>where ceps are cooked with white wine, olive oil and anchovies, may explain the confusion. The oldest recipe I found was stuffed with a traditional</em> duxelle <em>mixture which was bound with breadcrumbs and egg, and forced inside the small artichokes. They were then wrapped in bacon and roasted. Others insist they must be grilled, but these days, almost invariably and I think to much better effect, they are braised with no mushrooms in sight</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Whenever I’ve eaten artichokes grilled or roasted they’ve been stringy, but braised as in this recipe, the little vegetables are soft, self-dressing, gloriously coated in olive oil and can be either eaten tepid or hot. One evening when I was cooking a</em> brandade <em>for some friends, I found a small bowlful of these artichokes that I’d cooked a few days earlier. I cut and sautéed them with the remaining carrots and onions until they were golden, and we ate them dipped in thick aïoli as an</em> amuse-bouche.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 small artichokes<br/>
1 large lemon<br/>
1 large carrot, peeled<br/>
1 medium leek, trimmed and washed<br/>
1 white onion, peeled<br/>
4 garlic cloves<br/>
1 bouquet garni (thyme, savory, bay)<br/>
300ml (10fl oz) white wine<br/>
150ml (5fl oz) olive oil<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) white wine vinegar<br/>
½ tsp salt</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">First slice the carrot and leek thickly at an angle, then cut the onion in half and each half into four. Mix these in a saucepan with the garlic, bouquet garni, white wine, olive oil, white wine vinegar and salt. Cut a piece of greaseproof paper slightly larger than your pan and put it over the top.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the outer leaves of the artichokes one by one, then pare the bases until there is no green remaining. Leave the tapering tops of the leaves on as this will stop the heads of the artichokes discolouring. Keep rubbing the artichokes with lemon as you go, and when you have finished each one put it into the wine mixture and make sure it is covered with the greaseproof paper.</p>
<p class="normalaa">When all of the artichokes are thus prepared and in the mix, bring the pan to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes or so until the liquid has all but evaporated and the artichokes can be easily pierced with the tip of a knife. If the artichokes are cooked but you still have too much liquid just lift them out, reduce the liquid and put them back into it. Remove the bouquet garni and serve the dish at any temperature except totally cold.</p>
