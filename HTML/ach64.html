<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_128"/><a id="ach64"/>tomato pesto for pasta or fish</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pesto di pomodoro per pasta o pesce</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">I prepare this recipe only in the summer, when the tomatoes are ripe and flavorful. It is a delectable lunch dish or pasta course served before grilled fish or meat. This pesto may also be served as a type of salsa with freshly grilled fish: Spoon a portion onto a serving plate and top with the fish and some coarsely chopped fresh tomatoes. This pesto may be prepared up to three days in advance; cover and store it in the refrigerator. Return the sauce to room temperature before serving.</p>

With the machine running, add the olive oil in a steady stream. Turn off the machine and scrape down the sides. With the machine running again, gradually add the tomatoes. Process just until the tomatoes have been blended into the other ingredients. Season with pepper and set aside.</p>
