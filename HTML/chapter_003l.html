<h2 class="h2b" id="page94">RATATOUILLE</h2>
<p class="normalla0"><em>The difference between the evocative and descriptive powers of French versus English are never more apparent than when ‘ratatouille’ is translated as ‘vegetable stew’. My first exposure to the cuisine of Provence which I now so love was through this vegetable dish that has everything – incredible flavour, warmth and vibrant colour, and the ability to be served hot or cold, on its own or as an accompaniment. The combination of flavours works with everything from grilled sea bream to a leg of lamb. When you make it, make lots, eat some the next day, or the day after, not out of the fridge but at room temperature with lots of Parmesan on top, or warm it a little and top it with a fried or poached egg. Spread it across a fresh baguette and drench it with good olive oil and you’ve got a glorious, if tricky to eat, ratatouille sandwich, well worth a few stains down the front of your shirt. Ratatouille is not meant to be a sophisticated dish. It should be slowly cooked and when it’s ready the colours are still vibrant but totally merged. Each individual flavour has its head held high, but is more importantly part of a luscious whole</em>.</p>

6 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
5 large tomatoes, cored and chopped<br/>

1 small bunch fresh savory or thyme<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) vegetable oil<br/>
2 large red or yellow peppers, cored, seeded and cut into 4cm (1½ in) chunks<br/>

<p class="normal">Sweat the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 10 minutes without colouring until soft. Add the tomato, orange zest and savory, and cook at a simmer while you sauté the other vegetables.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat a third of the vegetable oil and sauté first the peppers for 5 minutes. Season them and add to the onion, garlic and tomato. Wipe out the pan and do the same, separately, with the aubergine and courgette.</p>
<p class="normala">Simmer everything together gently for 30 minutes or so until the vegetables are completely soft but not dissolving.</p>
<p class="normala">Season to taste with salt, cayenne pepper and sugar.</p>
