<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Rice colored black from the ink of squid or cuttlefish is a specialty of the Empordà region of the Costa Brava. But the ink here does more than offer its dark color. It also gives the rice a tight, almost tinny sea flavor as well. Mercury-colored ink sacks are found beneath the tentacles of cuttlefish and squid; remove them carefully when cleaning—<a href="254-chapter190.html#page_342"><span class="red">see page 342</span></a> for instructions—or ask your fishmonger to do so. Certain Asian and Italian markets sell packets of preserved squid ink, as well as the Spanish specialty stores listed in the Sources, <a href="261-source.html#page_345"><span class="red">page 345</span></a>. They generally come in 4-gram packets (slightly more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> ounce). Two packets are enough for this rice.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Perhaps an even more original twist to this traditional dish than the ink is the addition of pieces of pork ribs to add an almost baroque range of flavors. <em>Allioli-a</em> garlic emulsion—is an obligatory accompaniment.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large cazuela, heavy casserole, Dutch oven, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the shrimp and cook, turning over until pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter. (Remove any stray legs or antennae from the pan and discard.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In the same pan, prepare a sofrito: Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for another 5 minutes. Add the cuttlefish and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Finally, add the tomatoes and 2 pinches of salt, and cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomato has darkened and is pasty, 10 to 15 minutes. Moisten with a spoonful of water if needed to keep it from drying out.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the stock over medium heat. Stir in the ink. Cover the pan and keep hot until ready to add.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><a id="page_146"/><span class="font2">4.</span> Prepare a picada with the garlic, parsley, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the simmering stock, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> When the sofrito is ready, add the pimentón and saffron, stir, and then pour in the stock. Bring to a boil over high heat, add the rice and stir in the picada. Cook uncovered over high heat for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time. Lay the reserved shrimp across the top of the rice, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the rice grains are tender but still have an al dente bite to them.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Remove the rice from the heat and let rest for a few minutes. Serve with the allioli on the side to dollop on the rice as desired.</p>
