<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Flame-haired Loli Flores, who was for many years a chef in Seville, remembers</span> sopeao <span class="italic">from the village of Mairena del Alcor near Seville, where she lived as a child with her mother, siblings, grandparents, and great-grandfather. (The famous Gypsy flamenco singer Antonio Mairena was from there.) It was a one-dish summer meal, served with crusty bread to soak up the creamed tomatoes—the name</span> sopeao <span class="italic">is derived from the word</span> sopear, <span class="italic">meaning “to soak up with bread.” For a big party during the Feria, the Seville spring fair, they made it in a huge deep platter and sometimes added pieces of pigeon and rabbit. They served it with lettuce leaves and followed it with melon or watermelon.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds large ripe tomatoes</p>
<p class="qun">¼ pound (5 slices) crustless firm white bread</p>
<p class="qun">1 green or red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and quartered</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons sherry vinegar or wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 to 6 hard-boiled eggs, quartered or sliced</p>
<p class="qun1">Two 5-ounce cans tuna in oil, drained</p>
<p class="recsum">There is no need to peel the tomatoes. Cut them into quarters and remove the hard little bits at the stem ends.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Dry the bread under the broiler without browning it, turning the slices once. Grind to coarse crumbs in a food processor and transfer to a bowl. Add the bell pepper to the processor and blend to a paste, then add the tomatoes and garlic and blend to a cream. Add the sugar, salt and pepper to taste, the vinegar, and the olive oil and blend again. Return the bread crumbs to the processor and blend briefly just to fold them in. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour onto a wide platter, and arrange the egg quarters or slices and the tuna, broken into pieces, on top.</p>
