 dolci</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">desserts</h2>
<p class="parab1">I have a very sweet tooth and adore puddings and cakes. When I make them, I use traditional methods to try to recapture the tastes of my childhood. I like to create rustic puddings flavoured with sweet spices such as cinnamon.</p>
<p class="parab1">It would be no exaggeration to say that I have spent my whole life working with food. I earned my first wages at the local <em>pasticceria</em>
 , which was owned by the father of a good friend of mine. He was exactly as you would imagine the owner of a cake shop to be, with a chubby, smiling face and a big belly from eating too many of his own cakes. When I went round to my friend’s house, I was always given a job to do – usually skinning almonds. Not the nicest job in the world but it paid good money – enough to fund my trips to the cinema.</p>
<p class="parab1">The almonds were gathered from just outside Minori. Sacks full of them were brought down from the mountains and put outside in the sun to dry. The nuts were cracked and shelled, then given to me to peel – one by one. I was equipped with two buckets of water, one hot and one cold. I had to soak the almonds in the hot water, take them out, peel them and then drop them into the cold. I ate as many as I provided for the shop but a blind eye was turned.</p>
<p class="parab1">It was a wonderful cake shop. When I passed it in the morning, the smell of baking was good enough to stop you in your tracks. Italy still has good <em>pasticcerie</em>
 but the local, seasonal element has disappeared. My friend’s father used fresh eggs, freshly milled flour from the village mill and fruit from local orchards. He baked for the shop every day: all kinds of pastries, local speciality biscuits, sponge cakes, jam tarts, chocolate cake and ice cream. Everyone in the village loved him, and he was often requested to make special cakes for weddings, parties and feasts. People would come in with their own recipes or bring in their own spices to be added to their cakes. He would nod and smile and agree to their wishes, but I knew that he never really stuck to the recipes he was given, and generally added a few spices of his own. He always produced a masterpiece and the ladies of the village adored him for it.</p>
<p class="parab1"><a id="page_182"></a>
 I was very lucky in my choice of friends. One of them, Antonio, had a father who owned a coffee shop in the village. It sold all sorts of things besides coffee, and the house speciality was a beautiful lemon sorbet. He made it from a huge block of ice, plus sugar, lemon juice and zest – nothing else. A big aluminium spoon slowly turned on the ice, mixing in the other ingredients until it was smooth and sweet like a cream. You could smell the lemons from 200 metres away.</p>
<p class="parab1">It was Antonio’s job to zest the lemons and he was always made to do this before he would come and play with me. If I was in need of a playmate, I helped him out. We would sit together grating the lemons for the zest and then squeezing out the juice. Of course, I did have an ulterior motive: his father would give us a big portion of sorbet with honey on top when we were done. I learned to make sorbet from this man. Not long ago, I returned to Italy and went to see him. He is very old now but he remembered me. ‘Gennarino,’ he said (which is what he called me all those years ago; it means little Gennaro), ‘do you remember the lemons?’</p>

 Crostata di Limone</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">Amalfi Lemon Tart</h3>
<p class="para1">This delicious lemon tart is made with puff pastry instead of the traditional shortcrust and the ready-bought variety is absolutely fine (unless you enjoy making your own puff pastry which is quite a lengthy procedure). I normally make this tart with lemons from the Amalfi Coast, which have a wonderful aroma, however, they are not easy to source so get the best unwaxed organic variety that you can find. Simple to prepare, this lemon tart makes a lovely dessert at any time.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Serves 6–8</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">100ml/3½fl oz water</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">zest of 2 Amalfi lemons, cut into julienne (thin strips)</p>
<p class="ingre1">300g/10½oz puff pastry</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">3 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">zest and juice of 2 Amalfi lemons</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz butter, melted, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="ingre">225g/8oz ricotta cheese, sieved</p>
<p class="ingre1">25g/1oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting and rolling</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to fan 190°C/210°F/Gas Mark 6–7.</p>
<p class="para1">To remove the bitterness from the lemon strips, place the water and sugar in a small saucepan over a medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the lemon strips, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Drain, discard the liquid, dry the lemon strips on kitchen paper and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Lightly grease a 25cm/10in loose-bottomed tart tin with a little butter and dust lightly with some flour. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 5mm/¼in. Line the prepared tin making sure it comes slightly above the edge. Line the pastry with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans, dried beans or rice and bake blind for 15 minutes; after 10 minutes, remove the beans and continue to bake until the pastry is golden. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Reduce the oven to fan 130°C/300°F/Gas Mark 2.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the filling, beat the egg yolks and sugar together until light and fluffy and doubled in volume – an electric whisk is best for this. Add the lemon zest and juice and melted butter, and mix well. Stir in the ricotta and sift in the flour. Whisk well to remove any lumps.</p>
<p class="para1">In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiffened, then fold carefully into the ricotta mixture until well incorporated. Pour into the pastry case and bake for 45–50 minutes until set. About 15 minutes before the end of cooking time, arrange the lemon strips over the top and continue to bake.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Gently remove the tart from the tin and transfer to a plate to serve.</p>

 frutta cotta</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">dried fruit compote with rum</h3>
<p class="para1">You can buy a wonderful array of dried fruit in supermarkets and healthfood shops and liven it up with spices and rum. This is so simple to prepare that it is worth making a large batch and storing it in sterilised airtight jars. It will keep for a couple of months. Serve with some mascarpone or whipped cream for a delicious, warming winter dessert.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6–8</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingre">grated zest and juice of 1 orange</p>

<p class="ingre">6 cloves</p>
<p class="ingre">½ tsp fennel seeds</p>
<p class="ingre">½ tsp black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/1lb 2oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">500ml/17fl oz water</p>
<p class="ingre">1kg/2¼lb mixed dried fruit, such as prunes, apricots, figs, raisins, apples, pears and peaches</p>
<p class="ingre1">200ml/7fl oz dark rum</p>
<p class="para1">Put the citrus zest and juice, rosemary, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seeds, peppercorns, sugar and water in a large saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Add the hardest fruit, such as prunes, first and simmer for 3 minutes, then add the rest of the fruit and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the heat and add the rum. Stir well and leave to stand, covered, for at least a day before use. Heat through gently before serving.</p>

 fragole fresche con salsa di fragole</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">fresh strawberries with strawberry sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">For a simple summer dessert with minimum effort but maximum taste, this is ideal. If you like, you can serve it with good-quality vanilla ice cream.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">450g/1lb strawberries, cut into quarters</p>
<p class="ingre">sprigs of fresh mint and icing sugar, to decorate (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">20g/¾oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">75g/3oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">¼ lemon</p>
<p class="ingre1">200g/7oz strawberries, cut in half</p>
<p class="para1">First make the sauce. Put the butter and sugar in a saucepan and place over a gentle heat. Spear the lemon quarter with a fork and use it to stir the butter and sugar until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. Press the lemon with the fork to squeeze out all the juice, then discard it. Stir in the halved strawberries, then remove from the heat and push the mixture through a sieve. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour the sauce on 4 serving plates, then top with the fresh strawberries. Decorate with sprigs of mint and sprinkle with icing sugar, if desired.</p>

 gelato passione</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">limoncello and strawberry ice cream</h3>
<p class="para1">This recipe was devised by my friend Albino Barberis who makes the best ice cream this side of Milan. He came up with the idea when we opened Passione, combining limoncello liqueur, which comes from the Amalfi Coast, with wild strawberries because of my fascination for wild food. The result was outstanding and it has become a firm favourite on our dessert menu. I make it with cultivated strawberries but if you want to treat yourself to wild strawberries, then even better!</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6–8</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">250g/9oz strawberries</p>
<p class="ingre">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingre">65g/2½oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">300ml/½ pint double cream</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint full-fat milk</p>
<p class="ingre">250ml/8fl oz limoncello liqueur</p>
<p class="ingre1">grated zest of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="para1">Put a large plastic container in the freezer ready for the ice cream. Slice half the strawberries quite thinly and set aside. Blend the remaining strawberries in a blender or food processor to a purée. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Beat together the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Put the cream and milk in a saucepan and bring gently to the boil. As it begins to boil, remove from the heat and beat in the egg mixture. Return to a low heat and cook for about 1 minute, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and fold in the sliced and puréed strawberries. Then stir in the limoncello and lemon zest. Remove the container from the freezer and pour in the mixture until it is about three-quarters full (if you have extra mixture, pour it into another plastic container). Leave to cool, then place, uncovered, in the freezer.</p>
<p class="para1">After 30 minutes, remove and stir well, then replace in the freezer. Leave for another 30 minutes and repeat the procedure a few times until the ice cream is frozen. Alternatively, if you have an ice cream machine, churn the ice cream until it thickens, then place in a container in the freezer.</p>

 semifreddo di mandorle e cioccolato bianco</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">semifreddo of almonds and white chocolate</h3>
<p class="para1">Semifreddo is a classic Italian dessert, which is served straight from the freezer but does not set as firm as ice cream. It is ideal for the warmer months and can be made in advance and kept in the freezer until you need it. I have used individual dariole moulds here but you could use one large mould, such as a loaf tin, and serve it sliced.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingre">75g/3oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">75g/3oz white chocolate, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">275ml/9fl oz whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the <em>croccante</em>
 (praline):</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">37g/1⅓oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5⅓oz blanched almonds, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">4½ tbsp water</p>
<p class="para1">First make the <em>croccante</em>
 . Place the sugar in a small, heavy-based pan over a medium heat and stir with a wooden spoon until it begins to caramelise and turn golden brown. At this stage, add the almonds and water and mix well. Remove from the heat, pour the mixture on to a lightly oiled baking tray or marble board and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy and increased in volume. Break up the cooled <em>croccante</em>
 quite roughly and add ⅔of it to the egg mixture, together with the white chocolate. Set the remaining ⅓of the <em>croccante</em>
 aside, to decorate.</p>
<p class="para1">In a separate bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks, then fold it into the mixture. Line six 9cm/3½in dariole moulds with clingfilm, fill them with the mixture and place in the freezer for at least 2 hours, until frozen. To serve, remove from the freezer and leave at room temperature for a few minutes, then turn out on to plates and peel off the clingfilm. Sprinkle with the reserved <em>croccante</em>
 , if wished.</p>

 panna cotta con menta fresca</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">fresh mint panna cotta drizzled with honey</h3>
<p class="para1">
<em>Panna cotta</em>
 literally translated means ‘cooked cream’ and that’s basically what it is. You can try all sorts of different flavourings – this one is especially light and subtle with the cool, fresh mint. It’s a very simple dessert to make, and it should be prepared in advance to give it time to set. I find it sets best if you make it the night before. It will keep for 3–4 days in the fridge.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">3 gelatine leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">250ml/8fl oz double cream</p>
<p class="ingre">250ml/8fl oz milk</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">10 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">a couple of drops of vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp runny honey</p>
<p class="ingre1">a few dark chocolate shavings (optional)</p>
<p class="para1">Place the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water and leave to soften for about 5 minutes. Put the cream, milk, sugar, mint and vanilla in a small saucepan and bring gently to the boil. As soon as it begins to bubble, remove from the heat, cover with a lid and leave to rest for 5 minutes. This is done to allow the mint to infuse. Strain the cream through a fine sieve and discard the mint.</p>
<p class="para1">Drain the gelatine leaves and squeeze out any excess water with your hands. Add the soaked gelatine to the cream mixture and stir well, making sure that the gelatine melts. The mixture will take on an oily appearance – don’t worry, this is because of the gelatine and is quite normal. Pour the mixture into 4 ramekins or dariole moulds and place immediately in the fridge. Leave for at least 4 hours, until set.</p>
<p class="para1">To serve, run a knife round the edge of each panna cotta and then turn the mould upside down on to an individual serving dish to tip it out. Drizzle some runny honey on top and scatter with a few chocolate shavings, if desired. If using ramekins, you don’t have to tip the panna cotta out if you don’t want to; just drizzle the honey on top and serve in the ramekins.</p>

 pastiera di grano</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">Neapolitan Easter wheat and ricotta tart</h3>
<p class="para1">This dessert is believed to date back to pagan times, when Neapolitans would offer all the fruits of their land to the mermaid, Partenope, in spring: eggs for fertility, wheat from the land, ricotta from the shepherds, the aroma of orange flowers, vanilla to symbolise faraway countries and sugar in honour of the sweet mermaid. It is said that the mermaid would take all these ingredients, immerse herself in the sea of the Bay of Naples and give back to the Neapolitans a dessert that symbolised fertility and rebirth. The recipe as we know it today came from Neapolitan convents, and nuns would make it for rich nobles of the area.</p>
<p class="para1">My mother and aunts would always make it at Easter. It is still made today, at home as well as in pastry shops throughout the Campania region. In Naples, Easter wouldn’t be Easter without a <em>Pastiera di Grano</em>
 . Wheat sounds like a strange ingredient for a tart but it really is delicious, especially with the delicate flavour of orange-flower water. Pre-cooked wheat is sold in tins in Italian delicatessens, and orange-flower water can be found in supermarkets.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 12</strong>

<p class="ingre">400g/14oz tin of pre-cooked wheat</p>

<p class="ingre">250g/9oz ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">5 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz icing sugar, plus extra for decorating</p>
<p class="ingre">120g/4½oz mixed candied peel, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1½ tbsp orange-flower water</p>
<p class="ingre">grated zest of ½ orange</p>
<p class="ingre">2 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the sweet shortcrust pastry:</strong>

<p class="ingre">400g/14oz plain flour</p>

<p class="ingre">100g/4oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz butter, at room temperature, diced</p>
<p class="ingre1">grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="para1">First make the pastry. Sift the flour on to a work surface and make a well in the centre. Add the eggs, sugar, butter and half the lemon zest (reserve the rest for the filling) and lightly blend everything together with your fingertips until you have a smooth dough. Wrap in clingfilm, chill for 1 hour, then roll out thinly and use to line a 25cm/10in loose-bottomed tart tin, trimming the excess. Place in the fridge until ready to use. Do not discard the pastry trimmings; shape them into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3. Place the wheat, milk, 1 tablespoon of the remaining lemon zest and the vanilla extract in a small saucepan, mix well and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently until the wheat has absorbed all the liquid. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Mash the ricotta with a fork and beat in the egg yolks until light and fluffy. Sift in the icing sugar and beat until well incorporated, then beat in the candied peel, orange-flower water, the remaining lemon zest and the orange zest. Stir in the cooled wheat mixture.</p>
<p class="para1">In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Then fold carefully but thoroughly into the ricotta and wheat mixture.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the pastry case from the fridge and pour in the mixture. Roll out the remaining pastry quite thinly and cut it into 2.5cm/1in strips roughly the length of the cake tin. Arrange the strips criss-cross over the tart roughly 2.5cm/1in apart, trimming off any excess and pressing the ends against the edge of the pastry case to seal. Place in the oven and bake for 50 minutes, until lightly browned but still moist. Leave to cool, then sift over some icing sugar to decorate.</p>

 <span class="big">‘</span>
 A tiny old lady, round as a barrel, ran the smallest, most magical shop in Minori. With a stern expression, she presided over a fabulous array of sweets, chocolates and small pastries, but there was a kindly twinkle in her small, dark eyes.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Her shop was scarcely bigger than a telephone box, yet it was packed with an amazing variety of tantalising delicacies. Everything was handmade. We children thought she was magic, and believed our parents when they told us that a fairy worked with her, sprinkling fairy dust over her sweets.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Pastries were filled with pâtisserie cream made from eggs that had been laid that morning, and flavoured with chocolate. There were tarts filled with ricotta and cherries, apples and cream, and all kinds of fruit. There was nougat, too, made with sugar, almonds and honey. The little <em>signora</em>
 stood with her arms folded across her chest, the trays of sweets before her covered in white muslin cloths. It was pure theatre. She waited until we were breathless with anticipation before lifting the muslin very slowly to reveal the mouth-watering displays and release the most tantalising smells.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I was lucky. I had the chance to taste her sweets now and then because my grandfather would send me on errands to her shop and always gave me a little extra money for myself. The fairy lady always chanted: ‘What do you want? How much have you got? Has your grandad sent you?’ When I close my eyes, I can still hear her. She would wrap my grandfather’s order in beautiful crisp, coloured paper. And then she would make a smaller parcel for me. She seemed to read my mind, and always put in the very sweets I had been fantasising about. Needless to say, my parcel was opened and devoured almost as soon as I left the shop.<span class="big1">’</span>

 biscotti rococo</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">spicy almond biscuits</h3>
<p class="para1">This is an old recipe from Naples. The exotic spices reflect the type of ingredients introduced to ancient Naples by the Arabic invasions. In fact, these biscuits taste more like a North African speciality than an Italian one. Stored in an airtight container, they will keep for about two weeks. They are delicious served at teatime, or after dinner as an alternative to the classic Tuscan cantuccini, for dipping into a dessert wine such as Passito di Pantelleria or Vin Santo.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes about 40</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">300g/11oz plain flour</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz ground almonds</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">1 sachet of Easyblend yeast</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz butter, diced</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp finely grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp finely grated orange zest</p>
<p class="ingre">150ml/¼ pint sweet white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">1 egg, beaten, plus beaten egg, for brushing</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz mixed candied peel, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz whole almonds, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingre">a pinch of ground nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingre">1 egg, beaten, for brushing</p>
<p class="ingre1">icing sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4). Mix the flour, ground almonds, sugar and yeast together in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the lemon and orange zests, the wine, egg, candied peel, almonds, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix well, preferably with your hands, to form a soft dough. Form into golf-ball shapes, then, on a lightly floured surface, roll into sausage shapes 12.5–15cm/5–6in long. Shape each one into a ring, overlapping the ends slightly and pressing them together to seal (like mini bagels).</p>
<p class="para1">Place on baking trays lined with greaseproof paper and brush with the beaten egg. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until golden brown. Dust with icing sugar and serve.</p>

 salsina picante con pere</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">pear and chilli relish</h3>
<p class="para1">This wonderfully tangy relish makes a perfect accompaniment to very mature hard cheese such as Pecorino, or a selection of after-dinner cheeses. It also goes well with cold meats. Apart from grilling the pears, there is no cooking involved. Stored in attractive jars, the relish makes an ideal present, together with a hunk of good-quality hard cheese.</p>

<p class="para1">Meanwhile, place the chillies, mostarda di Cremona and marmalade in a food processor and whiz until smooth (if you are using fine-cut marmalade, don’t add it to the food processor). Transfer to a large bowl (fine-cut marmalade should be mixed in now). Add the caramelised pears and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1">Fill one large or several small storage jars with the mixture. It will keep for a couple of months.</p>

 formaggi</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">an Italian cheese selection</h3>
<p class="para1">Cheese can be served before or instead of dessert, and although more popular eaten this way in northern Italy it is now also becoming the trend in the South. Traditionally in the South, cheese is consumed as part of the antipasto course.</p>
<p class="para1">I love the cheese course, which is often the highlight of a meal. There are so many varieties and you can combine them with different accompaniments to make it a real talking point. When buying cheese, look out for fully ripened, good-quality specimens, even if you have to travel a little to buy the best. I always bring back some cheese from Italy, as several excellent local types are not available in the UK. Nevertheless, you can get many good varieties in Italian delicatessens and specialist cheese shops nowadays.</p>
<p class="para1">Here are some tips on serving cheese as part of an Italian meal.</p>
<p class="para1">Take the cheese out of the fridge and leave it at room temperature for about 4 hours before serving. This softens it and its flavour becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p class="para1">If serving cheese as part of an antipasto, use a fresh one such as buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with lots of extra virgin olive oil, scamorza or caprino (Italian goat’s cheese).</p>
<p class="para1">To make up a selection, choose a couple of hard cheeses, such as Parmesan and Pecorino, a semi-soft cheese such as Taleggio or provolone, and two soft cheeses – one blue-veined, such as gorgonzola or dolcelatte, and one plain, such as caprino. Four or five cheeses are sufficient; too many and the tastebuds get confused. Serve with some taralli (a southern Italian, crisp, twice-baked savoury biscuit), fresh bread or plain biscuits and some fresh fruit or celery. Always accompany with a good red wine or a full-bodied white.</p>
<p class="para1">If you serve just one cheese after dinner, it should be something quite special, such as Castelmagno or Formaggio di fossa served with my special chilli relish (see opposite). Alternatively, a good-quality gorgonzola or dolcelatte drizzled with honey and served with a few walnuts is a great way to end a meal.</p>
<p class="para1">Good accompaniments to cheese include pears, grapes, walnuts and fresh broad beans.</p>
<p class="para1">Mostarda di Cremona is also excellent with cheese. This is a preserve made of candied fruits and mustard and is available in mild and hot versions. It can be bought in jars from good Italian delicatessens.</p>
