<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Except for calf’s liver, offal was the food of the poor, and consumption of it went down as Spain grew rich. Since immigrants from Latin America have arrived in large numbers over the last decade or two, though, the offal stands that had almost disappeared from city markets have been doing a booming trade. Calf’s liver has always been a delicacy. It is important not to overcook it—it should still be pink inside.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 large onions, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound thinly sliced calf’s liver, cut into 1-inch strips</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ cup brandy</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and sauté, covered, over low heat until they are soft, stirring occasionally. This can take up to 25 minutes because of the large amount of onions. Then cook, uncovered, over medium heat, stirring often, until golden.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the liver to the onions and sauté for 1 minute, adding salt and pepper and turning the pieces just to brown them lightly all over. Pour the brandy over them and cook over high heat for 1 minute to reduce the liquid quickly. The timing for the liver depends on the thickness of the liver. Cut into a piece—it should still be pink inside.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary">For an Andalusian version, a famous tapa, use chicken livers instead of calf’s liver and sauté very briefly, stirring and turning them to brown them all over. Use oloroso sherry instead of brandy.</p>
