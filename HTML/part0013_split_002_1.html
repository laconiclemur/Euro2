  <p class="chap-para">This is a country bread traditionally made by rural housewives for their husbands working in the fields. It was made using up leftovers of ham, salami, cheese and pork lard. In my region, we usually make this type of bread, with the addition of boiled eggs, at Easter; it is known as <em class="calibre4">casatiello</em> and is often made in large quantities to give away to friends and family. You can use any type of cured meats and hard cheese you have available – when I tested this recipe I didn’t have any other Italian cheese, so I used up some Gruyère that I had in the fridge and the result was just as tasty.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 6</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/4 cups strong (bread) flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">3g salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">3g black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to brush</p>

  <p class="ing1">300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">70g/2½oz pancetta, cut into small cubes</p>

  <p class="ing1">70g/2½oz coppa (or prosciutto), cut into small cubes</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz salami, cut into small cubes</p>

  <p class="ing1">70g/2½oz Gruyère cheese, cut into small cubes</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz pecorino (romano) cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="ing2">30g/1oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="para">In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, pepper and olive oil. Gradually add the water and mix well to form a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes, then leave to rest for about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, mix together the cured meats and cheeses.</p>

  <p class="para">Open up the dough slightly, incorporate the cured meats and cheeses and knead for about 5 minutes, making sure all the ingredients are well combined. Form into a long sausage shape about 65cm/26 inches long and seal the ends together to form a ring. Place on a baking sheet, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Brush the top of the bread with olive oil, reduce the oven temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4 and bake the bread for 35 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
