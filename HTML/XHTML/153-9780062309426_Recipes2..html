<p class="rec_sub_ttl">Red Wine Beef Stew</p>
<p class="rec_yld">Serves 6</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Like many Gascon dishes, this one takes time: a full night for marinating, and another to let the stew rest before it’s degreased and gently cooked a second time the following day. Most Gascons I know use <i>poitrine de boeuf</i>, or brisket, for daube, but I recommend good-quality chuck instead since American brisket isn’t usually streaked with fat in the same way French poitrine is. Also, adding tomatoes isn’t particularly Gascon, but they give a nice, subtle acidity to this rich braise.</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>3 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch chunks</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 large leek, chopped</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 bouquets garnis (each containing 3 sprigs parsley, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf)</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>4 garlic cloves, smashed, plus 2 more cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>One 750 ml bottle dry red wine</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 tablespoons rendered duck fat or olive oil</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 large carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 medium onion, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 celery stalk, chopped</p>
<p class="rec_ul_blsp"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 large plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Season the beef generously with salt and pepper and add to a cast-iron Dutch oven (cocotte) along with the leek, 1 of the bouquets <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266" title="266"/>garnis, the 4 smashed garlic cloves, and the wine. Stir to combine. Refrigerate, covered, overnight.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">The next day, remove the chunks of beef from the marinade and pat the meat dry with paper towels. Strain the marinade using cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer; discard the leeks, the smashed garlic, and the used bouquet garni. Divide the strained marinade between two bowls; whisk the flour into half the strained marinade.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Working in batches, brown the meat in the duck fat (or oil, if using) in the bottom of the Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Transfer the browned meat to a plate. Add the carrots, onion, celery, tomatoes, and chopped garlic to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables soften slightly. Return the meat to the Dutch oven along with the second bouquet garni and all the reserved marinade and stir to combine. Simmer, covered, over medium-low heat until the meat is tender, 2<span class="frnum">1</span><span class="frslash">/</span><span class="frnden">2</span> to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Remove the Dutch oven from the heat and allow the stew to come to room temperature. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove the congealed fat from the surface of the daube, and remove and discard the second bouqet garni. Allow the stew to come up to room temperature. Bring to a simmer again over medium-low heat and cook for 2 <span class="frnum">1</span><span class="frslash">/</span><span class="frnden">2</span> to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Serve with steamed potatoes and plenty of crusty bread.</p>
