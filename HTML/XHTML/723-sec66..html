<p class="nonindent">At its core, this combination represents the survival dishes from the Spanish civil war. Traditionally, cheap and filling ingredients were simply boiled together for sustenance. But the Spanish always had good taste—you can’t really go wrong with pork, beans, and potatoes. I hope I’ve made the trio even better by stirring in pimentón at the end. Its subtle smokiness brought a needed complexity to the luscious pork and beans.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound boneless, skinless pork belly, cut into 1-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 small green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (¾ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 small onion, finely chopped (½ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 carrots, peeled and finely chopped (1 cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 garlic clove, minced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup canned crushed San Marzano tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1¼ cups black beluga or French Le Puy lentils, rinsed well and drained</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 medium Yukon gold potatoes, peeled, quartered lengthwise, and cut into ½-inch slices crosswise (2 cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon pimentón (sweet smoked paprika)</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">HEAT A LARGE DUTCH OVEN OVER MEDIUM-HIGH</span> heat. Sprinkle the pork belly with 1 teaspoon salt and season with pepper. Add to the Dutch oven in a single layer and sear, turning the pieces to evenly brown, about 10 minutes. Move the pork to one side of the Dutch oven. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the pepper, onion, and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the crushed tomatoes and cook, stirring often, until all the liquid evaporates and the tomatoes begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add the bay leaf and 4 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Stir in the lentils and 1½ teaspoons salt. Simmer for 20 minutes. If the mixture begins to dry out, add more water. Stir in the potatoes and simmer until the potatoes and lentils are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the pimentón. Taste and add more salt and pepper if you’d like. Serve hot.</p>
<p class="indent">The lentils can be cooled completely and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding more water if needed.</p>
