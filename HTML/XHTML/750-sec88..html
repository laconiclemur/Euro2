<p class="nonindent">For Christmas, turrón de Alicante, an almond honey nougat, is served all over Spain. Cúrate’s version isn’t a candy, but uses the same ingredients to make a soft frozen dessert. It has the chill and mallowy softness of a semifreddo and the crunchy sweet almonds reminiscent of traditional turrón. Our meringue is actually easier to execute than the candy, and, in my opinion, more pleasurable to eat because it doesn’t get stuck in your teeth.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE CANDIED ALMONDS, LINE A HALF-SHEET</span> pan with a nonstick baking mat or well-greased foil. Bring the sugar, butter, corn syrup, and 3 tablespoons water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar begins to caramelize and turns a light golden brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the salt, baking soda, and almonds until the almonds are evenly coated. Cook until the caramel is a dark shade of amber, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately pour onto the prepared pan. Using a heatproof silicone spatula or metal offset spatula, carefully and quickly spread in an even layer. Cool completely on the pan on a wire rack, then coarsely chop.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, make the meringue. Line a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap with overhang on all four sides. Use 2 crisscrossing sheets of plastic wrap if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Bring the sugar, corn syrup, and 3 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, then simmer without stirring until a candy thermometer registers 248°F. While the sugar mixture simmers, whip the egg whites with the whisk attachment of an electric mixer on medium-low speed until foamy. Add the salt, raise the speed to medium, and whip until soft peaks form. Reduce the speed to low. With the machine running, slowly and carefully pour the hot sugar syrup into the bowl in a steady stream. Pour along the side of the bowl so that the whisk doesn’t flick burning hot beads of sugar out of the bowl. Raise the speed to high and whisk until the mixture stops steaming, about 3 minutes. Reserve the meringue.</p>
<p class="indent">Whisk the cream in a clean, cold large bowl with a clean whisk attachment or electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold in the Grand Marnier and orange zest until incorporated, then fold in the meringue and candied Marcona almonds just until no streaks of egg whites remain. Do not overmix or let the mixture deflate.</p>
<p class="indent">Carefully scrape the meringue into the prepared pan. Use an offset spatula to create swirls and peaks on top.</p>
<p class="indent">Freeze until firmer, at least overnight and up to 3 days. The meringue won’t—and shouldn’t—freeze into a hard solid.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To serve, lift the meringue out of the pan using the plastic overhang. Unwrap and cut into slices.</p>
