			<p class="QuotePara">“I hate brunch, I really do, so many horrible brunches, nightmares. I was traumatized as a young cook—bad Canadian bacon, frozen English muffins, hollandaise sauce dripping off of my face mixed with sweat. I vowed as a cook to do brunch differently, to treat it as another important service, with attention to the choice of ingredients and how the menu was written. I wanted to approach brunch without the obligatory notion that it was merely a hangover remedy.”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes 1 drink and enough garnish for 10 drinks  </span>My general manager, Matthew Conway, used to do this Bloody at his mother’s restaurant, where they garnished it with pickled shrimp and Havarti cheese with dill. When he first offered to make me one, I told him “No way!” Matthew being Matthew, of course, he made it for me anyway and I couldn’t believe how much I enjoyed it. I am not being biased, but it really is the best Bloody you will ever have.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">We now make our own proprietary Bloody mix called Batch 22. It took us a while to develop and make just right, and it’s perhaps the only restaurant recipe that I won’t be sharing with you here. However, Batch 22 should be widely available. I like our mix so much that I actually have a hard time drinking Bloodys made without Batch 22.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">At the restaurant, the vegetable garnishes change according to the season. Some of our favorites appear during the spring—beautiful green beans or haricots verts. It makes for a beautiful presentation to have the beans sticking out of the Bloody. We garnish it with a block of Havarti cheese with dill, a green olive, a pickled shrimp, depending on the season, whatever pickled vegetables we have on hand, and lemon and lime wedges.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I was shown this style of scrambled eggs while working in France. When I first tasted it, I could not believe I was eating scrambled eggs—they tasted so delicate and smooth, almost like an egg puree. Once you add a little smoked salmon and caviar, it becomes a very elegant amuse-bouche. We serve this in the eggshell, which makes for a stunning and sophisticated presentation.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Salmon</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pick the remaining bones out of the salmon and thoroughly dry the salmon with paper towels. Place the salmon on a large piece of plastic wrap. In a bowl, mix together the salt, sugar, dill, fennel, coriander, and peppercorns.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In medium nonreactive bowl, toss the onions with the lime juice. Pack the onions around the salmon and season generously with the curing spices. Wrap the coated salmon in the plastic wrap. Place the wrapped salmon into a dish that is deep enough to hold any liquid that might leak out. Refrigerate for 12 hours. Remove the plastic wrap and discard it; reserve the onions. Rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Using a cold smoker, place the salmon and the onion on separate trays and smoke them for 25 minutes. Refrigerate the smoked salmon until cold, then slice it into paper-thin slices, cover, and refrigerate until needed. If you don’t have a cold smoker, refrigerate the salmon for 24 hours—you will have delicious gravlax instead.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Eggs</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Using an egg topper, gently crack the eggs and remove the top of the shell. Reserving the eggshells, gently transfer the eggs into a medium bowl. Add the cream and whisk together until smooth. Add 6 tablespoons of the butter, cover, and refrigerate.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page341"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Rinse the inside of the eggshells with warm water and, using the tip of your finger, gently pull out any membranes that remain in the shell. Set the eggshells upside down on a paper towel and dry thoroughly. Reserve 4 eggshells.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a chilled 2-quart pot set over medium heat. Pour the reserved egg mixture into the pot, season with salt, and whisk constantly until the eggs just begin to set, about 5 minutes. Fold in the chives and fill the reserved eggshells with the egg mixture. Top each egg with some of the caviar.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Brioche</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position a rack in the middle. Ten minutes before serving, place the brioche on a shallow baking sheet and brush the pieces with some of the Clarified Butter. Season with pepper and salt. Toast the buttered brioche slices in the oven for about 5 minutes or until toasted. Transfer the slices to a cutting board and remove the crusts. Cut each brioche slice into 3 pieces. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Lay the salmon slices over the warm brioche slices. Serve the salmon-topped brioche toasts alongside the eggs. Drizzle the toasts with some olive oil and sprinkle with chive blossoms, if using. If any leftover eggs remain, serve them on the side with some toast.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you can get your hands on some good prepared gravlax or smoked salmon, you can make this dish last-minute without having to cure your own salmon. Sometimes breakfasts and brunches come together without much planning or foresight, and having a quality premade gravlax on hand allows for some spontaneity.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Feather Ridge Farm</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Katie Bogdanffy</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Feather Ridge Farm, a three-generation family-run poultry farm established in 1938, is one of the few poultry-only farms remaining in New York State. Chicken-farming know-how spanning several generations is what gives Feather Ridge Farm the ability to produce some of the best-tasting eggs I’ve ever had. The Bogdanffy family sold eggs to my father back in the day, which is how I came to know the farm.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Today the farm is run by the Bogdanffy siblings: Katie, Hallie, and Stephen, with their father and grandparents assisting as well, making the farm a family affair. Together, they care for ten thousand chickens (actually classifying Feather Ridge as a small operation).</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Katie and her family raise Rhode Island Red chickens—classic laying hens, docile and sweet, and good egg producers. Katie and her family use all-natural practices to raise their chickens, never any hormones or drugs. In fact, to feed their chickens, the Bogdanffys mill their own food using a mill that Katie’s father, a Cornell graduate, designed and built himself. And because they grind their own food, they are able to source all the feed ingredients, supporting their local farms and economy. Thus, the chickens eat a varied diet without any additives or fillers, something that’s evident when you crack open one of their eggs. The yolk is large, thick, and bright orange.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Because the farm produces eggs year-round, the chickens remain indoors in old, spacious barns where they run around, perch, and lay eggs in nests. Keeping the chickens indoors keeps them cleaner and healthier, Katie explains, eliminating the need for antibiotics, which keeps in line with their no-drug philosophy. The eggs are hand-gathered several times a day to ensure freshness, and are thoroughly washed.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Busy as they are, the Bogdanffys still think of ways to improve their farm, and plan to go green in the near future, hoping to install solar panels to power about two-thirds of the farm. There are also plans to raise pigs sometime in the near future.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">“I want to [be able to] say that we have green eggs and ham,” Katie shared. Soon enough—she will.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is a very special breakfast; however, if you don’t have truffles, just add a couple of drops of truffle oil, and it will still be delicious. I made this for breakfast one morning during truffle season, and it was so good that I wanted the rest of the world to taste it. When you open the top of the jar, the aroma that comes out is beyond words, something everyone should experience at least once.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">Try to get your hands on the freshest eggs available—if you live near a greenmarket, chances are one of the farmers sells eggs. Freshly laid eggs will always be more delicious than anything you can get at the store.

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>The year we put this steak on the menu, it was a cold winter, and I was kind of playing with the idea of steak and eggs for a brunch dish. Steak and eggs is a cool way to do dinner for breakfast, a hearty meal that sticks to your ribs and keeps you full and warm. The dish wound up being one of our first cold-weather steak dishes at the restaurant, and it was so successful that it eventually became a fixture on our dinner menu.

Add the wine, port, thyme, and bay leaf and raise the heat to medium-high. Cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Add the stocks and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer and return to the pan. Set the pan over medium heat and skim off any excess fat, tilting the pot slightly to make it easier to skim. Season to taste with salt and more red wine vinegar, if you like.

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, without moving the livers, for 1 minute. Add the brandy and shallots, stir, and cook for 1 minute more—the livers should be medium-rare. Transfer the livers to a blender and add the reserved port reduction. Blend, and when the mixture is sufficiently uniform, with the blender running, add the terrine, heavy cream, duck fat, and butter, piece by piece. Blend the mousse on high speed for 1 minute. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Pass the mousse through a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl set in an ice bath and let cool. Refrigerate the mousse until ready to use.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a small dry skillet, toast the cumin seeds over low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes, making sure to shake the pan frequently. Transfer the cumin to a spice grinder and finely grind. (To toast preground cumin, just warm it up in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring, until it smells fragrant.) Place the toasted cumin, coffee, pepper, chili powder, salt, and cinnamon in the spice grinder and grind everything together until combined.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Pat the steaks dry. Brush the meat with a little oil. Spread the coffee rub out on a tray and roll the steaks in the mixture to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour but no longer; otherwise, the meat will begin to cure.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Preheat the oven to 400ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add 2 of the steaks and sear on each side until browned, 3 minutes per side. Transfer the seared steaks to a baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining 2 steaks. Let the seared steaks sit for 5 minutes, then transfer them to the oven and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Return the steaks to the sauté pan over medium-high heat; reduce the oven temperature to 375ºF. Baste the steaks with their juices for 1 minute. Transfer the steaks to a carving board and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Eggs</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Place the bacon on a rack set on top of a baking sheet, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until crispy. Set the cooked bacon aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Shortly before serving, add enough oil to a medium skillet to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over medium heat. Add the Caramelized Onions and Mustard Greens and cook until warm. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>When ready to serve, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Add the eggs and as soon as the whites are set, reduce the heat to low. Cook the eggs, sunny-side up, for about 3 minutes. While the eggs cook, cut the filone or baguette toasts in half and spread the Duck Liver Mousse over the bread. Divide the toasts among 4 warmed plates. Slice the steaks on a 45-degree angle, fan out the slices and plate the meat on top of the toast slices. Spoon some Red Wine Sauce around the steak. Remove the eggs from the heat and add an egg on top of each plate. Season the eggs with some flaky sea salt and cracked black pepper, and garnish with the cooked bacon. Serve with the Caramelized Onions and Mustard Greens on the side.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Make the Coffee-Rubbed Flatiron Steak and serve it with fried eggs. Instead of making the mousse, purchase a foie gras terrine at a fine foods shop, and serve it on the side for a decadent Sunday brunch.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is our version of the classic brunch favorite, eggs Benedict. While it can never replace the original, it has the same spirit but with our own twist. Instead of ham, we use prosciutto; instead of an English muffin, we swap in potatoes that are crushed with squash, green garlic, or corn, depending on what’s in season. It’s always a crowd pleaser and the crushed potatoes, when combined with the oozing egg yolk, are no joke.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Prosciutto</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the prosciutto on a parchment paper– or Silpat-lined baking sheet, cover it with more parchment paper or another Silpat, and stack another baking sheet on top. Bake for about 12 minutes or until the prosciutto is completely crispy. Remove the top baking sheet and transfer the bottom sheet with the prosciutto to a cooling rack. Let cool for about 1 hour.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Hollandaise</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a saucepot. Place a kitchen towel over the simmering water, and place a bowl over the towel. The towel is used to protect the bottom of the bowl from getting hit with the direct steam. Add the egg yolks to the bowl and whisk vigorously for about 5 minutes or until the egg yolks have turned white and are about as thick as mayonnaise.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the Clarified Butter in a slow and steady stream until completely emulsified. Season to taste with salt, and add the cayenne pepper and lemon juice. Fold in the Preserved Meyer Lemons and set the hollandaise aside; keep warm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Potatoes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a pot filled halfway with cold water, place the potatoes, garlic, thyme, and enough salt so that the water tastes like sea water. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page348"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>While the potatoes are cooking, slice the green garlic bulbs into ¼-inch-thick rings. Prepare an ice bath in a medium bowl. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the sliced green garlic in the boiling water for about 2 minutes. Immediately transfer the blanched green garlic to an ice bath.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Drain the potatoes and, using the back of a large spoon or a fork, smash them.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a large sauté pan, warm the butter over medium heat just until it begins to brown and smell nutty. Add the blanched green garlic and potatoes, and crush them together. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in the parsley and tarragon. Cook for 1 minute, remove from the heat, and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Press the potato–green garlic mixture into 8 (2½-inch) ring molds large enough to hold an egg on top. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Eggs</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span><span class="smallcap">Immersion Circulator Poaching:</span> Preheat an immersion circulator filled with water to 145ºF. Place the eggs (still in their shells) in the water and poach the eggs for 40 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span><span class="smallcap">Traditional Poaching Method:</span> Fill a pot with enough water to come at least 3 inches up the sides. Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar, if using, for each cup of water you use. Bring the water to a simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl, and gently slide it into the simmering water; repeat with the remaining eggs, one by one (you may need to do this in batches). You might use two large spoons to contain the whites from bleeding around the water, but some of the fraying will happen no matter what. Simmer the eggs until the whites have grown more or less opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, gently remove the eggs from the water and transfer them to a cutting board. Trim the frayed edges off the whites. Set the eggs aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>If you have cooked your egg using the immersion circulator, while the eggs are poaching, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. As soon as the eggs are done, warm the potatoes in the oven for about 5 minutes or until heated through. Remove the ring molds and divide the potatoes equally among 4 warmed plates. If you have poached your eggs the traditional way, see <a href="#makeitfaster">“Make It Faster,”</a> below.</p>
			<p class="method para-style-override-10"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Using the back of a ladle, make an indent in the potatoes that looks like a “nest.” Gently place an egg into each potato nest. Spoon hollandaise over each egg until covered by the sauce. Top the eggs with a prosciutto chip and some pea shoots, and sprinkle with some flaky sea salt, crushed black pepper, and cayenne pepper.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="makeitfaster"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If, like most people, you don’t own an immersion circulator, you will opt to cook your eggs via the traditional poaching method, which will take you about 4 minutes. While you cook the potatoes, put the acidulated water on the stovetop and bring it to a simmer. As soon as your potatoes are done and plated, you can poach the eggs and place them on top of the potatoes. Top with the Hollandaise and prosciutto chip, and brunch is ready.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Black Pig Meat Co.</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Chef Duskie Estes</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">I had previously mentioned that I made some lasting friendships while filming <a href="FORGE_00_FM_PPF.xhtml#page20">Next Iron Chef</a>, and here is a perfect example. Even though Chef Duskie Estes was technically my competitor when I met her, we became good friends in no time.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Duskie and her husband, Chef John Stewart, are raising heritage pigs, own a meat company, and cook at their award-winning restaurant, Zazu, in the heart of Sonoma Valley. They are as farm-to-table as it gets, and they make the finest bacon I’ve ever tasted. In fact, Duskie and her husband know good pork so well that they were crowned the King &amp; Queen of Pork in 2011 in the final round of Cochon 555.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Most bacon is wet-cured and injected with liquid smoke—a process that takes less than a day. What you taste in the end is usually the salt and the artificial smoke flavoring. In contrast, the Black Pig Meat Co. takes twenty-one days to dry-cure the bacon and then finishes it with applewood smoke for about twelve hours, resulting in bacon that has a perfect balance of salt, brown sugar, and smoke—the kind of bacon where you can really taste the quality of pork.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Duskie’s path to raising pigs and making charcuterie is rather unusual, since she spent more than half of her life as a vegetarian. Her philosophy was simple: If she couldn’t take a life, she didn’t deserve to eat meat. After working in a number of restaurants all over the West Coast, Duskie landed at the lauded Palace Kitchen in Seattle, where she met her husband. Every night, animals were being grilled on the spit, and cooking the meat and not tasting it was proving to be difficult for Duskie. She decided that if she was going to eat meat, then she would only raise meat that was humanely and ethically raised, and hopefully one day, she could raise her own farm animals.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When Duskie and John opened Zazu in 2001, they also decided to start curing their own meat as well as raising their own pigs. John studied salumi making with Mario Batali and his meat curer before he started making his own cured meats. After John’s first successful batch of prosciutto, he got a tattoo on his forearm of the pig logo of Armandino Batali’s salumi shop in Seattle. Then, John and Duskie started to purchase piglets and raise them to adulthood. And in 2012, they started mating their pigs and breeding piglets.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">In their approach on how to raise their pigs, Duskie and John, outspoken advocates for animal welfare, decided against using any CAFO (Confined Animal Feeding Operation) practices. They wanted their pigs to have “a great life and one bad day,” as Duskie put it, and believe the life of the animal should be respected.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The company name, Black Pig Meat Co., came from the very first pig they had, a Berkshire pig, a breed that happens to be black. Today, they use seven different breeds, not all of them black: Berkshire, Mangalitsa, Mule Foot, Duroc, Red Wattle (the breed for which they won King &amp; Queen of Pork), Chester White, and Yorkshire. While the pigs are mixed colors, they have something in common: All are heritage breeds that are pasture raised and hormone-free.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I grew up on Long Island, and a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich with hot sauce from your local deli is as classic as it gets. My mom made a pretty mean BEC sandwich, too, and wrapped it in foil for me to grab as I was rushing out the door late for school. I came up with this version while I was at BLT Steak one morning after a few too many cocktails.

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Lay the bacon out on a rack set on top of a shallow baking pan. Bake for 12 minutes or until the bacon is crispy. Set aside to cool. Leave the oven on.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Popovers</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Place the rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf on a piece of cheesecloth and tie the ends together to form a sachet. Place the sachet and milk into a medium saucepot set over medium heat.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>While the milk is warming up, place the eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the salt, and whisk the eggs on medium speed. Keep the mixer running while the milk warms up–the time it takes for the eggs and salt to be properly whisked is the time it takes for the milk to warm.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Spray the popover tins with nonstick cooking spray and place them on baking sheets. Place the baking sheets and popover tins in the oven to warm up.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>As soon as the milk has small bubbles forming around the edge of the pot, remove the pot from the heat and discard the herb sachet. With the mixer motor still running, slowly whisk one-third of the infused milk into the eggs to temper them; add the milk slowly so as not to curdle the eggs. Gradually add another third of the milk, and then the final third. With the motor still running, whisk in the flour, 1 cup at a time, until fully incorporated, being careful not to overwhisk. Remove the hot tins from the oven and pour the popover batter all the way to the top of each well. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and return the tins to the oven. Bake for about 20 minutes or until the popovers rise by half. Rotate the pan so the popovers cook evenly, and bake for another 20 minutes or until the popovers are golden brown and very puffy. Transfer the tins to a rack and let cool slightly.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page352">Make the Eggs</h2>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a large sauté pan, melt the butter with the oil over medium heat. As soon as the butter starts to brown and smell nutty, pour in the egg mixture (you may need to do this in batches, and if you do, ration your butter accordingly), reduce the heat to medium-low, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the eggs are scrambled to your liking.

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>A couple of years ago when I was in Vegas, I had fried chicken and waffles at some diner and fell in love with the pairing. The crunchy, savory bites from the chicken balanced perfectly with the sweetness from the maple syrup and waffles. The pitfall of the recipe is that often, by the time you get your chicken and waffles, parts of the waffles are soggy. There are only a handful of places that can execute a perfect non-soggy waffle. For the amazing waffle recipe here, I tapped my good friend, master chef Laurent Tourondel. His waffles are light, crispy, and complex-tasting. And, to make it a bit more interesting, I swapped out chicken for quail. The result—something familiar and something new.</p>

We serve them with the hot cooking liquid on the side so you can dip the sliders in it. As for them being the “best sucking sliders,” we’ll let you judge for yourself.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Rub The Cure all over the leg and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. The following morning, rinse the leg under cold running water and pat the meat dry.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Wrap the thyme and bay leaf in the bacon and secure the bacon with butcher’s twine.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Add the bacon bundle, ale, and Clarified Butter to a saucepot and bring to a boil. Transfer the leg to a large casserole and pour the butter mixture over the leg. Cover the pot with parchment paper, then a layer of foil, and finally the lid. Bake for 4 to 6 hours or until the leg meat is perfectly tender and falling apart. Refrigerate the cooked leg overnight, in the cooking liquid, so that the flavors fully develop.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>The following day, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Remove the skin from the leg and lay it flat on a cutting board. Using the back of a paring knife, scrape off any excess fat. Lay the skin out on a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined shallow baking pan, place another Silpat or piece of parchment paper over the skin, and top with another shallow baking pan. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until the skin is brittle and looks like glass. Start checking on the skin after 20 minutes. Transfer the skin to a cooling rack and let cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Reheat the meat for about 10 minutes (do not turn the oven off). Transfer the casserole dish to a cutting board, remove the leg from the liquid, and place the meat in a large bowl. Using two forks, shred the meat. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside. Add a couple of tablespoons of the cooking liquid, the parsley, the mustard, and the red pepper flakes to the bowl with the leg meat, and mix to combine.</p>

Add the carrot and onion, and toss to combine.</p>

The reason we originally put this on our brunch menu was because we had a recession-friendly Sunday supper prix-fixe, and for whatever reason, people were more willing to pay for it as a brunch item than a Sunday supper item. The Sunday supper days are gone, but the Chili Lobster has become a brunch staple and superstar. Sometimes, people even ask for it with a <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page242">Tomahawk Chop</a>, which becomes the sickest, most decadent steak and eggs I’ve ever seen.</p>
