<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">You have to leave the window open, so to speak, to be creative when you cook, as so many recipes emerge from problems (e.g., lemonade from too many lemons). I find the best dishes happen when you have embellished something left over, or have replaced a missing ingredient, or from any time when you’ve treated a challenge like an opportunity. This elegant dish can also make use of an abundance of leftover asparagus.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 2]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">A small handful of asparagus, tough ends removed and discarded</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 good-quality large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">A little finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Bring a small</strong> pot of water to a boil over high heat and season with salt. Add the asparagus and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain immediately and transfer to paper towels and let dry off for a minute or so.</p>
<p>Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the asparagus to the butter and get the spears together in the center of the pan. Crack the eggs directly on top of the asparagus and sprinkle the tops with a pinch of salt. Cover the pan with a lid (or another skillet, inverted). Cook until the egg whites are just set, about 2 minutes. Uncover the pan, slide a spatula under the asparagus, and transfer to a warm plate, being careful to keep the eggs intact. Spoon the butter that’s accumulated in the bottom of the pan over the asparagus and the eggs and sprinkle the whole thing with a final pinch of salt and a few healthy grinds of black pepper.</p>
<p>Serve immediately with a little bit of Parmigiano-Reggiano on top, because <em>why not</em>?</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-26"/><span class="blue">Piperade</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Piperade</em>, a traditional Southwestern French dish of sweet bell peppers and pork, is made here with spicy chorizo. The combination evokes the flavors of sausage with peppers and onions, the Italian-American carnival classic. Topped with eggs, this makes a savory, satisfying meal that’s especially beneficial for curing brutal hangovers. Note that if you can’t find fresh chorizo, you can finely chop dried chorizo.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ pound fresh chorizo, meat removed from casings (casings discarded) or ½ pound finely chopped dried chorizo</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 bell peppers (whatever color you’d like), stemmed, seeded, and sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small yellow onion, peeled and sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">8 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Toast, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Crumble in the chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned and starting to get a little bit crisp, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Add all of the vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and browned (color is flavor!) and the whole thing smells intoxicating, about 20 minutes. Season the mixture to taste with salt and set it aside.</p>
<p>At this point you can leave the vegetable mixture in the pan and bake the eggs directly in the pan, or divide the mixture evenly among four individual baking dishes. Whether you’re working in one big skillet or in four individual baking dishes, use a wooden spoon to make indentations in the sauce, and crack the eggs into the indentations.</p>
<p>Transfer the skillet or dishes to the oven and bake until the eggs are just set, about 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Serve immediately.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTES</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">Without the chorizo, this recipe works well as a vegetarian option. You can also substitute soaked and chopped salt cod for the sausage.</span></p>
<p><span class="special">Instead of baking the eggs, you can scramble them and fold them into the vegetable mixture or serve them alongside the vegetable mixture.</span></p>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">On Toast and Its Toppings</span></h1>
<p class="noindent"><em>I like toast with butter and I really like it with olive oil. When I season a piece of toast with olive oil, I season it almost like a steak. I give it a good pour and, with a generous hand, sprinkle it with sea salt and black pepper. It’s a savory, crunchy vehicle for nearly everything good in life. I serve stacks of toast with a crock of duck rillettes (see <a href="chapter005i-2.xhtml#page-140">here</a>), or soft Oeufs Brouillés (<a href="chapter001b.xhtml#page-5">here</a>), and even a good piece of cheese.</em></p>
