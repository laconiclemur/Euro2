<div class="ser1"><img alt="images" src="images/img-112-1.jpg"/></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc"><b>One of the first techniques that I mastered in the kitchen was how to chop an onion. As the onion is economical, full of flavour and present in every recipe on the planet, I’d advise you to do the same.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tx2">From a very serious and very French manual, I learned the classic way of chopping an onion according to the rule book and, indeed, it works very well.</p>
<p class="tx2">But one day, watching a video on YouTube, I learned another method used by streetfood sellers in India. I felt as though I’d received a slap in the face. This method is certainly less precise but much quicker (although, until you’ve got the hang of it, take it easy and watch your fingers).</p>
<p class="tx2">I love it when everyday cooking gets one over on chef cuisine. It makes me happy. Here are the two techniques for you to decide which one suits you best.</p> 
<p class="h2">The traditional method</p>
<p class="tx2">For this technique, you will need any chef’s knife or paring knife.</p>
<p class="tx2">Cut the onion in half, remove the skin and lay one half, cut side down, so it is flat with the root away from you.</p>
<p class="tx2">Make vertical cuts down the onion half. This is when you determine how thick your chopped pieces will be.</p>
<p class="tx2">Make two horizontal cuts across it (sounds daft to me but, as they mention it, I’ve added it here).</p>
<p class="tx2">Turn the half onion 90 degrees so the root is on the left (I’m a rightie).</p>
<p class="tx2">Chop it, with your fingers tucked under (like a claw) so they are away from the knife blade.</p>
<p class="tx2">When the half becomes unstable (too tall and with a narrow base), flip it on its side and continue chopping until only the root itself remains. Repeat with the other onion half.</p> 
<p class="h2">The streetfood method</p>
<p class="tx2">For this technique, you will need a very sharp knife with a long, straight, thin blade.</p>
<p class="tx2">Slice off a big piece at the top of the onion and a smaller piece at the base. Remove the skin. The onion must be able to stand upright on its root.</p>
<p class="tx2">Run the knife blade down top to bottom through one half of the onion to make 4 or 5 vertical slashes but without going as far as the root. The idea is to use the length of the knife so that the tip stops as it touches the chopping board.</p>
<p class="tx2">Spin the onion 90 degrees and do the same again on the other side.</p>
<p class="tx2">The onion is still upright but is now scored into small dice. Let it fall on its side so it flattens out a bit and chop the rest.</p>
<p class="tx2">When you reach the root, lie it flat and chop that as well.</p>
<p class="tx2">This method requires more practice to perfect but when you have kilos of onions to chop, it is devilishly efficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="txc"><b>Be warned: my way of cooking steak is a bit of a pain. Having said that, the end result is beyond epic. It involves using state-of-the-art culinary techniques like sous-vide and temperature control... But, don’t panic. It’s me and I promise I’ll keep it cheap, fun and easy. Let’s do it!</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tx2">Everyone knows how they like their steak but fewer know that it’s all down to the core temperature of the meat. Rare steak is 54ºC [130ºF], medium rare 57ºC [135ºF], medium 60ºC [140ºF] and well done 65ºC [149ºF]. The problem is that if you cook a steak the classic way, either under a grill [broiler] or in a frying pan [skillet], its temperature rises very fast so, to ensure the steak is cooked how you like it, you have to guess when to remove it from the heat. GUESSING! Do this too early and it will be underdone; a bit too late and it will be over.</p>
<p class="tx2">Even if you manage to get it right, there is another problem you only discover when you slice your steak. Take a look! The doneness you want is only in the very centre. Between that and the crust, the rest of the meat (what I call the gradient) isn’t right at all. My mission is to get rid of this gradient and have a perfectly cooked steak all the way through.</p>
<p class="tx2">To do this, I use a cheat’s controlled-temperature cooking technique called sous vide or – avoiding ‘chef-speak’ – vacuum packed and for this you need an ice box. This brilliant insulator is perfect not just for keeping food fresh but also for keeping it warm for a long time and, believe it or not, it’s spot on for cooking steak. Something else you’ll need is a digital meat thermometer, which you can pick up from a kitchen store or online fairly cheaply.</p>
<p class="tx2">Now, take your nice thick steak and put it in a ziplock bag with a bit of butter and a sprig of thyme. Tuck the end of a straw into the bag alongside the steak and seal the bag so it is almost closed. Suck the air out through the straw, then remove the straw and seal the bag completely. As the bag is in close contact with the steak this will ensure more even cooking.</p>
<p class="tx2">Fill the bath of the ice box with warm water. As the water will lose 1–2 degrees’ heat per hour, I recommend that you have the water temperature slightly higher than the meat temperature you’re aiming at. Put the sealed bag in the warm water along with the probe of the meat thermometer and close the box lid tightly.</p>
<p class="tx2">From now it should take about 2 hours to cook your steak if it’s 5cm [2in] thick or 1 hour if it’s 2.5cm [1in] thick. Check the temperature displayed on the thermometer occasionally to make sure it’s stable. If it needs adjusting, add a bit of hot water to the bath. The bigger the ice box, the more stable the temperature will be. The obvious but amazing consequence of cooking a steak like this is that the temperature cannot go higher than the starting temperature of the water, so the steak will never be overcooked. On the other hand, don’t leave it in for more than 3 hours and when it’s done, get it out of the bath.</p>
<p class="tx2">When you remove the steak from the bag I admit it will look pretty miserable and lacking something crucial – a succulent, brown crust – but 1 minute on each side in a frying pan over a very high heat will soon fix that.</p>
<p class="tx2">Slicing a steak cooked in this way is a thing of beauty. No gradient but beautiful pink meat, stretching from one caramelized crust to the other, that’s incredibly juicy. There will be no going back…</p>

<p class="txc1"><b>OK, I know this dish isn’t for everyone. Not only does it contain raw beef as Italian carpaccio does but also raw egg yolk like homemade mayonnaise and proper chocolate mousse so it comes with all the potential risks associated with those.

<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp each of fresh chopped parsley and chopped chives</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100g [3½oz] highest-grade fresh sirloin steak, refrigerated</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>sea salt flakes, freshly ground black pepper and a few drops of Tabasco</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 organic egg yolks</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Finely chop the gherkins, capers and shallot and mash the anchovy fillet. Place in a bowl and mix in the chopped parsley and chives.</p>
<p class="tx2">Take the steak out of the refrigerator and cut it into very thin slices, trimming off any fat or sinew. Stack the slices on top of each other and cut them into really small dice.</p>
<p class="tx2">Add the diced steak to the bowl, along with the mustard, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Season with the salt, pepper and Tabasco. Mix everything together lightly but thoroughly. Divide in two.</p>
<p class="tx2">Place a large, round cookie cutter, or just a piece of double foil folded into a ring (long live DIY!), on a serving plate and press one portion of the mixture into it to make a patty. Carefully remove the cutter or foil ring and place the egg yolk on top to serve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc2"><b>VEGAN ALTERNATIVE?</b></p>
<p class="txc"><b>Are you outta your mind? Probably, but try this. Leave out the egg and anchovy, add vegan mayonnaise, and replace the meat with a mixture of chopped cherry tomatoes, sun- dried tomatoes and red (bell) peppers, pretty tasty alternative, minus the muscle.</b></p>

<p class="txc1"><b>Rare? No thanks... Most of the bacteria in a steak is on the surface, which is why, after the outside has been well seared, it is acceptable indeed recommended to eat the steak rare. But when it comes to a burger, the process of mincing the steak mixes the bacteria that was just on the outside all the way through the meat. Also, eating a burger rare will be like licking a piece of raw barbak. Yum. ‘Barbak’ is a slang word we French guys use for meat... I have to confess it’s not very polite. I will make an exception for <a href="chapter_Split12.xhtml#ref-51">steak tartare</a>, though...</b></p>

<p class="h2">Serves 1</p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ carrot</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a little juice from a jar of pickles</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 medium shallots</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 glasses of red wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a pinch of sugar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 beef stock [bouillon] cube, crumbled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tsp butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tsp plain [all-purpose] flour</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125g [4½oz] minced [ground] steak, shaped into a burger</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 rasher [slice] of bacon</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 button mushrooms</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a drizzle of vinegar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 burger bun, split in half</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp mayonnaise mixed with a pinch of chilli flakes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 lettuce leaf</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Using a speed [swivel] peeler, peel the carrot and shave into thin slices. Put the slices in a small bowl and spoon over a little juice from your jar of pickles in your refrigerator. Set aside while you prepare the rest of the recipe.</p>
<p class="tx2">Peel and slice the shallots into thin rounds. Set one or two rounds aside. Season the rest and add to a saucepan with a little oil. Fry for a few minutes over a medium heat. Add the wine, sugar and stock cube and season with pepper. Leave to reduce over a medium-low heat for 30 minutes, stirring from time to time. Thicken the sauce by mashing the butter and flour together until smooth and whisking this into the sauce. Bring to a gentle boil, taste and season with salt, if necessary. Cool and chill until needed.</p>
<p class="tx2">Season the burger and brush on both sides with oil. Cook in a frying pan [skillet] over a high heat for 2–4 minutes on each side (depending on how thick it is). Remove from the pan and set to one side covered. Fry the bacon and mushrooms in the pan for a few minutes, remove, finely chop the mushrooms and set to one side. Add a drizzle of vinegar to the pan, stir to incorporate the juices sticking to the bottom of it and add this liquid to the wine sauce.</p>
<p class="tx2">Quickly toast the burger bun and spread lightly with the spiced mayonnaise. Place the base of the bun on a plate or board and layer ingredients on top in the following order: lettuce leaf, burger, raw shallot slices, chopped mushrooms, 1 tablespoon of red wine sauce, bacon and pickled carrot slices. And more spiced mayonnaise if you like. Top with the lid of the bun.</p>

<p class="tx2">For the five-spice powder, roast the whole spices in a dry pan over a high heat until they smell fragrant. Bash them to a powder with a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p class="tx2">For the wet rub, finely chop the white parts of the spring onions and the green parts of two of the onions. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium-high heat and fry the chopped onions until golden. Strain, reserving the aromatic oil, and set the fried onions on kitchen paper [paper towels]. Mix the strained oil with the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and 2 tablespoons of the five-spice powder to make a paste.</p>
<p class="tx2">Cut deep slashes in the chicken legs and rub all over with three-quarters of the spice paste. If you wear rubber gloves to do this it’s less messy but also less fun.

<p class="tx2">Preheat the oven to 200ºC/180ºC fan/400ºF/Gas 6. Sit the chicken on a grill rack in a roasting pan, pour a glass of water into the bottom of the pan and roast for about 1 hour 30 minutes. While the chicken is roasting, put the remaining spice paste in a pan over a low heat. Mix the cornflour with the chicken stock and add to the pan. Bring to the boil, stirring, then simmer over a low heat until the mixture reduces to a syrupy sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="tx2">Take the chicken out of the oven and push a knife into the flesh between the legs and the breast – the juice that runs out must be clear, not pink. If it is clear, the chicken is cooked! Cover it with foil and several tea towels [dish cloths] and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Serve the chicken with a flourish at the table, accompanied by the sauce. Finely slice the remaining green parts of the onions and sprinkle over the chicken with the fried onions.</p>

Scrub the clams with a small brush in plenty of cold water to remove any dirt or sand, discarding any that have broken shells or that are open and do not close when lightly squeezed.</p>
<p class="tx2">Heat the butter in a very large saucepan and when it has melted, add the herb bundle first and fry for a minute or so to infuse it with the butter, and then add the shallots and garlic – the fresh herbs pimp and pump up the flavours of the dried ones. Fry until the shallots have softened, then add the wine (or whatever liquid you’re using) and bubble so the wine reduces a bit. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="tx2">Tip in the clams and celery leaves. Put a lid on the pan and cook until all the clam shells have opened, stirring once or twice. Discard any that remain tightly closed. The cooking time for the clams will depend on their size. Small ones (which taste so good) will open in 3–4 minutes; larger ones can take longer. Stir a couple of times while they cook to ensure those at the bottom don’t open before the ones on top. When the clams are ready, I like to add a dash of cream. It’s not classic, I know, but, honestly, I couldn’t care less. Haha.</p>
<p class="tx2">Remove and discard the herb bundle and then sprinkle in the chopped parsley. Pile the clams into serving dishes and ladle over the sauce. The flavours of the dish will be intense with the clams, shallots, butter and cream adding richness and the herbs freshness. Serve the clams on their own or with French fries on the side. And the rest of the bottle of wine.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>2 Tbsp salmon roe</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Put the rice in a fine-mesh strainer or colander and run cold water through it until the water runs clear. Transfer the rice to a rice cooker, add the measured water and cook the rice according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If you like rice but you don’t have a rice cooker (a bit hard to believe), go and buy one now.</p>
<p class="tx2">Place a saucepan over a low heat, add the vinegar, sugar and salt and heat, stirring regularly, until the sugar and salt have dissolved.</p>
<p class="tx2">When the rice is cooked, spread it out carefully in a large, deep dish so it will cool quickly, and spoon <span>the vinegar mixture evenly over it. Mix the rice gently with a spatula so you don’t crush or break the grains. As soon as the rice has cooled, it’s time to prepare the dish.</span></p>
<p class="tx2"><a id="page_129"/>The rest is all about making it look good! Fill 2 serving bowls with the rice. Prepare the toppings by cutting the salmon, beetroot and avocado into thin slices. Divide the watercress into small sprigs, removing and discarding any yellow leaves and tough stalks. Arrange the salmon, beetroot, avocado and watercress sprigs over the rice and top each bowl with a tablespoon of salmon roe. Sprinkle with black and white sesame seeds.

<p class="h2">Serves 1</p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 rice wrappers</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 Tbsp grated white cabbage</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2–3 mushrooms (depending on size), cut into thin strips</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>1 tsp finely chopped root ginger</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a few drops of sesame oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a drizzle of olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a drizzle of soy sauce</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Soften the rice wrappers by dabbing them with a damp cloth or dipping them briefly in warm water. Place the wrappers on a board in a flower pattern so they overlap nicely.</p>
<p class="tx2">Put the grated cabbage, mushrooms and bamboo shoots in the centre. Season the fish fillet well and place on top of the vegetables, then add some sprigs of coriander and some ginger. Drizzle over the sesame oil, olive oil and soy sauce. Fold the rice wrappers around the filling, making sure the packet is airtight.</p>
<p class="tx2">If you don’t have a proper steamer, it’s not a problem – I don’t have one either. So, DIY time! Screw up 3 sheets of foil into equal-size balls, each about the size of a clementine. Place these in a large saucepan and cover them three-quarters with water. Stand a small heatproof plate on top of the foil balls – the plate must not touch the sides of the pan. DIY steamer done! As an added bonus, it needn’t only be used for fish in rice wrappers.</p>
<p class="tx2">Rub the plate with a piece of oiled kitchen paper [paper towel] and then put the fish parcel on top. Cover the saucepan with a lid, place over a high heat and leave to cook for about 10–15 minutes.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>cornflour [cornstarch] for dusting</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>groundnut [peanut] oil for deep-frying</b></p>
<p class="tx2">For the sauce, put the crushed garlic, egg yolk, salt, mustard and lemon zest in a bowl. Mix the 2 oils together and gradually whisk in until incorporated. Bravo! You’ve made a mayonnaise. Finally, whisk in the lemon juice and chilli flakes.</p>
<p class="tx2">For the batter, pour the beer into a wide, deep dish and lightly mix in the cornflour, flour, salt, pepper, dried herbs and bicarbonate of soda. Any lumps? Even better.</p>
<p class="tx2">To prepare the fish, dust the fillets with cornflour until coated, shaking off any excess. Heat the oil for deep-frying in a large pan to 180°C [350°F].</p>
<p class="tx2">Dip the fish fillets in the batter until coated, then deep-fry until golden brown. Drizzling a little extra batter over the fillets while they are cooking makes for even more crispy and crunchy shards of batter when fried. Drain the fillets on a plate lined with kitchen paper [paper towels] and serve at once with the sauce and wedges of lemon.</p>
<p class="tx2">So, what happened to the chips? Answer: there aren’t any. The fish is too good and anyway there is enough fat already. Instead, I suggest you accompany the fish with a crisp, full-flavoured salad.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>1 garlic clove</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25g [1 Tbsp] butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ tsp salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>225g [8oz] cooked peeled prawns [shrimp]</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp neutral flavoured oil</b></p>
<p class="tx2">For the chilli oil, heat the oil in a saucepan with the ginger, spring onions, bay leaf, cinnamon stick and whole cloves over a medium-low heat for about 5 minutes until the onions start to brown.</p>
<p class="tx2">Strain the oil, return it to the pan and place over a medium heat. Meanwhile, put 5 tablespoons of chilli flakes in a heatproof ceramic or glass bowl. When the oil is just starting to smoke, pour half of it carefully over the chilli flakes in the bowl. Leave until the bubbles in the oil die down before continuing.</p>
<p class="tx2">Add the sesame seeds to the bowl with another tablespoon of chilli flakes and the peppercorns. Pour in the remaining oil and leave to infuse for 24 hours, by which time the oil will have turned orangey red.</p>
<p class="tx2">The oil can be kept in a covered container for a few weeks at room temperature or even longer in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="tx2">When ready to cook the prawns, crush the garlic with the butter and salt. Add the parsley and pound everything together. You might not know it but you’ve just made a true classic of French cuisine called <i><a href="chapter_Split11.xhtml#ref-49a">beurre maître d’hôtel</a></i>. And that’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p class="tx2">Heat the oil in a frying pan [skillet] over a medium heat and fry the prawns for a few minutes until lightly browned. Add the garlic and parsley butter, stirring so the prawns are coated, and serve hot. It’s already a very good dish but with a drizzle of the red oil, it’s to die for.</p>
