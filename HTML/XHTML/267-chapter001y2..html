<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Roasting the dry oats before cooking them in water gives this oatmeal a nutty flavor that permeates each bite. The real pièce de résistance, however, is the caramelized sugar that gives this hot cereal a crème “brûlée-esque” top that’s simply irresistible. Note this can be made up to a week in advance, making it especially great for when you’re entertaining. Simply warm it in a 400°F oven for about 15 minutes before brûléing the top.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 cups jumbo rolled oats</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 cups water</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup pumpkin seeds</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup sunflower seeds</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup flaxseeds (golden, brown, or a mix of the two)</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup ground hemp seeds</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup raisins</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ to ½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons bee pollen, for serving</p>
<p class="ingredient">Warm milk, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 425°F.</p>
<p>Place the oats on a baking sheet and bake, stirring the oats occasionally, until they smell toasty and are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Keep the oven on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bring the water to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan. Transfer the baked oats to the water along with the salt and stir to combine. Lower the heat and simmer until the oats are softened and thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in all of the seeds and the raisins and transfer the mixture to a baking dish or a pie dish.</p>
<p>Place the dish in the oven and bake until all of the excess liquid has evaporated and the top is lightly browned and just firm to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the oatmeal from the oven and turn the oven from bake to broil.</p>
<p>Evenly sprinkle the sugar over the surface of the oatmeal, using at least ¼ cup and up to ½ cup if you like it especially sweet. Place the dish on a rack set 4 to 6 inches under the broiler and cook, with a watchful eye, until the sugar has melted and caramelized, and is nearly, but not entirely, burned. Carefully remove the oatmeal from the broiler and serve immediately with the bee pollen sprinkled on top, if you’d like.</p>
<p>Serve hot with a pitcher of warm milk alongside, if desired.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTES</h1>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>1.</strong> <span class="special">You can skip the broiler and use a kitchen torch to brûlé the sugar. Or, alternatively, you can place a metal spoon directly into the flame of a gas burner set on high heat and heat the spoon for at least a few minutes, or until it’s red hot. Carefully holding the handle with a kitchen towel or oven mitt, place the spoon directly on the sugar and stand back—it will smoke!</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>2.</strong> <span class="special">Use any combination of nuts, seeds, and dried fruit that you’d like.</span></p>
