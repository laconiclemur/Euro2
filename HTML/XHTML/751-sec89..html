<p class="nonindent">For me, this is summertime in a dessert. It’s an icier sorbet that’s refreshing and not too sweet. Roasting the strawberries first intensify their flavor; be sure to scrape up all of the juices and syrup from the roasting pan, too. To complement the sweetness of those berries and fresh watermelon, use a brut or dry cava. A scoop of this sorbet is the ideal way to end a light summer meal, but it can also work as a palate cleanser between heavier dishes, like grilled meats.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 ounces strawberries, hulled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 cups watermelon chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup brut cava</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375°F. TOSS THE STRAWBERRIES,</span> oil, and 2 tablespoons sugar on a half-sheet pan. Arrange the strawberries in a single layer, hulled side down. Roast for 10 minutes, rotate the pan, and roast for 10 minutes more. Cool completely on the pan on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bring the remaining ¾ cup sugar and ¾ cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove the simple syrup from the heat and cool completely.</p>
<p class="indent">Scrape the strawberries with all their pan juices into a blender and add the watermelon and simple syrup. Puree until very smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into an airtight container, and whisk in the lemon juice and cava. Cover and refrigerate until very cold, at least 8 hours and up to overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Churn the chilled mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serve immediately or freeze in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
