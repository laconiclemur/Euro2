			<p class="Normal-noind"><span class="lead-in">of the hundreds of fish</span> that issue from American waters, I know most by name only, a shameful lacuna that I share with most Americans. A livresque acquaintanceship breeds frustrations, not only because a valuable judgment depends on getting ahold of the thing, feeling it and tasting it, but also because of our maddening habit of naming fish: A number of different fish may share a single name or a single fish may be known by a number of different names, some of which inevitably apply to other fish as well. Webster defines “bass” as “any of numerous edible spiny-finned fishes”—presumably the striped sea bass is that which most resembles that French Atlantic <em class="ital">bar</em> or the Mediterranean <em class="ital">loup,</em> but there is, as well, a fresh-water fish called striped bass and an ocean fish called black bass (as a child I loved a lake fish that we called black bass . . .); “sole” (genuine sole is called “Dover” and does not exist in American waters) apparently means any flat fish of Picassoesque profile; whiting, silver hake, sea mullet, kingfish, and Pacific hake would seem, to some mysterious extent, to be interchangeable appellations—although silver hake, according to my sources, grows to a size of 3 or 4 pounds (and is probably the whiting with which I am familiar and which is nearly identical to the French <em class="ital">merlan</em>) and kingfish to 30 pounds . . . And so forth.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page119">The reputation of variety and goodness enjoyed particularly by the fish of Mediterranean waters may be justified: its fame is certainly indebted to a loyal folklorique tradition and literature, to a long and civilized culinary tradition that precisely defines the various treatments to which each species best responds; to the intimate acquaintanceship of the cooks with the local water life; and, finally, to a general insistence that fish be absolutely fresh—serious shoppers only buy fish that have been fished the same morning.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Our habits of merchandising, of buying, and of living unhappily preclude, for the most part, the possibility of a fish’s leaping directly from its habitat into the frying pan—and to the extent to which this is true the subtlest and most important part of fresh (uncured) fish cookery is lost to us. All waters are peopled (or were, at least, until very recently) with a wonderful variety of good fish whose various qualities correspond closely to those in other parts of the world; I don’t doubt that a greater practical experience would permit me to abandon the depressing habit of making constant comparisons in search of analogies or substitutions.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page119a">Fish Stews</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The line dividing a soup from a stew is often infirm; some of the preparations discussed here may belong in the soup chapter—I don’t know.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Fish stews differ from meat stews (see <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page302">description</a>) only insofar as most fish (octopus and squid excepted) require a very short cooking period, being, in fact, cooked when thoroughly heated through; eel <em class="ital">matelote,</em> octopus <em class="ital">daube, coq-au-vin,</em> and <em class="ital">Bourguignon</em> are but a few variations on a same theme; <em class="ital">tripes à la Niçoise,</em> veal <em class="ital">marengo,</em> lobster <em class="ital">à l’Américaine,</em> and <em class="ital">estocaficada</em> on another that differs essentially only in the choice of moistening agents.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page120">The Mediterranean coast is particularly rich in fish soup or stew traditions. A number of them may be described as fish in tomato sauce or fish and tomato soup, depending on whether water or a <em class="ital">fumet</em> has been added or not. Such is an <em class="ital">aigo-sau</em> (literally “water-salt”)—one or several “white” fish boiled in an onion, tomato, and potato soup, the Provençal fennel and dried orange peel added to the usual bouquet, accompanied by the tempestuous red pepper and garlic <em class="ital">rouille.</em> <em class="ital">Bouillabaisse</em> is never far from mind—the concept representing a sort of absolute value, a yardstick by which other fish stews may be measured. When it is said of an <em class="ital">aigo-sau</em> that it is a preparation for convalescents or persons with delicate stomachs, one may understand that, whatever its virtues, its personality is less startling than that of the <em class="ital">bouillabaisse</em> and its digestibility relatively greater. <em class="ital">Bourride</em> is an <em class="ital">aigo-sau,</em> potatoes eliminated, thickened by slowly stirring the broth into an <em class="ital">aïoli</em> and continuing to stir over very low heat until lightly thickened, then poured over the fish and crusts of bread (the fish may be poached in a light-bodied fish <em class="ital">velouté</em>—its initial body will discourage its breaking while being thickened with the <em class="ital">aïoli;</em> some people enrich it unorthodoxly with the addition of a certain amount of cream).</p>
			<p class="Normal">I have had my say about <em class="ital">bouillabaisse</em> in the <em class="ital">French Menu Cookbook:</em> the Toulonnais add potatoes and mussels to their version and, in Martigues, a “black <em class="ital">bouillabaisse</em>” is made by adding small cuttlefish with their ink; <em class="ital">Revesset</em> is chopped and boiled spinach, chard, and sorrel, small fish—sardines, fresh anchovies, etc.—added a few minutes before serving over garlic-rubbed dried bread slices; <em class="ital">catigot</em> is an inland eel and red wine stew that may or may not be tomatoed and in which the red wine is not cooked long enough—when corrected, it becomes, on the one hand, a simplified <em class="ital">matelote</em> or, on the other, eel in <em class="ital">raito.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">On the Atlantic coast, the fennel and orange peel disappear from the bouquet, butter replaces the olive oil, and a certain amount of white wine is a constant. The fish remain much the same—for any of these stews the choice may be made among hake, haddock, halibut, skate, lemon sole, grey sole, conger eel, fresh cod, mullets, ocean perch, black drum, fluke, perhaps shark and sea squab, and, undoubtedly a great many more. Given enough time to cook, cuttlefish or squid are always good in a stew, but you had best eliminate the strong-flavored and fatty fishes except when they are specifically recommended for a recipe. Mussels or clams may be added. They are all, originally, fishermen’s stews, and one of the principles is the use of cheap fish. The Charentaise <em class="ital">chaudrée</em> is made by putting everything in the pot together—fish, water, white wine, salt (when sea water is not used), chopped onion, crushed garlic, and herbs—and then boiling until done, swirling in butter and serving over dried bread, of course. The Breton <em class="ital">cotriade</em> (recipe following) is a rough country potato and onion soup with a variety of fish thrown in when half cooked.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page121"><a href="j_118-169.xhtml#page143"><em class="ital">Matelote</em></a> is the best known of fresh-water fish stews. It is usually made of eels, but sometimes with perch and carp or with all three. It is made exactly like a red-wine meat stew (except in Alsace, where the local white wine is substituted), with a Bourguignon (little onions, mushrooms, lardons) garnish. The presence of lardons makes no sense to me, and the traditional method of sautéing the fish, cooking it for a quarter of an hour in the red wine and then putting it aside for an hour or two while finishing the sauce, gives much less happy results than if it is prepared simply as a <em class="ital">raito</em>, the olives and capers being replaced by butter-stewed little onions and rapidly sautéed mushrooms.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The Burgundian <em class="ital">pauchouse</em> is rather particular (restaurant versions often include salt pork, flour, and cream, all certainly heretical). It was traditionally made of a thin, nasty, extremely acid little white wine, the vines of which have long since been pulled up. Those who remember it claim the wine was practically undrinkable but that <em class="ital">pauchouses</em> are no longer the same: Pack fish heads and debris (blue-gills, crappies, perch, carp, wall-eyed pike, etc.) into the bottom of a pot with herbs, salt, lots of crushed or broken-up pepper, a couple of heads of unpeeled garlic cloves, the pieces of fish on top, as little open space as possible remaining; pour over a light-bodied, young, very dry white wine to cover; cook at a rolling boil for about 15 minutes; remove fish pieces to a heated deep platter and keep them warm while passing the contents of the pot through a sieve with firm pressure from the pestle and reducing the liquid at a continuing rolling boil; whisk in a generous quantity of butter away from the heat and pour over the fish . . . All very well, but I am happier preparing a <em class="ital">fumet</em> with the heads and whatnot and poaching the fish, rather than boiling it at a roll.</p>

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span> or <span class="oldstyle">5</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Any kind of fish may find its way into a <em class="ital">cotriade.</em> If small, tender-fleshed fish—pilchard, sardines, smelts—are included, they should be whole and added only 5 or 6 minutes before removal from the flame. Originally, the smoky flavor from the bonfire over which the kettle of fish was cooked no doubt enhanced the rough, direct, soul-warming character of the thing. Cider is the usual accompaniment—some readers may share my preference for a Muscadet or other light, dry, young white wine.</p>
			<p class="Normal">One of the particularities of a <em class="ital">cotriade</em> lies in the liquid’s being undersalted. The fish, after being removed from the pot, is then salted by pouring over a ladle or so of the bouillon in which has been dissolved a handful of coarse sea salt. The heavily salted liquid is drained off immediately, and the process is repeated three or four times. The fish absorbs the salt with a certain avidity and must not be left long in contact with the liquid. I much prefer, rather than salting the fish before serving, to distribute small bowls or ramekins of the salty bouillon to each guest, along with others containing the vinegar-crushed pepper mixture; the ritual aspect is attractive and the individual may, dipping first in one, then in the other, season to taste, biteful by biteful.</p>

Continue to cook at a light boil for another 10 or 15 minutes. Remove the fish and vegetables to a hot serving platter, prepare the accompanying salted broth, and serve the rest of the broth apart. Pour the broth, over the crusts of bread first placed in the soup plates, then the fish and vegetables served atop after the bread has been soaked.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page123a">Poached Fish <span class="French-translation">(Poisson Poché)</span></h2>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Rules vary depending on the lawmakers; some claim that only fresh-water fish should be treated in court bouillon, salt-water fish being poached in salt water; furthermore, different court bouillons are often recommended for different fish. As far as I’m concerned, fresh fish of any sort is good poached in salt water; it is better if a bay leaf and a branch of thyme are added; and it is best if treated in a wine court bouillon, the specific proportions of the ingredients not being important. Onion, thyme, bay, white wine, and water are the constants (if dill is used, I prefer to eliminate other herbs); fennel and oregano are also particularly good fish herbs. The following recipe should be considered symbolic—don’t bother to weigh vegetables or measure liquids (fill the saucepan a third or half full with water and when the vegetables are half cooked, pour in as much wine as you like). Leek or celery may be added; add 10 or 15 peppercorns if you like, but only a few minutes before straining—or, if the court bouillon is not strained, add them only when the fish is put in to poach.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST" id="page124">				
				<li class="IL">6 cups water	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">3 or 4 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
				<li class="IL">4 ounces carrots, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
				<li class="IL">4 ounces sweet onions, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
				<li class="IL">Parsley (including root), bay leaf, thyme, fennel (good handful of branches, leaves, flowers, depending on season), oregano</li>
				<li class="IL">2 cups white wine</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Bring the water to a boil, add all the ingredients except the wine (whose acidity will prevent the vegetables from cooking and perfuming the liquid to the fullest degree), simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes, then add the white wine, return to a boil, and continue to cook, covered, for another 20 minutes or so.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A court bouillon in which fish has been poached is a light <em class="ital">fumet,</em> which may form a splendid base for a soup or a sauce.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Crayfish (if you can find them—they are often sold in the United States for fish bait, the only drawback being their smallness) are never so good as when simply cooked in a court bouillon, <em class="ital">à la nage,</em> the central tail flap of each being first dislodged, the attached thread of intestine gently pulled out (an hour’s milk bath is said to remove the intestinal bitterness, but I have not been happy with the results), plunged alive into the boiling liquid, cooked, covered, at a simmer, for no longer than 5 minutes, and left to steep, covered, for another quarter of an hour before serving. The same observation is valuable for lobster, which, in the face of recent prices, one can hardly afford to treat otherwise lest its flavor dissipate in a sauce or its flesh turn coriaceous beneath the broiler flame (for 1½-pound lobsters, simmer for about 10 minutes once the court bouillon has returned to the boiling point, then leave to half cool in the liquid). Both crayfish and lobsters are (to me) better warm than either cold or hot; drawn butter may be added to their court bouillon accompaniment.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page125">Crustaceans aside, poaching means cooking, not at the boiling point or at a simmer, but at a temperature slightly below that of a simmer. Fish slices (no less than an inch thick) are immersed in the hot court bouillon and, if the container is large and heavy, retaining heat well, heating may be discontinued as soon as the liquid approaches the boiling point, the pan kept tightly covered until the poaching time is up. Large whole fish or fish sections are covered with tepid court bouillon, which is slowly returned to a near boil, the heat radically adjusted so that the boiling point may not be reached.</p>
			<p class="Normal">An explanation of timing for poached fish seems always to have frustrated cookbook writers, even such masters as Prosper-Montagné and Escoffier slyly sidestepping the issue and contenting themselves with the observation that the cooking time should be shortened for those fish destined to cool in their court bouillon. I am the more impressed by a note in James Beard’s <em class="ital">American Cookery</em> (he gives credit to the Canadian Department of Fisheries): “Measure the thickness of the fish at its thickest point and estimate ten minutes cooking time per inch, whatever the cooking method. Thus, if you are poaching a whole salmon that measures 4 inches at its thickest point, you will poach it forty minutes. If a fillet is half an inch thick you will sauté it or poach it 5 minutes. To broil a steak of salmon or halibut 1½ inches thick, allow 7½ minutes a side.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">Restaurant habits of tangling up a variety of fish, forcemeats, and sauces (sole, lobster, pike <em class="ital">quenelles, sauce vin blanc,</em> and <em class="ital">sauce à l’Américaine</em> is one of the most often found combinations and is named variously) rarely fail to confuse and tire the palate; a perfectly poached fish accompanied by a single and uncomplicated sauce is always more exciting.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page343"><em class="ital">sauce bâtarde</em></a> may be prepared rapidly at the moment of serving; replace the water in the recipe by the fish’s poaching liquid. Capers are often added.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The following green sauce is beautiful with either cold or hot poached fish.</p>

				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon (or more to taste) capers, rinsed, drained</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">6 anchovy filets (preferably 3 whole anchovies in salt, soaked, fileted, rinsed well, sponged dry, then chopped)</li>

Pound and stir in the soaked bread, then the egg yolks, and, when the mixture is absolutely smooth and uniform, begin dribbling in the olive oil, stirring vigorously and uniformly with the pestle as if mounting a mayonnaise. Taste for seasoning and stir in the vinegar or lemon juice to taste. If prepared ahead of time, the emulsion may not hold, traces of oil separating and appearing at the surface; give it a rapid beating with the pestle just before serving.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page127" style="page-break-before:always;">Nantais Butter Sauce</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Beurre Blanc</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">A good sauce for all poached fish. In the region of its origin it classically accompanies poached northern pike and is made with Breton salt butter (unsalted butter of the best quality is always superior to salted butter in France and I have never made it with salted butter—were one to use it, the salt should be eliminated from the recipe). If using the <a href="f_3-48.xhtml#page47">recommended reduced herb vinegar</a>, add a little more white wine and a bit less vinegar. The color of the vinegar is not specified—if red vinegar is used, the sauce will have a vaguely violet cast, displeasing to some, but good red wine vinegar is usually of better quality than the white vinegars. The quality of shallots is not mentioned either, because the common, or gray, shallot, despite its name, is hard come by. If you can find them (smaller, more warped in shape, the skin a hard shell of a pale gray-beige with a rose cast), don’t hesitate to replace the harsh red shallots by these in any recipe calling for shallots.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The utter simplicity of the thing, the paucity of elements, the absence of a binder . . . have engendered a wariness, distrust, or unbelief, than which there are no solider foundations on which to construct a myth. The story goes that only a very special kind of culinary genius with an inborn and mysterious twist of the wrist can produce a successful <em class="ital">beurre blanc;</em> the fact appears to be that few have ever tried, assuming it to be a lost cause. And restaurant <em class="ital">beurres blancs</em> suggest that the infidel ranks count a heavy professional population, for many are really light <em class="ital">sabayons,</em> an egg yolk having been sneaked in to hold the thing together or a few breadcrumbs added to the reduction to reinforce the body.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page128">For years, La Mère Michel, who is now retired, was the undisputed <em class="ital">beurre blanc</em> queen of Paris (for a time there was a pretender whose version I tasted only once—it was a <em class="ital">sabayon</em>). Her little <em class="ital">beurre blanc</em> temple in the rue Rennequin could seat but twenty-odd clients; the menu was short (I only remember pike, turbot, and a couple of other poached fish, all accompanied by the famous <em class="ital">beurre blanc,</em> a tarragon chicken sauté, and a kidney sauté—a good Muscadet and a good Beaujolais) and the kitchen, visible from the dining room, was a cubbyhole most of whose space was consumed by an antique range. Throughout the service, Madame Michel stood just inside the entrance to the kitchen whisking up <em class="ital">beurre blanc</em> after <em class="ital">beurre blanc,</em> each impeccable, in a small, chipped, and battered saucepan of the trashy, enameled, dimestore variety. I believe that she was quite proud to be able to exhibit this bit of hardware, for it lent force to the legend of her magic wrist (about which much was written in those years). To suggest that her secret lay elsewhere than in her wrist is not to detract from a very genuine talent and taste: She knew every square inch of her stove by heart—the precise quality of heat emanating from any given point of its surface; when working with a cast-iron kitchen range that is also an old friend, ambrosia may be concocted in tin cans.</p>
			<p class="Normal">With a less loyal stove surface, the qualities of the saucepan assume greater importance (small and heavy—copper, enameled cast-ironware, earthenware . . .) and one’s control of the heat must be precise; use an asbestos pad if working over a naked gas flame. Work in a relaxed manner—use a small whisk, holding it casually, as a pencil is usually held (thumb and index outstretched, the whisk stayed by the knuckle side of the third finger, the two others curled out of the way). The sauce will break only if the heat is too high. The proportions given produce a fairly strong sauce whose flavor may be attenuated by the addition of a couple of ounces more butter.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Leftover <em class="ital">beurre blanc,</em> chilled, can satisfactorily replace a <em class="ital">marchand de vin</em> butter, chunks served over grilled steak—or it may be transformed into a <em class="ital">sabayon,</em> crumbled into a saucepan with a bit of cold water and one or two egg yolks, depending on the amount of butter, whisked until mounted in a <em class="ital">bain-marie,</em> the water kept beneath a boil.</p>

Remove the pan from the heat for a half minute or so—long enough to cool slightly. Regulate the heat to <em class="ital">very</em> low, add about an ounce of the cut-up butter to the pan, and return it to the heat, whisking. Add more butter, approximately an ounce at a time (7 or 8 additions) as each addition begins to disappear, only a trace of solid butter in sight. As the last addition disappears into the sauce, remove the saucepan from the heat, continuing to whisk for a few seconds. The sauce is a rich, creamy emulsion—not thick but with a distinct, firm body. It is only warm and, to avoid loss of heat, is best served directly from the saucepan. If form dictates the use of a sauceboat, warm it first to the approximate temperature of the sauce—no more.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The term is arbitrary. It is most often used in a discussion of wine and food marriages to embrace a preparation-type that best accompanies a nervous and fruity, but full-bodied white wine—one of the white Burgundies, for instance. In that context, it nearly always means a sauce with a <em class="ital">fumet</em> and/or <em class="ital">velouté</em> base.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><a href="h_63-89.xhtml#page83"><em class="ital">Fumet</em></a> is stock; it is the preceding court bouillon packed full of fish carcasses and strained when finished. <em class="ital">Velouté</em> is <em class="ital">fumet</em> lightly bound with flour and butter roux and cooked gently, reduced and skimmed, over a period of ½ hour.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page130">Most preparations in this category are fish (filets best lend themselves) poached in a relatively small amount of <em class="ital">fumet,</em> whose reduction then serves as the base or as an enrichment for the final sauce. (Fish loaves, <em class="ital">mousselines,</em> turbans, molded <em class="ital">paupiettes,</em> “poached dry” in a <em class="ital">bain-marie,</em> may be accompanied by the same sauces, prepared separately, reduced <em class="ital">fumet</em> replacing the reduced poaching liquid. A <em class="ital">velouté,</em> sometimes creamed, often combined with a certain amount of <em class="ital">duxelles,</em> is the usual sauce for fish gratins—raw filets arranged in buttered gratin dish either on a bed of the sauce or of a garnishing element such as stewed sorrel, mushroom purée, etc., sprinkled often with white wine or sherry, covered with the hot gratin sauce, sprinkled with butter-cooked breadcrumbs, baked in a hot oven until sauce is bubbling and surface lightly colored—about 15 minutes.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">The sauces are of three kinds: (1) The poaching liquid is drained into a saucepan, reduced over a high flame to a syrupy consistency, and butter is whisked in away from the heat—there is no <em class="ital">velouté,</em> only the gelatinous reduction and the emulsion of butter forming the body of the sauce; (2) The poaching liquid is reduced and added to a <em class="ital">velouté</em> (heavy cream may be added to taste), the sauce may be reduced if necessary, and butter—a couple of tablespoons or 4 or 5 times that much—is whisked in away from the heat; the procedure is identical to that of a <em class="ital">sauce suprême</em> for poached chicken; (3) The sauce is thickened with egg yolks, either (a) whisked into the partially cooled reduction of <em class="ital">fumet</em> poaching liquid and mounted (like a hollandaise) with butter in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> or over very low heat, or (b) diluted with a certain amount of partially cooled <em class="ital">velouté,</em> stirred back into the <em class="ital">velouté</em> and reduced poaching liquid and finished like a <em class="ital">blanquette,</em> stirring constantly over low heat and removing from the heat well before the boiling point is reached. (Egg yolks enrich a sauce, but that need not necessarily mean that they improve it. With these fish sauces, egg yolks make the first two less easily digestible while also masking the quality of the <em class="ital">fumet.</em>)</p>
			<p class="Normal">Mushrooms, if included in the garnish, are usually precooked with a bit of lemon juice, a couple of spoonsful of water, seasonings, and a dab of butter for a couple of minutes, and their cooking liquid may be added to the fish’s poaching liquid. Mussels are also a <a href="j_118-169.xhtml#page150a">common garnishing element and a part of their liquid</a>, the quantity depending on its saltiness, may be joined to the basic <em class="ital">fumet</em> poaching liquid. Occasionally, as with the <em class="ital">Dugléré</em> preparations, no <em class="ital">fumet</em> is used for poaching (the fish is poached with chopped shallots, chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes,</em> peeled, seeded, chopped tomatoes, and white wine) and a fairly stiff <em class="ital">velouté</em> is joined to the reduced poaching liquid to add it body before whisking in butter away from the heat. A handful of shredded raw young sorrel leaves added to the sauce a minute or so before it is finished will give a completely different effect than the incorporation of the butter-stewed and pureed sorrel of the following recipe . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page131">Play around; with the above <em class="ital">données</em> and your own imagination endless recipes can be created. As long as you remain fearful of the boiling point (don’t boil the fish or it will dry out; don’t try to incorporate butter into a boiling sauce or it will turn to oil; don’t let a sauce containing egg yolks approach a boil or it will break), nothing can go wrong.</p>

The initial <em class="ital">velouté</em> should be very lightly bound with flour (most people overthicken sauces); subsequent reduction and the sorrel purée will give it needed body and the terminal incorporation of butter will suffuse it with velvet.

			<p class="Normal">Soak the filets in cold water for a few minutes, sponge them dry, flatten them slightly with the side of a large knife blade, and, skin side up, slit the thin surface membrane of each, diagonally, at approximately 1-inch intervals. Sprinkle lightly with salt, grind over a bit of pepper, and fold each filet in two, membrane inside (slitting and folding prevent deformation while poaching). Choose a low-sided heavy cooking vessel just large enough to hold the folded filets placed side by side; a copper <em class="ital">plat à sauter</em> is perfect, but a cast-iron enamelware frying pan or an earthenware <em class="ital">poëlon</em> will do.

Press a buttered round of parchment paper over the surface, cover the pan tightly, and bring to the boiling point, shaking the pan gently from time to time to ensure the liquid’s regular absorption of heat and lifting the lid to check progress. As soon as the boiling point is reached, turn off the heat and leave, tightly covered, to poach for about 8 minutes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">While the filets are poaching you should whisk the sorrel purée into the <em class="ital">velouté,</em> adding as much cream as the sauce can support without becoming too thin, and return it to a boil, reducing a bit, if necessary—more cream may be added along with the reduced poaching liquid if the body will then support it.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page133">Stuffed Baked Fish <span class="French-translation">(Poisson Farci au Four)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">A fish like the sea bass, with relatively firm flesh and an uncomplicated bone structure, is best for stuffing. It is possible simply to stuff the gutted cavity and sew it up, lace it up with the help of toothpicks or leave it open, but it seems a pity that the stuffing isn’t more of an integral part of the preparation as a whole; there is little interpenetration of flavors when a fish is stuffed in this way, and serving it is messy, the stuffing being separated from the flesh by the ribcage-like skeletal structure—the filets must be separated above and below from the backbone and the stuffing spooned out apart. When it is possible to obtain fresh ungutted fish, I prefer to bone it from the back (the bulk of the guts may first be drawn out with one’s fingers through the gills, tearing the gills loose first and gently pulling out all attached material), slitting down to each side of the backbone, keeping the blade of the knife in touch with it, cutting through the bone near the base of the head and at about an inch’s distance from the tail and working the bone structure free without piercing the abdomen. Boned in this way, the fish may be stuffed, the flesh molded around the stuffing, and baked, back up and open, boat-like.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If the fish has already been gutted and the abdomen slit, carefully work all of the curved bones surrounding the abdominal cavity free, one by one, with your fingers, breaking them loose at their point of attachment to the backbone, then free the backbone from the flesh, slitting to each side of the anal fin and using your fingers and the tip of a small sharp knife to loosen the bones from the flesh toward the back; clip through the bone at the base of the head and near the tail as before and remove it. Tear out the gills. Boned in this way, a fish is cooked on its side.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To stuff a flat fish of the sole or flounder variety, leave the white, underside skin (it protects the flesh while cooking), scraping it well to remove the tiny scales. Rip off the dark topside skin, removing the eyes with it (or ask your fishmonger to do it): Hold a towel or paper towels in each hand to keep the fish from slipping; slit the skin across the base of the tail, start tearing it loose carefully from the flesh in one piece, then grasp it firmly and pull, holding the fish’s tail firmly against the tabletop with the heel of your other hand. Keep the fish white skin side down and operate as if you were going to filet it, using, preferably, a sharp, slender, flexible-bladed knife: Cut the length of the lateral line (describing the path of the vertebrae) with the tip of the knife to begin loosening each filet; then, holding the knife firmly and almost flatly against the bone, slice the filet free, down its length, leaving it attached to the flesh and small root bones of the fins. Break the spinal bone at four points by bending the body of the fish (folding it, white skin inside) and free it from the fish, section by section, with fingertips and knife tip. The presentation of a stuffed flat fish is of the prettiest; the form resembles somewhat a partially opened coin purse.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page134">Stuffings</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The different mixtures suggested for <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page401">“Split, Stuffed Baked Chicken”</a> serve fish well also. An egg-bound bread and butter stuffing generously flavored with chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> is good. Variations on the classical <em class="ital">mousseline</em> forcemeat apart, I was surprised, upon gathering together my notes on fish stuffings, to realize to what extent they resemble one another, an abundance of green stuff, in particular, marking each. The following three are characteristic.</p>
			<p class="Normal">(1) For a 2½-pound sea bass: ½ pound chopped whiting filet; green parts of 1 pound chard, parboiled, squeezed dry, chopped; ¼ pound mushrooms, chopped or passed through Mouli-juliènne, and sautéed in butter till dry; 2 ounces crumbled crustless stale bread soaked in ½ cup heavy cream; 1½ ounces finely chopped green onions; 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh marjoram; handful chopped parsley; 1 egg; salt, pepper, nutmeg. Buttered gratin dish, white wine in bottom; dabs of butter on stuffed fish, covered loosely with aluminum foil; baste regularly after 15 minutes; 35 minutes in 400° oven.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page135">(2) For a 10- to 12-ounce sole: Open 1 quart mussels with white wine, herbs. Stuffing: 2 chopped sole filets; handful parboiled, squeezed, chopped chard; handful finely crumbled soft, crustless bread; finely crumbled oregano; 1 egg; salt, pepper; heavy cream. Buttered gratin dish scattered with chopped shallots, white wine; 20 minutes, hot oven, aluminum foil, basted; reduce basting juices and mussel liquid to syrup; add butter away from heat, add mussels, pour over fish.</p>
			<p class="Normal">(3) For 6 <em class="ital">paupiettes:</em> 6 sole-type filets, soaked in cold water, sponged dry, flattened, skin-side membrane slit at intervals (as in preceding recipe), each fitted into its own round, buttered ramekin, skin side facing in, forming a circular wall, the bottom of the ramekin remaining uncovered. Stuffing: ½ pound fish filets chopped; 1 pound spinach, parboiled, squeezed dry, chopped; 3 tablespoons softened butter; 3 egg yolks; salt, pepper. Pack stuffing into lined ramekins, poach in <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> covered with foil, 375°, 10 to 12 minutes or until centers are firm to the touch; unmold, first onto flat wire or slotted skimming spoon to drain, then slip each onto a bed of creamed mushroom purée, creamed sorrel, or a <em class="ital">velouté</em>-based sauce (with peeled, seeded, chopped, butter-stewed tomato added, for instance)—or serve them ungarnished, a <em class="ital">beurre blanc</em> apart.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is gratifying to note that the cooking times all correspond very closely to the 10-minutes-per-inch theory. The quality of all these rustic stuffings depends on the fish and the green stuff being chopped by hand (2 or 3 minutes’ work, in all); puréed mechanically, the fish will be dry and the pleasant, coarse texture of the greens will be destroyed.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Arrange about 20 of the largest and most perfectly formed lettuce leaves in a saucepan, add salt, pour over boiling water, return to a simmer for a minute or so, and drain, pouring carefully into a sieve or colander so as not to damage the leaves or bunch them up into a mass. Run a bit of cold water over to cool them and delicately, one by one, lift them out and spread them on a towel to drain.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Wrap the fish from head to tail (muzzle and tail tip remaining exposed): First salt and pepper the fish’s surface; arrange overlapping leaves of lettuce the length of the belly section, the rib ends gently tucked beneath the fish and the fragile leaf extremities pressed to the surface. Repeat the process along the length of the back, tucking rib tips under and pressing the leaves well into place. Turn the fish over, placing it in an elongated buttered gratin dish, the bottom of which has been scattered with chopped shallots; salt and pepper the newly exposed surface and repeat the performance with the lettuce leaves so that, when finished, the fish is firmly wrapped, mummy-like.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page137">Dribble the dry vermouth over its surface, pour the white wine into the bottom of the gratin dish, adding the section (or broken sections) of bone that was removed from the fish, line the surface of the fish with dabs of butter, press over lightly a sheet of aluminum foil (or buttered parchment), and bake for about 30 minutes at 400° to 425°, basting regularly during the last 15 minutes. Transfer, with the help of spatulas (first detaching muzzle and tail tip from sides of dish if they are touching) to a heated serving dish, discard the bones, pour the juices into a small saucepan, reduce to a light syrup, add the cream, and reduce at a high boil, stirring, by approximately half or until the liquid takes on the consistency of a light sauce (whisk in a couple of tablespoons of butter away from the heat, if you like), and pour it over the fish.

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page137a">Grilled Fish <span class="French-translation">(Poissons Grillés)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Any fish can be rubbed with oil or brushed with melted butter, seasoned and grilled, served simply with lemon. A sauce, cold or warm, served apart—like the <a href="j_118-169.xhtml#page126">green sauce</a>, one of the mayonnaise derivatives or béarnaise, choron (peeled, seeded, chopped tomato, butter-stewed until all liquid has disappeared, incorporated into a béarnaise), hollandaise, etc.—is particularly good with grilled slices of large fish.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To me—and to a great many people—grilled fish is associated with the Mediterranean, with a fairly limited variety of fish, with olive oil, fennel, and, of course, with wood coals. On the French Mediterranean coast, the fish most admired for this purpose are the <em class="ital">rouget de roche,</em> the <em class="ital">loup de mer,</em> and the various <em class="ital">dorades</em> (and closely related <em class="ital">sars, pageots,</em> etc.). Their near equivalents in American waters are red mullet, sea bass, and the porgies.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In the droll world of fish grillery, passions are easily aroused in defense of principles: The purists proclaim it criminal to scale, gut, season, or oil a fish before grilling it. Assuming the fish to be of the morning’s catch, that might be all right were one permitted to season it at the table, but the high priests of the order are an unbending lot (a whole family of them operates a celebrated and very silly restaurant in Marseilles); and then there is the incendiary school, whose fish, after being grilled, must be offered up in a holocaust of brandy and fennel branches.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page138">Hinged, double-faced grills are practically essential because of the fragility of the flesh, which would otherwise stick and tear in the turning. Those for small fish or flat fish are square and flat; for large fish they are oval and swelled, describing the form of the fish, and they exist in different sizes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The fish gains from marinating, but involved marinades do not seem interesting to me. Fennel is a perfect herb for delicately flavored white-fleshed fish; sardines, fresh anchovies, mackerel, or herring are better with a stronger herb (of which my own choice is usually oregano). Enough olive oil to coat the fish well, salt and pepper, and either a bit of white wine or lemon juice are all that is necessary. If fish is prepared with fennel, a tablespoonful or so of pastis (Pernod 51 or Ricard) in the marinade will reinforce the slight anise flavor. The abdominal and head cavity of a large fish may be stuffed with a healthy bouquet of fennel branches, which helps perfume the flesh while lending the fish a full, attractive form.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Small fish (2½ to 3½ ounces), gutted but unscaled and well coated in their marinade, profit from being rolled, each, into a large (grape) vine leaf before being grilled over intense red coals for only a couple of minutes on each side—long enough to char the leaf, which, when unrolled and discarded, takes the skin of the fish with it, leaving moist and flavorful filets exposed. When small red mullets neither scaled nor gutted (or, if gutted, the liver left intact and inside) are marinated in olive oil and quantities of fresh feathery chopped fennel leaves and grilled this way, they are among the very sublime things of the sea. Olive oil is the only sauce necessary—the liver may be mashed with it at table to serve as a heavier sauce.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Before marinating a large fish, score the flesh diagonally at intervals (or cut a serpentine design to the bone at the thickest part of the fish) so that it will cook more evenly and, if the unaggressive fennel weed is an element in the marinade, be certain that the scored parts are well garnished with it. To grill a large fish, the bed of coals should be fairly deep and well sustained, but their intensity should have died somewhat, a gray film of ash masking the red glow. The fish should be at a 3- to 4-inch distance from the bed of coals; it should be turned every 4 or 5 minutes; and, after having been turned once, it should be basted often but not abundantly (to prevent the oil from dropping onto the coals and flaming up) with its marinade, adding more olive oil if necessary. A 1- to 3-pound fish will generally require a corresponding 10 to 30 minutes’ cooking time, depending on the relative thickness of the fish. It is done when the flesh at the thickest point—behind the abdominal cavity and an inch or two below the base of the head—has turned from slightly translucent to milky-opaque next to the bone and is easily detachable, no longer clinging stubbornly; test with a knife tip—the flesh should not be “flaky.” Olive oil is the best sauce.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page139">Fish in Aluminum Papillote <span class="French-translation">(Poisson en Papillote D’aluminium)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">More interesting for larger fish, I think—I have most often prepared salmon, trout and bass in this way. The aluminum casing is not particularly attractive from the point of view of serving but, apart from being easy to arrange, it has the advantage over parchment paper of permitting the enclosure of a certain amount of liquid with the fish. The fish may be marinated as for a grilled fish and enclosed in the <em class="ital">papillote</em> with its marinade; it may be simply enclosed with a scattering of chopped shallots and 2 or 3 tablespoonsful of white wine, plus a handful of shredded sorrel; it may be placed on a scattering of <em class="ital">mirepoix</em> or <em class="ital">duxelles,</em> with more of the same spread atop and a bit of white wine added—and so forth. Allow a generous amount of foil—about 4 inches at each end of the fish. Place the foil on the baking sheet before garnishing it: Put the dry materials and the seasoned fish in place, slices of butter atop, and pull the borders of the foil up gently, boat-like, around the fish before pouring in the bit of wine. Fold the edges together, doubly or triply, pinching tightly, beginning at the summit and working first to one end and then to the other—it must be airtight and plenty of space should be left inside the sealed <em class="ital">papillote.</em> Bake in a 400° to 450° oven, using the 10-minutes-per-inch time measure. Transfer the package to a heated serving platter, slitting it open at table. The juices are sauce enough.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page140">Salt Cod <span class="French-translation">(Morue)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Salt cod is sold in filets or in sections cut from the filet. The abdominal section, although passable in recipes calling for poached, flaked cod, is often discolored and, in any case, is inferior in quality to the thickest part of the tail section—it is altogether unsatisfactory for preparations requiring pan-fried pieces. Buy, preferably, high up on the tail and choose that which is whitest. The Icelandic salt cod is the kind most often used in France.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Salt cod is considered a vulgar thing by most people, which does not prevent a great many from adoring it—those who do not may always have tasted it boiled, dry and woolly, or have never tasted it at all. In those parts of the world where it forms an important part of the diet, it is rarely soaked long enough for the unaccustomed palate. (Some Provençal cookbooks offer, as a sort of folklorique curiosity, a recipe for unsoaked salt cod, wiped free of surface salt and grilled over hot coals, accompanied by potatoes in their skins and whole heads of garlic roasted in the ashes. Plenty of chilled rosé is necessary to wash it down, and it is much more current fare than one might imagine.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">All salt cod, even of the same origin, is not salted to the same degree, and it is difficult to give precise instructions for soaking. Written instructions usually call for an overnight soaking; many readers may prefer to put it to soak the morning of the day preceding its preparation—from 24 to 36 hours, in all. Place it in a colander immersed in a large basin of cold water, changing the water regularly—at least four or five times. The volume doubles approximately during the soaking, and one may tell by pinching if the structure of the flesh has more or less returned to its original undehydrated state.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page141">For many preparations, it is first poached—and it must not boil: Cover the piece of cod generously with cold water, bring slowly to a near boil, turning the heat to a bare minimum the moment the water’s surface shows signs of movement, and poach in the hot but not simmering water for from 7 to 10 minutes—or sometimes for as long as 20 minutes, depending on the thickness and the length of soaking time—or until the flesh at its thickest point shows little resistance to the tip of a sharp knife (for an <em class="ital">aïoli,</em> it may remain a couple of minutes longer in the poaching water). It should be only just done. When recipes call for “flaked” poached cod, it is not literally flaked—or, at least, no more than necessary to remove all the bones, and it must, above all, not be shredded or crushed; the fatty skin is removed and all the bones are removed; try to damage the flesh as little as possible, keeping it in the largest possible pieces.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Flaked salt cod is sometimes warmed up in an egg yolk-thickened <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page343"><em class="ital">sauce bâtarde</em></a> made from the poaching liquid (assuming it’s not too salty, which it would be if the cod were under-soaked) and served with boiled potatoes; it is often associated with cut-up hard-boiled eggs in a <em class="ital">béchamel</em> or, which is better, prepare eggs <em class="ital">à la tripe,</em> incorporate flaked cod, and scatter with butter-crisp croutons. Or, still with hard-boiled eggs, prepare a gratin, the gratin dish lined with generously creamed, butter-stewed sorrel, a layer of cut-up eggs or egg slices and flaked cod, creamed sorrel on top, sprinkled with lightly buttered-colored breadcrumbs, gratinéed in a hot oven—or replace the creamed sorrel with Provençal spinach sauce (parboiled, squeezed, chopped spinach, finely chopped garlic, chopped or pounded anchovy filets, seasonings, cooked for a few minutes, stirring, in an olive oil and flour roux, milk stirred in, cooked gently for 15 to 20 minutes) and replace the buttered crumbs with dry crumbs and a dribbled crisscrossing of olive oil. Chopped leeks, first parboiled for 10 or 12 minutes and squeezed free of excess liquid, mixed with an egg and cream quiche mixture, a layer in the bottom of a buttered gratin dish, a layer of flaked cod, another of the leek mix, sprinkled with grated Parmesan and baked until swelled and browned is another happy gratin.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">À la Provençal,</em> the flaked cod is simmered for a few minutes in the standard stewed tomato mixture (chopped onion cooked in olive oil, peeled, seeded, chopped tomato, white wine, <em class="ital">persillade</em> added—strips of sweet pepper may be first cooked with the onion, a pinch of saffron may be added, black olives may be added . . .). Better, however, are sections of lightly floured cod pan fried in olive oil, as for the <em class="ital">raito,</em> and simmered gently in the tomato sauce for a few minutes; a pilaf is a good accompaniment. <em class="ital">A la Lyonnaise,</em> the flaked cod is tossed at the last minute with sliced boiled potatoes and sliced onions, each sautéed separately in olive oil, and chopped parsley—the pan is rinsed with a couple of tablespoons of vinegar, which is dribbled over the mixture.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page142">A <em class="ital">bouillabaisse de morue</em> is a soup prepared like that for <em class="ital">bouillabaisse Borgne,</em> in which cod sections are poached for 15 minutes (but more often they are deliberately overcooked at a rolling boil).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Many consider <em class="ital">brandade</em> to be salt cod’s essential raison d’etre; I have never understood the common passion for it. If you want to prepare it, the proportions are about 1½ cups olive oil and ½ cup boiling milk per pound (weighed unsoaked) of slightly under-poached, flaked cod: Add a clove or two of pureed raw garlic to the cod and beat it with a wooden spoon in ½ cup hot olive oil over a high flame until reduced to a purée; remove to very low heat, continue beating and incorporate the remaining oil at a dribble, alternating additions of hot milk; season to taste, peppering generously, and scatter with croutons. It looks like mashed potatoes.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Aïoli</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first"><em class="ital">Aïoli</em> is garlic mayonnaise. Poached salt cod is its constant companion, and around it is built another of the sacred Provençal mystiques. It crowns village festivals: Each summer Provençal villages organize festivals lasting three or four days each, involving orchestras, dancing, music-hall attractions, local talent shows, and fireworks, the final day winding up with an <em class="ital">aïoli monstre</em> in the public square, the entire population turning out to pile plates high with boiled salt cod, potatoes, carrots, green beans, artichokes, chick-peas, beets, hard-boiled eggs, snails, squid stew, and huge globs of garlic mayonnaise, liberally moistened with the local rosé. And it is the unquestioned Friday luncheon for countless Provençaux: The local shops in the villages of the Var soak quantities of salt cod on Thursday and sell it the following morning for the luncheon <em class="ital">aïoli.</em> In Solliès-Toucas, the local butcher prepares <em class="ital">aïoli,</em> boils up salt cod, potatoes, carrots, and snails and portions them out to long waiting lines, each person with an empty dish in hand, between 11:30 and 12:30 every Friday. Snails alone are accompanied by <em class="ital">aïoli</em> for the Christmas Eve supper, no doubt because that evening the cod finds itself obligatorily stewed in a <em class="ital">raito</em> or a <em class="ital">capilotade.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">To most outsiders, how the mere thought of boiled salt cod, boiled vegetables, and garlic mayonnaise can transport a solid block of the meridional French population to heights of ecstasy must remain forever incomprehensible; and after having shared an <em class="ital">aïoli</em> at a Provençal table, one may find puzzling the medico-analeptic, stomachic properties so earnestly claimed for it (I have read in one of the Marseilles newspapers that, if certain persons find <em class="ital">aïoli</em> indigestible, it is simply because too little garlic has been included in its confection, a minimum of four cloves per person being necessary . . .). The combination of raw garlic and an egg yolk emulsion is not particularly digestible and, allied to the inevitable chilled rosé wine, the effect can be deadly (certain non-indigens pretend that only red wine may be drunk with an <em class="ital">aïoli</em> and others dismally, but perhaps correctly, assert that only water is possible).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page146">A good <em class="ital">aïoli</em> is made with good olive oil. It is, traditionally, prepared in a marble mortar with a wooden pestle; the weight of the mortar prevents it from slip-sliding around as one turns the pestle with one hand while dribbling the oil with the other. I know of no other method as easy or as successful—and certainly no other receptacle from which to serve can be as handsome as the marble mortar. A good <em class="ital">aïoli</em> should be mounted slowly, rhythmically, and regularly, the pestle turned always in the same direction (clockwise is easiest for me) and, when finished, should be stiff and heavy, with a sweaty surface. The blender has now invaded the Provençal kitchen, and few <em class="ital">aïolis</em> are now mounted by hand; a blender <em class="ital">aïoli</em> is lighter, air having been whipped into it, and the flavor is altogether different, the violence—how, I do not know—destroying the fruit of the olive oil; nor is the body voluptuously oily, as in the hand-mounted product, but dry and flat.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Avoid any garlic cloves that are not firm and crisp or at the heart of which a green germ has begun to form. The oil and the egg yolks should both be room temperature to discourage the <em class="ital">aïoli</em>’s breaking. It is easy enough to control the flow of oil with one’s thumb held over the bottle top (beginning drop by drop, moving into a tiny but continuous thread until the body is firmly in control and continuing with a heavier thread)—or a narrow V-shape may be cut from the length of a cork before corking the bottle, thus leaving a tiny opening for the dribbling process.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Some people pound a lump of crustless bread, soaked and squeezed dry, into the garlic and egg-yolk mixture before beginning to add the oil. A more easily digestible but less silken <em class="ital">aïoli</em> may be prepared by substituting a boiled potato (about 3 ounces—cooled until only tepid) for the egg yolks.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page147">Most French authors content themselves with quoting Reboul’s recipe from <em class="ital">La Cuisinière Provençale;</em> I can do no better (although I think it wiser to begin with 2 egg yolks rather than x and to turn them until their yellow pales before beginning to add the oil; and, for my own purposes, I am content to use no more than 3 or 4 cloves of garlic for this batch of <em class="ital">aïoli,</em> presumably destined to serve 7 or 8—garlic cloves in the south of France do tend to be about double the size of those in the United States):</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-noind">Take two cloves of garlic per person, peel them, place them in a mortar, reduce them to a paste with a pestle; add a pinch of salt, an egg yolk and pour in the oil in a thin thread while turning with the pestle. Take care to add the oil very slowly and, during this time, never stop turning; you should obtain a thick pommade. After having added about three or four tablespoons of oil, add the juice of a lemon and a tea–spoonful of tepid water, continue to add oil little by little and, when the pommade again becomes too thick, add another few drops of water, without which it falls apart, so to speak, the oil separating itself from the rest.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If, despite all precautions, this accident should occur, one must remove everything from the mortar, put into it another egg yolk, a few drops of lemon juice and, little by little, spoonful by spoonful, add the unsuccessful <span class="text-italic">aïoli</span> while turning the pestle constantly. This one calls “reinstating the <span class="text-italic">aïoli”</span> <em class="ital">(relever l’aïoli).</em></p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The eel’s serpentine form apparently offends many people. There can be no other explanation for its lack of popularity. It is no rarity in American waters but, because of the little demand for it, one may have to order it in advance. Eels live for a long time out of water and should be alive when purchased. Gutted, cut into sections, skewered with alternate slices of lemon and grilled over hot coals, they need not be skinned; the fatty skin protects the flesh while cooking, the excess fat drops into the coals, and the skin is easily removed at the table (the Bordelais sauté them as in the following recipe, cut up but unskinned—the result is unpleasantly fatty). For all other preparations, they should be skinned: Rap the back of the head sharply against the edge of a table to knock the eel unconscious, cut a circular incision all around the base of the head, cutting slightly into the flesh, grasp the head firmly in one hand, holding it in a towel to prevent its slipping, and peel the skin, glove-like, from the body, turning it inside out; it is difficult to get it started and pliers can be useful, but once begun, it slips off easily (Midwesterners will recognize the process as identical to that of skinning bullheads and catfish). Slit the skin-like flesh the length of the abdomen, gut the fish, cut off the head, and rinse thoroughly (for the sake of presentation, the head is usually left attached, the tail in the mouth, if the eel is to be braised whole on a bed of <em class="ital">mirepoix</em> and moistened with white wine and <em class="ital">fumet</em>).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page148">The nineteenth century gave a large place to eel dishes, probably because, apart from the real delicacy of the flesh, whole, boned, stuffed (usually with a pike or whiting <em class="ital">mousseline</em> base, <em class="ital">duxelles</em> often added, sometimes truffled), and braised large specimens lend themselves to spectacular presentation.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Today most larger eels end up in red wine <em class="ital">matelotes,</em> occasionally in <em class="ital">fricassées</em> (the Alsatian <em class="ital">matelote</em> is a <em class="ital">fricassée,</em> white wine and <em class="ital">fumet</em> moistening, garnish of mushrooms and little onions, egg yolk and cream terminal binder), and small eels are usually sautéed like that in the following recipe, but for the presence of grated lemon peel. In recent years, eel terrines and <em class="ital">pâtés</em> have become one of the trademarks of fashionable restaurants (alternating layers of eel filets, rapidly sautéed in butter, and <em class="ital">mousselines,</em> often one of salmon and another of a white-fleshed fish; pistachios, chopped truffles, etc.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">A French version of the delicious cold Flemish hors d’oeuvre, <em class="ital">anguille au vert,</em> is sometimes prepared with small, sectioned eels—butter-stewed with an abundance of fresh herbs (recipes call for sorrel, nettle, parsley, tarragon, chervil, fresh sage, savory, burnet, and a bouquet—or a sprinkling of thyme and a loose bay leaf; sorrel dominates and, in practice, shredded spinach usually replaces nettle; burnet, the most boring of herbs, and chervil, whose fragile beauty is lost in such a rough and tumble mixture, may both be eliminated), moistened with white wine and water (beer in the Flemish original), cooked for 10 minutes and thickened with egg yolks (2 yolks per cup or so of liquid, with usual precautions: Cool a bit, stir some of the liquid into the yolks first, then stir back into the stew, stir over low heat until slightly thickened—do not approach the boiling point), lemon juice to taste.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Brush or scrape mussels (Americans brush, French scrape), pulling out the fragment of seaweed, or beard, that protrudes from the back. Discard any whose shells are cracked or broken and test each between your fingers to be certain of its live resistance to opening (occasionally a mud-filled shell, heavier than a live mussel, turns up). Soak in a generous quantity of salt water for 15 or 20 minutes so that they may disgorge much of the sand contained in them.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page151">To open mussels, put them into a large saucepan or pot, throw in a handful of chopped onion, 3 or 4 crushed cloves of garlic, thyme, bay leaf, a handful of parsley (whole or chopped), and some white wine—a half cup, more or less. Cover tightly and place over a high flame, shaking and tossing the contents (while holding the lid tightly in place) from time to time over a period of from 3 to 4 minutes to 10 minutes or so, depending on the size of the container and the quantity of mussels. Remove from the heat as soon as most of them are opened (the remainder can be forced open with a knife—and are often the best). With a chunk of butter and a healthy grinding of pepper added before heating, this is the simplest version of <em class="ital">moules marinières</em> and the one that is served in small restaurants throughout France, the mussels piled high in soup plates and the liquid ladled over.</p>
			<p class="Normal">As a preliminary preparation for other recipes, the mussels are removed from their shells (unless destined to be sauced and served on the half-shell) and put aside and the liquid is strained through finely woven cloth to eliminate any sand. It then serves as a stock—it should be tasted and its saltiness taken into consideration for eventual use.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Much more rapid than stuffed mussels and also a typically Provençal mussel and spinach preparation (and one which, to the ravishment of the restaurant’s clients, never quits the daily menu at Chez-Hiély in Avignon) consists of stirring together a heavily creamed <em class="ital">velouté</em> made of the opening liquid (the basic <em class="ital">velouté</em> may be quite thick and relatively salty, the addition of cream attenuating the one and the other), parboiled, squeezed, and chopped spinach tossed rapidly in a bit of olive oil, and the shelled mussels; the mixture is then gratinéed in a hot oven or beneath high heat. <em class="ital">Palourdes</em> (which may be replaced by littleneck clams) are also prepared in this way.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page152">When preparing stuffed mussels, the business of tying each mussel up is quite tiresome; those who are tempted not to bother will probably be happy with the results, but the stuffing and the sauce will have intermingled to form a general sameness of texture and taste and the mussels within the shells will have withered. When tied, the effect is very different: The fragile, membranous flesh of mussels opened alive clings, lining the inside wall of each shell half; when packed with the stuffing and tied firmly closed, the flesh has no space in which to shrink at contact with heat and gathers itself instead around the heart of stuffing, enveloping it in a neat sheath; the stuffing retains its own character, which forms a contrast to that of the sauce.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page154">The Mediterranean <em class="ital">pontine</em> (or <em class="ital">poutina</em>), tiny minnows of a number of closely related fish, for the most part sardines and anchovies, may, for all practical purposes, be considered to be the same thing as whitebait, minnows of their more northern cousins herrings and sprats, dominating in the English version; it is reasonable to assume that American whitebait varies in composition depending on where it has been fished. Whitebait is nearly always deep fried (tossed, as is, in a paper bag of seasoned flour, tossed repeatedly in a sieve to rid it of excess flour, fried, small quantities at a time, in very hot olive oil for a minute or so, drained, and garnished with fried parsley, lemon apart—it may be lightly sprinkled with cayenne) or, sometimes, pan fried, the floured and seasoned mass being colored as a block on one side before being tossed (or unmolded onto a plate and slipped back into the hot pan, to which has been added a bit more oil).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sardines, outside of the Midi, are rarely prepared otherwise than grilled or pan fried (not only are they much better grilled but, if pan fried, the kitchen risks being permeated with the odors for days). In the south, perhaps their most usual mode of preparation is stuffed with spinach and gratinéed (gutted, head and central bone removed, filets left attached at the tail and the length of the back, spread out skin side down, spread with parboiled, chopped, and seasoned spinach, rolled up and pushed into a bed of chopped spinach, one after the other, all the tails in the air, sprinkled with crumbs and olive oil, and put in a hot oven for 15 minutes; a <a href="j_118-169.xhtml#page141">Provençal spinach sauce</a> sometimes replaces the bed of spinach). A Niçoise variation consists in sautéeing raw shredded chard and spinach with a couple of cloves of crushed garlic in olive oil, mixing with parboiled rice, grated Parmesan, and eggs, arranging sardine filets between thick layers of the mixture in an oiled gratin dish, finishing with crumbs, grated cheese, and a dribbling of olive oil—this needs about ½ hour in the oven; instead of sardine filets, whitebait is sometimes stirred into the mixture and transformed into a gratin. Or, whole sardines, seasoned and sprinkled with crumbs and oil, are gratinéed and sprinkled with a garlic <em class="ital">persillade</em> and lemon juice as they are removed from the oven; sometimes they are placed on a bed of chopped, stewed tomato mixture . . . Layers of artichoke hearts, finely sliced, seasoned, and coated with olive oil, may enclose one of sardine filets and be baked with a sprinkling of breadcrumbs until the artichokes are just tender—about ½ hour.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page155">It is characteristic of most of these preparations that the fish, by other standards, be overcooked—they are sometimes cooked in a gentle oven (traditionally, they are prepared, taken to the baker, and picked up an hour or so later) for a much longer time than I have indicated, but are always better, to my taste, if cooked in a very hot oven for a minimum of time. One preparation, however, that is worth trying—and one had best count 1½ hours in a 325° oven—is sardines <em class="ital">en Chartreuse</em> (more often prepared with thick slices of tuna, the skin and dark parts removed and the flesh transpierced regularly with alternating strips of anchovy filet and of fresh fatback): a fairly deep, oiled oven dish lined with the outer leaves of a large Boston lettuce, a few leaves reserved to cover the preparation, the rest of the lettuce shredded and added to an abundant mixture of shredded sorrel, chopped or finely sliced onions, peeled, seeded, and chopped or sliced tomatoes, mixed crumbled herbs, <em class="ital">persillade</em> . . . ; half the mixture packed into the lettuce-lined dish, sprinkled with salt and olive oil, peeled and seeded lemon slices atop, the fish, more lemon slices, the rest of the mixture, salt, olive oil, white wine, water, covered with the remaining lettuce leaves—a loosely placed sheet of aluminum foil may be set on top during the first part of the cooking to cut down slightly on the evaporation and to protect the surface lettuce leaves from drying and burning. Lower the heat if anything more than a very gentle bubbling is in evidence and check after an hour’s time the liquid in the container. It is a sort of <em class="ital">confit</em> of fish and vegetables, everything intact but trembling at the brink of collapse.</p>

Press a sheet of aluminum foil over the surface and cook in a 450° oven for some 12 minutes—or a bit longer—until the liquid has come to a bubbling boil and the sorrel has turned grayish, clinging, film-like, to the form of each sardine. Leave for another 10 minutes or so in a warm but not hot oven (remove the dish, turn off the oven, cool it for a few minutes, and return the dish to the oven, still covered with the foil) to steep, the liquid evaporating a bit more—only a spoonful or so of the cooking juices should remain for each guest.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The best part is thrown back to the fish, only the white muscle appearing on the American market. Americans writing of the food of France never fail to extol the delicacy of the lovely tongue of coral; untraveled readers are conscious of being deprived, stupidly and wastefully, of an exquisite thing. The deaf ear of the fishing industry is incomprehensible; how fine a thing it would be were the scallop-eaters of America to launch a well-publicized boycott so that a ray of light might pierce thick heads . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">French cookbooks of the nineteenth century are not lacking in recipes requiring scallop shells, silver imitations often replacing the real thing, but they contain no suggestion of what may have happened to their contents. By the turn of the century there are recipes to prove that the flesh was being eaten—whatever the final preparation, it was first parboiled, presumably to get rid of the taste, and then cooked for some 20 minutes in a court bouillon. Later the parboiling was abandoned, but a 15-minute passage in a court bouillon preceded all other preparations. Today large sea scallops are considered to be perfectly cooked when poached or otherwise exposed to heat for from 8 to 10 minutes, a proportionately shorter period, and as little sometimes as 3 minutes are counted for sliced sea scallops or bay scallops; they are done, in any case, when the grayish translucence turns to opaque white and the somewhat flabby flesh becomes firm and resilient.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Pétoncles</em> are tiny—much smaller than bay scallops, their shells measuring an inch or so in diameter—and are often served several to a shell, a dab of snail butter on top, heated only long enough in the broiler or a hot oven for the butter to bubble. I have sometimes ordered <em class="ital">pétoncles</em> and been served cubed scallops in <em class="ital">pétoncle</em> shells, a not too distressing fraud in view of its goodness. The charm of the presentation is, of course, in the small shells but, just as snails, spread with their butter, often garnish half-grilled or broiled mushroom caps, which are then returned to the oven, raw cubed (¼ to ⅓ inch) scallops, several to a cap, treated in the same way could not help but be attractive and delicious. In their own shells, even thinly sliced and thinly spread, they would require too much snail butter, and, for a radically simple preparation, they are then best left whole or sliced in half across the grain, coated with olive oil, seasoned, sprinkled with crumbs (which may or may not be mixed with a clove of garlic pounded to a purée) and a dribble of olive oil and gratinéed.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page158">The pre-prepared scallop gratin (a layer of sauce in the bottom of the shell, sliced poached scallops—and corals—often supplemented by a garnish, another layer of sauce, a sprinkling of crumbs, of grated cheese, or of both, surmounted by a scallop of butter, all ready to pop into the oven for 10 minutes and serve), one of the mainstays of the French charcuterie (a take-out shop that specializes in glorious window displays), can be very good: The scallops are best poached whole in a scant white wine court bouillon (2 parts wine to 1 water) before being sliced; the sauce may be a <em class="ital">velouté</em> prepared from the poaching liquid, a sauce gratin (mixture of <em class="ital">duxelles</em> and <em class="ital">velouté</em>), a mixture of <em class="ital">duxelles</em> and tomato sauce, a <em class="ital">béchamel</em> (to which the reduced poaching liquid has been added), or a <em class="ital">mornay.</em> Sometimes a <em class="ital">duxelles</em> lines the shell and a <em class="ital">béchamel</em> tops the lot. The scallops may be thinly sliced and added raw to the dish, in which case it should be assembled just before being put in the oven. The nature of the preparation demands that a prettily colored, crisp surface coincide with the heating through of the dish and the bubbling of the sauce; unless your oven is equipped with overhead heat, the only way to perfectly achieve this effect is to put the shells first into a 500° oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until the sauce bubbles and then transfer them to the broiler for something less than a minute—until the gratin is formed. If you cannot put your hands on scallop shells, do the whole thing in a gratin dish and serve it out; and if the notion of the charcuterie sauce seems tiresome, substitute creamed sorrel or Provençal sauce in abundance, use raw sliced scallops, and count 20 minutes in a hot oven . . . less if in shells.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Twenty years ago, half the restaurants in Paris offered <em class="ital">coquilles Saint-Jacques au gratin.</em> Those I best remember and liked best were composed of poached sliced scallops, mussels, and sliced mushrooms (cooked with water, lemon juice, and butter) in a <em class="ital">velouté</em> made of the cooking juices of all three. Often a fluted border of <em class="ital">duchesse</em> potatoes prevented the sauce from brimming over while being reheated, stamping the presentation, at the same time, with a certain mechanical beauty (neither restaurateur nor client conceived of it as sapid support and, like <em class="ital">pâté en croûte,</em> the heart of the thing was dug out, the trappings being returned automatically to the kitchen).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page159">The world of food and fashion having proclaimed flour-thickened sauces coarse and unrefined, <em class="ital">coquilles Saint-Jacques sautées à la Bordelaise</em> (<em class="ital">meunière,</em> finished with a shallot <em class="ital">persillade</em> and a bit of lemon) took the ascendance (to confuse matters, a sort of <em class="ital">à l’Américaine</em> preparation—scallops sautéed with butter- or oil-stewed chopped onions, garlic, herbs, cayenne in the seasoning, moistened with blazed Cognac, white wine, and tomato, cooked 8 to 10 minutes, the scallops kept warm while the sauce is radically reduced, sieved, often creamed and, away from the heat, buttered—takes the name <em class="ital">à la Bordelaise</em> if a <em class="ital">mirepoix</em> replaces the stewed onions) and when garlic replaced the shallot, the scallops became inevitably <em class="ital">à la Provençale,</em> although they exist neither on the meridional market nor in Provençal cookbooks . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">Recently, in the confused service of ultimate purity and snobbism, the mode has turned to <em class="ital">coquilles Saint-Jacques à la nage,</em> a sobriquet restricted until a few years ago to lobsters and crayfish poached in court bouillon. When applied to scallops, the court bouillon is usually very scanty, indeed, and almost always reduced and mounted with butter so that, finally, the appellation no longer means anything at all, the scallops being served in a <em class="ital">fumet</em>-based <em class="ital">beurre blanc;</em> the preparation itself is delicious.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Whatever their preparation, scallops should first be well rinsed and sponged dry.

Saffron complements them nicely—try stewing little onions in butter, sprinkling with powdered saffron, adding the scallops and stewing, stirring, for another minute or so, moisten with mushroom cooking liquid and white wine (or fish <em class="ital">fumet,</em> if some is on hand), poach until done, add the mushrooms and thicken with egg yolks—saucepan removed from heat for a few minutes, part of the sauce stirred into the yolks, the mixture stirred back into the stew, stirred over very low heat until lightly thickened (or drain the liquid off, reduce by half, and whisk, like a <em class="ital">sabayon,</em> with egg yolks and a generous amount of butter in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> kept beneath the boil, until the sauce assumes the appearance of a light-bodied hollandaise) . . .</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page162">Cuttlefish; Squid; Octopus <span class="French-translation">(Suppions, Seiches; Calmars, Encornets; Poulpes, Pieuvres)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Octopus must be beaten to tenderize the flesh—fishermen heave them roughly and repeatedly against rocks to this end. Squid and cuttlefish do not require such harsh treatment. Unless bought cleaned, the tentacles should be torn loose from the fleshy hood, the eyes removed, the little beak-like teeth squeezed free of the orifice and the hood cleaned out, the cuttlebone removed from cuttlefish and the corresponding transparent, celluloid-like bone slipped out of the squid’s hood. The greatest care, it is said, should be taken not to break the ink sack but, in fact, unless one wants the ink for the fabrication of a black sauce of Spanish character, it could not make less difference. The fragile, viscous skin should be peeled off and discarded (large octopus may be parboiled to facilitate its removal), leaving only white flesh. Octopus, unless tiny, are always cut up; only squid is well adapted, by its form, to stuffing, the hood of the cuttlefish being shallower and that part of the wall from which the cuttlebone was removed being thin and easily torn.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Except for tiny little cuttlefish, cleaned—tentacles and hood separated but otherwise whole, dipped in batter, and rapidly deep fried, it is doubtful that those who claim for them a greater delicacy than that of squid could, at a blind tasting, distinguish one from the other. The octopus is, admittedly, a rougher beast, but certainly not indign of a serious and unprejudiced table. It requires from 1 to 4 hours’ cooking (usually from 2 to 2½), depending on the size, and it is wonderful prepared as a <em class="ital">daube</em> (exactly like a beef or a <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page306">mutton <em class="ital">daube</em></a>: Eliminate the pork products and calf’s foot, and a <em class="ital">mirepoix</em> may replace the chopped onions and red wine may replace the white, if one likes; sometimes it is served over semidried slices of bread thickly spread with <em class="ital">aïoli,</em> more <em class="ital">aïoli</em> served apart, a rich and heady thing of beauty for those with iron stomachs). Allowing for the difference in cooking time, it may be prepared like any of the squid stews. The Toulonnais, who share with the Neapolitans the reputation of being octopus-eaters (<em class="ital">mange-poulpes</em> is not intended as a compliment), often simmer it in a court bouillon (which may be no more than salted water with bay and thyme added) and eat it tepid, seasoned at table with olive oil, vinegar or lemon, salt, and pepper.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page163"><em class="ital">À la Tomate, à la Provençale, à la Sétoise, à l’Américaine, à la Niçoise</em> . . . The assertive Mediterranean presences of the recurrent preparation-type tomato sauce (described in the <a href="j_118-169.xhtml#page157">discussion of scallops</a>) seem to me better suited to squid, cuttlefish, and octopus than to other seafood (unless it be the peppery little crabs—<em class="ital">favouilles</em>—which, scanty-fleshed but rich in flavor, are pounded and pureed to form a soup or sauce base). The finesse of lobster and scallop are compromised and the fugacious charm of the crayfish is crushed in the encounter, whereas the sweet, herbal-spicy cephalopod autonomy is positively underlined, lent new dimensions, its primitive qualities at the same time suffusing, taming, and refining the sauce. The cooking time for squid or cuttlefish varies from 40 minutes to twice as long, depending on the squid and on the cook (20 minutes before serving, the stew may be smothered in freshly shelled little peas—an attractive supplement more Italian than French), and the sauce, whose body depends on the tomato alone, often needs to be drained off and rapidly reduced to a firmer consistency. A saffron pilaf is a perfect accompaniment, but buttered, fresh saffron egg noodles (a half teaspoon of powdered saffron stirred into—or sifted with—the flour before preparing the dough) are astonishing. In season, fresh and freshly torn-up basil, added a few moments before serving, will always complement these flavors.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Squid, if stuffed, should not be packed full—the stuffing swells while cooking and the hoods shrink; the chopped tentacles are always an element of the stuffing, and the opening is tacked with a couple of stitches of kitchen string.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A highly seasoned tomato and white wine sauce is a good braising liquid for a stuffing of finely chopped onions cooked in olive oil, the chopped tentacles sautéed with them, chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes,</em> parboiled rice, seasoned to taste.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page164">The stuffing is often a tomato mixture—oil-stewed chopped onions sautéed with the chopped tentacles, crumbled oregano, peeled, seeded, chopped tomato, seasonings (including cayenne and a pinch of sugar), reduced and stiffened with a handful of finely crumbled semisoft breadcrumbs, a handful of garlic <em class="ital">persillade,</em> and an egg to bind—and, for the sake of contrast, is better treated in a non-tomato sauce—oil-stewed chopped onions, to which chopped anchovy filets are often added, a sprinkling of flour, moistened with white wine and water, seasoned, thyme and bay . . . Quartered artichokes may be tucked into all the interstices and the dish is usually, but not necessarily, baked, uncovered, and basted regularly rather than being braised, covered.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Squid may be stuffed with a stiff Provençal spinach sauce—or, better, with the same spinach, hard-boiled egg, and <a href="j_118-169.xhtml#page152">mussel stuffing as that used for stuffing mussels</a>, a similar braising liquid to that above with the mussels’ opening liquid added to it—a handful of the mussels may be kept apart and warmed up in the sauce just before serving. Saffron flavoring and egg-yolk terminal binding can lend variety for either braised squid or baked squid; if baked, the sauce will reduce a great deal.</p>
			<p class="Normal">One of the commonest of squid stuffings is based on sausage meat, chopped ham, or a combination; the intermingled flavors of pork and of the sea taste, to me, like mud.</p>

The boning, itself, is very simple, the flesh being practically free of the bones except for the tendon attachments at the joints.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The form is a matter of personal preference; I prefer the <em class="ital">cappelletti</em> shape to the usual <em class="ital">ravioli</em> square. The buttered <em class="ital">fumet</em> is the simplest and most rapidly prepared of sauce possibilities; peeled, seeded, chopped, butter-stewed tomatoes may be incorporated into it—or sorrel—or the <em class="ital">fumet,</em> rather than being reduced, may be transformed into a <em class="ital">velouté,</em> creamed and/or buttered. Or the reduced <em class="ital">fumet</em> may replace the cream in the stuffing, the sauce being replaced by a brown butter.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Poach the frog flesh in the strained <em class="ital">fumet,</em> bringing the liquid to the boiling point over a moderate flame; if the saucepan is of a heavy material, the heat may be turned off the moment the boil is reached, the flesh being left to poach and to cool in the liquid, the pan covered; in a pan that loses heat rapidly, maintain the liquid at a simmer for one minute and then remove from the heat and leave, covered, to cool. Strain, saving the poaching liquid.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Soak the breadcrumbs in the cream, mashing with a fork, until all the cream has been soaked up, mash in the butter, add the herbs, seasonings, and yolks, stirring vigorously, then stir in the frog meat.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">If given a choice, use small legs for this preparation—they must be eaten with fingers, and finger bowls will be appreciated. Ordinarily, they are only floured before being sautéed—one must nurse them constantly and they still often stick (not that that is a disaster—they are still good). Dipped in egg, they will not stick while cooking and they are, I think, at least as good in their thin, batter-like crust. If you do not have a pan large enough to contain them all without crowding, side by side, you should use the two largest pans you have.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page169">	Season the legs, dredge them in flour (tossing in a paper bag to save mess), toss them in a sieve to rid them of excess flour, dip each in beaten egg, and drop into hot oil. As they begin to color—they will cook rapidly and the flame should be kept high, or relatively so, depending on their progress—toss them, gently turning over those that do not flip with the tines of a fork. Continue tossing regularly until lightly colored and crispened—5 or 6 minutes in all, add the <em class="ital">persillade,</em> and toss repeatedly for another minute. Turn out onto a hot serving platter, leaving behind any excess oil, and sprinkle the surface with lemon juice (some people add a small handful of breadcrumbs just after adding the <em class="ital">persillade</em>—they soak up the oil and give more body to the dish).</p>
