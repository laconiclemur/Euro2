<p class="tni">It was a bittersweet experience writing this book. Doing the research was a blast, but writing the comments brought back many memories of dear people who have died since I met them. I confess that I don’t know a thing about Asian cooking, but I know that there must be thousands of ways of cooking rice in the orient. But my first love is Italy and its cuisines. I guess it’s because I’m an Italian.</p>
<p class="txs">My fond hope is that you get to know me through my books. Perhaps this short poem will help you understand who Father Giuseppe Orsini really is. It was written by Gaspare Lo Bue in the Sicilian language and it has become my daily prayer before I celebrate Mass.</p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Accept me as I am</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Bread of Life within this Tabernacle</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">I am here</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">I am here at your door like a beggar seeking help.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">My heart is darkened and all bound up.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">It is like a twisted ball of barbed wire,</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">and I feel it deep within me.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">My heart is pinched, afraid, and attacked.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">The coldness is beginning to penetrate my bones:</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Take me by the hand,</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">show me the road I must travel.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Wash me with your blood,</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">forgive me of my sins.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Just one more time I want to eat the Bread of Life</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">like I used to do when I was innocent so many years ago.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">I know I am not worthy</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">But I … if I am truly repentant … you will forgive my faults.</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Show me your mercy, oh my dear God,</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">I beg your mercy!</span></p>
<p class="v"><span class="epub-i">Accept me the way I am.</span></p>
<p class="stxs">Thank you, dear reader, for buying this book, and may God bless you with good food, warm friends, and long life!</p>
<p class="ausig">Father Giuseppe Orsini</p>
