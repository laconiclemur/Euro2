			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_6771.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Italian beer, such as Birra del Borgo blonde, or a good lager beer</p>
			<p class="RHN1">A back-from-the-holidays dish, inspired by Mexican flavors. The weather is still warm, and corn is extra sweet. This can be eaten as an appetizer or as a side dish—for a roast pig, perhaps, or any grilled meat. I like the fresh Asian touch of fragrant kaffir lime, but the recipe also works well with regular lime zest. As for the pickled ginger, it is one of my go-to ingredients: it adds zing to anything! I use the pickling liquid like vinegar, to season raw fish dishes, such as crudo or ceviche, or a sauce for a pork dish.</p>
			<p class="RHN">If you can’t find Spanish ham, you can substitute good prosciutto or even culatello.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the pickled ginger</h4>
			<p class="RI">Scant 2 ounces (50 grams) fresh ginger</p>
			<p class="RI">⅔ cup (150 ml.) rice vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cup (50 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cup (50 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ teaspoon salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 medium red bell peppers</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fine sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">2 ears corn</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ bunch cilantro</p>
			<p class="RI">2 small shallots</p>
			<p class="RI2">2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of ¼ lime, preferably kaffir lime</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lime, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">3 ounces (85 grams) thinly sliced Spanish ham</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The pickled ginger</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Peel the ginger and slice it very thin with a mandoline. Put it in a small bowl.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a small nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Pour the liquid over the ginger and let cool to room temperature, then cover tightly and refrigerate. (The ginger will keep for weeks.)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Rub the bell peppers with olive oil, coating the peppers evenly, and sprinkle with salt. Grill them over a flame, either on an outdoor grill or directly over a gas burner, turning occasionally, until evenly blackened. Put the peppers in a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, so that the steam helps loosen the skin. Let stand for 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, husk the corn and cut off the kernels. Remove the cilantro leaves from the stems and coarsely chop. Peel and finely dice the shallots. Chop enough drained pickled ginger to make 1 tablespoon.</p>
			<p class="RP">Peel off the charred skin from the peppers, remove the cores and seeds, and slice the peppers into thin strips.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Melt the butter with a drizzle of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn and cook over medium-low heat until tender but still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shallots, pepper strips, and chopped pickled ginger and cook until the shallots are softened, just a few minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of the pickled ginger juice, the lime zest, juice, and chopped cilantro and stir well; taste and add more ginger juice and/or lime juice if desired. Season to taste with fleur de sel.</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide among four plates, top with the ham, and serve immediately.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_3503.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Arbois vin jaune (Savagnin); Stéphane Tissot</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Combining earthy and nutty flavors, this dish is the quintessence of autumn. You can use any wild mushrooms you may find in the farmers’ market. Mimolette is an orange cow’s-milk cheese from the north of France that becomes very firm when aged; aged cheddar, or any nutty-flavored mature cheese, can be substituted.</p>
			<p class="RI2">12 ounces (320 grams) wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles, yellow-foot chanterelles, hedgehog, porcini, and/or blewits</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the yogurt-hazelnut sauce</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (125 ml.) plain full-fat yogurt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon chopped skinned hazelnuts</p>
			<p class="RI">2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmesan</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons herb leaves, such as tarragon, dill, and/or flat-leaf parsley</p>
			<p class="RI">Hazelnut oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons skinned hazelnuts</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">A small bunch of Muscat or black seedless grapes (about 24 grapes)</p>
			<p class="RI">2 ounces (57 grams) aged Mimolette or aged cheddar</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tarragon sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI2">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed but not peeled</p>
			<p class="RI">Leaves from 3 thyme sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The mushrooms</h3>
			<p class="RP1">It’s best to clean mushrooms with a brush, a damp cloth, and/or a small pointed knife, but if they are very dirty, remove as much dirt as possible with the knife, then dip them very briefly in cold water, drain them immediately, and dry with a paper towel or a cloth. (Mushrooms should never soak in water for more than 30 seconds.) Cut bigger mushrooms lengthwise in half; leave smaller ones whole.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The yogurt-hazelnut sauce</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the yogurt, hazelnuts, Parmesan, herb leaves, a drizzle of hazelnut oil, and a pinch of salt in a blender and mix until creamy. If the sauce is too thick, add a drop or two of water. Adjust the salt if necessary and refrigerate. (The sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Use extra as a delicious dip for raw vegetables, or serve it with fried chicken.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Toast the hazelnuts with a pinch of salt in a small dry skillet until they are golden brown. Let them cool, then coarsely crush them.</p>
			<p class="RP">Separate the grapes from the stems. With a vegetable peeler, cut thin shavings from the cheese. Remove the tarragon leaves from the stems.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil starts to smoke, throw in the mushrooms and sauté them for 8 to 12 minutes, or until tender (timing will depend on the type of mushrooms). Season with salt and pepper, then add the butter, garlic, and thyme. When the butter is foaming, add the grapes and tarragon leaves, stir gently, and add the lemon juice. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed.</p>
			<p class="RP">Arrange the mushrooms on four plates, scatter the crushed hazelnuts and cheese shavings over them, and drizzle with some of the sauce.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_DDZ7600.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Graves white (Sauvignon/Sémillon); Domaine de Chevalier</p>
			<p class="RHN1">I love the balance of salty and sweet in this risotto, with the sweetness of the creamy roasted squash puree and crunchy amaretti cookies offset by the grated and shaved Parmesan.</p>
			<p class="RHN">You could use store-bought chicken broth, but the taste of homemade chicken broth is incomparable and well worth the effort. Ideally, you should prepare the broth a day ahead. I like to use nonclassic flavors, such as ginger and lemongrass, in this broth, which give it freshness and make a wonderful counterpoint to the squash and amaretti. You will have extra broth; freeze the rest for another dish.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the chicken broth</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 carrot</p>
			<p class="RI">1 leek</p>
			<p class="RI">1 celery stalk</p>
			<p class="RI">1 onion</p>
			<p class="RI">½ fennel bulb</p>
			<p class="RI">1 lemongrass stalk</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove</p>
			<p class="RI">⅔ ounce (20 grams) fresh ginger</p>
			<p class="RI">3 thyme sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">4 white peppercorns</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">2 pounds (1 kg.) chicken bones and/or wings from free-range chickens</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the butternut squash puree</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ small butternut squash</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">4 ounces (100 grams) Brussels sprouts</p>
			<p class="RI">About 6 sage sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Sherry vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">8 amaretti cookies</p>
			<p class="RI">Parmesan shavings</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the risotto</h4>
			<p class="RI">5 cups (1.25 liters) chicken broth, or as needed</p>
			<p class="RI">2 shallots</p>
			<p class="RI">4 tablespoons (56 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bay leaf</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1¾ cups (300 grams) carnaroli or arborio rice</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (100 ml.) dry white wine</p>
			<p class="RI">Generous ¼ cup (70 grams) freshly grated Parmesan </p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The chicken broth</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Chop the carrot, leek, celery, onion, and fennel into 1-inch pieces.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine all the vegetables, the lemongrass, garlic, ginger, thyme sprigs, peppercorns, and fennel seeds in a large pot, add the chicken bones, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 1½ hours, skimming off the foam regularly. Turn off the heat and let the broth infuse for another 30 minutes as it cools.</p>
			<p class="RP">Strain the broth and refrigerate (it will keep for up to 3 days). Remove any hardened fat before using.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The butternut squash</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 350°F. </p>
			<p class="RP">With a sharp spoon, remove the seeds and strings from the squash; reserve about 1 tablespoon of the seeds. Peel the squash, dice into ¾-inch pieces, and place in a large bowl. Toss with the olive oil, crushed garlic, and salt and piment d’Espelette to taste. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for about 20 minutes: the squash is done when it mashes easily under your fingers.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, toss the reserved squash seeds with a pinch of salt, spread on a small baking sheet, and toast in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="RP">Transfer the squash to a blender, add the lemon juice, and puree. Add a little water if necessary to obtain a smooth puree. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">With a small knife, cut the outer leaves from the Brussels sprouts, keeping only the pretty ones. Save the “hearts” for another use.</p>
			<p class="RP">Remove the sage leaves from the stems. Fry them in a small quantity of olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat, making sure they don’t burn. The sage leaves are ready when they become translucent. Drain on paper towels. Save the sage-infused oil for garnish.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The risotto</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Heat the 5 cups chicken broth in a saucepan and keep it warm over low heat. Peel and dice the shallots.</p>
			<p class="RP">Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with a dash of olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the shallots, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt and cook until the shallots are softened, about 3 minutes; avoid browning them. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the rice, stirring so each grain is coated with fat, and cook the rice for 3 to 5 minutes to toast it. Turn up the heat slightly, deglaze the pan with the white wine, stirring, and cook until the wine has evaporated. Add a small ladleful of broth, stir, and cook, stirring until the liquid is absorbed by the rice. Continue cooking, stirring and adding more broth as necessary, until the rice is al dente and the risotto is creamy, about 17 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Add ¼ cup of the butternut squash puree to the risotto and mix well (reserve the remaining puree for another use). Turn off the heat and let the risotto rest for 5 minutes (don’t forget to remove the bay leaf).</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, briefly sauté the leaves from the Brussels sprouts in a bit of olive oil with a pinch of salt. Add a dash of sherry vinegar, and drain on paper towels.</p>
			<p class="RP">Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, the grated Parmesan, and the lemon juice to the risotto and give a good stir. If it is too thick, add a bit more chicken broth to loosen it. Taste and season with salt and piment d’Espelette.</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide the risotto among 4 bowls. Top with the Brussels sprout leaves, fried sage, and toasted squash seeds. Crumble the amaretti over the top, finish with the Parmesan shavings and a drizzle of sage-infused oil, and serve immediately.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_DDZ8120.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Late-harvest German Riesling (Spätlese); Egon Müller</p>
			<p class="RHN1">The sweetness of scallops and parsnips is wonderfully balanced by the acidity of sorrel, the tart apple, and the radish pickles. I love the sourness and soft crunch of these pickles, which bring a new dimension to myriad dishes. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the radish pickles</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 large bunch radishes (about 15)</p>
			<p class="RI">1¼ cups (300 ml.) rice vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant ½ cup (100 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">2 pinches fine sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI2">12 fresh plump sea scallops</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the parsnip puree and chips</h4>
			<p class="RI">3 parsnips</p>
			<p class="RI">1 cup (250 ml.) whole milk</p>
			<p class="RI">Fine sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">About 3 cups (750 ml.) vegetable oil, for deep-frying</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">About 12 sorrel leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">1 Granny Smith apple</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
			<p class="RI2">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The radish pickles</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Trim the radishes and reserve 4 whole radishes for garnish. Cut the others into quarters and place in a bowl. </p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a small nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Pour over the quartered radishes and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. (The radishes will keep for several days.)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The scallops</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, rinse the scallops under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Put them on a plate, arranging them tightly together so they stay firm. Refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The parsnip puree</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Peel the parsnips. Set 1 aside for the chips. Slice the other 2 into 1-inch chunks; cut the thicker chunks lengthwise in half. Put in a small saucepan and pour in the milk. Bring to a boil (be careful that it doesn’t boil over), then lower the heat and simmer until the parsnips mash easily under a spoon, 15 to 18 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Using a slotted spoon, transfer the parsnips to a blender. Add half the milk and puree, adding more of the milk if necessary, then return to the saucepan and season with salt to taste. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The parsnip chips</h3>
			<p class="RP1">With a vegetable peeler, slice the reserved parsnip into long, thin strips.</p>
			<p class="RP">Heat the vegetable oil to 350°F in a medium deep saucepan. Fry the parsnip strips, in batches, to a golden color, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain on paper towels and immediately sprinkle with salt.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Remove the center stems from the sorrel (fold the leaves in half and strip out the stems).</p>
			<p class="RP">With a mandoline, cut the apple into thin slices (discard the center slices with the core) and toss with the lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="RP">Thinly slice the reserved radishes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The scallops</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Heat a large skillet over high heat. Generously coat the scallops with olive oil and place them in the (very hot) pan; don’t add salt yet—it will make them tough. Cook for 1 minute on the first side, then add the butter, thyme, and crushed garlic. Once the butter is foaming, turn the scallops over, sprinkle with fleur de sel and piment d’Espelette, and baste with the butter for 30 seconds, or until just cooked through. Drain briefly on paper towels.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, gently reheat the parsnip puree.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Spoon the parsnip puree into four shallow bowls. Lay a nest of parsnip chips on each plate, top with 3 scallops, and harmoniously arrange some of the radish pickles, sorrel leaves, apple slices, and sliced radishes in each bowl.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_4111.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Burgundy white (Viognier); Condrieu Georges Vernay</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Pork shoulder is one of my favorite cuts: it is full of collagen, which will soften and melt during the long slow cooking and make the meat very tender and tasty. This is an Italian-inspired dish, using techniques I learned at The River Café in London. The milk proteins also help soften the pork, and then the milky curds are served with the meat.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the pork </h4>
			<p class="RI">One 2-pound (1-kg.) boneless pork shoulder roast</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">About 6 sage sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">2 salt-packed anchovies (or substitute 4 oil-packed anchovy fillets)</p>
			<p class="RI">Grapeseed oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">½ garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">About 5 cups (1.25 liters) whole milk</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the Marinated fennel</h4>
			<p class="RI">6 baby or 3 medium fennel bulbs</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small chile pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ bunch dill</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ teaspoons fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Coarse sea salt</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The pork</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">Season the pork shoulder with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="RP">Tie the sage sprigs together with kitchen string. With a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the lemon in strips, making sure to avoid the bitter white pith. If using salt-packed anchovies, rinse under cold water and remove the 2 fillets from each one.</p>
			<p class="RP">Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of grapeseed oil and then add the pork, fat side down. Brown the meat on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side, then transfer it to a plate.</p>
			<p class="RP">Pour off the fat from the pot, put it back over medium heat, add the butter, and deglaze the pot with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the meaty browned bits. When the butter starts to foam, add the sage, garlic, anchovies, and lemon zest and cook over low heat, stirring, until the anchovies dissolve.</p>
			<p class="RP">Add the pork shoulder and pour in enough milk to come about halfway up the sides of the meat. Bring to a simmer, then cover tightly with the lid, put the pot in the oven, and cook for 2½ to 3 hours, turning the meat every 30 minutes and adding milk as needed, until the pork is tender and separates easily and the milk has reduced and curdled. If the pork is cooked but the milk has not reduced and curdled, remove the meat from the pot, place the pot over medium heat, and cook until the milk has reduced. Then return the pork to the pot and cover to keep warm.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The marinated fennel</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil.</p>
			<p class="RP">Trim the fennel bulbs, halve lengthwise, and cut each half into 3 wedges.</p>
			<p class="RP">Cut the chile pepper lengthwise in half, remove the seeds, and finely mince the pepper. Chop the dill.</p>
			<p class="RP">Generously salt the boiling water, throw in the fennel seeds, and add the fennel wedges. Cook for 6 to 9 minutes; the fennel should be tender but still have a slight crunch. Drain the fennel pieces and put in a baking dish in a single layer. Let cool for a few minutes, then add the chile pepper, chopped dill, and lemon zest. Add lemon juice to taste, drizzle with olive oil, and toss gently with your hands. Season with coarse salt to taste.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">With a large spoon, separate the pork into chunks and divide among four plates. Top each with a spoonful of milk curds and arrange the marinated fennel wedges alongside. The pork is best served just slightly warm.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Cahors red (Malbec); Mas del Périé</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is comfort food with a twist, where the sweetness of the beets is lightened by the raspberry vinaigrette, and the beef cheeks are “peppered” with watercress and horseradish. Beef cheeks are a tough, lean cut, with a lot of collagen, and need to cook very slowly. Properly cooked, they turn soft and almost caramelized, a bit like pulled pork. You’ll need to order them ahead from a specialty butcher; or see <a href="sources.xhtml#p137">Sources</a>. Plan ahead, as cooking the meat can take up to 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="RHN">Roasting the beets covered on a bed of salt steams them while intensifying the flavors. If you can find tiny new beets at the farmers’ market, even better—adjust the cooking time as necessary, and then leave them whole.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the beef cheeks</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 large beef cheeks (2 to 2½ pounds/1 kg. total), trimmed of excess fat</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">1 carrot</p>
			<p class="RI">1 onion</p>
			<p class="RI">1 celery stalk</p>

			<p class="RI">½ star anise</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cinnamon stick</p>

			<p class="RI">Peel of ½ orange</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon tomato paste</p>
			<p class="RI">½ bottle (1½ cups/375 ml.) dry red wine </p>
			<p class="RI">1 bouquet garni (a few thyme and parsley sprigs and a bay leaf, tied together with kitchen string)</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the beets</h4>
			<p class="RI">12 to 16 baby beets (about 1½ pounds/700 grams)</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons (200 ml.) beet juice</p>
			<p class="RI2">Red wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons fine kasha (roasted buckwheat)</p>
			<p class="RI">Raspberry vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bunch chives, finely chopped</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ ounce (20 grams) fresh horseradish, grated</p>
			<p class="RI">A handful of watercress leaves</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The beef cheeks</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 350°F. </p>
			<p class="RP">Cut the beef cheeks in half. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</p>
			<p class="RP">Peel the carrot. Cut the carrot, onion, celery, and leek into 1-inch pieces. Chop the ginger.</p>
			<p class="RP">Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of grapeseed oil and brown the meat on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes per side, then remove it from the pot.</p>
			<p class="RP">Add the vegetables to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes, until beginning to soften. Add all the spices, the lemongrass, ginger, orange peel, and tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the red wine and bring to a simmer.</p>
			<p class="RP">Put the meat back in the pot, along with the bouquet garni, and add water to cover the meat almost entirely. Bring to a boil, then cover tightly, put the pot in the oven, and braise for 3 to 3½ hours, checking the level of liquid every 30 minutes and adding boiling water if necessary, until the meat is very tender and almost melts in your mouth; halfway through cooking, turn the cheeks over.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The beets</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, wash the beets under cold water, using a brush if necessary. Spread the coarse salt in a baking dish and lay the beets on top. Cover tightly with two layers of foil and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the beets, until tender: the tip of a knife should go through a beet without any resistance. Let the beets stand until cool enough to be handled.</p>
			<p class="RP">With an old cloth (beet stains are hard to remove) or paper towels, rub off the beets’ skin; it should come off easily. Dice or quarter the beets into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="RP">Bring the beet juice to a boil in a small saucepan and boil it to reduce by half. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">When the beef is cooked, transfer it to a plate. Strain the braising liquid into a small pot, bring to a boil, and reduce it until slightly thickened. Add a dash of red wine vinegar and adjust the salt. Return the beef cheeks to the sauce and reheat.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, warm the beets in the beet juice. Remove from the heat, add the buckwheat, cover, and let it swell for about 5 minutes. Add a dash of raspberry vinegar and the chives, taste, and adjust the salt if necessary.</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide the beets among four shallow bowls. Add a piece of beef cheek to each and cover with the sauce. Garnish each plate with some grated horseradish and a few sprigs of watercress. Serve immediately.</p>

			<p class="RHN1">Quick to prepare and delicious, this versatile little salad can be served as a starter, a light lunch, or a cheese course/dessert. The shaved pecorino pepato, a delicious hard Italian cheese studded with black peppercorns, is my way of seasoning the salad—it adds sharpness, salt, and pepper all at once. Make sure you use baby turnips, which can be eaten raw.</p>
			<p class="RI2">4 juicy pears, such as Red Bartlett or Comice</p>
			<p class="RI">4 baby turnips (the size of a golf ball or smaller)</p>
			<p class="RI">A handful of baby dandelion greens</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Extra virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">3½ ounces (100 grams) pecorino pepato cheese</p>
			<p class="RP">Quarter and core the pears. With a mandoline, slice the turnips very thin. Separate the dandelion leaves.</p>
			<p class="RP">Put the pear wedges, turnip slices, and dandelion leaves in a large bowl and gently toss with a pinch of fleur de sel, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and the lemon juice.</p>
			<p class="RP">Arrange the salad on four plates. Using a vegetable peeler, thinly shave the pecorino pepato over the salads. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_3621.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Calvados; Adrien Camus (35-year-old)</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is a dessert for the first chilly nights by the fire. Chocolate, chestnuts, and quince are soothing flavors that marry well.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the poached quinces</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ vanilla bean</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (150 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">⅔ cup (150 ml.) dry white wine</p>
			<p class="RI">⅔ cup (150 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">Zest of ½ orange, removed in strips with a vegetable peeler</p>
			<p class="RI">Zest of ½ lemon, removed in strips with a vegetable peeler</p>
			<p class="RI">2 small quinces</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the chestnut cream</h4>
			<p class="RI">⅓ cup (75 ml.) very cold heavy cream</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons (50 grams) sweet chestnut puree</p>
			<p class="RI">About 1 teaspoon rum (optional)</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">4 candied chestnuts</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of ½ orange</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ ounce (20 grams) 70% bittersweet chocolate </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The poached quinces</h3>
			<p class="RP1">With a small knife, split the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds; reserve the bean and seeds.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the sugar, white wine, water, orange and lemon zest, and vanilla bean and seeds in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and let the liquid steep while you prepare the quinces.</p>
			<p class="RP">Cut off the tops and bottoms of the quinces, then cut each one into 6 uniform wedges so they will cook evenly. Remove the skin by holding each wedge in one hand and cutting the skin away in a curved motion with a sharp paring knife. Remove the seeds with a curved cut.</p>
			<p class="RP">Submerge the quince wedges in the poaching syrup, bring to a simmer, and simmer, turning the wedges occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the ripeness of the fruit. The quinces should be tender but still have a slight crunch. Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm in the poaching syrup.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The chestnut cream</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, with an electric mixer, whip the cream just until it holds firm peaks. Put the chestnut puree in a small bowl and stir in a little of the cream, then gently fold in the remaining cream. Add the rum if desired.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Place a large quenelle or a generous spoonful of chestnut cream in each of four shallow bowls. Arrange 3 lukewarm quince wedges around each one and coat with the syrup. Garnish each serving with a candied chestnut and some orange zest, and grate the chocolate over the top.</p>
