<p class="nonindent">When Cuba was a Spanish colony, it exported parts of its culture to Spain. Arroz a la cubana is a dish that found its way from Cuba onto Spanish plates. In Spain, it doesn’t often have the fried banana that’s common in the Latin American versions. I think the sweetness from the banana makes the dish, so I always add it. It’s a surprising counterpoint to the garlicky rice, saucy tomatoes, and runny egg. And I’m adding my own Southern twist by using bacon and Anson Mills heirloom Carolina Gold rice. Its perfume is intoxicating in the morning. This dish is delicious even without those lovely grains. Any type of rice will work; you can even skip the rice-cooking step and use leftover rice from takeout. Félix and I like to leisurely cook this together on Sunday mornings when we (try to!) take the day off to relax. Ideally, the tomato sauce and rice simmer at the same time, then the rice and banana fry simultaneously. While all those components are doled onto plates, the eggs should be fried and slipped on top right before serving. It’s fun to tag-team the process with family or friends so that everyone can sit down and eat the meal hot all together.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">BRING THE RICE, BAY LEAVES, 2 GARLIC CLOVES,</span> and 1½ cups water to a boil in a large saucepan, stirring occasionally. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the rice is tender and the water absorbed, about 20 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes, then uncover and fluff with a fork. Discard the bay leaves.</p>
<p class="nonindent">While the rice cooks, cook the bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the fat renders and the bacon is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add 4 garlic cloves and stir until golden but not dark brown, about 2 minutes. Add the onion, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping up the browned bits, until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and ¼ teaspoon salt. Raise the heat to high to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low to simmer until the mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Keep warm over low heat.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 4 garlic cloves and cook, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Add the rice and cook, stirring to separate the grains and heat through, about 2 minutes. Divide among 4 serving plates and scrape the skillet clean.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the remaining tablespoon oil in the skillet. Add the bananas and cook, turning once, until nicely browned, about 1 minute per side. Divide among the serving plates. Spoon the warm tomato sauce alongside the rice and top with a fried egg. Serve immediately, cutting the egg up and mixing the yolk with the tomato sauce and rice.</p>
