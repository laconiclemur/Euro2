<p class="nonindent">Rossejar means “to toast” and that’s the first step in these paella-like noodle dishes. Noodles are not commonly found in Spanish cuisine, but they form the basis of this Catalan specialty. Very fine noodles—Spanish fideos or broken vermicelli or angel hair all work—are browned in oil before simmering later. Not only do the noodles develop a richer taste, but they also hold an al dente texture even after a long simmer.</p>
<p class="indent">While noodles are unique to Catalonia, the combination of squid with its ink is found all over the country. Squid ink is available at specialty stores and is a must here. Its flavor is subtle but tastes purely of the ocean. Once you buy that ingredient, the whole meal comes together quickly. It’s ideal with a glass of white Garnacha from Catalonia’s Mediterranean coast.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound angel hair pasta, broken into 1-inch-long pieces</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound squid tubes and tentacles, tentacles cut in half, tubes cut into ¼-inch rings, patted very dry</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 garlic clove, minced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ small onion, finely chopped (¼ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 (14.5-ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 cups Seafood Stock (<a href="sec61.xhtml#page183">here</a>) or store-bought unsalted seafood stock, heated</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons squid ink</strong></p>

</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">HEAT 2 TABLESPOONS OIL IN A 16-INCH PAELLA</span> pan or cast-iron pan over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the noodles and immediately stir to evenly coat the noodles with the oil before they start browning. Continue cooking, stirring and tossing frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Alternatively, toss the noodles with 2 tablespoons oil and spread in a half-sheet pan. Bake in a 350°F oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. It’s a matter of whether you’d rather scrape the noodles out of the paella pan or turn on the oven. Both techniques work well.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Add 2 tablespoons oil to the paella pan and reduce the heat to medium-high. Add the squid and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, turning and tossing, until starting to turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and reduce the heat to medium. Add the minced garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Stir in the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent and soft, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes turn a dark brick red and start to stick to the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Stir in the noodles, then the hot stock, squid ink, pimentón, and 2½ teaspoons salt. Stir well and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring continuously. Spread the noodles in an even layer. Now don’t touch it. You want to cook the noodles until they’re just tender and stick to the bottom of the pan and make a snap, crackle, pop noise, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve with the allioli.</p>

<h2 class="sec1">GARLIC MAYONNAISE</h2>
<h2 class="serve"><span class="small">MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Allioli derives from “all i oli.” In Catalan, “all” means garlic, “i” means and, and “oli” means oil. Those are the only ingredients in the most traditional version of this sauce. You mortar-and-pestle the garlic and then add the oil drop by drop while whisking with the pestle until you get the consistency of mayonnaise. It’s difficult and time-consuming. But when you’re in someone’s home in Spain or at a great restaurant, you can taste the difference. You can even see it. Even though it’s as thick as mayonnaise, it’s not quite as smooth. I’ve never tried that technique because I just don’t have the patience.</p>
<p class="indent">My whole take on allioli speaks to my practical side and tastes delicious. For a foolproof and fast allioli, I use a food processor. The feed tube with the insert slows the flow of the oil to just the right drip for the emulsification. I use a whole egg, because I hate having leftover whites, and a blended oil, to avoid getting out both my canola oil and olive oil. (If you can’t find blended oil, do half-and-half canola and a mild-flavored olive oil, such as Arbequina.)</p>
<p class="indent">A good allioli will leave you breathing garlic four hours later. Even so, garlic varies widely in intensity. Take a tiny nibble of your clove, then use anywhere from one small clove to two large ones, depending on the potency.</p>
<p class="indent">This all-purpose recipe beats mayonnaise in any sandwich, serves as a sauce for rossejat, paella, potatoes, and beans, and as a dip for vegetables or a spread for meat.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large egg</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 to 2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1¼ teaspoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup blended oil</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">COMBINE THE EGG, GARLIC, LEMON JUICE, AND</span> salt in a food processor. Turn the machine on and pour a little of the oil through the slow-drip feed tube. Add the remaining oil and process until it’s all emulsified into the mixture.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make by hand, push the garlic through a garlic press, then whisk with the lemon juice, salt, and egg. Whisk in the oil, a drop at a time, to ensure an emulsification that doesn’t break.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Or the allioli can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
