<p class="C3607"><span id="page_9">The</span> Dinner Rush</p>
<p class="C3608">It’s 6:30 pm on a Thursday at Boqueria 19th Street, and the relentless buzz of the kitchen printer signals the beginning of the dinner rush. A string of tickets inches over the back of the old ink-jet printer and snakes its way across the worn butcher’s block where plates are staged and garnished before being sent to the tables.</p>
<p class="C3609">Chef Marc turns toward Oaxaco, who, just as he has every day for the last ten years, stands behind him at a small table preparing potatoes for patatas bravas. His stout fingers move on autopilot, peeling and dicing in just a couple of quick gestures.</p>
<p class="C3609">Marc yanks the long perforated stretch of orders from the printer and holds it in the air, his arm outstretched at shoulder height. “Look at this, Oaxaco! It’s taller than you.” Oaxaco looks at the slim ribbon of paper, and flashes his crooked smile. “But it’s way skinnier!”</p>
<p class="C3609">The cooks laugh and Marc begins to call the tickets to them in breakneck Spanglish.</p>
<p class="C3609">“Fire dos gambas!”</p>
<p class="C3609">“Fire datiles, cuatro piezas!”</p>
<p class="C3609">“Tres albondigas!”</p>
<p class="C3609">“Fire tres espinacas, one no garlic!”</p>
<p class="C3609">One by one, cooks yell “Oido!”—signaling to Chef that they heard the orders. Pots clank. Oven doors slam. Within minutes, the grill is full, covered with fresh squid, juicy lamb skewers, hanger steak and Ibérico pork. Flashes of fire dance over the sautée station as brandy burns off the garlicky ajillo shrimp. Basketfuls of patatas bravas and croquetas are shocked to a crackle as they hit the deep fryer. The cooks scramble to toss, dress, season, and sear, all while holding a complex puzzle of orders and cooking times in their heads.</p>
<p class="C3609">Cooks, tongs, and plates shift and spin past each other until that old butcher block fills with the finished tapas. Marc turns toward the server station.</p>
<p class="C3609">“Runner, please!!!”</p>
<p class="C3609">The dining room staff rush in and Marc crosses dishes off the tickets as he directs.</p>
<p class="C3609">“Gambas table 13 and 36.”</p>
<p class="C3609">“Four piece dates, 108.”</p>
<p class="C3609">“Espinacas, 40.”</p>
<p class="C3609">Servers grab the plates and run them into the packed dining room, holding them high in the air where they hold altitude next to the hanging Edison bulbs before landing in front of hungry guests.</p>
<p class="C3609">Yann, the owner, stops in front of the small coat closet wedged between the bar and the dining area and watches the action.</p>
<p class="C3609">There’s a first date on table 35 that looks like it’s going well, and one on 12 that doesn’t. A group of coworkers on 31 just broke out into hearty laughter, and the two enviably stylish older women at the next table look on in amusement. A bartender shakes a cocktail while recounting a Barça soccer match to the regulars in front of him. They scrape up the last savory bits of rice from a paella pan and bang the spoon against their plates to loosen the sticky caramelized grains.</p>
<p class="C3609">Yann cracks the door of the coat closet and reaches in, keeping his eyes and ears fixed on the room. He brushes the wall gently until he finds the dimmers and the volume control. The nightly party is on. It’s time to dim the lights and turn up the music. This is the energy that he had seen so many times in his favorite spots in Barcelona and wanted to capture when he first envisioned Boqueria.</p>
<p class="C3609">Much like New York, Barcelona is an eccentrically cosmopolitan city with a distinctive character. Its long history as a magnet for pioneers of design and cuisine expresses itself today in the effortless style of its citizens as they ramble down the wide promenades, passing the fairytale façades of Gaudí’s masterpieces before settling into the cafés and tapas bars that anchor every neighborhood street.</p>
<p class="C3609">These neighborhood spots are at once charged with history and charging ahead. They are lively places where neighbors and friends come together to break bread and have a couple of short glasses of ice-cold draft beer. Bartenders smile and customers shout orders over an awe-inspiring and meticulously prepared variety of tapas. Plates of just-fried golden croquettes let off steam while mounds of mushrooms wait to be sautéed. Platters filled to overflowing with every imaginable combination of salads, pâtés, vegetables, and seafood paint the bar with tempting bursts of edible color.</p>
<p class="C3609">There is something about eating this way—sharing a variety of delicious dishes and drinks with friends—that provokes conversation. “I’ll fight you for that last squid!” “Mind if I soak up the sauce?” “Wow! What’s in that?”</p>
<p class="C3609">Talk of food inevitably turns to other topics. It is a time-honored, informal, and genuine way to connect: the original social network. That’s why we always have to turn up the music a little throughout the evening, to compete with the animated conversations.</p>
<p class="C3609">By sharing our recipes and stories with you here, we hope to give you everything you need to bring the Boqueria experience to life in your own home. Although you may never peel a potato as quickly as Oaxaco, Chef Marc has adapted our favorite dishes to be prepared with ease in your kitchen. Our recipes are as fun to shop for and to cook as they are to eat. We want to share that joy with you and your guests.</p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_12">The</span> Origins of Boqueria—Yann de Rochefort, Founder</p>
<p class="C3608">The path to Boqueria began either ten years before our 2006 opening or 40 years before then, depending on how you look at it. Although I didn’t really start thinking about opening a restaurant until 1996, my love affair with Spain started much earlier.</p>
<p class="C3609">As a marketing executive, flying around the world for Sauza Tequila or L’Oréal shampoo, I had nursed an ambition to become an entrepreneur. That this ambition found its expression as a restaurateur was almost by chance. While living in New York City in the 1990s, I hatched a plan with some friends to open a bar—the sort of plan you make over (many) drinks and that is soon forgotten. Though, for some reason, I didn’t forget it.</p>
<p class="C3609">I kept thinking about it, dreaming up ideas, looking for partners, and scouting potential venues. In the end, I was seduced by an abandoned restaurant project on the Lower East Side. Someone had spent years excavating a basement on Ludlow St. to create a magical, subterranean “grotto,” and it was my good fortune to find it.</p>
<p class="C3609">Since it was too big for just a bar, I thought, “Why not open a restaurant?” I had never run a restaurant, and my only prior hospitality experience had ended with me getting fired from a college server gig after just two days. What could go wrong?</p>
<p class="C3609">Nevertheless, I worked on the project nights and weekends, and somehow managed to raise enough money to claim that basement space on the Lower East Side. I juggled my day job at Allied Domecq, the world’s second-largest wine and spirits company, with moonlighting as a budding restaurateur with my then business partner and still friend Phil Morgan. In 2000 we opened Suba, an expectation-defying Spanish restaurant on Ludlow St. Suba was an ambitious restaurant in a difficult location. We were in for a challenge.</p>
<p class="C3609">Here are the facts:</p>
<div class="C3610">
<p class="C3617"><span class="C3619">•</span>The owners of Suba had never run a restaurant.</p>
<p class="C3617"><span class="C3619">•</span>The dining room was in the basement and surrounded by a moat.</p>
<p class="C3617"><span class="C3619">•</span>The chef was French but the menu was Spanish.</p>
</div>
<p class="C3609">None of it was exactly a recipe for success.</p>
<p class="C3609">Despite that, Suba lasted nearly ten years and helped me get my start in the business. Boqueria would not have been possible without the years of experience I gained in that first venture.</p>
<p class="C3609">My first restaurant taught me just how hard the business can be. Most people do not appreciate just how many different things have to go right to create the perfect guest experience. Consequently, my advice to anyone not already in this industry who dreams of opening a restaurant is this: “If you have ANY other legal means of supporting yourself, do that instead.” Until you establish yourself, and even after you do, running a restaurant is hard work.</p>
<p class="C3609">In retrospect, it still amazes me that the thought of quitting and going back to a “real job” never entered my head. Through hell and high water (and with a moat-surrounded dining room, high water was an all-too-common calamity) my stubborn streak held up. This HAD to work.</p>
<p class="C3609">What did I take away from that first experience?</p>
<div class="C3610">
<p class="C3621">1<span class="C3622">.</span>You should give people what they want. (As a former publicist once told me, while we were dining at an “ambitious” chef-owned restaurant, “I want to ask the chef: ‘Is this your dinner, or my dinner?’”)</p>
<p class="C3621a">2<span class="C3622a">.</span>Know <em>exactly</em> what you want people to think about your restaurant (think condensed “elevator pitch”—that is, one that could be expressed in a 20-second elevator ride).</p>
<p class="C3621a">3<span class="C3622a">.</span>Build a team that supports you—or abandon all hope of the semblance of a normal life.</p>
<p class="C3621a">4<span class="C3622a">.</span>When everything lines up, running a restaurant can be an intensely satisfying experience.</p>
</div>
<p class="C3609">Long before the idea of opening a restaurant (let alone several of them) became a real project, the genesis of Boqueria had started with repeated exposure to Spanish food and culture.</p>
<p class="C3609">Although I grew up in France, as a child I spent every August sailing in the Mediterranean with my parents. Leaving Barcelona after a few days of shopping to stock up our little boat with Rioja, whiskey, cans of anchovies, etc., we spent the month of August sailing between Ibiza, Mallorca and Menorca.</p>
<p class="C3609">This all sounds far more glamorous than the reality: a family of five children crammed on a 35-foot sailboat helmed by a father figure with autocratic tendencies even for a boat captain. Still, it all made for great memories.</p>
<p class="C3609">Much later, I returned to Barcelona as a 17-year-old boarding school escapee to attend a year abroad as a high school senior. Getting high on the Ramblas and dating Swedish girls from the “Spanish for Foreigners” school one flight below my abode was a <em>huge</em> step up from Deerfield, the (then) all-boys prep school I’d left behind.</p>
<p class="C3609">A few years later, I returned to Spain again to work in Madrid for six months during my MBA internship with Colgate. This time with greater means and independence, I ventured deeper into Spanish gastronomy. Bars such as José Luis, Cibeles, and Viva Madrid intensified my love <span id="page_13">of</span> tapas bars and planted a seed that would germinate years later. Eating like this was fun in a way that a “regular” meal never was. You could sample a range of deceptively simple yet memorable dishes and stay or leave whenever the spirit moved you; groups could form and disband at will as people joined you or moved on; and you committed to the experience one bite at a time. Eating at the bar or standing up gave these spaces an energy that most restaurants could never match.</p>
<p class="C3609">It was this accumulated experience and web of memories that all came together in Boqueria.</p>
<p class="C3609">When we opened Boqueria in 2006, there were generally two types of tapas place in New York: bars that provided loads of fun but little in the way of culinary ambition … and the reverse.</p>
<p class="C3609">Boqueria was our attempt at offering all the fun of tapas bars with no compromises. All the fun (or at least most of the fun) of a dive bar, without compromising on what was on your plate.</p>
<p class="C3609">Ten years later, it still works. Boqueria is the sort of place you can bring anyone, any group, any night. It feels both like home and like nowhere else.</p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_18">It’s</span> Beautiful</p>
<p class="C3608">The phone was ringing but Will Meyer wasn’t picking up. Will was one of the two principals of Meyer Davis, the young design studio Yann had cajoled into designing Boqueria, his second restaurant. Yann stood on 19th Street, peering into Boqueria, watching the staff polish glasses and set the tables for the first (mock) service. He dialed Will again. Still no answer.</p>
<p class="C3609">Two years earlier, Yann had traveled to Barcelona with Will and business partner Gray Davis to start the design process. He wanted to show them his favorite haunts, hoping they could help him capture the essence of the city. He was in love with the modern design he’d seen in Barcelona and wanted Boqueria to strike this great balance between upscale and intimate. “Stark and modern” was an option, but it wouldn’t have felt warm or embraced any heritage. He knew that the restaurant had to be beautiful. He loved architecture and design and wanted the restaurant to reflect that passion.</p>
<p class="C3609">In Barcelona, design inspiration is everywhere. They visited the warm but minimalist Hotel Omm, in the fashionable El Eixample neighborhood, and ventured through the cobblestone, tree-lined streets of El Born to the must-visit restaurant El Xampanyet, where they sipped cava and gazed at the tiled walls and shelves lined with bottles of Catalan wine. At Paco Meralgo, they settled on high bar stools at a table in the tiny tapas bar and focused their attention on the cozy, modern design and the large chalkboard menu covered in carefree Catalan script.</p>
<p class="C3609">Just before heading back to New York, Yann spotted some beautiful Catalan modern door handles in a small hardware shop and bought them on sight. They would be perfect for the front doors.</p>
<p class="C3609">Now, he stood facing the restaurant and glanced at the handles, appreciating them anew. Although he had spent the better part of the previous eight months in the small space, it had been in construction, and this was the first time he was seeing the restaurant. The tarp that had protected the bar top during construction had been removed to reveal a heavy marble slab. The mess of tools and Masonite gone, he could finally see the polished concrete floors and the curved banquettes that hugged the dining room. The walls, clad in white oak, soaked up the golden incandescence of the simple lightbulbs. The warm glow spilled out into summer twilight. What he had been imagining for years stood right in front of him.</p>
<p class="C3609">As the staff continued to fine-tune the dining room and prep for service, Yann dialed Will again. They had spent weeks going back and forth about tile choices, table heights, stool design, ceilings, and numerous other seemingly insignificant details that no one might ever notice but that would either add up to a beautiful, seamless experience, or trip up the vibe like a false note in an orchestra. Inevitably, there had been bumps in the road, compromises, changing minds and differences of opinions—always against the clock. Maybe that was why Will wasn’t answering. He was probably thinking, “What now?”</p>
<p class="C3609">Will finally picked up. “Yann…” The hesitation and trepidation in his voice were palpable. Yann put his fears to rest: “Will, I’m standing outside the restaurant. It’s beautiful.” And it really was.</p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_20">Marc</span> Vidal, Executive Chef</p>
<p class="C3608">When I turned nine years old, my mom finally managed to put me to work at Bar Roca, the restaurant that she and her family ran. It was 1986. Ronald Reagan was on TV all the time, and Argentina (with Diego Maradona) won the World Cup. Barcelona was selected to host the ’92 Olympics, and the price of our daily four-course lunch menu at Bar Roca was 450 pesetas, around U.S. $3.</p>
<p class="C3609">The menu changed daily, but the first course was usually a simple green salad with a couple slices of tomato, olives, onion, and a hard-boiled egg. For the second course, the guest could choose between three or four light dishes—for example, green beans with serrano ham or escalivada, a roasted vegetable salad. The main course always offered a choice of protein. We served traditional dishes. Stewed rabbit was a favorite. So was the “lomo rebozado,” slim slices of pork loin that would get an egg-and-flour wash before being pan-fried. The thin batter would puff when it cooked. I liked them best later on, after they had cooled. My cousin, Alex, and I would have contests to see who could eat the most slices.</p>
<p class="C3609">Every Thursday we served paella, and people lined up for it in front of our tiny façade. Most of the people in the line worked in neighborhood factories. We were just five blocks away from the church of the Sagrada Família. Gaudí’s most famous building is now Barcelona’s most popular tourist destination, but back then there were no tourists, and the neighborhood still had a lot of industry. I can remember the Estrella Damm bottling plant. Every time I passed, I took a deep breath because I loved the strong smell of barley and yeast. I would always take a break to perch on the stairs by the front gate. From there I could catch a glimpse, through the large windows, of the giant machines filling the beer bottles inside. It was fascinating. Whenever I saw Estrella workers in the restaurant, I would wonder to myself if they got to operate those machines. What a cool job.</p>
<p class="C3609">My own tasks at the time were not quite so interesting: sweeping and washing dishes. But I wanted to learn to cook. I was famous (still am) for asking dozens of questions, and I would bombard my grandmother with them while watching her. “Why do you cut these this way?” “How do you know when to take it out of the oven?” Eventually, I guess, she recognized an interest and started to teach me a few basics.</p>
<p class="C3609">As I got older, I graduated to pulling espresso for regulars before heading to school, then returning after class to make bread pudding and help close up shop. My father saw a spark of interest, and when it came time to choose a career path, he offered to pay for culinary school. I liked the idea, but when I proposed it to my mom’s side of the family, my grandmother instantly objected. “Don’t do it,” she advised. “You’re crazy. Too much work. Too many long hours. Don’t you see what we go through in this business?”</p>
<p class="C3609">Despite her advice, I enrolled. I was the youngest in my class at Escola de Restauració i Hostalatge de Barcelona. Whenever I wasn’t in class, I was working in restaurant kitchens—peeling potatoes, dicing onions, and picking up speed and discipline along the way.</p>
<p class="C3609">In the years just after leaving school, I expanded my knowledge of Spanish cuisine. I had a job in the Catalonian Pyrenees and spent a summer cooking in the Canary Islands. At Gaig, a Michelin-starred Barcelona restaurant, I worked as a prep cook and saw many of the dishes I had originally learned to prepare with my family reinvented and reimagined. Seeing that food treated with such reverence and respect gave me an incredible sense of pride.</p>
<p class="C3609">Later I worked stints in Barcelona and Paris, broadening my culinary knowledge along the way. At Alain Passard’s L’Arpège, in Paris, I trained in the pastry station, where I learned to make their amazing mille-feuilles, the best version of this airy, custard-layered puff pastry I have ever eaten. Across the Seine at Restaurant Alain Ducasse, I learned that obsessing over ingredients and mastering simplicity could produce magical results. I still remember a dish of poached langoustines nestled in a reduced cream sauce that had been slowly infused with the langoustine heads. A dollop of osetra caviar topped the succulent shellfish. The simple combination was spectacular. I aspired to cook like that.</p>
<p class="C3609">Once while I was working in Barcelona as a pastry chef, my friend Angel called me with exciting news. El Bulli, Ferran Adrià’s famed restaurant on the Costa Brava, needed people to work the rest of the season. I jumped at the opportunity. But on my first day in the kitchen, I twisted my ankle. A doctor told me to stay off my feet for two weeks, but I couldn’t throw away the chance to work with Adrià, so I taped up my ankle and kept going with the rest of the crew. The days were long and trying—in at 9:00 a.m. and out at midnight, with just one 15-minute break—but it was one of the best life and cooking experiences I ever had. It blew my mind to see how limitless culinary creativity could be.</p>
<p class="C3609">My career continued to progress, and larger opportunities presented themselves. An offer to head the kitchen of a new Spanish restaurant in Miami pulled me away from my first executive chef position in Barcelona. The prospect of building a menu of Catalan classics for a fresh audience excited me. For inspiration I looked all the way back to the little kitchen at Bar Roca and to my family’s <span id="page_22">recipes,</span> then transformed them with the technique and eye I had developed over my career. The food I made for that venture garnered attention, and landed me an offer to open the W Hotel restaurant in nearby South Beach.</p>
<p class="C3609">It was during a trip with the W team to New York City that I first visited Boqueria. I had never eaten there before and didn’t know anything about it when I walked into the SoHo restaurant that evening. The atmosphere struck me immediately. The place was packed, and I was captivated. I loved the music and lighting and enjoyed watching the chefs hard at work in the open kitchen from my seat at the large communal table in the center of the restaurant. I had often thought that the States had yet to capture the real energy of Spain in a restaurant, but that night in Boqueria, I thought, “This is amazing. They did it. It’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="C3609">While we were eating, Yann stopped by our table to say hello. I talked to him for five or ten minutes, and in that short time, we were laughing. I had a good feeling about this place.</p>
<p class="C3609">Back in Miami a few months later, a recruiter called me. “There’s a company in New York. They have two Spanish restaurants and they’re looking for an executive chef.” I interrupted her: “Boqueria, right?” She fell silent for a second before asking, “How did you know?” I don’t know how I knew. I just did. I hadn’t stopped thinking about my experience at Boqueria, and about how I much I wanted to serve my food in that environment. It felt right. Just months later, I was rolling up the sleeves of my Boqueria chef coat for the first time.</p>
<p class="C3609">I often think back to my grandmother’s warning, that the life of a chef would be hard work. She was absolutely right. But, in this case, I’m glad I ignored her advice.</p>

</div>
<p class="C3607"><span id="page_24">Our</span> Food</p>
<p class="C3608">We take our name from Barcelona’s Boqueria Market. The sprawling expanse of masterfully merchandised stalls selling every food product imaginable sits just off La Rambla, the wide pedestrian artery of Barcelona’s old city center. It has been in that same spot for hundreds of years, and in that time it has evolved into one of the world’s greatest markets, an inspiring place for anyone who loves food. The world’s most prized ingredients, such as Jamón Ibérico, sit alongside the freshest local seafood and vegetables. Pungent spice aromas mingle with the zesty scent of freshly squeezed citrus and the fragrance of just-pulled espresso.</p>
<p class="C3609">Kioskos, or small tapas bars, sit along the perimeter of the market. Every morning their chefs walk the corridors to select the day’s best produce, fish, and meat. These products drive the daily menu, which will be scrawled on a chalkboard or shouted to patrons over the din of the neighboring market. The menus weave together a mix of familiar dishes like croquetas and salt-cod fritters with specials featuring rare or prized ingredients, such as gooseneck barnacles from Galicia or sweet, incandescent orange shrimp from Palamòs on the Costa Brava.</p>
<p class="C3609">At Boqueria, we create our menu in the same spirit. Every Friday Marc meets with the chefs from each of our restaurants to toss around ideas and experiment with new dishes. They have already visited the Union Square Greenmarket. Although it is much smaller than the Boqueria Market, it is charged with the same vitality and stocked with beautiful produce. Now the team gathers in the kitchen of our SoHo location with shopping bags overflowing with fresh ingredients. Some of those ingredients will become the stars of our “market menu” of seasonal specials; others will provide an important flourish or a finishing touch.</p>
<p class="C3609">Marc starts with a list of ideas he’d like to try out, and the team gets to work. They take a first pass at each new dish. Marc is relentless as he pushes the staff for honest feedback. He makes laps around the restaurant with a new salad or tapa in hand, asking everyone working to taste. He presses for an honest opinion: “Qué?” He asks and watches intently as a manager takes a bite. His eyes widen while he looks for a reaction. “You like it? More lemon juice? Does it need something crunchy?”</p>
<p class="C3609">Each dish is made several times over until everyone agrees that it’s the best it can be. Even then, many dishes will never make it onto the market menu. Even fewer will shoulder their way onto the classic tapas menu between the paella and the pimientos. The (metaphorical) tapas bar is high.</p>
<p class="C3609">On the Boqueria table, every dish must stand alone and stand out, each one fully composed and incorporating a variety of tastes and textures. Classic dishes such as patatas bravas and gambas al ajilo get fine-tuned to a New York buzz with an uptick in spice or an added texture. Other dishes celebrate traditional Spanish products in completely new ways; for example, a staple huevo estrellado (fried egg) sits under just-sliced Jamón Ibérico over homemade potato chips with a decadent truffled potato cream.</p>
<p class="C3609">Often we look no further than the farmers’ market for inspiration and celebrate the fresh, seasonal ingredients available to us here in New York City. Even in these dishes Marc always looks to incorporate a nod to Spain. A salad of fresh pears and radicchio finds balance with a shower of salty aged Mahón cheese. Crisp cauliflower comes to life when paired with a fragrant saffron dressing.</p>
<p class="C3609">For the final test of each dish, we look back to the tapas bars of Spain. Their food is always easy to share and easier to love. That’s what tapas are all about—dishes that inspire connection and conversation. We look for the connection at every service.</p>
<p class="C3609">When a guest flags down a server to ask, “What’s in that incredible sauce?”</p>
<p class="C3609">When someone leans over the kitchen counter to take pictures of the sizzling seafood-packed plancha. “Are those the squid? I had them. They were amazing!”</p>
<p class="C3609">When plates move around the table as quickly as the conversation.</p>
<p class="C3609">That’s the true measure of our success.</p>

<p class="C3608">In 2006, when Boqueria opened, there was no Yelp, no Instagram, no Facebook, no competition for the old-guard media. The opinions of key restaurant critics could make or break a new restaurant. Shortly after its opening, in 2000, Yann’s first restaurant, Suba, had received a harsh one-star review in the <em>New York Times</em>. It nearly killed the business, which took years to recover.</p>
<p class="C3609">We weren’t sure Boqueria would get reviewed (not every restaurant does), but we knew a <em>Times</em> review could make all the difference. We needed Frank Bruni, the <em>New York Times</em> food critic, to visit. And that review had to be good.</p>
<p class="C3609">In those early months, we were always on the lookout for Bruni. Eventually, we spotted him. He came! And then he returned. We examined every detail of his visits for clues. Did he clean his plates? What facial expressions did he make? What tip did he leave? In the end, we could decipher nothing. We had no idea what he thought.</p>
<p class="C3609">It was October when the <em>Times</em> contacted our publicist to let him know that a review was imminent. The paper sent a photographer in to take pictures of the dining room and a few select dishes, and Bruni called to interview Yann and our opening chef. Each step moved us closer toward the review, anxiety rising day by day.</p>
<p class="C3609">In 2006 Spanish chefs were the darlings of the food world. Ferran Adrià’s restaurant, El Bulli, on Catalonia’s Costa Brava, had become a destination for culinary pilgrims. Basque chefs such as Martín Berasategui and Andoni Luis Aduriz had transformed San Sebastián into the city with the most Michelin stars per capita in the world. Spain was on the culinary map, but it had been put there by chef-driven fine dining restaurants, not by upscale tapas bars or “gastropubs.”</p>
<p class="C3609">We wanted to showcase the other Spanish cuisine, the delicious ingredient-driven dishes and Spanish classics that made the food at our favorite tapas bars so irresistible. The farm-to-table movement quickly gaining popularity in New York at the time seemed right in line with what tapas bars had been doing forever: talking to farmers, fishmongers, and foragers; cultivating relationships with the best meat and dairy purveyors; buying the best product possible every day and preparing it with care.</p>
<p class="C3609">We hoped we had done that. Would Bruni feel the same? We had seen our dining room fill nightly with happy guests and had been reassured by their enthusiasm for the food, service, and space. Regulars started to return once or twice a week and bring in their friends. But it was still slow early in the week, especially outside prime dinner hours. A positive review in the <em>New York Times</em> would be the ultimate validation and would bring us the business we needed for real success.</p>
<p class="C3609">What if Bruni didn’t like it? What if we tried too hard to loosen up service? Did we make it so informal and friendly that it came over as too casual? Was he comfortable in the high bar-stool seating? <em>Did he like the food?</em></p>
<p class="C3609">Eventually, the <em>New York Times</em> gave us a heads-up. The review would be featured in the November 1, 2006 edition, and we knew that the reviews always post to the website first, appearing late on the night before the print editions hit newsstands.</p>
<p class="C3609">Once service ended on Halloween night, Yann gathered the general manager and the opening chef at a back corner table. The review was due to post. They were spooked and huddled around a laptop, reloading the food section every minute or so. They took turns speculating, and with each passing minute the tension and their blood pressure rose.</p>
<p class="C3609">Refresh. Still last week’s review. Refresh. Still last week’s review. Refresh. Refresh. Refresh. Still last week’s review. Refresh, and then … a headline: “Tapas: It’s Not About Commitment.” And just underneath? Two <em>New York Times</em> stars! Restaurants four times as ambitious had been given no stars at all. “Two stars! Two stars! We did it!”</p>
<p class="C3609">The staff dropped their closing side work to hug and cheer and break out some cava for a toast while the others continued to read. The text spun on the page as they moved through the column hardly taking a single breath.</p>
<p class="C3609">He liked the food! He liked the high seats! He thought the squid was “fantastic” and the lamb was “beautifully braised!” He said the cojonudo was “My kind of finger food.” One sentence captured it best: “In New York it’s easier to make like you’re having tapas than to actually have them. The happy, peppy new Spanish restaurant Boqueria, named for the food market in Barcelona, is doing what it can to change that.”</p>
<p class="C3609">He got it! Years of dreaming and hard work had gone into building Boqueria, and Bruni had just given our future a green light. We were ecstatic.</p>
