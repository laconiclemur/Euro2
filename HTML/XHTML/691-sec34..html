<p class="nonindent">The Moors crossed into Spain from North Africa centuries ago and their cultural influence remains strong today. You can see it in the architecture and taste it in the cuisine. When opening Cúrate, we wanted to create a dish in homage to Moorish culture. The concept of grilled meat sticks comes from all over Spain and North Africa. These skewers smother lamb in a generously spiced marinade that blends the seasonings from both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make these with precut lamb cubes. If you’re cutting the meat yourself, you’ll need to purchase about 3 pounds of boneless lamb shoulder or leg. Once you trim off all the fat and silverskin, you’ll end up with 2 pounds of meat to cut into cubes.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup packed fresh cilantro leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 garlic cloves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon garam masala</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons pimentón (sweet smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 dried arbol chiles</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 fresh or dried bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ teaspoons black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder or leg of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Cucumber Onion Pickles (recipe follows)</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">COMBINE THE CILANTRO, PARSLEY, GARLIC, LEMON</span> juice, garam masala, thyme, pimentón, chiles, bay leaves, peppercorns, oil, and 2 teaspoons salt in a blender and blend on high until smooth.</p>
<p class="indent">Pour the marinade over the lamb in a bowl and mix until all of the lamb pieces are evenly coated. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Two hours before you’re ready to cook, soak 16 (6-inch-long) bamboo skewers in cold water. (You can skip this step if you’re using metal skewers.)</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re ready to cook, heat an outdoor grill, preferably charcoal, or indoor grill pan to high. Thread five or six lamb pieces on each skewer. Season each skewer on all sides with salt.</p>
<p class="indent">Grill the skewers, turning once, until medium, about 4 to 6 minutes total. The outside should be charred and the meat should have a little resistance if you press it. Serve immediately with the Cucumber Onion Pickles.</p>
<h2 class="sec2"><span class="border1">CUCUMBER ONION PICKLES</span></h2>
<h2 class="serve"><span class="small">MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Pickles aren’t common in Spain, but they taste great with some Spanish dishes, like Pinchos Morunos. The sour crunch of this half-sour pickle simultaneously cuts through the richness of the lamb and accentuates the complexity of the spiced marinade.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ sweet onion</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 English cucumber</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ cup sherry vinegar</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">USING A MANDOLINE OR THE SLICING BLADE OF A</span> food processor, slice the onion as thinly as possible and the cucumber into 1/16-inch slices. Transfer both to an airtight container.</p>
<p class="indent">Bring the sugar, salt, and ¾ cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Remove from the heat, stir in the vinegar, and pour over the cucumber and onion. Cover tightly and refrigerate at least overnight and up to 1 week.</p>
