<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Oeufs à la Coque, a classic breakfast of soft-boiled eggs, served with thin <em>bâtons</em> of toast (sometimes referred to in English as “soldiers”) is so simple, yet also feels so special. To make a slightly elevated version, I flavor the toasts with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and thyme and wrap them in prosciutto. The toasts also make great snacks to have with cocktails.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 slices country bread</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Small handful grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme</p>
<p class="ingredient">8 slices prosciutto, cut in half lengthwise</p>
<p class="ingredient">8 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Cut each slice of bread into 4 long bâtons (each should be about the size of your index finger). Place the bâtons on a baking sheet in an even layer and bake in the oven, turning the bread every so often, until dry and golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and drizzle the oil evenly over the toasts. Scatter over the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and the thyme leaves so that each toast is hit with a bit of both. Wrap each toast with a strip of the prosciutto and then place the toasts back on the baking sheet, being sure to leave a bit of space between them.</p>
<p>Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake the toasts until the prosciutto is just barely beginning to crisp, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a pot of water. Gently add the eggs to the water and cook for exactly 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to bowls or individual egg cups if you have them. Serve the eggs with the toasts.</p>
<p>To eat, use a table knife to cut the top off of each egg, and use a little spoon to dig out the beautifully cooked egg, spreading the yolk on your savory toast, or even dipping your toast into the egg yolk. However you please, really.</p></div>
