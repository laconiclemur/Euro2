<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>espite everything that the forward-thinking Henri IV accomplished in his lifetime—uniting Navarre with France, enacting the Edict of Nantes, becoming the first French monarch from the House of Bourbon—a remark about chicken remains the most famous thing the Gasco-Béarnais king ever said. Speaking to either the Duke of Sully or the Duke of Savoy, depending on which history book you’re reading, the monarch uttered some version of the following pronouncement: “As long as God keeps me, I shall make sure no laborer in my kingdom lacks the means to have a chicken in his pot.” Thanks to his words, the enduring peasant dish known as <i>poule au pot</i> is now forever associated with le Roi Henri.</p>
<p class="indent">As a rule, Americans don’t boil chicken. We prefer to fry it or grill it or sear it or roast it, occasionally with a beer can up its backside. We like our chickens young and white-fleshed. We like them <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" title="120"/>mild-tasting and quick-cooking. Poule au pot is the opposite of all those things.</p>
<p class="indent">And it is so much better.</p>
<p class="indent">This truth was revealed to me when Nadine finally had us over for lunch.</p>
<p class="indent">We arrived at Nadine’s early in the morning. I was feeling wobbly. I’d gone to the Esbouhats the previous evening, intending to stay for one drink, but ended up making a night of it after Basso had chided me in front of everyone.</p>
<p class="indent">“Eh oh, once you walk in, you’re in till the end!” he’d shouted. To my protests that I’d already eaten, he countered, “A real Gascon eats two dinners!”</p>
<p class="indent">This was surely an exaggeration, but even so, some ninety minutes after the evening meal I’d shared with my family, I had a second one, working my way through a couple of roasted tomato halves, several thick slices of roast pork, a pile of egg noodles bathed in <i>jus</i>, a wedge of cheese, and a large piece of eau-de-vie–drenched tiramisu. I’d gone to sleep sitting up, hands on my belly, and awakened feeling less than sanguine about a garbure-esque session of toiling over a soup pot, followed by a big lunch. As we pulled up in front of Nadine’s maize-colored farmhouse, I was more in the mood for dry toast than boiled bird.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine’s kitchen looked tinier than I remembered it. This may have been because of the staggering abundance of ingredients piled everywhere. The table was a Flemish Master still life: bunches of untrimmed turnips and carrots, a pile of fresh leeks, a riot of parsley and thyme and chervil, a whole cabbage, capers, shallots, heads of garlic, cooked and uncooked eggs, a bowl of uncooked sausage, a hunk of beef shank, four veal tails, and, at the center of it all, a very yellow plucked hen, its three-toed feet sticking into the air in a vaguely salacious way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121" title="121"/>“Isn’t she a beauty?” Nadine said after we’d had a coffee and put on our aprons. She plucked a stray quill from the carcass. “You can hardly find old birds like her anymore. One has to know the right farmer.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine introduced us to Jenny, the live-in helper she’d told us about. Jenny looked away from us shyly when we said <i>bonjour</i>. She was asked to fetch something from the <i>arrière-cuisine</i>, and disappeared down a long, narrow hallway.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine crossed her arms, exhaled with puffed cheeks, and took stock of the table.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Bon</i>, let’s get started.” She pulled out a chair for me. “<i>Dah-veed</i>, you can make the <i>sauce gribiche</i> for the chicken.”</p>
<p class="indent">I sat down. Tentatively, I reached for the hard-boiled eggs. There were definitely eggs in a sauce gribiche. And capers—that I was sure of.</p>
<p class="indent">“You <i>do</i> know how to make a sauce gribiche, yes?” Nadine said.</p>
<p class="indent">“I used to,” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">She refreshed me on the basics and plunked down the other ingredients—oil, vinegar, chervil, tarragon.</p>
<p class="indent">Now she gave Michele a roll of kitchen twine and asked her to make a few bouquets garnis for the broth.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele took a seat opposite me. Her hands hovered uncertainly over the piles of herbs.</p>
<p class="indent">I leaned across the table. “You <i>do</i> know how to make a bouquet garni, yes?”</p>
<p class="indent">Michele held my gaze coolly and extended her middle finger. She pulled out a few sprigs of each kind of herb and started tying them together.</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh, my,” said Nadine, coming over. “That won’t do at all.”</p>
<p class="indent">She sat down next to Michele and took the twine from her. “<i>Regarde</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine grabbed three leeks, three stalks of celery, an entire <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122" title="122"/>bunch of parsley, a fistful of fresh thyme, and a dozen sprigs of rosemary, and bound them all up like cordwood. She placed the enormous bundle in front of Michele. “Two more like this should do the trick.”</p>
<p class="indent">Jenny had returned, and she and Nadine started making the forcemeat stuffing. This entailed mixing a few pounds of fresh sausage with the minced heart and liver of the hen, a minced onion, lots of parsley and thyme, a couple of raw eggs, and some bread that had been soaking in milk. <i>Cook that all up with some fried eggs</i>, I said to myself, <i>and you’d have dinner for six</i>. To all this Nadine made the superfluous addition of some rolled oats.</p>
<p class="indent">She winked at me. “They’re good for the colon.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now Jenny was holding the bird open by the legs while Nadine spooned in the stuffing. The two women worked together like well-meshed gears, exchanging barely a word. Nadine sewed the cavity shut using a long needle and some of the kitchen twine, and then used the excess twine to secure the legs snugly to the body. She brought the ends of the twine around the tail nubbin and snipped them. I’d never seen anyone truss a bird with more authority. It looked like a yellow football with limbs.</p>
<p class="indent">I was done with the sauce gribiche. Nadine looked in the bowl and frowned. She poked at the sauce. “<i>Oh la</i>, this should all be minced finer.” She sucked her finger and then assumed a chipper tone. “<i>Pas grave</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">A brown enameled cookpot filled with water had been heating on the stove since our arrival. It was a very big cookpot. You could have bathed a medium-size dog in it. Nadine carried the trussed bird over to the stove. She lowered the hen into the bubbling water and then added the hunk of beef shin, the veal tails, the three gargantuan bouquets garnis, two chicken necks, and four chicken feet.</p>
<p class="indent">“Wow.” It was all I could think of to say.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123" title="123"/>Nadine flashed me one of her <i>Why so surprised?</i> looks. “I like a hearty broth.”</p>
<p class="indent">She gave the pot a stir, put down the spoon, and started rummaging through one of the kitchen drawers. She pulled out a box of surgical gauze.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked her if she’d cut herself.</p>
<p class="indent">Appearing to have taken this as a joke, she laughed and walked back over to the table, where she scissored off four lengths of the gauze. Then she and Jenny used them to make skinless boudin-like sausages with the rest of the forcemeat stuffing. Nadine tied off the end of one of the zeppelin-shaped packets. “We’ll drop these into the pot just before the bird is done,” she said. “Surgical gauze,” she added, “is a Gascon cook’s best friend.”</p>
<p class="indent">She took off her apron. “Now we let it simmer. Come, let’s find something to put out for apéro.”</p>
<p class="indent">While Jenny stayed behind to skim the broth, Michele and I followed Nadine down the hall and into a chilly, concrete-floored backroom. Cinder-block walls were lined with metal shelves stocked with hundreds of hand-labeled mason jars. On a long table covered in plastic were piles of canning equipment. This was Nadine’s arrière-cuisine.</p>
<p class="indent">Perusing the shelves and studying the labels, I realized I’d stumbled into the Alexandria Library of canning cellars. The room was a shrine to every imaginable Gascon farmhouse recipe—civets of hare and wild boar, daubes of beef and cèpe mushrooms, <i>salmis</i> of wood pigeon and squab, conserves of haricots Tarbais and tomatoes and green beans. Three shelves were devoted to foie gras alone—plain foie gras, foie gras with apples, foie gras with raisins, foie gras with Armagnac. Duck confit got an entire shelving unit: duck legs, duck necks, duck gizzards, duck wings, duck breasts.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s a terrible mess in here,” said Nadine, raising a pair of glasses <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124" title="124"/>to her nose to examine a jar. She put it back and pulled down a different one. “Ah, here we are. I think foie gras with figs would be nice for today, no?”</p>
<p class="indent">It didn’t seem possible, but I was starting to feel a dull intimation of hunger.</p>
<p class="indent">There was plenty of sweet stuff on the shelves, too: grape jelly, red currant preserves, rhubarb preserves, strawberry, raspberry, mulberry, blackberry.</p>
<p class="indent">I picked up a jar labeled “<i>gratte-cul</i>”—literally, “ass-scratcher.” Nadine told me it was the nickname for rose hip. “Because of what the bristles do when you’re trying to pick it.” She scratched her haunch.</p>
<p class="indent">Then she took the jar and put it in an empty apple crate. “You can take it home for Charlotte.”</p>
<p class="indent">She started plucking more jars from the shelves and adding them to the crate—two, four, six, eight.</p>
<p class="indent">Now she was gazing with glistening eyes at a particularly tall one in her hand. “Goose neck stuffed with foie gras, my husband’s favorite.”</p>
<p class="indent">Into the crate it went.</p>
<p class="indent">“Nadine,” I said, “you don’t have to give us that.”</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Pff</i>, please. It’s not like <i>he’s</i> going to eat it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Michele was inspecting a shelf of sauces and coulis. “Who <i>is</i> going to eat all this?”</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine shrugged. “Grandkids, friends. It was different when there were lots of hungry men around. I suppose I keep doing it out of habit.”</p>
<p class="indent">By the time we returned to the kitchen, it had filled with a bewitching aroma—a deep and chicken-y scent, a scent thick with promise.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125" title="125"/>We still had time to kill while the bird finished cooking, so Nadine made more coffee. Preparing the poule au pot had put her in a sentimental mood, and she reminisced for a while about the dishes she’d eaten growing up. One was called <i>sanguette</i>, which she described as a duck’s blood omelet. Another was<i> alicot</i>, a slow-simmered ragoût of unglamorous duck parts—giblets, necks, wings, feet. The name, she said, came from the Occitan <i>ale y cot</i>, for <i>aile et cou</i>, which means “wing and neck.” She dwelled with particular relish on <i>graisserons</i>, a sort of scrapple made from the bits of meat and cartilage left over after making confit.</p>
<p class="indent">“You spread it on toast,” she said. “<i>C’est magnifique</i>.”</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>NADINE HAD INVITED HER FRIEND</small> Danielle to join us for lunch, and also André Dubosc, who lived just up the road. He walked in with a carton of wine and a toothy grin. When I introduced him to Michele, he practically genuflected.</p>
<p class="indent">“You’re in for a rare treat,” he said, clasping Michele’s hands in his. “No one makes a finer poule au pot than Nadine.”</p>
<p class="indent">Jenny had cleaned off the kitchen table, and we all sat down. Dubosc poured glasses of Pacherenc, and Nadine served the foie gras on slices of toasted black bread. The fullness I’d been weighed down with earlier was now a memory.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc told a story about how, many decades ago, the town of Viella had been gerrymandered out of the Madiran appellation because of a local feud.</p>
<p class="indent">“In those days,” he said, “villagers seldom traveled outside their <i>commune</i>. People from Viella considered people from the other side of the Adour River outsiders. People from the Béarn considered the Gers a foreign country. This created misunderstandings.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126" title="126"/>Dubosc said his father persuaded the quarreling parties to put aside their differences, resolving the dispute and bringing prosperity to the village.</p>
<p class="indent">“He was a true gentleman, your father,” Nadine said to him.</p>
<p class="indent">“So was your husband,” said Dubosc. “<i>C’était un vrai monsieur</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">They clinked glasses.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine went into the kitchen, prodded the contents of the cookpot with a wooden spoon, and took a taste. She pronounced the poule au pot ready.</p>
<p class="indent">First came bowls of the bouillon by itself, strained and then thickened with a little tapioca powder. It was a broth of fathomless richness, chicken soup’s platonic ideal.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, borne by Nadine on an enormous platter, came the main attraction. Dubosc closed his eyes and inhaled deeply as it passed in front of his face on its way to the center of the table. Danielle, seated across from him, did the same, causing her glasses to steam up.</p>
<p class="indent">Like a number of dishes beloved by Gascons, poule au pot is defiantly unphotogenic. There is no crisp, burnished skin, no oven-caramelized vegetables, just pieces of boiled chicken and mounds of khaki-colored stuffing on a bed of limp-looking turnips, leeks, potatoes, cabbage, and carrots. But it is a thing of beauty nonetheless. It is beautiful <i>because</i> it is delicious. A real poule au pot is the product not so much of cooking as of alchemy. In the crucible of the stewpot, the humblest ingredients are rendered sublime, infused with flavors of stupendous depth and intensity.</p>
<p class="indent">I took a bite of each thing on my plate. Each ingredient tasted a hundred times better than it ever could have if it had been cooked and seasoned on its own.</p>
<p class="indent">I told Nadine, without exaggerating, that it was the best chicken dish I’d ever had.</p>
<p class="indent">She gave an <i>oh you!</i> wave of the hand.</p>
<p class="indent">“Don’t be silly,” she said. “It’s simple peasant food.”</p>
