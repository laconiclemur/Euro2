<p class="intro">In Scandinavia, anything small and baked in the fashion of a biscuit or cookie is called a little cake (<i>småkage</i> in Danish), which I guess is what it is. A perfect two bites with a cup of tea or coffee. Throughout Scandinavia, you will find hundreds of recipes for different varieties – too many to include here. We have chosen some favourites from our café to share with you.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_18"/>Kokostoppe</p>
<p class="head1">COCONUT TOPS</p>
<p class="intro">These super-easy treats are the Scandinavian version of the coconut macaroon. They are gloriously soft and sticky – and gluten-free, too. You can make endless flavour variations: classic vanilla or filled with berries or spices. Personally, I love to add cardamom or lime zest.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">3 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1 cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/2 cups desiccated/dried shredded coconut</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingrd">50–100 g/2–3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. dark/bittersweet chocolate, chopped, to coat the bases</p>
<p class="ingrd">flavouring of your choice (see method)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 18–20</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat the egg whites and salt until soft peaks form using a hand-held electric whisk or in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. In a separate bowl combine the caster/granulated sugar, desiccated/dried shredded coconut and ground almonds. Fold into the egg whites with the vanilla extract until you have a thick mass, taking care not to knock out the air. Add your choice of flavouring (see flavour options below).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leave the mixture to rest in the refrigerator for 15–20 minutes; this will make it easier to mould.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Divide and shape the chilled mixture into rough ‘tops’ or little mounds of around 25 g/1 oz. each in weight. You could also make log shapes or firmer round shapes, I prefer the more rustic look.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 8–12 minutes, depending on the size of the tops and strength of your oven. Keep a close eye on the tops, as they will brown quickly and can burn. They are done when slightly golden all over. Leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To decorate, melt half the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water. Remove from the heat and add the other half of the chocolate immediately, stirring in well. Wait a minute or two until all the chocolate has melted, then dip the base of each coconut top into the chocolate and leave on their side on a plate or tray for the chocolate to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Flavour options:</b> zest from 1 lime + 3 tablespoons fresh OR frozen raspberries OR lingonberries, lightly crushed OR 1 teaspoon ground cardamom.</p>

<p class="head1">DAIM COOKIES</p>
<p class="intro">A good cookie recipe is essential to a complete baking repertoire. These are wonderfully gooey and filled with pieces of delicious chocolate-coated almond toffee. Daim is one of the most popular chocolate bars in Sweden. It originated in Scandinavia during the fifties and was then bought by Kraft foods and renamed Dime. Now it’s back to being Daim again – and remains a Nordic favourite. You can use another type of chocolate bar if you can’t get hold of Daim.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">150 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon bicarbonate of/baking soda</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup light brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons whole milk</p>
<p class="ingrd">5 Daim bars (each weighing 28 g/1 oz.), roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 20-22 COOKIES (DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH DOUGH YOU EAT!)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Melt the butter and set aside to cool down.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine flour, bicarbonate of/baking soda, vanilla and salt in a bowl and set side.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the sugars with the cooled, melted butter and stir until no lumps remain. Combine the egg, egg yolk and milk and mix with the sugar and butter until thoroughly combined.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the flour, bit by bit, mixing until everything is incorporated. Add the Daim pieces and mix to combine. Wrap the dough in clingfilm/plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F) Gas 5.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Form the dough into rough balls, each weighing about 40 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. and place on the prepared baking sheets around 5 cm/2 inches apart.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 8–10 minutes or until just golden. Remove from the oven immediately and transfer to a cooling rack – the middle should still be slightly soft but they will harden up after a while. The cookies will be at their very best about half an hour after removing from the oven, when they are still slightly warm and beautifully chewy in the middle.</p>

<p class="head1">NOTHING BISCUITS</p>
<p class="intro">This treat is called <i>Ingenting</i> – which means ‘nothing’. Because when people say ‘I can eat nothing more’, you can always fit in one of these very light treats!</p>
<p class="ingrd1">BISCUIT BASES:</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingrd">175 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons double/heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingrd">25 g/1 oz. icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MERINGUE TOPPING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingrd">a tiny pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">275 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups minus 2 tablespoons caster/superfine sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingrd">3 tablespoons finely chopped almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a baking sheet, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 5-cm/1-inch fluted pastry/cookie cutter</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag fitted with a star nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 30–35</p>
<p class="noindent1">Blitz the ingredients for the biscuit bases briefly in a food processor. Once a smooth dough has formed, wrap in clingfilm/plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 160°C (300°F) Gas 2.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 3 mm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch. Use the round fluted pastry/cookie cutter to stamp out circles and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all the dough has been used.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For the meringue topping, beat the egg whites with a tiny pinch of salt until stiff using a hand-held electric whisk or in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Slowly add the sugar and vanilla, bit by bit, and whisk on high speed until you have a shiny mixture that forms stiff peaks (still soft enough to be spoon-able). Fold in the vinegar and chopped almonds.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pipe or spoon the meringue mixture onto each biscuit base, spreading or placing almost to the edge (the meringue will not spread much during baking).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake the biscuits in the middle of the preheated oven for around 18–20 minutes or until the base is cooked and the top is lightly browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before eating.</p>

<p class="head">Jødekager</p>
<p class="head1"><a id="page_25"/>JEWISH BISCUITS</p>
<p class="intro">I remember my grandmother in Denmark making these when I was very little. I loved the smell of the cinnamon as they baked and I remember pacing by the oven impatiently, waiting for the goodies to cool down enough so I could get my grubby little fingers on them. The name <i>Jødekager</i> means, literally, Jewish biscuits. This name stems from the 1800s when Eastern European Jews settled in Copenhagen, and many sold baked goods for a living. This biscuit is particularly popular around Christmas time in Denmark, but I’ve always wondered why it isn’t made all year round – it’s deliciously light and crispy, and super-easy to make.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">175 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> sticks cold butter, cubed</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd1">TOPPING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg white</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">small handful chopped almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2–3 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES APPROX. 40</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the cold cubed butter with the plain/all-purpose flour and baking powder in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or in a food processor. Mix briefly until you have a grainy, sand-like texture. Add the caster/granulated sugar and egg yolk and mix until the ingredients are just evenly incorporated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll the dough into a neat log (about 5 cm/2 inches in diameter) and wrap in clingfilm/plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour, but ideally longer (overnight is good).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a sharp knife, carefully slice your pastry log into thin slices. Place the dough slices on the prepared baking sheets. Try not to handle them too much – they bake more evenly if they stay cold.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brush each piece of dough with a little egg white using a pastry brush. Mix together the cinnamon and caster/granulated sugar and scatter over the biscuits/cookies. Add a small sprinkling of chopped almonds to the middle of each.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 10–12 minutes or until the biscuits/cookies start to brown at the edges. Be aware that these biscuits burn easily, so keep a sharp eye on them. They need to be taken out of the oven before they brown all over.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leave the biscuits/cookies on a wire rack to cool and crisp up before eating.</p>

<p class="head1">NORDIC ORANGE AND GINGER BISCUITS</p>
<p class="intro">At Christmas time all over Scandinavia a mountain of ginger cookies are consumed at festive get-togethers and <i>fika</i> breaks. This version is super-traditional, with the added zing of orange zest.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">550 g/4 cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon bicarbonate of/baking soda</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon ground ginger</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon ground cloves</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of ground all-spice</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/1 stick plus 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature</p>
<p class="ingrd">zest of 1 orange</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/10 tablespoons golden/light corn syrup</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup dark brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup double/heavy cream icing/confectioners’ sugar, to dust</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 or more baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">festive shaped pastry/cookie cutters</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 50–70</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mix the flour and bicarbonate of/baking soda with the dry spices and salt.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the butter and all the other ingredients and mix until you have an even dough. It may still be sticky, but shape into a log and wrap in clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to rest in the refrigerator overnight before using. Try to resist eating the dough every time you pass by the fridge. Yes, we know it is hard not to do!</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the dough thinly on a lightly floured work surface and use cookie cutters to cut your desired shapes. You want the biscuits/cookies to be thin.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place on the prepared baking sheets and bake in the preheated oven for 5–6 minutes or until the biscuits/cookies turn a darker shade of brown. This is a large quantity of dough so you may need to bake the biscuits in batches.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container or serve dusted with icing/confectioners’ sugar.</p>

<p class="head1">‘PEPPER NUTS’ OR DANISH CHRISTMAS BISCUITS</p>
<p class="intro">These biscuits are essential at the lead-up to Christmas in Danish households. Some say they are truly of Danish origin, among the first biscuits baked here in the Middle Ages. Others say the recipe travelled up via Holland and Germany. There are no nuts in the dough – the name simply refers to the shape of a small nut. Back in the day, to ‘pepper something’ meant to spice it up; this is now more symbolic, but I still like a subtle amount of white pepper in mine.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1 cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">425 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon bicarbonate of/baking soda</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup double/heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SPICE MIX:</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground white pepper</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon mixed spice/apple pie spice</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground ginger</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground cloves</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 100–120</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the spices for the spice mix in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and caster/granulated sugar until pale and fluffy using a hand-held electric whisk or balloon whisk. Add the spice mix and sift in the plain/all-purpose flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of/baking soda and salt. Finally, add the double/heavy cream. Mix until you have an even dough. Wrap the dough in clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to chill for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll the dough into little balls of around 5–6 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> oz. each. Arrange on the prepared baking sheets. The dough will spread only slightly when baked, so you should be able to fit many on each sheet. (This dough should be enough to make over a hundred; it sounds a lot but they are small and get eaten quickly!)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 8–10 minutes or until golden. Leave to cool on a wire rack. The pepper nuts will crisp up nicely as they cool down. Store in an airtight container.</p>

<p class="head2"><a id="page_30"/>Seven kinds of biscuits</p>
<p class="intro">Back in 1945, as Europe emerged from war, a book called <i>Sju Sorters Kakor</i> was published in Sweden. The title means ‘seven kinds of biscuits’ – a reference to the amount of varieties of biscuit or cookie that the lady of the house would be expected to offer to her guests. That didn’t include additional buns, cakes or breads, either!</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Sju Sorters Kakor</i> was a cookbook put together with suggestions from households all over Sweden and over 8,000 recipes were initially submitted. It ended up containing around 300 traditional recipes and quickly became a bestseller. It is now in its 84th edition and every household in Sweden owns at least two copies. This average only increases year by year, because nobody would ever dare to throw out any of the older handed-down copies. (I have five passed down from various great aunts – if you want a copy, let me know.)</p>
<p class="noindent1">These days, very few households stay up late to bake seven kinds of cookies just because the neighbours are coming over for <i>fika</i>, but the concept dates back to the late 1800s when, after a period of prohibition, people were once again allowed to drink coffee, and to meet up and do so became something of an occasion. Those households who could offer the finest variety of baked goods along with their coffee were considered superior, and the fashion for elaborate <i>kafferep</i> (coffee parties for ladies) soon spread. Although seven varieties was the minimum to <a id="page_31"/>offer, if anyone went beyond that, it might have been considered pompous. This concept of having just enough (not too much, not too little) is known as <i>lagom</i> and can be applied to almost every aspect of life in Sweden.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="img" src="images/C3-F9.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">Towards the end of the 19th century, in the Sønderborg area of Denmark, the Second Schleswig War of 1864 meant that the region was under German rule. During this time, people were forbidden to meet and consume alcohol in taverns, but they were allowed to meet in community houses. Ladies would bring elaborate cakes and the famous <i>kaffebord</i> (cake tables) became bigger and better. During the Second World War, the tradition for elaborate cakes again became popular, as the only public meetings allowed during occupation were for coffee and cake. Under the guise of eating cake, resistance matters could be discussed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">On a traditional <i>Sønderjysk kaffebord</i> (Southern Jutland coffee table), there are seven types of cookies and seven kinds of soft cake. There are strict rules on how to approach such an offering: first, one would start with a good <i>bundlag</i> (base layer) of wheat buns with lots of butter. From there, one would go from the soft cakes to the harder ones: from cream cakes to the drier varieties and finishing up with biscuits/cookies. Traditionally, guests were expected to take slices of everything and keep them in front of them on several plates. To refuse anything would have been seen as an insult to the baker.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Elaborate and lengthy coffee table meetings in Denmark were not only reserved for discussions of war. Local gatherings were held to discuss important village matters, too. Personally, I can’t think of a better way to settle disagreements (whether large or small) than over copious amounts of coffee and cake – there are few people who cannot be reasoned with after a bucket load of whipped cream.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The <i>Sønderjysk kaffebord</i> is a wonderful part of Danish food heritage. During the 1960s, it all but disappeared, but today it has been revived. You can find Southern Jutland coffee tables at fancy cafés and hotels all over the region as well as at larger celebrations. If you are in the area, it is worth seeking one out. Just remember not to eat breakfast before you go!</p>

<p class="head1">SMALL RASPBERRY TREATS</p>
<p class="intro">This is one of the most iconic bakes for the Swedish fika table. <i>Hallongrottor</i> are included in every grandma’s baking book, and are one of the first treats we learn to bake. Kids just love them – and why wouldn’t they? A crumbly vanilla biscuit/cookie with fruity jam/jelly is always a winner.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or in a food processor, combine the butter and lime zest with the dry ingredients (plain/all-purpose flour, cornflour/cornstarch, vanilla sugar, icing/confectioners’ sugar, baking powder and salt), stopping when you have a smooth, even dough. Try not to overwork the dough.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Form the dough into a sausage shape. Cut the dough either into 15 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. or 25 g /1 oz. pieces and roll into balls. Place the balls into the paper cases in the prepared muffin pan or mini muffin pan.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Press each ball in the middle using your thumb to make a deep hole for the jam/jelly. Use a piping/pastry bag to fill each hole with your chosen jam (1 large teaspoon per hole for the large ones or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon for the small ones). Add slivered/flaked almonds on top.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 15–20 minutes or until slightly golden in colour. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack. Remove the paper cases before arranging on a pretty plate or cake stand and dusting with icing/confectioners’ sugar to serve. Keeps well in an airtight container for 2–3 days.</p>

<p class="head1">DANISH VANILLA COOKIES</p>
<p class="intro">Around the world, people buy Danish butter cookies in pretty tins, but those biscuits taste nothing like the home-made version. While writing this book, I had many discussions with friends about how to recreate a recipe that tasted ‘just like Grandma’s’, and found that it was harder than I first thought. Truth be told, nothing can replace the taste of those biscuits that she made – there was so much love in them, heaven and earth together can’t find a substitution. Still, after much trying, these do taste almost like my <i>Mormor</i> Erna’s did. I hope that one day, my grandkids will bake these and say they taste just like Grandma Brontë’s.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">1 whole vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 g /1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks cold butter, cubed</p>
<p class="ingrd">325 g/scant 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup finely chopped almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd2">3–4 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a strong, fabric piping/pastry bag fitted with a large star nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 40</p>
<p class="noindent1">Grind the whole vanilla pod/bean, including the skin, with 3 tablespoons of the caster/granulated sugar in a spice grinder or food processor. Sift out any big lumps and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer or food processor, combine the cold butter with the plain/all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, baking powder and the vanilla sugar mixture. Mix with the paddle attachment or pulse briefly, until the mixture has a coarse, sandy texture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the ground almonds and remaining caster/granulated sugar and mix again, then add the egg and chopped almonds. Mix until you have an even dough that is soft enough to push through a piping/pastry bag. Note: you will need a strong fabric piping bag for this and a larger nozzle as the dough is really, really hard to push out. It may help to warm the dough with your hands until mouldable. Alternatively, you can also simply roll these, but they will not have the pattern.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pipe (or roll) the dough into 8–10 cm/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> –4 inch long sausages. Carefully connect the two ends of each to form rings and place on the prepared baking sheets. Make sure the dough is no thicker than the width of your little finger, because these will spread during baking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Chill the dough rings on the baking sheets in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This will help the biscuits to keep their piped pattern as they bake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pop the cold tray into the preheated oven and bake the biscuits for 8–10 minutes, or until the edges are just slightly tinged golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool and harden before eating. Store in an airtight container as the biscuits do go soft quickly.</p>

<p class="head1">SWEDISH ‘DREAM’ BISCUITS</p>
<p class="intro">There are many traditional Scandinavian biscuits that use baker’s ammonia (ammonium carbonate) as a leavening agent instead of baking soda or baking powder. Also known as salt of hartshorn, it used to be made from ground male deer’s antlers, but is now chemically constructed. For these Swedish <i>Drömmar</i> it is worth getting hold of – once baked, it creates a chemical reaction which results in a melt-in-the-mouth, super-crispy but fragile finish.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">120 g/1 stick butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1 cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">80 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup neutral-tasting oil (such as a good rapeseed or sunflower oil)</p>
<p class="ingrd">240 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon baker’s ammonia (otherwise known as ammonium carbonate/hartshorn/hjorthornssalt) available at speciality shops, online and in pharmacies.</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 30–35</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cream together the butter and caster/granulated sugar until pale and creamy using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment or a hand-held electric whisk. Next add the vanilla and oil and beat again until combined. Add the plain/all-purpose flour, baker’s ammonia and lemon zest and mix briefly until you have an even dough.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Wrap the dough in clingfilm/plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F) Gas 2.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll the chilled dough into small balls of around 15 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. each, trying not to overwork the dough. Evenly distribute the balls on the prepared baking sheets. There is no need to flatten the dough, as the biscuits/cookies will spread by themselves when baking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 20–25 minutes. The biscuits/cookies will not darken much in colour, so remove from the oven when they have only a slight tinge of gold and slightly cracked tops. Try not to open the oven door during at least the first half of the baking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leave to cool on a wire rack before storing in an airtight container. The baker’s ammonia means the biscuits/cookies will stay crisp, even when baked at a low temperature.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Variations (omit the lemon zest):</p>
<p class="noindent1">For a hazelnut variation: add 50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup finely chopped hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For an almond variation: add one whole almond on top before baking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For a festive variation: add a pinch of ground saffron when you cream together the butter and sugar.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Note:</b> When the biscuits bake, a strong smell of ammonia will be present – but don’t worry, this is normal and the smell goes as soon as the biscuits cool. Just open the window a bit – and don’t eat the dough before baking.</p>
