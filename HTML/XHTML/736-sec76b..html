<h2 class="serve"><span class="small">MAKES 4</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent">In Madrid, storefront windows display the city’s signature sandwiches. When I first tasted one, it reminded me of a Southern po’ boy. Depending on my mood, I’ll stick to Madrid’s crusty baguette-style sandwiches or swap in sweet and soft potato rolls for a taste of New Orleans.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREP A POUND OF SQUID BY CUTTING THE BODIES</span> in ¼-inch rings and the tentacles in half, then soaking in whole milk overnight in the fridge. Mix ¾ cup garbanzo bean (chickpea) flour with ¼ cup all-purpose flour in a large bowl. Drain the squid and toss in the flour mixture until well-coated. Fill a cast-iron skillet with canola oil to ½-inch depth and heat over high heat until very hot. Fry the squid in batches, adding only as much as can fit in a single layer without crowding. Shake any excess flour off first and turn to evenly brown. These cook really quickly, in a minute or two. As soon as they come out of the oil, drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Finish by zesting a bit of lemon zest over the top. Sandwich between toasted split baguette or potato rolls spread with Arbequina Olive Oil Mayonnaise (<a href="sec10.xhtml#page49">here</a>).</p>
