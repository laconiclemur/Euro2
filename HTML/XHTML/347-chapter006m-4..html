<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-191"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Risotto Sotto Bosco</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This unique risotto is meant to look like <em>sotto bosco</em>, or “the forest’s floor.” The ultimate forager’s risotto, this is made with everything you would find on a walk through the woods in autumn, including fresh porcini mushrooms, a mixture of wild herbs, and a handful of berries. Brought together in a single pot, the eccentric combination of ingredients calls to mind the old adage “What grows together, goes together.”</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small shallot, peeled and minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 firm, fresh porcini mushrooms, cleaned and sliced (about 1½ ounces)</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 fresh sage leaves, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 1 small sprig fresh rosemary, minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup high-quality risotto rice</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 to 4 cups boiling water</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</p>
<p class="ingredient">Small handful fresh blueberries and/or blackberries</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Melt 2 tablespoons</strong> of the butter in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, porcinis, and herbs and cook, stirring occasionally, until just softened and beginning to turn golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and cook until it turns opaque and starts to make a faint popping sound, just a minute or two. Add the white wine to the pot and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Add a pinch of salt and 1 cup of the boiling water and cook, stirring continuously, until the water has nearly evaporated. Repeat the process with a second cup of the boiling water, and when that has nearly evaporated, add a third cup. You will know when to add more water when the surface of the rice is coated with small bubbles—it’s not unlike knowing when to flip a pancake. Cook, stirring, until this last addition of water has nearly evaporated.</p>
<p>Test the rice by tasting it—it should be just cooked through, but still have a bit of a bite. If it’s too undercooked, add ¼ cup of water. Depending on the cooking temperature and the type and age of the rice, it may or may not need it. Trust your instincts.</p>
<p>When the rice is just cooked through, about 20 minutes of cooking altogether, turn off the heat and vigorously mix in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter along with the cheese. Fold in the berries, and season the risotto to taste with salt.</p>
<p>Serve immediately, with an extra dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano on each portion.</p></div>

<p class="noindenth1"><em>In order to be a good cook, it helps to be observant, patient, and in charge. To tend to the pots and ovens, don’t be afraid to lean over, to stir whatever’s in there, to spread it out and see what’s happening. Most beginning cooks tend to be intimidated by everything happening on the stove—it helps to remember you are in charge of the food and not the other way around.</em></p>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-192"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Steak Tartare</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This recipe depends entirely on the quality of your meat. Think of it like beef sashimi—only the highest quality will do. Although high quality means high price, this is a great way to stretch an expensive steak since one pound will provide enough tartare for four people. While most steak tartare recipes include a raw egg yolk, I purposely omit it from mine. I find the raw egg muddles the flavor of the raw beef.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 dashes Tabasco sauce</p>
<p class="ingredient">5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons capers, drained and very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 cornichons, very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 shallot, peeled and very finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and puréed using a Microplane grater (or mashed to a paste)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">One 1-pound New York strip steak (2 inches thick), all excess fat trimmed off and discarded</p>
<p class="ingredient">For serving: grilled toast, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil; a handful of extra cornichons; olives; a fistful of wild arugula or a few leaves of butter lettuce; a hard-boiled egg or an <em>oeuf mollet</em>; a couple of anchovies; and some radishes</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In a mixing bowl</strong>, whisk together the Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, and olive oil. Stir in the capers, cornichons, shallot, and garlic. Season the dressing to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.</p>
<p>Fill a large bowl with ice and a bit of water. Place a slightly smaller metal mixing bowl on top of the ice bath, and place the whole setup next to your cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut the meat against the grain into thin, but not too thin, slices (about ¼ inch thick). Place 4 or so slices of steak on top of each other in a little pile and cut the slices into long strands, then cut the strands crosswise into a rough dice. Place the meat into the bowl that’s sitting on the ice water as you cut, continuing until you’ve diced all of the meat.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to serve, pour the dressing over the meat and season with an additional pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Stir gently to combine and serve immediately alongside grilled toast that’s been drizzled with olive oil and with a handful of extra cornichons on the plate too. Olives are nice as well, and if you want to make a real meal out of the tartare, add a fistful of wild arugula to the plate <a id="page-193"/>or a few leaves of beautiful butter lettuce and some radishes. A hard-boiled egg or an <em>oeuf mollet</em> (a soft-boiled egg that’s got a set, but still soft yolk) and a couple of anchovies would be welcome on the plate as well.</p></div>
