<p class="nonindent">Gazpacho comes from Andalucía and my version replicates the region’s traditional smooth and silky soup. In America, gazpacho has come to mean any type of cold summer soup and is often chunky, laden with all types of summer produce. I prefer the classic trio of tomato, cucumber, and pepper, and my seasonings strike just the right balance between sweet and tart, rounded out by a generous dose of olive oil.</p>
<p class="indent">I always make a big, full batch. If it’s just for Félix and me, I keep a pitcher of it in the fridge. When we’re looking for a refreshing snack on a hot summer afternoon that also provides an energy boost, we drink a cup, sometimes still standing in the kitchen. By the end of the week, the pitcher’s empty. If it’s for a dinner party, I make it a day or two ahead of time and give it a quick stir before serving. And if it’s for the beach or a picnic, I get it super cold, then keep it in a cooler with a spout. That way, anyone can get a cold cup any time while under the sun. The soup is light enough to be a first course before any meal, but also substantial enough for a light lunch with the addition of a salad or bread or both.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">YOU NEED TO WORK IN BATCHES TO PUREE THIS</span> soup in standard home blenders: Combine about one-third of the pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, garlic, bread cubes, vinegar, wine, and 1 teaspoon salt with ½ cup water in a powerful blender, preferably a Vitamix if you have one. Puree, gradually raising the speed from low to high. With the machine running, add one-third of the oil in a steady stream, then puree until totally smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large pitcher.</p>
<p class="indent">Repeat two more times with the remaining ingredients, using 1 teaspoon salt and ½ cup water for each batch. Taste the mixture and add more salt to taste and more water for the right consistency. It should be drinkable. Depending on how much water your tomatoes are holding, you may need to add another ½ cup water to the strained soup.</p>
<p class="indent">Cover tightly and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. When it is very cold, it is ready to serve. Stir well and adjust the seasonings again just before serving.</p>
