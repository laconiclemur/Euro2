<p class="nonindent">Individual lamb rib chops can be enjoyed in a fraction of the time it takes to cook a whole rack with this simple weeknight preparation. Thin single rib chops sear quickly and can be divvied up among as few or as many people as you’d like. In addition to giving the meat a deep sear, I also keep the spirit of a lamb rack’s crust by making a crunchy crumb sprinkle. When fried, olives become as crisp as the toasted bread crumbs while retaining their acidic brininess. Lamb is popular in the Ribera del Duero region, which produces the wine that would taste best with the rich meat.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup minced pitted Kalamata olives</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons plus ½ teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons minced garlic</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 (1-inch-thick) single rib lamb chops</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Zest of ½ orange</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">IF THE OLIVES ARE VERY WET, SCATTER THEM</span> between paper towels and press gently to remove excess moisture. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the olives and cook, stirring often, until crisp but not burnt, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the panko and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Push the olives and crumbs to one side of the pan and add ½ teaspoon oil and the garlic to the other side. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 15 seconds, then stir into the crumb mixture. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sprinkle the chops on all sides with 1½ teaspoons salt, then season with pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a very large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add 4 chops and cook, turning once, until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side. Turn each chop on its top side to sear the fat for 1 minute. Transfer to serving plates. Repeat with the remaining chops.</p>
<p class="indent">Let the chops rest for a few minutes while you stir the rosemary and orange zest into the crumb mixture. Sprinkle the crumble mixture on top and serve immediately.</p>
