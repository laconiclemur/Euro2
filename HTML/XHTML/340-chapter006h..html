<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-175"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Salsify Sweet and Sour</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Salsify is sometimes referred to as the oyster plant since, once cooked, its flavor has been likened to oysters. In its raw state, salsify looks like long, brown, dirty carrots. Once peeled, its natural sap emerges, a sign of the sweet final product. You could substitute any firm root vegetable in this dish, including carrots or parsnips, and also feel free to use white wine instead of red. Serve with Roast Chicken (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-202">here</a>), or grilled quail or rabbit.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 salsify roots, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 3-inch-long pieces</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ bottle full, rich red wine (a cabernet works nicely)</p>
<p class="ingredient"><span class="font1">⅓</span> cup honey</p>
<p class="ingredient">Two 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 large garlic cloves, crushed with the back of your knife or even with your fist (don’t even bother peeling them)</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup crumbled blue cheese, such as Roquefort, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Combine all of</strong> the ingredients except for the cheese in a saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer until the salsify is tender when pierced with a paring knife, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer the salsify to a serving dish.</p>
<p>Bring the cooking liquid in the pot to a boil. Cook until a thick syrup forms, about 5 minutes. Discard the rosemary or thyme and the garlic and pour the reduction over the salsify.</p>
<p>Serve immediately with the blue cheese scattered on top, if you’d like.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-176"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Lentils with Kale and Shallots</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This hearty lentil dish is all about patience and slow cooking. You want the kale to really cook to the point where it just about loses its physical integrity and all of its freshness is dissolved into the lentils. The effect becomes rich and comforting. And while this is completely vegetarian, I am not. Really, I am just opportunistic and I believe in the freedom of what works well. Which is to say, this would be great with bacon!</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4 TO 6]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 shallots, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">5 garlic cloves, peeled and trimmed</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 dried red chilies or 1 teaspoon red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bunch kale (preferably lacinato kale, also known as dinosaur kale), finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup dark lentils (see Recipe Note)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 cups water</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingredient">Crème fraîche, for serving</p>
<p class="ingredient">Some really high-quality, extra-virgin olive oil, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Heat the ¼ cup</strong> olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, garlic, chili, and kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the lentils, a healthy pinch of salt, and the water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer gently until the lentils and kale are not <em>just</em> cooked through, but really soft and lovely, a good hour, maybe even two; it will depend on the age and type of lentil you choose. Splash the mixture with additional water as it cooks if it’s threatening to dry out; you want the final product to be moist, but not at all brothy. Just before serving, stir in the nutmeg and season the mixture with salt.</p>
<p>Serve hot or at room temperature with generous spoonfuls of cold crème fraîche and a healthy drizzle of the raw, high-quality, extra-virgin olive oil.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">I prefer very dark green, tiny lentils for this dish, often labeled “du Puy” or “Castelluccio.” They retain their shape when you cook them and have a wonderfully nutty, earthy flavor. Be sure to pour them out onto a plate before you cook them to look for little stones. While they’re rare, you don’t want any of your guests or friends breaking a tooth.</span></p>
