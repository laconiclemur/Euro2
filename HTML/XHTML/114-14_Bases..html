<p class="C3625"><strong><span id="page_266">BASES</span></strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Many Spanish home cooks still prepare a three-course meal every day. Families take advantage of a three-hour mid-afternoon break to head home for the day’s principal meal. For many, this is still the cornerstone of their family life with generations of families seeing each other every day to break bread.</p>
<p class="C3609">The task of preparing a sit-down three-course meal for several people every day may sound daunting, but Spanish home cooks have some tricks up their sleeves. Most of them prepare stocks and bases about once or twice a week and can use these in a number of different dishes.</p>
<p class="C3609">At Boqueria, we do the same.</p>
<p class="C3609">Our arsenal of bases includes stocks, sauces, and dressings. The ones that follow are either used more than once in this book (hello, stocks) or can be thrown onto just about anything for a little Spanish flair (we’re looking at you, salsa verde).</p>
<p class="C3609">To make the most of your bases, portion them into single-use servings and seal them in airtight containers. Label them with the name and date and refrigerate or freeze them until needed. If you have bases in the freezer, thaw them overnight in the refrigerator before cooking.</p>

<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_268">CHICKEN</span> STOCK</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">Chicken bones, especially the feet, develop gelatin in stock when the cartilage melts into the simmering liquid. The resulting stock is richer than store-bought broth and is easy to make at home. Refrigerate or freeze the stock in smaller portions so you always have some on hand.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> 10 cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 4½ hours</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>3 chicken carcasses or 2¾ pounds chicken backs, bones, wings, and necks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ cup blended canola-olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ large onion, cut in chunks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 leek, cut in 3-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 celery stalk, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large carrot, cut in large chunks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ head garlic, cut through the “equator”</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon tomato paste</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tomatoes, cut in eighths</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>10 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>10 ounces chicken feet</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 500ºF with a rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.</p>
<p class="C3636">Place the chicken carcasses on the smoking hot baking sheet. Roast until the undersides are well browned, about 25 minutes. Flip the carcasses and roast for 5 minutes more.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, leek, celery, carrot, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until well-seared, about 10 minutes. You want the vegetables to brown well, but stay as raw as possible.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the tomato paste, tomatoes, and peppercorns. Cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes break down, about 5 minutes. Add the roasted chicken carcasses, chicken feet, and wine. Cook until the wine has reduced so that almost no liquid remains, about 5 minutes, then add enough cold water to cover all of the solids, about 3 quarts.</p>
<p class="C3636">Bring to a boil over high heat, pushing in the solids to keep them submerged. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 hours, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface and replenishing the water if it goes below the solids.</p>
<p class="C3636">Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. The stock can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_269">LOBSTER</span> STOCK</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">Lobster stock enriches seafood dishes with an incomparable depth. To make it, you need to follow a few simple steps. First, start with a huge pot. Next, take your time caramelizing the lobster heads to draw out their deep-sea flavor. Finally, simmer low and slow to fully infuse the stock with all the aromatics.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about 10 cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 2 hours</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>9 raw lobster heads (2 pounds)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup cooking brandy</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large leek, white and pale green parts only, cut into ½-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 carrot, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ onion, cut into ½-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 head garlic, cut in half through its “equator”</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 celery stalk, cut into ½-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons sweet pimentón (smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 tomatoes, cored and cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Pull the top shells of the lobster heads off the bottoms. Cut the top shells in quarters and cut the bottoms in half lengthwise, then crosswise into thirds.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat 5 tablespoons oil in a large stockpot over high heat until smoking hot. Add the lobster pieces, in a single layer if possible. Cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until well caramelized, about 15 minutes. The shells should be bright red and the meat dark brown.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the brandy. If you’re comfortable flambéing, light the alcohol very carefully with a long match. Otherwise, let the brandy boil until it has almost completely evaporated. Transfer the lobster pieces and all the pan juices to a large bowl.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil to the same stockpot and heat over medium-high heat. Add the leek, carrot, onion, garlic, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until well caramelized and browned, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the pimentón and stir well, then immediately add the tomatoes to prevent the pimentón from burning. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down, about 3 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil, then simmer until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add 4 quarts cold water and return the lobster and all its juices to the pot.</p>
<p class="C3636">Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour to steep.</p>
<p class="C3636">Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on all the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. The stock can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 6 months.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>You can ask for lobster heads at your local market’s seafood counter. If you can’t find them, use 2 pounds of large shell-on shrimp with heads instead.</em></p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_270">VINAGRETA</span> DE JEREZ</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">The complex acidity of sherry vinegar—a little oaky, a little sweet—comes through in this super versatile dressing. Earthy maple syrup and the floral notes of lemon juice bind the edgy acid with fruity Spanish olive oil. Keep a jar on hand in the fridge to drizzle over any salad.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about 1¼ cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>2 tablespoons maple syrup</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>juice of 3 lemons, about 1 cup</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Whisk the syrup, lemon juice, vinegar, and oil in a bowl until smooth. Season to taste with salt and whisk well.</p>
<p class="C3636">The vinaigrette can be refrigerated for up to 7 days.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="id_6">PICKLING</span> LIQUID</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">You can pour this over anything to make pickles. Keep sliced soft vegetables like shallots and cucumbers raw and blanch hard, dense vegetables, such as cauliflower or carrots before immersing in the liquid. Seal in a jar and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 1 month.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about 4 cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 cup sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 whole star anise</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ teaspoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ teaspoon white peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 whole cloves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 teaspoons yellow mustard seeds</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 guindilla peppers or chiles de árbol</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 small sprig of rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 sprig of thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Combine all of the ingredients in a medium saucepan with 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then remove from the heat. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 month.</p>
<p class="C3607"><span id="page_271">Sherry</span> Vinegar</p>
<p class="C3601">Studies have found at least 80 unique aroma compounds in sherry vinegar. This vinegar’s bright, yet rounded, signature smoky, woodsy notes result from fermenting, aging, and blending the vinegar in oak barrels.</p>
<p class="C3677">You can find sherry vinegar in supermarkets. Look for labels with the Denominación de Origen Protegida (or DOP) seal. It means that the vinegar began as Andalusian sherry good enough to drink before spending at least six months aging. DOP Vinagre de Jerez Reserva is aged at least two years and Gran Reserva at least ten. Standard sherry vinegars tend to come from palomino grapes, while sweeter ones start with Pedro Ximénez or moscatel. We always keep a few different varieties on hand.</p>

<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_272">VINAGRETA</span> DE CÍTRICOS</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">This is our go-to vinaigrette with its tart duo of lemon and vinegar, softened with a little honey. It tastes great on any salad, especially ones with fruit.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about ⅔ cup</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ garlic clove</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon honey</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Combine all of the ingredients with a pinch of salt in a blender and purée until very smooth. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3636">The vinaigrette will keep, refrigerated, for up to 5 days.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="id_9">SPICED</span> BUTTER</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">This outstanding spiced butter is great served with grilled steaks (see <a class="RED" href="11_Meat___Poultry.xhtml#page_211">here</a>), and many other meat dishes.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> 1½ cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 tablespoon kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon sweet paprika</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon hot pimentón (smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ pound (1 stick) unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the salt, pepper, paprika, and pimentón in a medium bowl. Put the butter in a deep microwave-safe container and microwave in 30-second increments, until the dairy solids sink to the bottom and the clarified butter rises to the top, about 1½ minutes total. Pour the clarified butter over the spices, leaving the dairy solids behind. Stir the spiced butter well.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="id_7">SOFRITO</span></strong></p>
<p class="C3675">This saucy blend of onion, tomatoes, and garlic is the foundation of most Catalonian dishes. The very best cooks know that the longer the blend simmers, the richer it tastes. Some even leave it on the stove for a full day. We make a big batch and refrigerate or freeze the mixture in smaller ready-to-use portions, so that we can add this deep flavor to a dish in an instant.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about 1 cup</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 3½ hours</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 pound ripe tomatoes, cut in 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 (8-ounce) white Spanish onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup blended canola-olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Put the tomatoes, onion, and garlic, in that order, into a blender or food processor. Pulse until well mixed, then purée until almost smooth but with a few small chunks remaining. Transfer to a large saucepan with the oil and stir well.</p>
<p class="C3636">Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and sweet, about 3 hours.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_273">ALLIOLI</span></strong></p>
<p class="C3675">In Catalan, allioli translates to “garlic and oil” and those are the only two ingredients in the original. It’s one of the region’s absolute oldest and essential sauces. Traditionally, it’s made by smashing garlic in a mortar while drizzling in oil. The two emulsify to create a sauce as creamy as mayonnaise. Nailing that skill is hard, to say the least. The old-school technique may be a dying art, but the sauce itself lives on, often with a mayonnaise formula. We use a whole egg in ours to make the emulsification process easy and foolproof. It also results in an airier spread that’s still luscious and garlicky.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> 1½ cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 large garlic clove, peeled and trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large egg</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¾ teaspoon white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup blended canola-olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Process the garlic, egg, vinegar, and mustard in a blender or food processor until smooth, scraping the bowl occasionally. With the machine running, add the oil in a very slow, steady stream. Process until emulsified, scraping the bowl occasionally. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="id_5">SPICED</span> ALLIOLI DRESSING</strong></p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> 1 scant cup</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large egg, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ teaspoon sriracha</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 teaspoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¾ cup blended canola-olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Use a zester to finely grate the garlic into a bowl. Add the egg and whisk until the egg is broken and blended. Add the mustard, sriracha sauce, and vinegar, and whisk until smooth. Continue whisking while adding the oil in a very slow, steady stream. Whisk until emulsified into a creamy dressing. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_274">PICADA</span></strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Mortar-and-pestle sauces are the backbone of Catalan cuisine. This pounded herb-bread paste seasons stews, paellas, and fideuas with a hit of freshness while thickening cooking liquids. Like so many Spanish staples, picada was created during tough times as an inexpensive flavor base that could enrich a wide variety of humble dishes. It still excels in doing the same now.</p>
<p class="C3637">We make our picada a little luxurious with the addition of aromatic saffron. To streamline the step of toasting the saffron, we sprinkle it over the hot fried bread. The saffron heats up over the bread and releases its intoxicating aroma beautifully that way.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about ⅓ cup</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 20 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 20 minutes, plus overnight infusing</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 dried ñora pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 garlic cloves, peeled and trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>blended canola-olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 (¾-inch-thick) slices baguette</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>a good pinch of saffron threads</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Cover the ñora pepper with very hot (almost boiling) water in a bowl. Let stand at room temperature overnight.</p>
<p class="C3636">Drain the pepper and discard the stem and seeds. Use a spoon to scrape out the flesh. Reserve the flesh and discard the skin.</p>
<p class="C3636">Put the garlic and a large pinch of salt in a mortar or food processor. Pound with a pestle or pulse the machine until the garlic becomes a paste. Add the parsley and pepper flesh and pound or pulse until the leaves are very finely ground.</p>
<p class="C3636">Fill a small skillet with the canola-olive oil to a depth of ½ inch. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil is hot and shimmering. Add the baguette slices and cook, turning once, until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to the mortar or processor and immediately sprinkle the saffron on top. Pound or pulse until the mixture is smooth. Add the olive oil and stir with the pestle or pulse in the machine until fully incorporated.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="id_8">SALSA</span> DE AJO Y PEREJIL</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">This versatile sauce can be used to finish any grilled or sautéed vegetables, fish, or meat. In Spain, tapas bar chefs drizzle a little over everything. Home cooks sometimes just stir together chopped parsley and garlic or mix the duo with a little oil. We like the body the bread gives to the sauce, but you can leave it out if you want.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> ⅔ cup</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled and halved</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 slices <a class="RED" href="05_The_Classics.xhtml#page_32">Olive Oil Toast</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Pound the garlic and salt in a mortar with a pestle until the mixture is pasty and smooth. Add the parsley and pound and stir until the herbs are very finely torn. Add the toast and smash until a smooth paste forms.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the oil and stir until well mixed. Season to taste with salt. The salsa can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>To save time, or if your mortar is not large enough, you can pulse everything together in a food processor or blender until well mixed. Just avoid overmixing because the heat of the machine can burn the greens and oil.</em></p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="page_275">SALSA</span> VERDE</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">This four-herb blend includes sharp-sweet shallot and dried guindilla chili. Using both sherry vinegar and lemon juice gives a freshness and complex acidity ideal for balancing the richness of meaty dishes like <a class="RED" href="05_The_Classics.xhtml#page_50">Pintxos Morunos</a>. It’s also delicious spooned over any grilled meat, fish, shellfish, or roasted vegetables.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about ½ cup</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 15 hours</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>1 packed cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons minced chives</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ shallot, very finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 guindilla pepper, very finely chopped or</strong> ⅛<strong/> <strong>teaspoon crushed red chili</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638">⅜<strong/> <strong>cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 teaspoon sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 teaspoon lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Stir together the parsley, chives, shallot, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and oil in a medium bowl. Season to taste with salt. At this point, the sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="C3636">When ready to serve, stir in the vinegar and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3685"><strong><span id="id_136">SALSA</span> BRAVA</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">This is the sauce that makes the bravas! Tangy, thick, and smooth, this intense tomato sauce can pack a little heat or a lot, depending on how many chili peppers you throw in. It’s really a matter of taste. We use dried guindilla chilies from Spain to give our sauce a little kick. If you want a fiery salsa, toss in more peppers.</p>
<p class="C3637">Once the sauce is done, it can be served alongside allioli or mixed with it for the perfect <a class="RED" href="05_The_Classics.xhtml#page_57">Patatas Bravas</a>. If you’re serving the sauces separately, you can put the brava sauce in the bottom of the dish under the potatoes, dollop onto the spuds, or serve it in a bowl on the side for dipping.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> about 4 cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 1¼ hours</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>⅓</strong> <strong>cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>7 garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>5 guindilla or pepperoncini peppers</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ large (minimum diameter 3 inches) white onion, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 x 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes in sauce</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ teaspoon sugar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the oil, garlic, and guindillas in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add the onion and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is very soft and caramelized, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Stir in the tomatoes, sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the tomatoes lose their water, about 35 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Pass the mixture through a food mill or purée in a blender until smooth. The sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature or heat before serving.</p>

<p class="C3608">Make a big batch of this Catalan sauce and you’ll find yourself spooning it on everything. It’s a thick, coarse olive oil blend of caramelized tomatoes, peppers, and garlic with fried bread and hazelnuts. All that richness is balanced with sherry vinegar and fresh parsley. We dip raw vegetables and crackers into it, smear it on toast and sandwiches, slather it all over grilled vegetables and fish, use it to thicken stews, and make salad dressings with it.</p>
<p class="C3637">This recipe calls for roasting the vegetables in the oven, but in the summer, we grill them for an added smokiness. We encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Makes</strong> 3 cups</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Prep</strong> 45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Total</strong> 3 hours, plus overnight soaking</p>
<p class="C3638a"><strong>2 dried ñora peppers</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>6 vine ripe tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 head of garlic plus 1 garlic clove, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for frying</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>6 (½-inch-thick) slices baguette (about 4 ounces)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>⅔</strong> <strong>cup hazelnuts, preferably skinned</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Place the ñora peppers in a bowl and pour very hot (almost boiling) water over them. Let stand at room temperature overnight.</p>
<p class="C3636">Drain the peppers and discard the stem and seeds. Use a spoon to scrape out the flesh. Reserve the flesh and discard the skin.</p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 450ºF. Line a rimmed baking tray with foil and place the tomatoes on it. Roast for 20 minutes, then place the whole head of garlic on the pan alongside the tomatoes. Continue roasting until the tomatoes are blackened and blistered and the skins on the garlic are browned, about 2 hours longer. The tomatoes should be very dry.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile, fill a large skillet with enough oil to come ¼ inch up the sides. Heat over medium-high heat until very hot. If you touch a slice of bread to the oil, it should bubble immediately. If it doesn’t, let it heat more. Add the bread in a single layer. Cook until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a bowl.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the hazelnuts to the oil and cook, shaking the pan often, until evenly golden brown, about 1 minute. If they are already skinned, combine them with the bread. If they have skins, first transfer them to a clean kitchen towel. Wrap the nuts in the towel and rub vigorously to remove the skins. When cool enough to handle, combine them with the bread.</p>
<p class="C3636">Remove the top ¼ inch of the head of garlic. Using your hands, squeeze the soft roasted cloves into the bread and nut mixture. Using a blender, blend the ñora pepper flesh, tomatoes, roasted garlic, raw garlic clove, fried bread, fried nuts, parsley, vinegar, and 1 cup oil until the mixture is smooth. It will be very thick and there may be some tiny bits remaining. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3636">The romesco can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 6 weeks.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>Ñora peppers are available online, but you can substitute dried California (Anaheim), New Mexico, or pasilla chilies.</em></p>
<p class="C3607"><span id="page_277">Ñoras</span></p>
<p class="C3601">Dried ñora (or nyora) peppers are deep red, small, and circular. They’re earthy and sweet, with the aroma of paprika. They should be stemmed and seeded before use and rehydrated by soaking in hot water. Once softened, the juicy flesh is scraped from the skin. You can buy ñora peppers online or from a Spanish market. If you can’t find them, substitute another dried mild, sweet chili pepper, such as ancho or cascabel, a close cousin to ñora, which has the same round shape.</p>
