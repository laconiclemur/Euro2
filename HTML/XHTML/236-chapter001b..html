<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Brouillade</em> is how the French describe perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. At Buvette, we make them using the milk steamer on our espresso machine. It is not only quick and efficient but it also adds to the charm of having your breakfast made in front of you, literally at arm’s length, gastrothèque style. At home, you can successfully achieve the same incredibly creamy, nearly custardlike texture using a small, heavy saucepan on the stovetop.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 1; EASILY MULTIPLIED]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">3 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons good-quality unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Crack the eggs</strong> into a bowl and vigorously whisk together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, set a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat and add half of the butter. Once the butter has melted, add the whisked eggs. Using a wooden spoon, stir the eggs constantly while they cook, being sure to get all of the bits off of the sides of the pot (not unlike you do when you’re making a risotto). Do not turn the heat up—you want the eggs to cook gently and lovingly and not take on any color.</p>
<p>You are looking for a mixture that’s cooked through, but still loose enough to pour. To get to that perfect moment, pull the pot off the heat when the eggs begin to form small curds. Another good indicator of this moment is when the bottom of the pot will hold the lines your wooden spoon makes as you draw it through the eggs. At that precise moment when the eggs are <em>just</em> cooked, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter (the pot will hold more than enough residual heat to melt the butter into the eggs).</p>
<p>Serve immediately with a sprinkle of salt and a few grinds of pepper. While these are heaven on their buttery own, welcome embellishments include a spoonful of crème fraîche or caviar, or both, and a sprinkle of fried shallots with a few shavings of bottarga (dried tuna roe). Slices of prosciutto or smoked salmon draped over the eggs are very nice too. Be sure to add some large caperberries and crème fraîche to the plate if you go down the smoked salmon route. With any of these variations, an accompanying stack of toast goes without saying, buttered or drenched in olive oil of course.</p></div>

<p class="noindent1"><strong>1.</strong> <span class="special">To get the creamiest, richest scrambled eggs, it’s vital that the eggs are mixed well. Like a proper cocktail, there should be a little froth on top.</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>2.</strong> <span class="special">I mix the eggs with what some people call a spring whisk. The coiled spring agitates the eggs more than a traditional whisk, ensuring that they are incredibly well incorporated.</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>3.</strong> <span class="special">It’s important to use a small, heavy saucepan to make these since the large surface area of a skillet supplies too much direct heat to the eggs. You never want your brouillade to brown or cook too quickly—the small size of a saucepan helps you control the heat and keep them blissfully creamy.</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>4.</strong> <span class="special">Please substitute olive oil for butter as you wish.</span></p>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">On Fresh Orange Juice</span></h1>
<p class="noindent"><em>It is important to understand that “fresh” is nothing other than immediate. And if there’s an option to do something by hand, that’s how we do it. Not only does this inform the type of food we prepare and the feeling it evokes, it also cuts down on how much noise we make! This is especially true when it comes to the fresh orange juice that we squeeze—to order, manually, in an old press. And while there’s nothing wrong with using standard juice oranges, if you can find a variety of citrus fruits it’s nice to make combinations, like blood orange and tangerine, or grapefruit and Meyer lemon. If your juice is very tart, you can serve it alongside a shaker of sugar, like they do in Italy. Of course any and all citrus juice is also great with a bit of Champagne!</em></p>
