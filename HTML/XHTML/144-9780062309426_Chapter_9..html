<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>riting in <i>Le Nouveau Cuisinier Gascon</i>, André Daguin had this to say on the subject of soup: “Soup is primordial cooking, born of ancient times. True soup is food for those of strong heart and good stomach, those with a clear conscience.”</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>La Cuisine du Pays</i>, Simin Palay makes an equally sonorous if less koan-like pronouncement: “In our land,” he intones, “there is no such thing as a good meal without a hearty soup.”</p>
<p class="indent">Paula Wolfert, Northern Californian that she is, strikes a lighter tone: “If France is a country of soup-eaters,” she writes, “the South-West is the land of soup-<i>lovers</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, the kinds of soup to be found in the greater Southwest are legion. Palay’s book contains recipes for no fewer than three dozen: bean soups, <i>bouillons</i>, Basque saldas, cheese soup, pot-au-feu, plus many potages even most French people have never heard of—<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88" title="88"/><i>panturoun</i> (made with lamb), <i>jerbilhoû</i> (thickened with corn flour), <i>cousinette</i> (flavored with sorrel), and more.</p>
<p class="indent">In the very heart of Gascony, though, when one is offered soup, it is, almost without fail, a garbure. That beloved dish of simmered cabbage, beans, and salt pork (and usually many other things) is the soup that trumps all others. It is sustenance and comfort in equal measure. It is the ne plus ultra of Gascon peasant dishes. Often, it arrives at the table unbidden, as essential and commonplace as a basket of bread.</p>
<p class="indent">None of this is to say that garbure—a specialty generally thought to have originated in the Béarn but now firmly entrenched all over Gascony—does not have its myriad regional and even microregional variations.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, so disparate were the recipes that I’d rounded up in preparation for cooking my first garbure that when I sat down to make my shopping list, I soon fell into a state of confused paralysis.</p>
<p class="indent">At one end of the spectrum lay Paula Wolfert’s multipage epic, which called for two pounds of pork shoulder, one pound of unsmoked pork belly, one pound of garlic sausage, a ham hock, smoked bacon, six confit duck legs, one pound of white beans, five kinds of vegetables, and an aerobic-sounding workout of mincing, sweating, puréeing, straining, simmering, and skimming, as well as the dunking of whole confit duck legs into the broth, the transferring of the meats to warming plates, the rubbing of pieces of stale bread with garlic, and the placing of those pieces of bread in the bottom of the soup tureen before serving the soup and meats separately with various pickled and spicy condiments.</p>
<p class="int_blsp">At the opposite extreme was a recipe that Nadine (who would have been disappointed by my continuing reliance on cookbooks) had given me:</p>
<p class="ext"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89" title="89"/>Put six liters of water, a dozen cut-up potatoes, and a ham hock in a pot. Bring to a boil. Add two sliced turnips and a bunch of blanched and sliced kale, plus whatever bits of duck confit you have handy (wings, necks, etc.). Add eight cloves of minced garlic and simmer for an hour and a half. Season to taste.</p>
<p class="int_tpsp">Unlike Wolfert’s mighty garbure, which was supposed to be so thick that a “wooden spoon stands up straight” in it, Nadine’s was clearly a soup of the more watery kind. They were two entirely different dishes.</p>
<p class="indent">I was also in possession of a brown envelope that Henri had dropped off. It contained a dozen recipes that a friend of his, a local historian, had collected several years back from—according to a handwritten note—“elderly housewives of the Val d’Adour.” Each recipe had a woman’s name attached to it: <i>la Daube d’Odette</i>, <i>la Poule au Pot</i> <i>d’Adrienne</i>, <i>la Brandade de Marie-Amélie</i>. The one for garbure, from a lady named Suzanne, was slightly more involved than Nadine’s, but still a masterpiece of brevity. The main difference was the suggestion, echoed by Wolfert, to lay pieces of stale bread in the bottom of the tureen.</p>
<p class="indent">As for Simin Palay’s book, the Béarnais poet proposed three garbure recipes. One suggested adding grilled chestnuts. Another called for spooning a layer of goose fat over the thick soup, flambéing the fat, and then covering the pot lid with hot coals to create a kind of gratin.</p>
<p class="indent">This wasn’t really clearing up my confusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Palay did, however, make one enlightening point. He said there was a long-accepted distinction between what he dubbed “classic” garbures, extravagantly meaty affairs typically eaten in the evening as a full meal—dishes like the one in Wolfert’s book—and simpler “everyday” garbures like Nadine’s, more often served as a starter or a light lunch.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90" title="90"/>In the end, ignoring the great chef Escoffier’s advice to “<i>faites simple</i>,” I decided on the former.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>I WAS NOT THE TYPE</small> of cook who makes a joyous mess in the kitchen. Before diving into a new recipe, I liked to have my chopping and mincing done ahead of time, my <i>mise en place</i> bowls at the ready, my counter freed of clutter, my utensils close at hand. I washed my dirty cookware as I went along. I set timers. I took a certain Midwestern pride in efficiency and order. In domestic matters in general I was a speedy multitasker. On a typical weeknight, in the time it took Michele to give Charlotte a bath and brush her hair, I could prepare a simple supper, take out the recycling, sort the mail, and empty the dishwasher. Then, after I’d rinsed the last pot and wiped down the countertops, I would pour myself a drink and power down. In fact, if I stopped to think about it, I really had only two operational gears, high and neutral, and two modes of waking activity: work and reward. This was perhaps not the healthiest way to live, but there you go.</p>
<p class="indent">Making a “classic” garbure required a certain retooling of my modus operandi.</p>
<p class="indent">The procuring of the ingredients stretched over several days. The undertaking began with a visit to Plaisance’s weekly market, for the various root vegetables and herbs. For the duck confit, I drove to Ferme Tomasella. Obtaining the pickled condiments and the dried white Tarbes beans, which had to be soaked overnight, necessitated a trip to a supermarket in another town.</p>
<p class="indent">On the morning of garbure day, after deciding that only the finest-quality pork products would do, I made the forty-five-minute drive to Éauze, a village that boasted what Henri had described to me as the best butcher shop in the Gers. Boucherie Cugini faced <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91" title="91"/>a busy ring road encircling the medieval <i>centre ville</i>. I entered the crowded shop, took a number, and waited my turn behind a scrum of middle-aged women engaged in lengthy negotiations with the apron-clad countermen. I ordered the items I needed, with the exception of the garlic sausages, which they were out of. I figured I could get by.</p>
<p class="indent">Henri had warned me that Cugini was <i>très cher</i>, but I hadn’t lent much credence to his remark, since a warning about high prices was a standard local refrain, Gascons being a frugal bunch. In any event, Henri had been right. Now, driving home in possession of a small fortune in meat, I felt added pressure not to mess things up.</p>
<p class="indent">Never had the kitchen of the old mill felt smaller than it did that day. With the ingredients for my garbure spread out over every square inch of free counter space, I set to work. I pulled out our pear-shaped (and barely bigger than pear-size) cutting board and began trimming the turnips and cutting up the potatoes. I drained the white beans. I blanched the cabbage. I tied the bouquet garni. I sliced the leeks and sweated them in duck fat. I removed the skin from the confit duck legs and chopped it up to make cracklings. I pierced an onion with cloves and finely sliced another. Charlotte came into the kitchen to ask me something. I brusquely shooed her away. I plugged in our Moulinex food processor and puréed the parsley, garlic, and bacon for the <i>hachis</i> that would augment the stock, making a greasy mess of the superannuated appliance. Finally, I started simmering the beans, the ham hock, the pork belly, and the pork shoulder, realizing as I did so that I should have started that step before everything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Feeling spent—though I was far from finished—I rinsed my hands and looked at the counter. It was littered with onion skins, turnip tops, flecks of parsley and thyme, globules of duck fat, and lengths of wet butcher’s twine. I picked up a dishcloth, then put it <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92" title="92"/>back down. <i>No.</i> Instead of cleaning up, I sloshed a little wine into a glass and stared out the kitchen window for a while, observing the comings and goings on the bridge.</p>
<p class="indent">The water in the pot had grown cloudy, and the air in the kitchen was thick with the scent of boiling pork. Foam rose to the water’s surface. I skimmed it off. I added some of the hachis. More foam rose up. I skimmed it off. I added the bouquet garni. More foam. More skimming. This went on for some time. Now the kitchen was starting to smell good; the herbs and aromatics were doing their thing. I felt relaxed, and not particularly needful of distraction beyond the foam-skimming, bridge-gazing, and wine-sipping.</p>
<p class="indent">After a while it occurred to me to check the time. It was close to six. Henri and Monique, whom we’d invited for dinner, would be arriving in a couple of hours. I’d planned to devote part of the afternoon to washing the car and doing some spider-web removal in the living room, among other things, but the day was all but gone. There were no shortcuts with a classic garbure. Once you were in it, you were in it. I made peace with this circumstance, reconciling myself to the fact that today was no longer about doing lots of things, or even several things. It was about doing one thing: making garbure.</p>
<p class="indent">Before cleaning up, I performed one of the final steps: adding the duck legs. After that, I gave the pot a stir and let go of the wooden spoon. It stayed upright. Charlotte walked halfway down the stairs and peeked at me through the railing. I waved for her to come down. I handed her a jar of dried espelette pepper, lifted her up, and told her to give a few good shakes over the soup pot. Then I told her to add a few pinches of salt. At last, I stirred in a spoonful of duck fat, as one of Simin Palay’s recipes had advised, “for a touch of finesse.”</p>
<p class="indent">I took a taste.</p>
<p class="indent">“Is it good?” Charlotte asked.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93" title="93"/>The garbure had an oniony bite that an overnight rest in the fridge probably would have cured, but it was full of profound, meaty flavors.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’d say it’s just about right.”</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>WHILE HENRI AND MONIQUE WERE</small> having apéro on the balcony with Michele and Charlotte, I followed Wolfert’s suggestion to remove the meats to a warmed platter so that they could be sliced and eaten with cornichons and pickled peppers. But the great hunks of pork and confit fell apart at the first touch of the knife. So at the last minute, I separated out the duck bones and slid the meats back into the pot. My garbure looked more like a deconstructed cassoulet than a soup.</p>
<p class="indent">This fact did not stop our guests from oohing and aahing when I brought the tureen to the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Henri took a bite. “Now <i>this</i> is a garbure,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">Monique had a taste, and let her spoon hover respectfully over the bowl. “<i>Formidable</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Not too heavy?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“Not at all,” Henri replied.</p>
<p class="indent">“You’re spoiling us,” said Monique.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele leaned toward me and said sotto voce, “My God, it’s like eating with your parents.”</p>
<p class="indent">Henri, who had taken a keen interest in our daughter’s acquisition of French, asked Charlotte what she was planning to do over the weekend. Charlotte offered a short but, to my great pleasure, grammatically correct reply, and I noticed for the first time that she pronounced <i>samedi—</i>Saturday—“sa-muh-dee,” in the local way. Some Gascon-ness had rubbed off on one of us, at least.</p>
<p class="indent">We had leftover garbure for dinner the next night, and the night after that. Each time, I stretched out the soup with a little water <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94" title="94"/>and added some salt and pepper. And each time, it tasted better than the time before: mellower, softer, with deeper bass notes and more harmonious flavors. Thus concluded my first object lesson in the making of Gascon soups, stews, and braises: If made right, they improve with age.</p>
