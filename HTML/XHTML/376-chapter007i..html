<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">In Rome, <em>granita</em> and <em>grattachecca</em> (shaved ice with syrups) are a summer tradition served from colorful kiosks, with perpetual lines, along the Tevere. This espresso granita must be completely frozen before serving, so plan ahead and note that it can be kept, covered, in the freezer for up to a month.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 cups very strong cold-brewed coffee or espresso</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup light brown sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup heavy cream</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Pour the coffee</strong> or espresso into a small saucepan and stir in the sugar. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the sugar has completely dissolved, 2 or 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Let the coffee cool to room temperature then pour it into a shallow metal pan and freeze until solid, about 3 hours. Place six glasses into the freezer as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pour the cream into a large bowl and whip with a wire whisk until it forms soft peaks. Set the cream aside.</p>
<p>Using a fork, scrape the frozen coffee to form icy shavings, and scoop the shavings into the cold glasses. Top each serving with some of the whipped cream and serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Fior di latte</em> roughly translates to “milk blossoms,” and the clean, sweet flavor is the pinnacle of ice cream purity. All it needs are some fresh strawberries as an accompaniment.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 1 QUART GELATO]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups heavy cream</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Combine the milk,</strong> sugar, and salt in a saucepan over low heat and cook just until the sugar has completely dissolved, being careful not to scorch the milk. Now would be the time to infuse the gelato to your heart’s desire if you were going in that direction (perhaps a sprig of rosemary, a handful of coffee beans, or crushed green cardamom pods), then strain out the flavorings.</p>
<p>For our simple purposes, we will just remove the sweetened milk from the stovetop, pour it into a bowl, and stir in the cold cream to cool down the milk. Cover the mixture and refrigerate it until it’s very cold, at least 1 hour.</p>
<p>Transfer the mixture to your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Or get some friends together to churn the gelato the old-fashioned way with a vintage, hand-cranked White Mountain ice cream maker.</p>
<p>Scoop the gelato directly from the freezer and serve immediately.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">If you do not have an ice cream maker (neither a contemporary one nor an old-fashioned one), you can make gelato in sealable plastic bags. Fill one large bag with 6 cups of ice, 2 cups of kosher salt, and 1 cup of water; the combination creates a below-freezing temperature. Place the chilled gelato mixture into another bag and zip it closed. Place the gelato bag into the bag of icy salt and zip it shut. There should be enough icy salt mixture to completely submerge the gelato bag, and it is vital that both bags be zipped, so consider double-bagging each. Once you’re set up, shake the bags vigorously until the gelato thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. While this doesn’t make gelato as thick as a machine would, and it requires a lot of cold shaking, it is fun and a great way to keep children entertained.</span></p>
