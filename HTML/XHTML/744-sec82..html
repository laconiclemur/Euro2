<p class="nonindent">Throughout Catalonia, restaurants and dessert shops sell shallow dishes of this eggy custard. The oldest institutions burn the sugar on top with a branding iron. As much as I love the original, I also love the tartness that berries add to the cream base. Plus, they look beautiful when peeking through that thin sheet of caramelized sugar. The berries are great, but don’t add more than the amounts below. If you toss in more berries than called for in this recipe, the liquid they exude while cooking will mess up your custard as it sets.</p>
<p class="indent">You do need shallow ramekins for this. Spanish ones are round, but oblong French crème brûlée dishes would work, too. Finally, the last step may seem counterintuitive: Why chill the custard again after caramelizing the sugar? Trust me, the flavor actually deepens in those 20 minutes. It’s worth the wait.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup strawberries, hulled and cut in eighths</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup raspberries, halved</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup blackberries, halved</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 cups heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅛ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>9 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>12 teaspoons turbinado sugar</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">POSITION RACKS IN THE CENTER AND LOWER</span> third of the oven and preheat to 300°F. Arrange 8 shallow (5-ounce) ramekins (4 inches round) in two roasting pans or large baking dishes. Divide the berries among the ramekins in a single layer. Bring a large kettle or pot of water to a boil.</p>
<p class="indent">Combine the cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a large saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the seeds and pod. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl. While whisking, add the hot cream mixture in a steady stream. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a 1-quart liquid measuring cup or a bowl with a spout. Divide the custard among the ramekins, covering the berries. The mixture should come within ⅛ inch of the rim.</p>
<p class="indent">Carefully place the pans in the oven. Ideally, you should put them side by side on the lower rack. If they can’t fit together, place one on the center rack and one on the lower one. Very carefully pour boiling water into each pan so that it comes two-thirds of the way up the sides of the ramekins.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until the centers of the custards are set and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the centers registers 185°F, 30 to 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Carefully remove the ramekins from the water and cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate uncovered until cold and set, at least 4 hours or up to 1 day.</p>
<p class="nonindent">About half an hour before you’re ready to serve, sprinkle 1½ teaspoons turbinado sugar evenly on top of each custard. Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar, letting it bubble and turn very dark brown. Return to the refrigerator and chill for 20 minutes, then serve immediately.</p>
