<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This white-on-white, chic and classic bistro salad of raw, crunchy matchsticks of celery root dressed with mayonnaise and mustard is essentially the French version of coleslaw. I like serving it alongside rich foods like Pâté de Campagne (<a href="chapter005l.xhtml#page-147">here</a>), or as a side dish alongside a simple Roast Chicken (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-202">here</a>). It’s also wonderful as part of a lunch of composed salads.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 celery root, peeled (about ¾ pound before peeling)</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup mayonnaise (preferably homemade, <a href="chapter008d.xhtml#page-264">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ tablespoons Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons water</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Cut the celery</strong> root lengthwise into thin slices, using a mandoline if possible to make this really uniform and easy. Pile the slices and cut them lengthwise into thin matchsticks. You should have about 2 cups of matchsticks.</p>
<p>Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, water, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and add the celery root. Toss to combine. The salad can be made up to a day ahead as long as you keep it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">An unusual but tasty application for Celery Root Rémoulade is a sandwich made with fried skate. The combination merges two classic French dishes—pan-fried skate and celery root rémoulade—into one of my favorite things on earth, the fried fish sandwich, a specialty of East Coast seafood shacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="special">To make one, simply pan-fry a piece of skate in olive oil and serve it on toasted country bread with plenty of celery root rémoulade (it sort of takes the place of coleslaw) and also a generous swipe of Sauce Gribiche (<a href="chapter008d.xhtml#page-264">here</a>), some sliced radishes, and a handful of watercress. Be sure to serve this with lots of napkins, as eating it can get a bit messy—not necessarily a bad thing. Serve these with big glasses of Panaché (<a href="chapter003o.xhtml#page-94">here</a>), an icy beer with lemon.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Pinzimonio</em> is an Italian crudité. It is both utterly simple and thoroughly sophisticated. Commonly eaten at the start of the meal, pinzimonio celebrates the arrival of the season’s first pressing of olive oil. It is traditional to include every vegetable in season. Feel free to use whatever vegetables you love.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 heads endive</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 head Treviso or radicchio</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bulb fennel</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bunch scallions</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bunch radishes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup best extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Remove the stem</strong> ends from the endive and the Treviso and separate the leaves.</p>
<p>Trim off and discard the tough base of the fennel (approximately the bottom ¼ inch) and any dark, bruised outer layers. Trim off most of the green tops and fronds and set aside for another use (or discard). Slice the fennel lengthwise into pieces that are neither too thick nor too thin.</p>
<p>Trim off and discard the root ends and the very dark green tops of the scallions.</p>
<p>Cut the radishes in half lengthwise, leaving a bit of their greens on top to act as handles.</p>
<p>You could also add cleaned and trimmed carrots, celery, tomatoes, green beans, asparagus, etc.</p>
<p>Artfully arrange all of the prepared vegetables on a platter, pour the olive oil into a shallow bowl, and season it with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. That is literally it.</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><em>When making a menu, memories are a great source of inspiration, but old cookbooks are useful too. Even travel guides inspire with their informative “where to eat” and “what not to miss” suggestions. They indicate the dishes you must not leave a place without trying; and, to me, those are the dishes I am most interested in not only consuming but also cooking.</em></p>
