<p class="nonindent">Seafood stock intensifies this chunky, smoky tomato sauce with a deep savory note ideal for the fresh seared cod. The addition of earthy garbanzo beans turns this into a hearty, warming dish. Even though this whole meal comes together quickly, it tastes like it’s developed its deep flavors over many hours. Be sure to serve it with rice or good bread for sopping up the sauce.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup finely chopped onion</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup canned crushed tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 small rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup seafood stock, homemade (<a href="sec61.xhtml#page183">here</a>) or store-bought unsalted stock</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 (14.5-ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon pimentón (sweet smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 (6-ounce) skinless cod fillets</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">HEAT 1 TABLESPOON OIL IN A LARGE SAUTÉ PAN</span> over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until almost translucent, about 5 minutes. If the onion begins to brown, add a splash of water. Add the tomatoes, bay leaf, and rosemary. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the seafood stock, garbanzo beans, and pimentón. Raise the heat to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and rosemary. Stir in the parsley, season with ¼ teaspoon salt, remove from the heat, and reserve in the pan.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Season the fish with 1 teaspoon salt on both sides. Add to the pan, smooth side down. Cook until golden brown and the flesh releases easily from the pan, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the fillets over. Add the tomato garbanzo mixture to the skillet and cook until the fish is just opaque throughout and the sauce is bubbling, about 4 minutes. Serve the fish with the sauce spooned all around.</p>
