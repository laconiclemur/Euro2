		<p class="fmpf"><span class="dropcaps2line_alt"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">A</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">bout a hundred years ago a woman named Plantia Pautard lived with her husband, a baker, in St Yzans, a small village in the Médoc region of France. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">She was a formidable, renowned cook, fascinated by food and driven by ambition. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Her talents were, it seems, not limited to the kitchen, for she was also the mistress of the richest man in town, Monsieur Brion, the town’s mayor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">It was all, as they say, very French.</span></p>
		<p class="fmp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">When Monsieur Brion bought the largest, most opulent house in town, right in the center of the village, he had plans to use the house for something practical (for he was a practical man), like government offices or even a post office. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Plantia convinced him to change his mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Whether through clever pillow talk, or perhaps simply because he could never say no to Plantia, he agreed to let her use the house as a very upscale hotel and restaurant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Most likely her poor husband supplied the bread. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">(Apparently, if nothing else, he was a very good baker.)</span></p>
		<p class="fmp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The hotel soon acquired legendary status, and people from all over the region, fancy folks from Bordeaux, even Paris, would drive to Médoc to taste Plantia's cooking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Those were her glory days. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">She presided over the establishment with precision and panache, always dressed in black, cooking with the finest seasonal ingredients. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">The years passed, Plantia’s daughter had a daughter, Jacqueline, and the three women cooked side by side in the kitchen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">When the mayor sensed the end of his days, he donated the house not only to his mistress but also to her husband the baker who finally got something out of it all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6">When Plantia died, her granddaughter and her family continued to live in the house until the little girl became an older woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.7">She continued to take care of the house with exceptional care and determination, refusing to consider leaving her childhood home for a more comfortable, smaller house.</span></p>
		<p class="fmp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">When Jacqueline died, the shutters and doors of No 1 rue de Loudenne closed and the house remained locked and empty…until about a year later when a family of many children and more dogs found it and bought it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">They started cooking and the house came to life once more.</span></p>
