<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Made of grape stems, grappa has the same variety of flavors you find in wine, and combining it with chocolate is a great way to temper the “firewater” quality it can sometimes have.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES ABOUT 2 DOZEN TRUFFLES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ pound (8 ounces) semisweet chocolate, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons grappa</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">High-quality cocoa powder, for rolling</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Put the chocolate</strong> into a large mixing bowl and set aside.</p>
<p>Stir together the cream, grappa, and salt in a saucepan over medium-high heat. When the cream mixture begins to form bubbles around the edges, but before it comes to a full boil, remove the pot from the heat. Immediately pour the cream mixture over the chocolate and let it sit for 2 minutes to allow the heat to melt the chocolate. Vigorously whisk everything together or, if you have one, blend the mixture together with a handheld immersion blender. Either way, you want the chocolate and cream to be completely emulsified. Let the chocolate cool to room temperature (you can speed this up by pouring it into a baking dish or something else with more surface area), then refrigerate it until it’s firm, at least 2 hours. At this point, the chocolate mixture can sit in the refrigerator, covered, for up to a week.</p>
<p>Once the chocolate is solid, place a pile of cocoa on a large plate. Drag a warm spoon across the chocolate to make curls. Don’t worry about making them perfect. Actually, avoid making them perfect. They should be irregular and varied. Place the curls in the cocoa and toss them to coat. Transfer the finished truffles to a serving platter or into a container. While they keep well, covered, in the refrigerator for a week or so, it’s best to eat them at room temperature.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Almond toffee is a great recipe for beginning candy makers. Serve it with an espresso as a café gourmand, the assortment of sweets that come with coffee in the late afternoon in Paris. It also makes a great gift.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 1 POUND CANDY]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus extra for the pan</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups roasted almonds</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup semisweet chocolate chips (3.5 ounces)</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Generously butter a</strong> half sheet pan and set it aside.</p>
<p>Coarsely chop 1 cup of the almonds and set them aside. Finely chop the remaining 1 cup almonds and set them aside separately.</p>
<p>Transfer the coarsely chopped almonds to a heavy saucepan along with the butter, sugar, and salt. Set the pan over high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has become a golden brown caramel and registers 300°F on a candy thermometer, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Carefully pour the caramel onto the prepared sheet pan and allow it to spread naturally. Evenly distribute the chocolate chips over the top of the caramel while it is still hot. Once they melt from the heat of the caramel, sprinkle the chocolate layer with the reserved finely chopped almonds. Allow the toffee to cool and then break it into pieces. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator. Serve at room temperature.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">These were some of the first things I ate when I went to Italy, and their beautiful simplicity was part of what made me fall so deeply in love with Italian food and culture. To make these, simply melt chopped semisweet chocolate in a bowl set over a small pot of barely simmering water. Peel back the papery skin from the gooseberries (the small orange fruits also sometimes called ground cherries)—be sure to leave the papery skin attached. Holding the stem, dip the berries into the chocolate and transfer them to a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack or parchment paper to set. You can speed this up by placing the dipped fruits in the refrigerator. Repeat with the dried figs. You can make this with any fresh or dried fruit, and feel free to stuff the dried fruits with nuts. Figs and walnuts are terrific together, as are apricots and almonds.</p></div>
