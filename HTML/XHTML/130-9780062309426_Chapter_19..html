<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s late as the 1860s, on the eve of the Third Republic, virtually none of the <i>communes</i> in the Gers were French-speaking. The Gascon dialect of Occitan was the lingua franca, and even that tongue had its variants within the département. “The old dialectical world was fragmented in the extreme,” writes Eugen Weber in <i>Peasants into Frenchmen</i>. “Dialect might change from one valley to another, from high ground to low, from one riverbank to the next, if physical barriers made communication difficult.” As was the case with much of southern France, rural Gascony and its subregions were essentially countries unto themselves almost until the twentieth century: loose assemblages of isolated and self-sustaining peasant communities conducting their daily life almost completely outside the purview of the French national identity. Weber cites the account of a British visitor to the western fringes of Gascony in the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210" title="210"/>1860s: The people there, the visitor wrote, “‘live on French soil, but cannot be called Frenchmen. They speak a language as unintelligible to a Frenchman as an Englishman; they have none of the national characteristics—little, perhaps, of the national blood.’”</p>
<p class="indent">Weber’s book is packed with surprising anecdotes about the insularity of the Southwest of France. Until the mid-nineteenth century, for example, no one had bothered to build a bridge anywhere along the length of the Garonne River—Gascony’s northern frontier—between Bordeaux and Toulouse. Similarly, when a representative of the French government proposed constructing roads connecting Gascony to its adjacent provinces after the Revolution, “the people of Auch, bourgeois and common folk alike, protested: ‘We have all we need to live well.’” For many generations, Weber notes, any villager who made the difficult journey north to Paris was, upon his return, referred to forever after as a “<i>Parisien</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">One of the best parts of <i>Peasants into Frenchmen</i> is a short history of “La Marseillaise.” According to Weber, France’s national anthem—born as a battle hymn in Strasbourg in 1792 to rally the Army of the Rhine against Prussian and Austrian invaders—did nearly as much as roads and bridges to bring far-flung peoples like the Gascons into the French national fold. Weber does not fail to point out the irony of the fact that the song’s name—coined in honor of the Marseille Battalion, whose soldiers embraced the hymn with a particular fervor—refers to “a city whose people did not speak French” at the time. And yet, Weber avers, in very short order the song became an incredibly effective vector for the spread of the national language and of Frenchness in general.</p>
<p class="indent">What’s fascinating to me about all of the above is that, while I’ve heard “La Marseillaise” sung in other parts of France, I have never seen it accorded more respect and solemnity than I have in Gascony. Nowhere has that hymn made me feel more firmly rooted in <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211" title="211"/>French soil, or more unreservedly respectful of the French national ideals. It seems that somewhere along the line the Gascons, though they remain quite happily a nation unto themselves in certain ways, became model Frenchmen.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>THE EVENT THAT SPURRED THIS</small> particular revelation was Armistice Day, an anniversary that’s largely yawned at in the United States but is still a big deal in France—the First World War having been a lot deadlier for Frenchmen than the Second. Public commemorations take place all over the country, in cities, bourgs, and bourgades alike. In preparation for the ceremonies in Plaisance, Charlotte’s class had been practicing “La Marseillaise” daily, and with a diligence that I thought was impressive. It seemed I was hearing the verses emanating from the classroom windows every time I passed by the school. For two weeks, Charlotte had been reciting the song at home, sometimes with a school-issued lyric sheet in front of her and sometimes just idly, while going about her usual business. One morning, I found her in her room dressing a stuffed animal in a toilet-paper gown while repeating the lines “Form your battalions!” and “Let impure blood water our furrows!”</p>
<p class="indent">I’d never realized how violent France’s national anthem was until I studied Charlotte’s lyric sheet. Throats are slit, mothers’ breasts are ripped, warriors are struck down by mercenary phalanxes. The song paints a violent scene. (Here’s an interesting fact I learned later: In the 1990s a coalition of activists, including France’s first lady at the time, Danielle Mitterand, started a campaign to change the lyrics. The movement gained steam after a ten-year-old French girl sang an a cappella version of the anthem at the Albertville Winter Olympics, shocking quite a few non-French viewers who were following along to the subtitles. The campaign ultimately failed.) I confess I was a <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212" title="212"/>little taken aback by the lyrics, but not terribly surprised. The French don’t, on the whole, sugarcoat bloody episodes in their national history for the benefit of their children. Indeed, Charlotte was having nightmares about some World War I photos she’d seen with her class during a field trip to the local <i>médiathèque</i>. The exhibit wasn’t pulling any punches. There were pictures of bodies piled in the trenches and portraits of the gruesomely disfigured faces of mustard-gas victims. It was enough to give a grown-up bad dreams, too.</p>
<p class="indent">The day of the commemorations dawned damp and gray. Over breakfast, I helped Charlotte practice the song one last time. She’d been tripping over the line “Against us tyranny’s bloody banner is raised!” Then, at ten o’clock, the three of us walked up to the esplanade, where townspeople were assembling in front of the war memorial—a white-marble statue of a bare-breasted heroine with an upraised sword, set atop a plinth bearing three marble plaques inscribed with the names of Plaisance’s war dead.</p>
<p class="indent">The mood was somber. Members of the town council, dressed in dark suits, had lined up alongside the mayor and the president of the <i>conseil général</i>, all of them wearing serious expressions. Four veterans—of which war I wasn’t sure—took their place as flag-bearers; they wore white gloves and had medals pinned to their chests. A few gendarmes from the local <i>caserne</i>, in their flat-topped kepis and dress uniforms, were there, too, as was a good cross-section of the village, with most of the attendees crowded around the perimeter of the esplanade. In my immediate field of vision, I could see Coscuella, Alphonse, Lorette, the butcher from the new bastide, the baker from the old bastide, Doudou from the school cafeteria, and at least a dozen other familiar faces. I received a few tight-lipped smiles and nods of the head—subdued greetings appropriate to the tenor of the day.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlotte joined her classmates on the esplanade. I could see <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213" title="213"/>Charlotte in front, horsing around with her friends, looking not the least bit nervous or out of place. The Maîtresse got the kids settled down, and the crowd fell silent.</p>
<p class="indent">Now a marching band—a mix of high-school kids and adults, maybe fifteen musicians in all—rounded the corner down by the town hall, playing a military tune. We made way for them as they trooped past and installed themselves next to the war memorial. The band stopped and it was quiet again. A thin, slouching man wearing a ski parka over a suit approached a dais draped with red-and-blue bunting. He picked up a microphone, tapped it, and announced that the ceremonies would begin with a rendition of “Le Soldat” by the singer Florent Pagny, as interpreted by members of the local junior-high-school choir. Nine kids of wildly varying heights filed onto the esplanade. A young teacher played a chord on a portable electric piano, and the students’ quavering, pubescent voices rose up. Michele, who has been known to cry at Halloween parades and school band concerts, palmed away a tear.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, the mayor, accompanied by three students, laid a wreath at the foot of the memorial. A town council member gave a short, poignant speech about how war binds nation and family together. Then, one by one, the names of Plaisance’s war dead were read aloud. After each name, the entire crowd—babies and toddlers excepted—responded in unison with an incantatory “<i>Mort pour la France</i>.” This funereal call-and-response took quite a while. I counted more than seventy names in all, starting with a man named Ader and ending with someone named Touzy.</p>
<p class="indent">Now the band played a “Taps”-like tune. The man in the ski parka returned to the dais. “To conclude our commemoration,” he said, “I invite you to lend your ears as the pupils of the École Primaire sing our <i>hymne national</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">The children began to sing: “<i>Allons enfants de la patrie / Le jour de</i><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214" title="214"/><i>gloire est arrivé . . .</i>” They were out of tune, but they knew the words, every blood-soaked verse. Though I couldn’t make out her voice, I could see Charlotte’s lips moving, exhorting her fellow citizens to slay the foreign cohorts and vile despots. The crowd—reverent, standing rigidly as if at attention—mouthed along.</p>
<p class="indent">It was hard not to get swept up in the moment. Though I generally took a dim view of flag-waving and other nationalistic displays, standing there shoulder to shoulder with the people of Plaisance as “La Marseillaise” rang out, with the names of the dead still hanging in the air, I couldn’t help but feel moved. A sense of inclusion and gratitude welled up in me. It was a sentiment that might accurately be described as <i>fraternité</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">After the anthem was over, the master of ceremonies invited everyone to the town hall to share <i>le vin d’honneur</i>. A nip seemed much needed, so we gave Charlotte a long congratulatory hug and proceeded together to the mairie. Plates of crackers and cups of sparkling wine had been laid out on plastic-covered tables in the <i>salle de réunion</i>. We sipped and snacked and chatted with Maîtresse Nathalie and the school principal; Alphonse and Lorette drifted over to say hi, as did Coscuella. The town council had mounted an exhibition of children’s artwork on the theme of World War I. Charlotte’s class had pasted Xeroxed photos of French infantrymen onto construction paper and written words and short phrases next to the photos: “hunger,” “homesickness,” “fear,” “mud and lice,” “dying too young.” Charlotte showed us her contribution: “<i>beaucoup trop de morts</i>.” Her words were written in the perfectly uniform cursive drilled into every French citizen at an early age.</p>
