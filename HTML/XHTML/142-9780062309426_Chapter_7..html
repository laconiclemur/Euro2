<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>uch of present-day Gascony was part of the Basque Kingdom of Navarre until 1589, when Navarre’s Béarn-born king, Henri III, united the northern part of the kingdom with France (in the process becoming Henri IV). The Iberian dominion receded back across the Pyrenees, but an affinity for Spain lingers among the Gascons, most famously in their enduring and occasionally fanatical love of bullfighting. In much of the Gers and parts of the neighboring Landes and Lot-et-Garonne, almost every village of a reasonable size has its own bullring. Plaisance’s, a squat concrete structure built in the 1930s to replace an older wooden arena, stands on the banks of the Arros, just across the river from where we lived.</p>
<p class="indent">In Gascony, the season for <i>le corrida</i> is summer, which is also the period of the annual village <i>fêtes</i>, which, in turn, offer an occasion for much outdoor feasting, often to the accompaniment of <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_64" title="64"/>Spanish-style brass bands or flamenco dancing. Gascons take fêtes very seriously. A summer visitor to Gascony will be quick to notice the abundance of cheaply printed fliers plastered onto kiosks and shop windows announcing an extraordinary plenitude of cookouts, bandas concerts, and <i>soirées musicales</i>, and won’t have to travel far before stumbling on a hamlet turned out for its yearly party. Grilled foods are the star attraction at such events. The offerings, consumed at long communal tables, usually include one or more of the following (in descending order of prestige): magret, beefsteak, sausages, and, a perennial favorite, duck hearts, which are springy and meaty and have the distinction of tasting remarkably like magret and costing roughly a quarter as much.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele, Charlotte, and I attended our fair share of village fêtes. They were a mixed bag. At an outdoor lunch organized by a local chapter of the Young Farmers Association, rain kept putting out the grill fire that was supposed to cook the many pounds of chipolata sausages that had been procured for the occasion, and so we waited for an hour under a tent with a hundred or so stoic Gascons, watching an unflappable amateur dance troupe perform flamenco moves on a waterlogged stage, their high heels splashing in the puddles. The weather proved more cooperative when we attended a <i>grillade</i> in the tiny village of Préchac, just next door to Plaisance. There, we struck up a conversation with a plucky ninety-year-old named Jacqueline Sanvert, who upon learning that we were American, spent the entirety of the cheese and dessert course expressing her contempt for the English, speaking of them as if the Hundred Years’ War were still raging. When she found out we lived in Plaisance’s old mill, she said, “We are neighbors! You must come for apéro.” Then she looked at Charlotte with a wolfish, lip-smacking relish. “And of course you shall bring that <i>petite créature délicieuse</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">In some Gascon villages the annual fête and the much-anticipated <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65" title="65"/>bullfights are bundled into a single Bacchanalian weekend. On these occasions, Gascons enter a kind of altered state, requiring little sleep and abandoning the propriety that governs their usual, workday feasting. If a typical Gascon meal requires stamina of the uninitiated visitor, then the <i>fête-corrida</i> combo requires an almost superhuman fortitude.</p>
<p class="indent">The most famous bullfights and the most unbridled partying take place on Pentecost weekend in the town of Vic-Fézensac, about twenty-five minutes from Plaisance. I attended the Saturday-night <i>corrida</i> there and decided it wasn’t for me. A few weeks earlier, in Plaisance’s arena, I’d seen the local non-lethal (for the animal) style of bullfighting known as a <i>course landaise</i> and had found it to be quite sporting: It required the bullfighter merely to dodge the beast or, occasionally, leap over it rather than kill it. The corrida in Vic was a gorier affair. As the torero withdrew his sword from between the bull’s blood-soaked shoulders, the animal looked in my direction with wet, imploring eyes before crumpling to its knees, keeling over, and being unceremoniously dragged out of the ring by a couple of horses, quite possibly to be butchered and made into a long-simmered <i>daube de taureau</i>, which, I must confess, is a most delicious dish.</p>
<p class="indent">I found the spectacle outside Vic’s bullring to be kind of unsavory, too. The streets of the normally sleepy village heaved with drunk teenagers in white T-shirts and red kerchiefs, peeing in alleys and stalking the main avenue with arms draped over one another while singing at the top of their lungs. Before that, I’d never seen a Gascon get drunk, at least not in public. A few days later, when I mentioned my surprise to Henri, who of all people could reliably be expected to heap opprobrium upon such behavior, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said, “<i>C’est la fête</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaisance’s annual festival fell on the long Bastille Day weekend <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66" title="66"/>and attracted its own fair share of drunk, flip-flop–wearing teenagers, most of them rugby players. Carnival rides and beer tents had been set up in the parking lot of the bullring. So had a flimsy-looking stage fitted with towering loudspeakers, multicolored spotlights, and a marquee that read <small>DISCOTHÈQUE MOBILE</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">On the first night of the fête, Michele and I were kept awake until four in the morning by the DJ’s thumping beats, which would stop tantalizingly for a few seconds, filling us with hope that our misery was at an end, only to start again with a thunderous drop. Posters I’d seen around the village had advertised this nocturnal component of the weekend’s festivities quaintly as a <i>bal dansant</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">“We should lodge a complaint,” Michele said from under her pillow.</p>
<p class="indent">I told her that probably wasn’t an option in Plaisance.</p>
<p class="indent">“There’s got to be <i>something</i> we can do.”</p>
<p class="indent">I shut the windows, got back into bed, and pulled the sheet over my head. <i>“C’est la fête</i>.”</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>ANOTHER FESTIVE PHENOMENON THAT HAS</small> seeped across the Pyrenees is that of the fraternal cooking club, a tradition widely agreed to be of Basque origin.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaisance had its very own such club. It was called Les Esbouhats, which means “The Winded Ones” in the old Gascon dialect. It consisted of a few dozen rugby players, ex-rugby players, and bullfighting enthusiasts who organized inter-village rugby tournaments and, more to the point, got together for epic Friday-night dinners at their clubhouse, which was referred to, in the Spanish style, as the<i> bodega</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">I attended my first Esbouhats gathering at the invitation of Alphonse, my friend from the cooking classes. I had run into him on the second day of Plaisance’s fête. He looked relaxed and rested, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67" title="67"/>leading me to believe he lived well out of earshot of the <i>discothèque mobile</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">When he suggested I join him that night at the bodega, I demurred.</p>
<p class="indent">“I should probably tell you,” I said, “that I’ve never played rugby in my life, and I’m not the world’s biggest fan of le corrida.”</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse gave this a few seconds of consideration and then slapped me on the shoulder. “<i>Ça ne fait rien</i>,” he said. “Just come with an appetite.”</p>
<p class="indent">I’d never been a member of a social club or, come to think of it, even a guest of a member of a social club. The only image I was readily able to conjure was that of pot-bellied men sitting at card tables, smoking cigars, reading the Racing Form, and eating meatball sandwiches.</p>
<p class="indent">The Esbouhats was a different thing altogether.</p>
<p class="indent">That evening, I made my way to the address Alphonse had given me. It corresponded to a plain wood door in a narrow alley behind a Groupama insurance office. I knocked, but no one answered. Hearing loud voices inside, I pushed the door open and peeked in. A dozen or so men were crowded around a bar along one end of a cozy, grotto-like room festooned with bullfighting and rugby ephemera—old team photos, a rugby shirt the size of a bedspread, a framed silhouette of a bull.</p>
<p class="indent">I stepped inside. Three long tables in the middle of the room had been covered with white paper and neatly set with plates, glasses, and bottles of wine. There was a small kitchen behind the bar. A guy with a sandpaper beard was busily slicing something. Another man was seasoning some kind of meat.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse saw me and leapt up from his barstool, his head knocking into a string of dried peppers hanging from the ceiling. “There you are!” he said, coming over. “Let’s get you a drink.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_68" title="68"/>Alphonse installed me at the bar and introduced me to a man on the other side of the counter who went by the name of Basso. He had Popeye forearms and a walrus mustache not unlike the ones I’d seen adorning the paysans in Henri’s book of water mills.</p>
<p class="indent">“What’s your pleasure?” Basso said.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked for a beer, and Basso jerked back from the bar in mock indignation. “Eh oh!” he yelled. “You can do better than that!”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked for a whiskey instead.</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s more like it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Basso had deep smile lines around his eyes, which gleamed mischievously.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse corralled a plate of chorizo and a dish of anchovies skewered with toothpicks. Basso slid a bowl of potato chips in front of me. They were Pringles, an American import that the Gascons—who typically disparage foods that are extruded, expeller-pressed, or otherwise denatured—have for some reason warmly embraced as an apéro snack.</p>
<p class="indent">“So that you don’t feel homesick!” Basso said.</p>
<p class="indent">More men were coming in. A lot of them seemed to be Alphonse’s age—which I guessed to be in the vicinity of sixty-five, though with Gascons it was hard to tell—but many were younger. One man had brought his son, who looked to be about twelve and was sporting a faux-hawk. The club members were dressed mostly in T-shirts and jeans, with a few exceptions, among them Alphonse, who had draped a lavender cotton sweater over a madras shirt in the enduring French shorthand for laid-back male elegance. I recognized a few faces: Bernd and Thierry from the Coscuella classes, and also the local mechanic who had, free of charge, replaced our car’s antenna after it had mysteriously gone missing.</p>
<p class="indent">Basso peered at my drink and decided it needed freshening. Then he topped off Alphonse’s.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_69" title="69"/>I asked what was on the menu for tonight.</p>
<p class="indent">“Duck steaks à la plancha,” Alphonse said, pointing toward the stove. I could see a flat-top griddle fitted over the burners. I thought of my incinerated magrets and realized that a plancha would have come in handy that night.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse showed me a duty roster tacked to the wall and explained that cooking detail fell to two different members every week.</p>
<p class="indent">“We eat like kings at the Esbouhats!” Basso interjected. He proceeded to reel off an eclectic list of recent dishes: lamb navarin, Moroccan-style couscous, choucroute garnie, tapas, <i>tête de veau</i>, goulash.</p>
<p class="indent">Bernd wandered over, trailing cigarillo smoke. Then Thierry joined us. Then the <i>garagiste</i>. I was interrogated at length about American sports and politics. Henri Michel, a retired train conductor with an equine face and thinning hair, engaged me in a protracted discussion about pigeon hunting. After that, I talked to a soft-spoken man named Doudou, a native of Madagascar who, it turned out, was the school cafeteria cook. I told him Charlotte had been regaling us with descriptions of her daily lunches (for which, incidentally, the school allotted a full two hours).</p>
<p class="indent">More drinks and conversation flowed. I began to wonder if we’d ever sit down to eat.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, at around ten thirty, one of the guys who’d been working by the stove shouted, “<i>À table!</i>”</p>
<p class="indent">Basso hadn’t lied. The Esbouhats <i>did</i> eat like kings . . . or at least country lords. We started with a coarse, peppery homemade <i>pâté de campagne</i>, studded with soft fat. After that came a cold lentil salad with gravlax and fresh dill, as refined as the pâté was rustic. There were pickled cherry peppers stuffed with brandade. There were chive-topped deviled eggs. And at last the duck steaks, seared <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70" title="70"/>on the griddle for no more than a minute a side, perfectly <i>saignant</i>. Each man held the serving platter for his neighbor so that he could spoon up some of the bloody juices.</p>
<p class="indent">The men ate fast and talked faster. I couldn’t quite figure out how so much food could disappear so quickly while everybody’s mouth was running. The men jawed animatedly at one another across the tables, their words issuing forth in gusty, boastful bursts. It was the very definition of a gasconade.</p>
<p class="indent">Basso, sitting next to me, was the most blustery of all. He was a relentless wisecracker. Even when he wasn’t talking, a joke or a put-down seemed poised to escape from beneath his mustache. All of his salvos began with <i>Eh oh!</i> or <i>Putain!</i> or sometimes both. <i>Putain</i>, by the way, literally translates as “whore” but has evolved, particularly in Gascony, into a supremely versatile expletive that can range in meaning, depending on inflection and context, from a resigned “Aw, hell” to a skeptical “Oh, come on” to a mildly stunned “Holy crap” to an ejaculatory “Shit!” or even “Fuck!” Indeed, <i>putain</i> sees a lot more action—if you’ll pardon the idiom—in these parts than <i>merde</i>, a word Gascons reserve for life’s exasperating or downbeat moments, like getting a flat tire or receiving news that a friend’s dog died.</p>
<p class="indent">Basso was on a roll. By the time the apricot tart and the Armagnac had come out, he seemed to be winding up to a finale. He poured himself some of the brandy, laid a hand on my shoulder, and shouted to a short, straitlaced guy seated at the next table, “Eh oh! Francis! Tell our American friend what happened at the fête in your wife’s village!”</p>
<p class="indent">Francis groaned and swiped a hand across his face.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Putain</i>,” Basso said, looking at me but playing to the room, “Francis got so drunk, he climbed into bed with his mother-in-law!”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71" title="71"/>“Knock it off<i/>,” said Francis weakly. But it was too late; the sharks smelled blood.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s true!” said Basso, slapping a hand against the table for want of a rim shot. “He screwed her three times before he sobered up!”</p>
<p class="indent">The room erupted. Francis hurled a piece of baguette across the table. It ricocheted off the Armagnac bottle and landed in my lap.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>A FIXTURE OF ANY RESPECTABLE</small> festival weekend is the morning <i>casse-croûte</i>. Most often a paper-plate meal of bacon and eggs, a casse-croûte is not unlike a church pancake breakfast, except that the Gascon version includes plenty of wine, has been preceded by a late night of feasting and drinking, and will be followed by a lunchtime <i>grillade</i> and, a few hours after that, an evening of more drinks and more feasting, all of it wrapping up with a bloody corrida.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaisance’s casse-croûte took place on the morning after the Esbouhats dinner—Bastille Day—and had been described by Alphonse as a beloved local tradition not to be missed. It was held under the main festival tent next to the bullring and started at nine o’clock, but Basso had advised me to get there early to beat the crowds.</p>
<p class="indent">By eight thirty, people were already lining up at a small ticket kiosk. I could see Basso and Alphonse inside the tent, both smartly groomed and looking impossibly well-slept. Alphonse and a couple of other Esbouhats were placing bottles of red wine on long folding tables. Basso was connecting a propane tank to a rickety portable gas range topped with a couple of beat-up skillets and a cast-iron plancha. He saw me and rushed over.</p>
<p class="indent">“Eh oh! We weren’t sure you’d make it in time,” he said, ushering me past the crowd. He pawed through a cardboard box. “You can cook eggs, right?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’ve fried a few, why?”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72" title="72"/>Basso grinned and tossed me an apron. “An Esbouhat has to work for his breakfast!”</p>
<p class="indent">I tried to think of the French expression for “bait-and-switch,” but it escaped me.</p>
<p class="indent">Basso lit the burners on the range and handed me a spatula. “Two eggs per customer,” he said. “Alphonse will cook the bacon.” He jabbed a thumb toward a towering stack of egg crates behind us. “We cook until we run out or everyone’s fed, whichever comes first.”</p>
<p class="indent">At nine o’clock, villagers started streaming into the tent and lining up in front of our cooking station, plastic plates in hand. They wore the grave expressions of Gascons not accustomed to waiting for their first meal of the day.</p>
<p class="indent">Basso, who inexplicably donned a cowboy hat, poured some oil into his skillet. I did the same, and then followed Basso’s lead, cracking six eggs into my pan, giving them a dusting of salt and pepper, and serving them two by two, sunny-side up, onto the attendees’ outthrust plates.</p>
<p class="indent">I quickly fell behind. My burner seemed to have only one setting—high—and soon droplets of sputtering, superheated oil were leaping about festively, dappling my forearms with a hundred bee stings. The uneven bottom of my dented skillet, which should have been retired from service many bacon-and-egg breakfasts ago, kept sliding partway off the burner, sloshing oil onto my shoes and, by exposing the naked flame, causing my recently regrown knuckle hairs to curl and blacken all over again. My glasses kept slipping down my sweat-slicked nose. I looked over at Alphonse, who was unhurriedly lifting tidy rounds of <i>ventrèche</i>—the cured, unsmoked pork belly that is a beloved Gascon breakfast meat—off the griddle and onto the plates, and wondered how he’d gotten the easy job.</p>
<p class="indent">The worst part was, I was breaking and overcooking the yolks, discovering in doing so that Gascons paying to attend a Bastille <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73" title="73"/>Day casse-croûte had no compunction about refusing an egg they deemed less than flawlessly done. I was discarding almost as many eggs as I was dispensing.</p>
<p class="indent">My travails seemed to cause Basso immense delight.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Putain</i>, <i>Dah-veed!</i> I thought you said you’d cooked eggs before!”</p>
<p class="indent">“I have,” I said, dumping another ruined specimen into the garbage can. “Just not this many!”</p>
<p class="indent">Basso was turning out one jiggling duo of perfect eggs after another and, as if to show me how effortless it was, kept up a stream of banter all the while. Each customer received a customized bon mot.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Alors</i>, Mademoiselle,” he said to a girl Charlotte’s age, “how do you like yours? Medium? Rare? <i>Bleu?</i>”</p>
<p class="indent">To the middle-aged man in line after her, Basso rattled off a joke about a cuckolded pharmacist.</p>
<p class="indent">The svelte woman who came next got a scolding for asking for just one egg. “How do you expect to get fat like me if you keep eating like that!”</p>
<p class="indent">As we were getting near the end of the eggs, Michele and Charlotte appeared in front of me, plates in hand. It took me a second to register who they were.</p>
<p class="indent">“What are you doing here?” Michele asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“Long story,” I said. “What are <i>you</i> doing here?”</p>
<p class="indent">“We got hungry and followed the crowd.”</p>
<p class="indent">I served Charlotte her eggs. She looked entertained by the whole scene. Then I served a couple of eggs to Michele.</p>
<p class="indent">“Not that one!” Michele said. “The yolk’s broken.”</p>
<p class="indent">Into the trash it went.</p>
<p class="indent">By the time the eggs were gone, I was a scalded, sweaty wreck. As I was untying my apron, Alphonse tapped my shoulder. He was holding one last plate of food.</p>
<p class="indent">He handed it to me. “Eat up, <i>mon brave</i>.”</p>
