<p class="nonindent">This potato salad from Andalucía gets dressed in sherry vinegar and oil while hot to fully absorb the seasonings. It’s a simple way to make potatoes tasty. The dressed potatoes can be refrigerated for up to three days and tossed with the aromatics and herbs just before serving. Fresh herbs are not traditional in this dish, but I really love the blend of chives, tarragon, dill, and parsley. This salad would be ideal at any cookout, but is especially good with boquerónes, marinated white anchovies you can buy at well-stocked markets.</p>
