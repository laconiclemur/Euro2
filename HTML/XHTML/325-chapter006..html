<p class="center">There is a communal table at Buvette that seats twelve. In the mornings we use it as a kitchen table for prep: shelling beans, peeling asparagus, or making croque-monsieurs. In the evening we seat couples and groups side by side. It isn’t for everyone, but by the looks of it, most guests do enjoy themselves.</p>
<p class="center1">For a celebration at the table, we create a feast around one simple roast chicken. Upon the guests’ arrival we greet them with Kirs and a generously stocked table of charcuterie. There are carved hams and pots of mustard with chilled leeks and asparagus in vinaigrette. Waiters pass tartinettes with oxtail marmalade and walnut pesto, not to mention warm schiacciata from the oven. From the kitchen I often hear bottles of Champagne being opened, sounding like gunfire from the dining room, a signal the celebration is underway. There are many recipes here to help you create an informal feast of your own, as well as a few techniques to make it all the easier.</p>
<p class="center1">I remember the first grand meal I made. I was seven years old and I made lunch for my mother, who was a schoolteacher, and a colleague of hers. Unplanned and unsolicited, I brought them from the kitchen a tray with two beefsteak tomatoes filled with a sloppy tuna salad, along with iced teas and cutlery rolled in paper napkins. My wobbly tomatoes were greeted with smiles—I have come a long way.</p>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-164"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Leeks in Vinaigrette</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">A classic bistro preparation, this is one of my favorite vegetable dishes. Serve these leeks on their own to start a meal, or alongside Roast Chicken (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-202">here</a>) or crispy Duck Confit (<a href="chapter005i-2.xhtml#page-140">here</a>) as an unexpected, beautiful side dish. Note that the longer these sit and marinate in the dressing, the better they get, so feel free to make them ahead.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bunch leeks, white and light green parts only, well washed</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup Vinaigrette (<a href="chapter008.xhtml#page-258v">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Bring a large</strong> pot of water to a boil and salt it. Add the leeks and cook until softened, about 15 minutes. To test for doneness, insert a paring knife into one of the leeks—it should be able to go through with barely any resistance.</p>
<p>Transfer the leeks to a plate and let cool to room temperature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whisk together the vinaigrette and the mustards.</p>
<p>Cut each leek in half lengthwise, then cut the halves in half crosswise. Place them on a platter, cut side up, and cover with the vinaigrette. Let the leeks sit for at least 10 minutes before serving so that the dressing has a chance to find its way between the leeks’ layers.</p></div>
