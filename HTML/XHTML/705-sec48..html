<p class="nonindent">If you think this sounds like ratatouille, you’re right. Or, for that matter, caponata. Italy, France, and Spain share very similar Mediterranean dishes. The differences among the countries’ versions stem from regional ingredients and cultural traditions. Some may argue over whose recipe appeared first, but I think what matters more is how it tastes now. I tossed in some thyme and rosemary, as I think those herbs lend a lovely aroma.</p>
<p class="indent">This stew originated in La Mancha, which is one of the largest wine regions in the world. Vineyards from that region produce beautiful wines, which would taste great with this dish.</p>
<p class="indent">Pisto Manchego morphs easily from appetizer to side dish to main dish. You may make a big batch and serve some on toast at the start of a meal. The next night, it might nestle next to roast chicken (see <a href="sec42.xhtml#page140">here</a>). The following morning, you might slide an egg on it (see <a href="sec71.xhtml#page210">here</a>).</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large tomato (8½ ounces), cut in half crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 green bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and cut into ½-inch dice (3 cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and cut into ½-inch dice (3 cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 small yellow onions, cut into ½-inch dice (1½ cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 packed tablespoon minced garlic (from about 4 large cloves)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large (1¼ pound) eggplant, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅓ cup tomato paste</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 sprigs thyme</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">SET A BOX GRATER OVER A MEDIUM BOWL AND</span> grate the tomato from the cut sides until all you have left is skin. You should have 1 cup tomato puree.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Combine the oil, green peppers, and red peppers in a large stockpot. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 15 minutes. Add the onions and garlic. Stir well and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened and become translucent, about 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the eggplant, tomato paste, thyme, rosemary, and tomato puree. Stir well until everything is evenly mixed. Cook until sizzling, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat to low, and continue cooking until very soft, about 1 hour. As you get toward the end of cooking, you have to stir more frequently because the vegetables are losing their moisture, so they tend to stick a little more. Lower the heat if needed.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Season with 1¼ teaspoons salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Discard the rosemary and thyme. Taste and add more salt and pepper if you’d like.</p>
<p class="indent">The Pisto Manchego can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Reheat before serving.</p>
