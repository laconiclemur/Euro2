<p class="nonindent">Throughout Spain, this quail dish is usually served cold or room temperature. The birds soak in the vinegary sauce for up to a week, taking on an intense tartness. I don’t like eating generously sauced poultry at room temperature, so I decided to serve this hot. The key is to simmer the cooking liquid to the point when the acid has burned off and the natural sugars in the vinegar start to caramelize. That results in a silky sauce with a welcome tang.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 whole (4-ounce) quails, or 2 (1¼-pound) poussins</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup pearl onions</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 carrot, peeled and cut into ¼-inch-thick rounds (½ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 scallions, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 strips orange zest, removed with a vegetable peeler</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 dried guindilla or arbol chile</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup dry sherry wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup sherry vinegar</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">IF YOU’RE USING BONE-IN QUAIL OR THE POUSSINS</span>, start by splitting them in half. Using kitchen shears, cut along one side of the backbone, then the other, and discard the spine. Cut along one side of the breast bone, top to bottom, to split the birds in half. One side of each bird will be slightly larger since it has the breastbone.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To peel the pearl onions, fill a medium bowl with ice and water and bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Use a sharp paring knife to slit an “X” opposite the root ends of the pearl onions. Drop into the boiling water and boil for 45 seconds. Drain and immediately transfer to the ice water. When cool, slip off the outer papery layers of the onions. Trim the very end of the roots.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt all over the quail (or 1½ teaspoons for the poussins). Season with pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until very hot. Add half the poultry and cook, turning once, until nicely seared, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and repeat with another tablespoon oil and the remaining birds.</p>
<p class="indent">Add another tablespoon oil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the garlic. Stir just until golden, about 15 seconds, then add the carrot. Cook, stirring often, until golden and starting to caramelize, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the pearl onions and cook, stirring often, until starting to turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the scallions and stir for 30 seconds, then stir in the bay leaf, orange zest, and chile. Stir just until fragrant, then add the sherry. Bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up the browned bits. Add the vinegar, remaining ¼ cup oil, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, then simmer until reduced by half. Stir in ½ teaspoon salt.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the birds with any accumulated juices and nestle into the mixture. Simmer, turning the pieces occasionally, until the meat is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. When you press the meat with your fingertip, it should feel firm and not at all squishy. Transfer the birds to a serving platter. Taste the sauce. It should now be reduced and bubbling thickly like lava and the vinegar should taste a bit sweet. If not, simmer it longer. Spoon all over the poultry and serve hot.</p>
