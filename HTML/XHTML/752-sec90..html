<h2 class="serve"><strong>MAKES 5 CUPS</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Lavender grows all over Spain. When used in its fresh form, its floral fragrance stays subtle. That hint of lavender perfumes this sweet-tart raspberry sorbet, elevating its otherwise straightforward flavors into an elegant dessert complex enough to eat on its own.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup packed fresh lavender sprigs, tied with twine into a bundle</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ pounds frozen raspberries</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons vodka</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small"><strong>BRING THE SUGAR, LAVENDER, AND 1 cup WATER</strong></span> to a boil in a large saucepan, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Stir in the raspberries and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Discard the lavender. Transfer the raspberry mixture to a blender and puree on high speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, until very smooth, at least 1 minute. Add the vodka and blend until fully incorporated.</p>
<p class="indent">Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate in an airtight container until very cold, at least 8 hours and up to overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Churn the chilled mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serve immediately or freeze in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
