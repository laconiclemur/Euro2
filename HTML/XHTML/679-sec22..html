<p class="nonindent">Mushrooms are a staple of both Catalonia and North Carolina’s mountains, so I wanted to showcase them in this classic Spanish tapa, which is normally stuffed with only squid, aromatics, and bread crumbs. Mushrooms bring as much depth to the dish as my technique of caramelizing the vegetables for the sauce. Since the whole process is pretty labor-intensive, I use a food processor to chop the vegetables for the sauce. They need to be cut small to brown well, but they don’t have to look pretty. If you want, you can use the machine to cut the squid, onion, garlic, and mushrooms for the filling, too. The mixture will end up smoother and firmer but still taste wonderful.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE MANZANILLA TOMATO SAUCE,</span> pulse the onions and carrots in a food processor until finely minced, scraping the bowl occasionally. It’s okay if the pieces aren’t perfectly uniform because the vegetables are strained out later. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add the minced carrots and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has evaporated and the vegetables have begun to caramelize, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the crushed tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the tomatoes begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sherry, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer for 5 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pushing firmly on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve. The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, make the stuffed squid. If the squid bodies are still attached to the tentacles, cut them apart. If the bodies still have the stiff cartilage spine inside, remove and discard. If the bodies still have the outer wings attached, carefully pull them away. Pack the wings and tentacles into a ½ cup measuring cup; if it isn’t full, add enough of the smallest bodies to fill it. Transfer to paper towels and squeeze very dry. You should have about 12 bodies remaining; refrigerate them.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the squid wings, tentacles, and any bodies with them. Be careful; the squid may pop out of the pan and the oil may splatter if there’s any water on the squid. Cook, turning to evenly brown, until well-seared, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Add <a id="page82"/>1 tablespoon oil to the skillet, reduce the heat to medium, and add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring and scraping up the browned bits, until glassy, about 8 minutes. While the onion mixture cooks, very finely chop the seared squid. Return the squid to the pan and add the mushrooms and thyme. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until the mixture is very dry and begins to slightly brown and stick to the pan, about 5 minutes. Add the sherry and cook until all the liquid evaporates. Remove from the heat and discard the thyme. Stir in the panko, parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt. Spread out on a plate and refrigerate to quickly cool room temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer the cooled squid mixture to a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Snip a ½-inch hole in one corner, essentially making a piping bag. Stick the corner with the hole cut out into the opening of a reserved squid body and squeeze in the squid filling until the body is about two-thirds full. Repeat with the remaining squid bodies and filling. Use a chopstick or the dull end of a skewer to push the filling into the body to remove any air pockets. Seal the open ends of the squid bodies with a toothpick using a sewing motion. The stuffed squid can be covered tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 1 day.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Lightly season the stuffed squid with salt and add to the hot oil. Cook, turning once, until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomato sauce. Simmer until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the squid.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer the squid to a serving platter and carefully remove the toothpicks. Pour the sauce all over and serve hot.</p>
