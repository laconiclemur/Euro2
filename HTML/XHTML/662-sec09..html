<p class="nonindent">José Andrés, a preeminent Spanish chef with restaurants in America, remains an inspiration years after I started my career in his restaurants. He used to do a cold mushroom soup with Manchego, which I loved so much that I created a hot mushroom soup with Idiazábal cheese for our winter menu at Cúrate. Idiazábal comes from the Basque region, where it’s made from the raw milk of Laxta and Carranza sheep. Lightly pressed and aged for under a year, it’s supple and creamy with a mild sharpness. To complement that complex cheese, I work the flavor out of the mushrooms by sautéing them for the stock and the base of the soup. But I streamline the rest of the prep. Since the mushrooms are going to be pureed anyway, I don’t bother with trimming or finely chopping them. Instead of washing them, I wipe off any dirt with a dry paper towel. The process goes quickly and saves a lot of time later. Mushrooms soak up water like sponges, so if you wash them, they have to release the water first before browning and then take three times as long to sear as dry mushrooms. That little trick yields an intensely flavorful soup that’s perfect for chilly days.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE MUSHROOM STOCK, COMBINE THE</span> onions, carrot, celery, garlic, and 1 tablespoon oil in a 6-quart saucepan. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and soft, about 20 minutes. They should just start to lightly brown in spots and stick to the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the remaining tablespoon oil, then the cremini mushrooms. Stir well, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the bay leaf, dried mushrooms, and 8 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indent">Strain through a colander set over another large pot, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. You should have 6 cups stock. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and boil until reduced to 4 cups, about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the mushroom soup, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a very large, high-sided cast-iron pan or large skillet over high heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan, until just smoking. Add half of the crimini mushrooms in a single, even layer, spacing 1 inch apart, and turn cut sides down. <a id="page46"/>You want the mushrooms to sizzle pretty hard when they hit the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-high and sear until the bottoms are dark golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil and mushrooms. If the pan gets too dry, add just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. You want to get the color on there for more flavor. If you add all the mushrooms at once, they’ll steam and not brown.</p>
<p class="indent">Remove the pan from the heat, then return all the mushrooms to the pan, along with the onion and thyme. Stir well and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is supersoft, about 12 minutes. Reduce the heat if the vegetables start to brown too much.</p>
<p class="indent">Add ½ cup mushroom stock, raise the heat to medium-high, and simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the pan is almost dry, about 7 minutes. Add the sherry and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until almost all the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the thyme sprigs.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer to a blender, being sure to scrape all the onions, mushrooms, and juice from the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining mushroom stock. If the blender seems too full, don’t add all the stock. Puree until smooth. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve set over another saucepan. If you have any remaining stock, pour through the sieve.</p>
<p class="indent">Set over medium-high heat and whisk in 1 teaspoon salt. Reheat until hot. Taste and add more salt if you’d like. I like to season something at the temperature at which I want to eat it. Divide among serving bowls. Scatter the cheese on top, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with the thyme leaves.</p>
