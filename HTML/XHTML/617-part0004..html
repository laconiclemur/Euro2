<h1 class="heading" id="ch01sec01">Ukrainian beetroot broth</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My uncle in Moscow would often be asked by his Russian friends: &#8216;Is it true that Ukrainians eat <em>borshch</em> three times a day?&#8217; He answered, &#8216;If you guys could make a proper Ukrainian <em>borshch</em>, you would get up at night to eat it.&#8217; Stock is very important here, as with every other broth recipe in this book, and the meat that you use should be well marbled, otherwise it will never become meltingly soft. The most authentic of <em>borshches</em> should include pork <em>salo</em> (<a href="part0008.xhtml#pg136">cured pork belly</a>) minced with garlic and added at the end. A skinny, old boiling chicken also makes a flavoursome <em>borshch</em>.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) beetroot, peeled and cut into matchsticks</p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) potatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang">1 carrot, peeled and roughly grated</p>
<p class="hang">1 red pepper, cored, deseeded and chopped</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon tomato pur&#233;e</p>
<p class="hang">1 beef tomato (skin discarded), roughly grated, or 100g (3&#189; oz) <a href="part0009.xhtml#ch06sec06">fermented tomatoes</a></p>
<p class="hang">&#189; small white cabbage, shredded</p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang"><a id="pg12"></a><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) oxtail or fatty beef short ribs</p>
<p class="hang">1 onion, peeled but kept whole</p>
<p class="hang">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hang1">2.5 litres (4 pints) cold water</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>To serve</strong></p>
<p class="hang">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) soured cream</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of dill, chopped</p>
<p class="hang1"><em><a href="part0005.xhtml#pg42">Pampushky</a></em></p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> To make the stock, simply place the meat, whole onion, bay leaf and measurement water in a large saucepan. Season the water lightly and cook over a low heat for 1 hour. Skim off the scum with a spoon from time to time.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Add the beetroot and potatoes to the stock, season well with salt and pepper and cook over low heat for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Meanwhile, heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and carrot and cook over a medium heat, stirring, for about 5&#8211;7 minutes until the carrot is meltingly soft and is about to start caramelizing. This is a distinctively Ukrainian soffritto technique called <em>smazhennya</em> or <em>zazharka</em>.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Add the red pepper and tomato pur&#233;e to the onion and carrot and cook it out for 2 minutes, then add the grated fresh tomato or fermented tomatoes, stir and reduce slightly before adding all of this to the broth.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Finally, add the shredded cabbage and beans to the broth and cook for about 7 minutes until cooked through.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Serve with a dollop of soured cream, chopped dill and <em>Pampushky</em>.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch01sec02"><a id="page_15"></a>Sorrel broth</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Come the spring, we pick basketfuls of sorrel from Mum&#8217;s vegetable patch, collect duck eggs from her ducks and cook this emerald-green beauty. You can use chicken or vegetable stock, but rich duck stock tamed by sharp fresh sorrel is a winner for me. It&#8217;s not a true <em>borshch</em> but more of a sorrel broth. Grandma Lusia always made a huge pile of <em>Frumentaty</em> (<a href="part0005.xhtml#ch02sec05">Moldovan flatbreads</a>) to go with this. I would recommend keeping the duck breasts for a different dish (use them instead of pork in the <em><a href="part0007.xhtml#pg98">Nudli</a></em> on) and just using the back, legs, wings and giblets for this soup.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4&#8211;6</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang">1 carrot, peeled and grated</p>
<p class="hang">2 potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) beetroot leaves and stalks, chopped, or 1 small beetroot, peeled and cut into matchsticks</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) sorrel, sliced with its stalks</p>
<p class="hang1">2 spring onions, sliced</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p class="hang">back, wings, legs and giblets (except the liver) of 1 medium duck</p>
<p class="hang">1 onion, peeled but kept whole</p>
<p class="hang">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hang">2.5 litres (4 pints) cold water</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>To serve</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 chicken&#8217;s eggs (or duck eggs), hard-boiled, shelled and chopped</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of dill, chopped</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of parsley, chopped</p>
<p class="hang1"><em><a href="part0005.xhtml#pg49">Frumentaty</a></em></p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> To make the stock, place the duck pieces and giblets, whole onion and bay leaf in a large saucepan, then cover with the measurement water and add a pinch of sea salt flakes. Bring to a simmer and skim the surface, discarding all the scum. Simmer on the lowest heat possible for 1&#189;&#8211;2 hours or until the duck meat falls off the bone. The liquid will reduce by almost half. Keep skimming it from time to time.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Strain the stock into a large bowl, reserving the duck bits, but discarding the onion and bay leaf. Pour the liquid back into the pan. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pull the duck meat off the bones, discard the bones and set the meat aside.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Skim half a ladleful of duck broth from the very top (you are aiming to skim the fat here) and pour it into a frying pan. Boil off the liquid for a minute until you are left with just duck fat. Add the onion and carrot to the pan and sweat over a medium heat, stirring all the time, for about 5&#8211;7 minutes until they are soft and caramelized ever so slightly. These will bring beautiful sweetness to the broth.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Introduce the onion and carrot to your stock, followed by the potatoes, and cook for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Add the beetroot leaves and stalks or beetroot matchsticks and cook for 5 minutes, then switch the heat off.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Place some duck meat in each serving bowl. Then place the raw, chopped sorrel and spring onions on top and pour the hot stock over them. Garnish with the chopped egg, dill and parsley, and serve with <em>Frumentaty</em>.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is simply the best hangover cure there is. The meat needs to have a good amount of fat on it as this is the whole point of using gherkins &#8211; they cut through the fat. You should only use brined or fermented gherkins, as even the nicest vinegar will spoil this dish. Look for a label with &#8216;og&#243;rek kwaszony&#8217; in Polish or <a href="part0009.xhtml#page_152">Eastern European shops</a>. Make the stock in advance and freeze it; it doesn&#8217;t take long to make this soup once the stock is ready. The fat, salt and sugar from caramelized carrot will make you feel alive again.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang"><a id="st"></a><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) pork ribs</p>

<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) gherkins, peeled and grated</p>
<p class="hang">200ml (7fl oz) gherkin brine from the jar</p>
<p class="hang1">2 spring onions, finely chopped, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> To make the stock, cut the ribs into individual ribs, place in a large saucepan and cover with the water. Add the whole onion, bay leaf, peppercorns and allspice and bring to the boil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Reduce the heat as soon as the water boils and skim the scum that rises to the surface. Simmer for a couple of hours while you watch your favourite TV series and eat leftover gherkins.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> When the meat is tender and falling off the bone, add the pearl barley or rice and cook for 15 minutes until it is cooked, but still has a bite.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, sweat the diced onion in the sunflower oil in a frying pan over a medium heat for 5 minutes, then add the parsley root or stalks and carrot and continue to cook over a medium-low heat, stirring often, for 15 minutes or until everything is soft and starting to caramelize slightly. Add to the stock.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Add the gherkins to the stock, taste and add 100ml (3&#189;fl oz) of the gherkin brine. Taste it and add more if you think it needs more salt. The broth should taste rich, but also a little salty, sweet and sour. Scatter with spring onions and serve with a huge hunk of good bread.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is incredibly refreshing in the summer. I guess it&#8217;s a hybrid of something that Russians call <em>okroshka</em> (which comes from <em>kroshit</em>, meaning &#8216;to chop into small pieces&#8217;) and the Ukrainian <em>kholodnyk</em> (&#8216;the cold one&#8217;). I like the idea of brining the beetroot first. And I like the idea of fresh radishes and cucumber in it, too. Add a small splash of sherry vinegar, and a tiny bit of Tabasco if you can&#8217;t find fresh horseradish, to funk it up a little.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Drain the beetroot, reserving the brine. Cut it into thin slices and then into 5mm (&#188; inch) dice.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Place the beetroot, stock and 300ml (&#189; pint) of the reserved brine in a saucepan, taste for seasoning, then bring to the boil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Add the potato and cook for 15 minutes or until cooked through. Let the broth cool, then cover and chill in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Add the horseradish just before serving (it is so volatile, it will make you cry but will dissipate into thin air quite rapidly). Serve the soup chilled, with an ice cube or two added, and garnished with the radishes, cucumber, spring onions and dill.</p>

It should be rich, spicy and a little bit crazy-tasting. My grandmother used to make it with ox heart &#8211; boiled with some beef bones and then chopped into small pieces. Instead of the more traditional salami, I sometimes like to use diced and fried spicy cooking chorizo.

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">The word <em>tuzluk</em> is normally used in the Caucasus region to describe a brine for salting fish or meat. However, in the south of Ukraine <em>tuzluk</em> is what we call a simple mutton broth served with seasoned raw onions. We always used to make it when camping by the Dnieper River, cooked over a campfire in a cauldron for a few hours while the fathers fished, mothers chatted and chopped salads, and the kids swam in the river. I always associate this broth with a sense of adventure. Once, when I was five, we went camping with my huge extended family. It was a beautiful July afternoon when a huge storm came out of nowhere. Luckily, my uncle had an old Volga truck in which all 15 of us huddled up and sipped on <em>tuzluk</em> that we had managed to save, listening to the banging of torn willow branches against the roof of the car.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> When the broth is ready, place the sliced raw red onions in a bowl, season well with salt and give them a quick massage. Then add a ladleful of the hot broth to kill any raw onion harshness. Take out the meat and potatoes and place them on a platter. Everybody serves themselves broth and takes a little bit of meat, some potatoes and the broth-soaked raw onions. Sprinkle over the chopped herbs and eat outside at dusk, preferably by a campfire.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">I visited Baku when I was two years old. My parents were really brave to take me together with my 10-year-old brother on a 1,300-mile road trip in our old Zhiguli. It took us two days and finally we were there, just south of Iran, by the Caspian Sea. I wish I remembered more of the trip. All I have is a photo of my brother and me in a meadow by a lake, and a vague memory of watching TV in Azerbaijan. Even though nobody believes me, I remember Gorbachev talking passionately about something (<em>perestroika</em>?) on TV and how serious my parents&#8217; faces looked. This soup is traditionally cooked in individual clay serving pots, but I prefer cooking it in a large pot and then decanting it into small bowls.</span></p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This, like all the other Armenian recipes in this book, is Aunt Nina&#8217;s recipe. When she first sent it through, she said, &#8216;If you can, use Alycha prunes; if not, just regular prunes &#8211; not the smoked variety!&#8217; I would actually love to get my hands on some smoked prunes &#8211; how ace do they sound? Nina normally just drops a couple of prunes into the broth while cooking the chickpeas, but I like to add some pomegranate molasses. Do whatever is easier or suits your tastes, as both versions are good.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 litres (3&#189; pints) meat or vegetable stock</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; cinnamon stick</p>

<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of dill, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang1">&#189; bunch of fresh coriander, finely chopped</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the stock and cinnamon stick in a saucepan, add the chickpeas and bring to the boil. Stir in the pomegranate molasses, and the sugar, if the broth seems a little too sour. Reduce the heat and simmer &#8211; if using soaked chickpeas, simmer for 55 minutes, or 5 minutes for canned &#8211; until the chickpeas are cooked through, but still have a crisp texture. Season the broth with salt and pepper once the chickpeas are cooked.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Meanwhile, make the meatballs. Place the lamb, onion and uncooked rice in a bowl, season well and give it all a really good mix with your hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Wash your hands, but do not dry them, as it is easier to shape the <em>kyufta</em> with wet hands. Roll the mixture into 12 oblong meatballs, stuffing a prune half in the middle of each.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Drop the <em>kyufta</em> into the broth and cook for 20&#8211;25 minutes or until the rice in the <em>kyufta</em> is tender and the meat is cooked through. Taste the broth &#8211; it should be well seasoned and slightly sweet and sour. Serve with the chopped herbs.</p>
