<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-13"/><span class="blue">Poached Eggs over Scafata</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">In Italian, <em>scafata</em> means “shelled beans,” but when you order it, it often includes a mix of vegetables. I always make scafata with fresh fava beans, springtime’s gift to the kitchen. (See the recipe introduction on <a href="chapter003k.xhtml#page-83">here</a> for instructions on shelling favas.) Feel free to include asparagus or fresh lima beans. Note that this dish is welcome anytime of the day and makes for a great lunch, especially with a glass of rosé from Provence.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 dried red chilies, or a large pinch of red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 baby artichokes, trimmed and cut into eighths</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup peeled fava beans</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup fresh shelled peas</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ bunch escarole, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh basil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh mint</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Shaved pecorino Romano cheese, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Combine the</strong> olive oil, garlic, chilies, and artichokes in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook, partially covered, until the artichoke pieces are just beginning to get tender, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the fava beans, peas, and scallions and cook until the beans are just tender, about 2 minutes. Add the escarole, basil, and mint and let the mixture simmer until the artichokes are completely tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Season to taste with salt, then divide the scafata evenly among four shallow bowls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile bring 3 inches of water and the vinegar to a boil in a large saucepan. Lower the heat so that the water is just gently simmering. Crack each egg into a small ramekin and carefully slip each one into the simmering water, spacing them so that their whites do not touch. Cook the eggs until the whites are just set, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the eggs from the water and transfer them immediately to the plated scafata. Top each poached egg with a few shavings of pecorino Romano and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-14"/><span class="blue">Omelette</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">The choices for omelettes are limited only by your imagination. All you need is a nice salad of fresh greens and radishes dressed simply with oil, salt, and a few drops of vinegar served alongside, and a glass of wine.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 1 OMELETTE]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons chopped mixed leafy herbs (I like a mix of chives, chervil, and tarragon, but use whatever you like and is fresh)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Crack the eggs into a bowl and add a large pinch of salt. Vigorously whisk together and stir in two-thirds of the herb mixture. Set the egg mixture aside.</p>
<p>In a small, 6-inch diameter sauté pan set over medium heat, melt the butter. (If your pan is not well seasoned you may need more butter.)</p>
<p>As the butter melts, tilt the pan to make sure the butter evenly coats the pan. Pour in the whisked eggs and continue cooking over medium heat until the eggs begin to set, but are not cooked through, roughly 3 minutes, keeping in mind that the eggs will continue cooking off the heat. This is the point where you can add Parmigiano-Reggiano and butter, ham and Gruyère, or goat cheese and leeks if you wish. A good omelette will have a creamy texture and remain bright yellow.</p>
<p>Season with salt and pepper, and then begin to fold the omelette.</p>
<p>To remove the omelette, tilt the pan toward the serving plate and gently free it with a spatula until it slides halfway onto the plate. Now fold it over onto itself to form a half-moon. Serve sprinkled with the remaining 1 tablespoon herbs and an additional pinch of salt.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">If you are making omelettes for more than one, I suggest using your oven as I do at Buvette. It is a fast and easy way to make a beautiful omelette. Begin by melting the butter in a small pan on the stovetop as above, but when you add the eggs, transfer the pan to a 400°F oven to continue cooking, about 5 minutes. If you wish to fill your omelette with spinach or leeks, etc., do so as soon as it sets and then return it to the oven to finish cooking. Remove and follow the instructions for plating above.</span></p>
