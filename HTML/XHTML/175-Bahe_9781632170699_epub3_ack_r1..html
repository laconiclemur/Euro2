<p class="left morespaceabove" id="p1"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE</span> who have had a hand in shaping this book. Thank you to my editor, Hannah Elnan, and everyone at Sasquatch Books for making this experience a delightful one. Deepest thanks to both my agents, Mackenzie Brady and Danielle Barthel at New Leaf Literary, for believing so fully in me and in this project from day one. Their enthusiasm gave me confidence every step of the way.</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p2">Thank you to my photographer, Charity Burggraaf; my stylists, Renée Beaudoin and Shannon Douglas; and my designer, Anna Goldstein, for making this book more beautiful than I ever imagined. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Andrea Smith, my illustrator. When I first saw her stunning artwork, before I’d even finished my book proposal, I knew it perfectly captured the essence of my book. I’m so thrilled to have her illustrations grace the pages of <em>Scandinavian Gatherings</em>.</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p3">I’m grateful for friends who allowed me to put their recipes in this book: thank you, Tania, Christina, and Marcelle. Thank you to Maria Stordahl Nelson of <em>Pink Patisserie</em> (<a href="http://PinkPatisserie.net">Pink​Patisserie.​net</a>) for being a great source of Scandinavian inspiration. Her blog is full of delicious Scandinavian recipes and beautiful photos. Thanks to Eva Jorgensen of Sycamore Street Press (<a href="http://SycamoreStreetPress.com">Sycamore​StreetPress.​com</a>) for being a longtime friend and a champion of this project.</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p4">I couldn’t have written <em>Scandinavian Gatherings</em> without the help of an army of readers and testers: Caroline, Devon, Veeda, Sara, Amy A., Bre, Hannah, Linda A., Annie, P. J., Amy W., Marcelle, Haeley, Cyd, Amy C., Julie, Kristy, Laurel, Heidi, Brooke, Kim, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page205" title="205"/>M. J., Marlene, Rachel, Sarah, Stephanie, my mother-in-law, my mom, and my sister, Emily. And to Katie H., Katie L., and Linda W., who collectively tested a dozen recipes for me at the last minute as I was scrambling to finish on time, a huge thank-you and a big hug!</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p5">Thanks to everyone who helped watch my kids while I wrote or cooked or made things. I have the most wonderful family and friends, and am constantly humbled by their generosity. Thank you, Mom, Dad, Chaz and family, Holly, Emily and family, Anna, Nana and Poppy—the best family a girl could ask for. I feel truly blessed to have a husband and kids who are always cheering me on, who happily go along with my dreams and schemes, no matter how crazy, and who don’t mind a dining room table covered with skeins of yarn and bottle after bottle after bottle of craft paint. I love you, Speedy, Addie, Ellie, James, and George. To the moon and back.</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p6">And to Poppy, my darling grandpa, who inspired me to write this book in the first place, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
