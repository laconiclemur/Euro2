<p class="nonindent">Trout are cooked and eaten anywhere they’re caught in Spain, in river regions from north to south and east to west. I took one of my favorite Spanish preparations and brought freshness by stuffing the cavity with herbs. They infuse the flesh with their aromas while the ham creates a crunchy porky skin. I originally attempted an American twist by swapping in bacon for the ham, but it doesn’t crisp quite as nicely. By the time the strips cook through, the trout tends to be overcooked. Turns out the original was definitely the way to go.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 whole (12-ounce) trout, gutted and scaled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 lemon wheels</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 rosemary sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 thyme sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 to 4 ounces very thinly sliced ham, Ibérico or Serrano</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons blended oil</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">SEASON THE TROUT INSIDE AND OUT WITH</span> 1 teaspoon salt. Lay the lemon wheels inside in the cavity and top with the rosemary and thyme. Wrap the trout with the ham, overlapping the slices slightly and completely covering the fish and enclosing the lemon and herbs. The stuffed and wrapped trout can be cooked immediately or refrigerated for up to 4 hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the trout and sear until the bottom is nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and sear the other side, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer to a serving plate and let rest for a few minutes. Cut the fillets with the ham off the bone, season to taste, and serve.</p>
