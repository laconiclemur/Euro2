<p class="rec_sub_ttl">Seared Duck Breasts with Armagnac-Blackberry Sauce</p>
<p class="rec_yld">Serves 4</p>
<p class="rec_pf">The name has a fancy ring, but this dish—one of dozens that pair magret with a sweet pan reduction—is as straightforward as can be.</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 skin-on moulard duck breasts (or 4 skin-on Pekin duck breasts)</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 small shallot, minced</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 cup chicken or duck stock</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 <span class="rec_frnum">1</span><span class="rec_frslash">/</span><span class="rec_frnden">2</span> ounces Armagnac</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 <span class="rec_frnum">1</span><span class="rec_frslash">/</span><span class="rec_frnden">2</span> tablespoons blackberry jelly</p>
<p class="rec_ul_blsp"><span class="hide1">                      </span>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Using a small, sharp knife, score the skin of the duck breasts in a crosshatch pattern, taking care not to cut into the meat. Season both sides of the breasts with salt and pepper and set aside for 15 minutes. Pat the meat dry with paper towels and place the breasts, skin side down, in a cold skillet. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook the breasts until most of the fat has rendered out and the skin is golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip the breasts and continue cooking for another 6 to 8 minutes until medium-rare.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">(<i>Note</i>: If using Pekin duck breasts, cook over medium heat instead of medium-low, and reduce the cooking time by 2 minutes per side. Cook in two batches if necessary to prevent crowding the skillet.)</p>
<p class="rec_pf"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_264" title="264"/>Transfer the breasts to a cutting board and tent them with aluminum foil. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet, then add the shallot. Cook over medium heat until soft, about 1 minute. Add the stock, Armagnac, and blackberry jelly and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil and continue boiling until it has reduced by a little more than half and has become lustrous and almost syrupy. Remove the sauce from the heat, swirl in the butter, and season with a little salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Pour the sauce into the bottom of a deep serving platter. Slice the duck breasts and place the slices on top of the sauce.</p>
