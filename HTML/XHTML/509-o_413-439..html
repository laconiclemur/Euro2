			<p class="Normal-noind" style="page-break-before:always;">Many people are happy to finish a meal with cheese, especially if a red wine other than that served with the principal course has been chosen to accompany the cheese platter. For others, a glass or two of a fine Sauternes, unaccompanied, is welcome and sufficient food and drink at the end of a meal. Fresh fruit is a good dessert. In season, fresh strawberries, peaches, or figs (the latter peeled, a cross cut into the upper part of each, pinched open like a baked potato and well chilled), coated with a raspberry purée (fresh or deep-frozen raspberries passed either through a nylon drum sieve with a pastry cook’s <em class="ital">come</em> or plastic disc or through a stainless steel sieve with a wooden pestle and sweetened to taste) are a perfect dessert; peeled fresh almonds may be scattered on top or whipped cream diluted with raspberry purée served on the side. (The acidity may, to some extent, interfere with the perfect analytical appreciation of an accompanying Sauternes). Or one’s glass of red wine filled with fresh strawberries or sliced peaches, sugar-sprinkled, will terminate a meal in beauty.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page414">France produces many dessert wines other than Sauternes; many tend to be flat and flabby in effect—cloying but otherwise destitute of character (this may be true also of generic Sauternes, whose labels indicate no more specific origin). None has the depth or the intricate structure of a Sauternes at its best—the nervous, sensuous, pulsating body whose background of delicately etched bitterness lends relief to and is masked by a complexity of fresh and sun-dried fruit associations and whose sweetness is vibrant. These astounding wines are so consistently pitted against quarrelsome desserts that it is not surprising to see the Sauternais wine growers arising indignantly in a body to condemn their being served at the end of a meal, dictating instead that they assume the role of apéritif or that of companion to foie gras, avocados, fish in sauce, or Roquefort cheese. Celebrated menus of the past are cited to prove that the time-honored placement of a Sauternes is at the head of a menu—and it is true that a Château d’Yquem very often opened the gamut of wines (Champagne inevitably closed it, which, although “brut” was not then fashionable, is compelling enough proof that the taste of our ancestors was not invincible).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Not only is it difficult to ally a Sauternes successfully to a first course, but it is also practically impossible to follow it with a wine, red or white, that will not suffer from its juxtaposition to the penetrating intensity of the Sauternes—nor, for my part, can there be any question of drinking a Sauternes throughout a meal. Few, moreover, would deny that a brut Champagne or other dry white wine is a truer apéritif or appetite sharpener. It seems to me wiser to search out those desserts that best accompany the wines of Sauternes rather than to risk unbalancing a menu by their displacement.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page415">The cellars of our gastronomic temples all harbor great Sauternes from rich vintages—noblesse oblige—but their menus rarely list a single dessert of a discretion designed to flatter or to lend relief to their qualities. Sauternes are best served well iced—colder even than most white wines—and certain hot or tepid desserts will afford an exciting contrast (ices and ice creams will annihilate any wine, as will excessive sweetness; the proximity of chocolate is a disaster; desserts soaked or blazed in distilled alcohols will paralyze the palate). The dessert should be less sweet than the wine itself. The richer the wine, the greater is one’s choice of dessert possibilities. The best recent vintages are 1962, 1967, and 1970; the greatest “living” Sauternes are probably still the fantastic 1921s, but it is possible that the ’67s will develop into near peers. A wine like the admirable Château Filhot, which, although lacking none of the depth and vitality of its more classical neighbors, tends to be somewhat less sweet and lighter of body, may be more difficult to place on a dessert: Hot or tepid apple desserts are among the most perfect of Sauternes companions (baked apples; fritters; sliced apples sautéed in butter, rolled, unsweetened, into <em class="ital">crêpes,</em> arranged in a buttered gratin dish, sprinkled with sugar—heavy cream may first be spooned over—and heated in a hot oven until the sugar is lightly caramelized; half-baked pastry shell lined with butter-stewed sliced apples, a sugared quiche mixture of beaten eggs and heavy cream poured over, baked until swelled and set; or a discreetly sweetened American butter-crust apple pie . . .). Eating pears (slightly underripe, halved, peeled, and cored, simmered for a couple of hours in red wine with sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, and a strip of orange peel, served tepid or cold), fresh figs (peeled, sprinkled with sugar, a film of water in the bottom of the pan, baked for 20 minutes in a hot oven), dried figs (simmered in wine, with or without thyme), peaches (peeled and poached in a red wine and sugar syrup, the poaching liquid radically reduced to serve as a sauce), or the <em class="ital">raisiné,</em> a variety of seasonal fruits stewed in the unfermented must drawn from the newly filled wine vats, which is made in all wine-growing areas at the time of the grape harvest (you can approximate it by boiling up ripe, black-skinned grapes, straining them through a sieve, reducing somewhat with sugar to taste, and simmering sliced apples and pears, whole figs, cubes of pumpkin—quince is often added—or whatever fruits are available, in the juice, stirring regularly to prevent sticking) also serve well. Nutty and, in particular, almond-flavored (but not <em class="ital">pralinés</em>) desserts marry well with Sauternes, as do any of the starchy puddings—bread; rice; noodle or vermicelli; tapioca; semolina . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">With the exception of the melon ice, all of the following recipes will welcome an accompanying Sauternes.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pain des Houris</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Served directly from the oven, this is a soufflé. Tepid, much of the body is lost, but the savors may more easily be appreciated. Cold, it is moist and compact, heavy but delicious.</p>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">Candied peels: 1 tablespoon each slivered strips of orange and lemon peel, parboiled for a few seconds and drained</li>
				<li class="IL">⅓ cup water</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon sugar</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">4 ounces shelled almonds, parboiled for a couple minutes, rubbed between towels, and skinned</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup sugar (plus sugar for sprinkling on the surface)</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup white wine</li>
				<li class="IL">3 eggs, separated</li>
				<li class="IL">Small pinch salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon butter</li>
				<li class="IL"> parboiled for a couple of minutes, rubbed between towels, and skinned</li>
				<li class="IL">2 ounces shelled pistachios, treated as above</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Combine the juliènned, parboiled orange and lemon peels with the sugar and water, bring to a boil, and simmer until the liquid is almost entirely reduced, the peels coated with a thick syrup, but remove from the flame before the sugar begins to caramelize.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pound the almonds and pistachios together in a mortar until well crushed into a coarse purée, add the peels and a bit of sugar, and continue pounding, adding sugar from time to time, until the mixture becomes too stiff to work easily. Continue pounding, alternating additions of white wine and sugar until both are used up. Add the egg yolks and work vigorously, pounding and stirring with the pestle.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Beat the egg whites with the pinch of salt until they stand firmly in peaks, fold a healthy spoonful into the mixture in the mortar, then turn the contents of the mortar into the bowl containing the remaining egg whites, and fold the two gently together.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour into a buttered gratin dish and bake at 375°, the dish immersed by half in a larger pan containing hot water, for about 25 minutes, or until the center of the pudding is firm to the touch.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The ingredients (except for the final incorporation of the beaten whites) may be added progressively to one of the “robot-cutter,” “cuisinarts,” or “magimix” mechanisms with extremely rapid and satisfactory results.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pudding Crème aux Pommes</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">For this and any of the following apple recipes, russet or Canadian apples will be the best choice. They are hard to find; use whatever varieties are available, leaning on the abundant Golden Delicious only as a last resort. Serve tepid, accompanied or not by a <em class="ital">sabayon</em> sauce (½ cup sugar, 3 egg yolks, ⅔ cup white wine, and a bit of grated lemon peel whisked in a small heavy saucepan in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> of nearly boiling water over low flame until thick—the water should not boil).</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 pound apples, quartered, cored,  peeled, sliced</li>
				<li class="IL">Large handful (about 2 ounces) stale breadcrumbs, without crusts</li>
				<li class="IL">About ½ cup butter</li>
				<li class="IL">Pinch powdered cinnamon</li>
				<li class="IL">1 cup milk</li>
				<li class="IL">2 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">⅓ cup sugar</li>
				<li class="IL">Small pinch salt</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Cook the apples in about 3 tablespoons butter, tossing from time to time, until tender and translucid—20 to 30 minutes. Cook the breadcrumbs in the remaining butter (eventually adding more if necessary) over very low heat, stirring regularly, until they are uniformly golden and crisp.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Spread the crumbs in the bottom of a lightly buttered gratin dish, arrange the apples on the bed of crumbs, sprinkle lightly with cinnamon, whisk together the milk, eggs, sugar, and salt, and pour the liquid slowly over the apples so as not to displace them. Bake at 325° for about ½ hour.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pain de Pommes Rapées</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">I am beholden to my sister-in-law, Judith Olney, for this recipe. Serve it hot or warm—not cold—accompanied or not by fresh heavy cream.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 pound apples, quartered, cored,  peeled, coarsely grated or passed through medium or fine blade of Mouli-juliènne</li>
				<li class="IL">About ⅓ cup sugar (in all)</li>
				<li class="IL">Pinch powdered cinnamon</li>
				<li class="IL">4 ounces finely crumbled stale but not dried bread, without crusts</li>
				<li class="IL">¾ cup butter</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Mix the apples with ¼ cup sugar and the cinnamon. Mash the breadcrumbs, 2 or 3 tablespoons sugar, and ½ cup softened butter together with a fork. Melt the remaining ¼ cup butter in a small heavy frying pan and pack the breadcrumb mixture against the bottom and sides with a fork to form an even shell. Fill with the apple mixture, packing with the fork, and cook over a low flame, covered, for about 15 minutes or until the edges of the breadcrumb casing begin to show brown. Finish, uncovered, in the oven (375) another 15 minutes. If the contents of the pan do not slide freely with gentle shaking, loosen the bottom with a spatula before unmolding.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Brouillade aux Pommes</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Serve hot, tepid, or cold, with or without heavy cream.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 pound apples, peeled, quartered, cored, sliced</li>
				<li class="IL">Small pinch salt</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup sugar (plus 2 tablespoons for sprinkling later)</li>
				<li class="IL">3 eggs</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Sprinkle the sliced apples with the sugar, tossing well, and leave, covered, overnight. Beat the eggs and the salt lightly, as for an omelet, and gently stir in the apples. Heat the butter in a heavy frying pan until bubbling, pour in the mixture, and, a few seconds later, transfer to a medium (350°) oven. Stir every 10 or 15 minutes, turning the mixture over in spoonfuls, chopping it with the side of the spoon, and smoothing the surface with the back of the spoon. Count 1 hour in all and, after 45 minutes, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar, turn the oven higher, and if, after 15 minutes, the surface is not sufficiently caramelized, pass for a few seconds beneath a hot broiler.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page420" style="page-break-before:always;">Apple Tart</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Tarte aux Pommes</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">A <em class="ital">pâte sablée</em> or crumbly pastry, cookie-like, is the usual base also for jam tarts, a thin layer of jam replacing the apples in this recipe and a latticework of pastry strips pressed on top for decorative purposes. Any fairly thick pureed jam or fruit “butter” may replace the apricot jam as a glaze in this recipe—I usually use one made of wild plums.</p>
			
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">Sablée pastry</h2>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 cup flour	</li>
				<li class="IL">3 tablespoons sugar</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup softened butter</li>
				<li class="IL">Tiny pinch salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 egg</li>
				</ul>
				
				<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 pound apples	</li>				
				<li class="IL">Sugar (to sprinkle surface of tart)</li>
				<li class="IL">Pureed apricot jam</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Combine the pastry ingredients in a mixing bowl, stirring and mashing with a fork until fairly consistent, then work with fingertips until everything is absorbed in a coherent mass. Transfer to a floured pastry marble or board and knead for a couple of minutes, pushing small sections of the mass against the floured surface and away from yourself with the heel of your hand; gather it together in a ball and begin again—it will, at this point, be soft and sticky; wrap it in plastic or waxed paper and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If using a cookie sheet, butter it lightly. If your oven is fitted with a solid metal plaque, use it, removing it from the oven before heating and lining it with parchment paper or aluminum foil, the surface lightly buttered.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Roll out the dough as rapidly as possible, being certain that it is always lightly coated with flour—it sticks easily. Turn it over two or three times while rolling—the given proportions should form a circular sheet approximately 14 inches in diameter. Fold it and transfer it to the buttered plaque; then spread it out. It is extremely fragile; if it should tear, don’t worry—patch it up. Roll the edges up to form a border, pressing all around with the tines of a fork.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page421">Halve the apples, core them and peel them (don’t do it ahead of time—they will turn brown). Slice each half crosswise into ⅛- to ¼-inch thicknesses and arrange the slices, starting just inside the border of the pastry, in concentric circles, slices overlapping and circles overlapping. Sprinkle the surface with sugar and bake in a 350° oven for about 1 hour, checking progress regularly after 45 minutes. Paint the surface of the apple slices with the pureed jam, using a pastry brush—or simply dribble it around with a teaspoon, smearing it regularly over the surface of each apple slice with the back of the spoon. Slip the tart onto a large flat, round platter; serve hot, tepid, or cold.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pudding au Pain</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">3 ounces stale but not dry bread  without crusts</li>

			<p class="Normal">Put the breadcrumbs to soak with the milk in a mixing bowl, add the sugar, Kirsch, pistachios, and egg yolks, combining thoroughly, beat the egg whites until they stand in peaks, fold them in gently, pour into a liberally buttered gratin dish and bake at 400° to 450° for from 25 to 30 minutes or until swelled, browned, and firm in the center. Serve directly from the oven. A <a href="o_413-439.xhtml#page417"><em class="ital">sabayon</em> sauce</a> is probably the best accompaniment; apricot sauce or <em class="ital">crème Anglaise</em> are also possibilities.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">These proportions will fill four small individual ramekins—small portions, but it is a rich essence. It is good accompanied by heavy cream. Serve at the same time simple butter cookies, <em class="ital">tuiles,</em> palm fans (puff pastry sprinkled with sugar, rolled up from opposite edges to meet, sliced crosswise, and baked), <em class="ital">pets de nonnes,</em> etc.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 cup freshly ground coffee	</li>

				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Stir together the coffee and 1 cup of milk in a saucepan over medium flame until a full boil is reached, remove from the heat, and leave to infuse until tepid. Strain through a sieve lined with a cloth, pressing and twisting the cloth to extract as much milk as possible.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Boil the 2 tablespoons sugar with 1 tablespoon water in a tiny saucepan, watching carefully—after the slurry boiling stage is passed, the sugar begins, first imperceptibly and then very rapidly to color. Remove from the heat the moment the right, rich, but not dark caramel color appears, pour in 2 or 3 tablespoons water and dissolve the caramel, stirring and returning to the heat for a few moments, if necessary.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Combine all the ingredients, whisk thoroughly, and cook in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> on top of the stove, the water kept just below the boiling point—or, if you are using a heavy copper saucepan, the custard may be cooked directly over a tiny flame. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon and remove from the heat as soon as the mixture is the consistency of a heavy sauce, coating the spoon easily—it must not approach the boiling point. Pour into ramekins or into a single deep serving dish and chill.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and cook at a simmer, covered, for about 1 hour, turning the figs over from time to time in their liquid if not completely covered. Remove the figs to a serving dish, discard the thyme, and reduce the cooking liquid over a high flame by about one third—or to the consistency of a light syrup—and pour over the figs. Good either tepid or chilled. Serve a dry cookie-like thing on the side.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Buy more melons than you need and taste them before using them —flavorless melons will make a flavorless sherbet. If they are of a size that half shells will contain the right quantity for individual servings, cut them in two—if larger, lift off a lid as for a jack-o’-lantern to empty them, serving from the shells into sherbet glasses. In Europe, tiny melons no more than 2½ to 3 inches in diameter are perfect for individual servings; I have never seen such small versions of the American cantaloupe or muskmelon. If you have large enough deep-freezing facilities, deep freeze the shells, otherwise chill them thoroughly.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Boil the sugar and water together and leave to thoroughly cool before mixing it with the melon purée (sieved), lemon juice, and Champagne. Freeze in ice-cube trays, loosening the mixture from the sides and stirring from time to time, as it freezes. Best start it several hours ahead of time. Just before serving, turn it into an iced bowl, working it a bit with a fork if too firm—it should be just slightly mushy. Rinse out the frozen or chilled melon shells with the Cognac, pour it into the ice, mix, and then fill the shells with the ice.</p>

Beat the egg white and the white wine together in a large mixing bowl, pour in slowly the other mixture, whisking all the while, pour back into the saucepan, bring to a boil, still whisking, and leave at a simmer, whisking from time to time, for about 15 minutes. Strain through a tightly woven cloth (dish towel, section of sheet . . .) lining a sieve.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page426">Combine the milk, sugar, salt, orange peel, and butter in a saucepan, bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and leave to steep until tepid. Discard the orange peel, add the parboiled rice, return to a boil, and leave, covered, over very low heat (or in a slow oven), without disturbing it, for ½ hour. The milk should be completely absorbed; should any remain, strain it off and discard it. Stir in the egg yolk and leave the rice until nearly cool. Stir in the orange juice and the cup of gelatin.</p>

Tap the bottom smartly against the tabletop a couple of times to settle the contents and refrigerate for 5 or 6 hours—or overnight.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The receptacle chosen to serve as a pie dish should be of a heavy material and able to support the heat of a direct flame. It should be deeper than the ordinary American pie dish in order to contain a sufficient quantity of wine during the first part of the cooking process. A frying pan is perfect if your oven is large enough to take the handle; the lid to a large <em class="ital">pommes Anna</em> mold, a <em class="ital">tarte tatin</em> mold, or a round, enameled ironware gratin dish will serve equally well. The proportions given here are for an approximate 10-inch mold.</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">The dessert may be served hot, tepid, or cold but should, in any case, be unmolded only just before serving to prevent the pastry’s being soaked in the cooking juices.</p>

				
				<ul class="IL-LIST" id="page427">				
				<li class="IL">7 firm, slightly underripe  eating pears, split in half, cored, and peeled</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup sugar</li>

				<li class="IL"><a href="l_261-278.xhtml#page261c">Short pastry (pâte brisée)</a></li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Arrange pear halves in the pan, cored surface facing up, the wide end of each pressed against the side of the pan, the elongated tips pointing in toward the center of the pan so that the ungarnished areas form a fairly symmetrical star shape. Split the remaining pear halves and fill the empty spaces, slender tips pointing out, wide ends meeting in the center so that, when unmolded, the body of pears will form a neat geometric pattern.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sprinkle over the sugar and the cinnamon, pour over red wine to cover, bring to a boil, and cook, covered, at a simmer, for from 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes or until the pears are tender, lending no resistance to the tip of a sharp knife, but still firmly intact. Drain all the liquid into a saucepan, holding a lid firmly against the pears’ surface so as not to displace them. Reduce the cooking liquid over a high flame, stirring from time to time, until only about ½ cup remains, the boil having arrived at the cottony, puffy, slurry stage, the liquid a consistent syrup. Dribble the syrup regularly over the pears’ surface.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Roll out a round of pastry; prick it 4 or 5 times with a knife tip; it may be cut to the exact inside dimensions of the pan or rolled out slightly larger, the edges rolled up and crimped either with the floured side of your thumb or with fork tines and laid gently upside down over the pears. Bake in a 375° to 400° oven for about 40 minutes or until the pastry is golden and crisp. Unmold with care—if a frying pan has been used, the handle will prevent its being unmolded onto the center of the platter; place the platter upside down over the pan, its edge pressed to the handle’s point of attachment, turn everything over at once and ease the tart into the middle of the platter. The pears often spread slightly in the unmolding—push them gently into place, pressing all around the outside with the back of a tablespoon or a spatula.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pets de Nonne</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">about <span class="oldstyle">40</span> fritters</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">In pre-nineteenth-century cookbooks, these little fritters are called <em class="ital">pets de putain.</em> I have been unable to pinpoint the moment—certainly early—during the nineteenth century at which, with a somewhat irreverent insouciance, they were distinguished by the more respectable title of <em class="ital">pets de nonne,</em> the largest of the lot being attributed, traditionally, to the Mother Superior.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The mixture is an ordinary <em class="ital">pâte à choux,</em> the same that, baked in various forms, is transformed into <em class="ital">éclairs, profiterolles, gateau St.-Honoré,</em> etc. One of its more attractive forms is that of the Burgundian <em class="ital">gougère</em> (3 ounces Gruyère cut into tiny cubes replacing the sugar and grated peel of this recipe; dabs arranged in a circle with a spoon or pastry bag, the crown sprinkled with more Gruyère cubes, and the batter baked at 400° for about 40 minutes, pierced regularly with a knife tip after ½ hour to permit the interior to dry out).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Both the drying of the paste over the fire and the incorporation of the eggs is tiring arm work. If, after the mixture begins to achieve a certain consistency, the handle of the wooden spoon, standing vertically, is grasped in one’s fist, forearm held horizontally in relation to the spoon handle, the movement coming from one’s shoulder as one stirs firmly, rhythmically in a circle, the forearm will suffer less from fatigue.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">

				<li class="IL">½ tablespoon sugar</li>

				<li class="IL">1 teaspoon (loosely filled) grated lemon rind</li>
				<li class="IL">1 cup (instant-blending type) flour</li>
				<li class="IL">4 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">Olive oil (or other vegetable oil) for frying</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Combine the water, butter, sugar, salt, and lemon rind in a saucepan, bring slowly to a boil, and, as soon as the butter is completely melted, remove from the heat. Add the flour all at once, stirring, first carefully, then, as the mixture pulls itself together, vigorously. Return to the heat and continue to stir, roughly and rhythmically, for 3 or 4 minutes or until the mass clings persistently together, leaving the bottom and sides of the saucepan clean, and its surface assumes a sweaty, shiny aspect. Remove from the heat and, forming each time a well in the center, add the eggs, one at a time, stirring each time until the mixture begins to unify and then beating vigorously.</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page429">	A skillet or a large omelet pan, filled two thirds full with oil, is deep enough for frying. If using a deep fryer, don’t use the basket; a large, round, flat, wire skimming spoon <em class="ital">(araignée)</em> is the most practical for removing the fritters from the fat; lacking that, use a slotted skimming spoon. The oil should sizzle when a bit of batter is dropped in, but it should not be too hot—the fritters need to cook long enough so that exterior coloration coincides with their interior drying out. Don’t overcrowd the pan—fritters swell to about four times the size of the raw dab of dough. Drop in teaspoonsful, dipping the spoon into the hot fat each time before spooning up the dough. Roll them over in the oil with a nudge of the teaspoon tip to encourage even coloring. Drain on absorbent paper and sprinkle with sugar or with confectioners’ sugar.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page430">The Thirteen Provençal Christmas Desserts <span class="French-translation">(Les Treize Desserts du Gros Souper)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The Parisian Christmas Eve <em class="ital">réveillon</em> differs little in spirit from the New Year’s <em class="ital">réveillon.</em> It is a public and mundane celebration that, for those who respect the tradition of the midnight mass, does not begin until afterward. Restaurants are booked far in advance, and oysters, Champagne, foie gras, truffles, roast turkey, and <em class="ital">bûche de Noël</em> usually mingle among the elements of the menu (the <em class="ital">bûche,</em> most often a construction of <em class="ital">Génoise</em> and variously flavored butter creams, is characterized by a log-like form and excessive sweetness; its principal virtue lies in the fidelity with which creams, chocolate curls, and meringues simulate wood grains, bark, and mushrooms).</p>
			<p class="Normal">The ritual, pre-midnight mass, Christmas Eve supper in Provence is strictly a family affair. A certain flexibility of detail exists within its nonetheless rigid form: Garlic soup <em class="ital">(aïgo bouido)</em> may or may not preface the meal, followed by or replaced by either <em class="ital">petits-gris</em> (a variety similar to but smaller than the huge Burgundy snails that are tinned and exported—they are first starved for a few days, bathed in salt and vinegar, well washed, and cooked for 2 or 3 hours in a heavily fennel-flavored white wine court bouillon) and <em class="ital">aïoli</em> or crisp celery hearts and <em class="ital">anchoiade</em> (a thick vinaigrette whose body derives from pounded garlic and anchovy filets); salt cod and its alternative <em class="ital">raito</em> or <em class="ital">capilotade</em> sauces, although traditional, are sometimes dethroned by other fish and other sauces (an octopus <em class="ital">daube,</em> for instance, which takes the quaint appellation of <em class="ital">tripes de mer,</em> or “sea tripe”); gratins of spinach and hard-boiled eggs, creamed chard ribs, or salsify are common follow-ups, but any winter vegetable preparation may supplant or supplement them. Each element seems to have been deliberately chosen for its humble and homely character, and the intention becomes flagrantly evident when one examines the lavish-sounding thirteen desserts: They are chosen from among seasonal fresh fruits (oranges, tangerines, pears, apples, bananas), sun-dried fruits (figs, raisins, dates), nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts), candied chestnuts, candied almonds, candied fruits, almond and honey nougatines, sometimes a local pastry (spinach tart, for instance—parboiled, squeezed, and finely chopped spinach, sautéed with olive oil or butter, liberally sugared, flavored with grated lemon peel, and baked in a Provençal olive-oil crust, a butter short crust, or a <em class="ital">pâte sablée</em> with a pastry latticework atop), and the immutable <em class="ital">pompe à l’huile</em> with its accompanying homemade sweet wine <em class="ital">(vin cuit),</em> so useful for dunking (<em class="ital">pompes</em> garnish all Provençal tables on Christmas Eve and have apparently done so for many centuries). The meal is an homage to the fruits of nature—a Provençal Thanksgiving.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page431" style="page-break-before:always;">Provençal Christmas Cakes</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pompe à l’Huile, Pompe de Noël, Gibassier, Fouace</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">about <span class="oldstyle">12</span>, each <span class="oldstyle">4</span> inches in diameter</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Home baking is not one of the French vices; baking, it is felt, is what bakers and pastry cooks are made for. The Provençaux carry that attitude to an extreme—and they think of pastry, moreover, as being for children; the adults eat it, for the most part, only on religious holidays, tradition having assigned a different pastry to each. Few housewives have ever prepared <em class="ital">pompes</em> in their kitchens, and published recipes tend to be largely folklorique galimatias. For all practical purposes of description, they are flat cakes made of sweetened bread dough that has been enriched by the addition of olive oil; it is probable that the addition of egg to the dough is a fairly recent amelioration and it is certain that a larger proportion of sugar than that recommended in the following recipe often goes into their confection (orange blossom water, which stamps many Provençal pastries with a vague, sickly memory of stale and faded perfume, usually is added to a <em class="ital">pompe</em> dough, as well). The <em class="ital">pompes</em> sold in the village bakeries tend to be hard, tough, greasy, and heavily anise-flavored.</p>
			<p class="Normal">When shorn of ritual and symbolic glory—and when homemade—they are pleasant tea biscuits or a perfect accompaniment to stewed fruits, fresh fruits macerated in wine or ices; I find them innocent to the point of being innocuous (although I enjoy dunking them in my morning coffee), but friends and neighbors never fail to wax enthusiastic when offered them.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page432">The Niçoise <em class="ital">fougassette</em> is made in the same way—about ⅛ teaspoon saffron is usually stirred into the flour before preparing the dough and sometimes fragments of candied fruits are pressed into the surface of the little breads at the same time that their surfaces are slit with the razor blade.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Pompes</em> are sometimes called <em class="ital">fouaces,</em> but the term or one of its variations <em class="ital">(fougasse, fougace),</em> depending on the region, is more widely used outside of Provence to describe a similar <em class="ital">galette</em>—country cousin and undoubted ancestor of the elegant <em class="ital">brioche,</em> whose only difference is in the substitution of softened butter for olive oil in the dough; like <em class="ital">fougassettes, fouaces</em> are often saffron-flavored.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Pompes</em> are traditionally cut into large rounds of from 6 to 7 inches in diameter; a 4-inch diameter seems to me to produce a more attractive article of a more practical size.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The French equivalent of American “instant-blending” flour has been used for testing proportions—a bit more in terms of volume may be required of other flours.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">½ ounce compressed yeast (or 1 tablespoon dried yeast)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon sugar</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup tepid water</li>
				<li class="IL">About 3 cups instant-blending flour (just under 1 pound)</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup brown sugar</li>
				<li class="IL">2 teaspoons grated lemon peel</li>
				<li class="IL">1 egg</li>

			<p class="Normal">Add the tepid water to the yeast and sugar (first mashing the yeast and sugar together with a fork if the yeast is compressed) and leave in a warm place to ferment for 15 minutes or so.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Put the flour in a mixing bowl, make a well in the center, add all the other ingredients, including the yeast-water mixture, stir with a fork, working from the center gradually outward, until thoroughly mixed, then transfer to a floured board and knead well, eventually picking up the mass and heaving it back against the board repeatedly in between kneadings. When the dough is elastic and no longer sticky, form it into a ball, return it to the mixing bowl, and leave, covered with a towel, in a warm place for a couple of hours or until the volume has nearly doubled. Turn it out onto the floured board, punch it down, and knead lightly (not too much or it will not want to be rolled out), then flatten as much as possible with the palm of your hand, turning repeatedly to keep both surfaces floured, and roll out to a thickness of from ¼ to ⅓ inch. Use a large, opened tin can or an overturned bowl to cut out rounds, transferring them to a flat baking sheet (or foil-lined oven plaque). Gather the scraps into a ball and roll them out again—or simply flatten them into another <em class="ital">pompe</em> with your hand. Slit the surface of each with a razor blade, forming a crisscross design—two slits each way if the <em class="ital">pompe</em> measures about 4 inches in diameter. Leave, covered with a towel, in a warm place to rise for another hour or so; they will rise but slightly (by about one third). Bake at about 400° for 20 minutes or until a rich deep brown and crusty. Slip onto a pastry grill to cool.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Gâteau des Rois</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">6</span> to <span class="oldstyle">10</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The ritual of the thing—and the accompanying wine—may be more amusing than the pastry itself. The <em class="ital">gâteau des Rois</em> in the Parisian region—and, generally, in northern France—is a simple <em class="ital">galette</em> of puff pastry, the surface crisscrossed with a knife tip and painted with egg before being baked; sometimes it is a confection, less fanciful in form but resembling in composition a <em class="ital">Pithiviers,</em> of sweet, buttered, and lightly egg-bound almond paste, spread between plate-sized rounds of puff paste. Throughout the southern half of France, it is a ring of leavened pastry, brioche-like, whose composition varies greatly from one region to another and from one baker to another: The dough may be less richly endowed with butter and eggs; a heavy, sweet syrup in which grated orange and lemon peel have been cooked is often added as well as a liqueur of some sort (or some orange blossom water); a variety of candied fruits, citrus dominating, may join or replace the cherries. A <em class="ital">gâteau des Rois</em> contains either a dried bean or a small porcelain or plastic trinket (known, in any case, as <em class="ital">la fève,</em> or broad bean) and the person whose portion of pastry contains it is crowned king or queen for the evening.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page434">A celebration of the Epiphany (although scholars suggest that its origins may be pagan), its sacred significance has long been tenuous; the devout during the seventeenth century abominated the tradition of the <em class="ital">gâteau des Rois</em> because of the excessive debauchery to which it led. Prosper-Montagné cites a tract from the period whose tone suggests that the author may have been a temperance leader:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-noind">Large groups gather (on the Twelfth-Night) to elect a king; he chooses his cabinet members and then the celebration begins, continuing for days with the festivities multiplying until all purses are empty and the creditors arrive.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The sons hasten to imitate the example; they elect their king also and organize elaborate banquets either with stolen money or at their parents’ expense, the better to school themselves in the ways both of luxury and of larceny.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">Nowadays the game is an innocent excuse for friends to gather together and drink a couple of bottles of Champagne; it is apparently still great fun, for hardly is everyone recovered from celebrating the advent of the New Year than people begin gathering to <em class="ital">tirer les Rois</em> and it goes on throughout the month of January, the person crowned being designated as the next to receive; quite distinguished company is apt to turn loud and bawdy in the joyous atmosphere. (If you want to play the game, you will need, in addition to the ingredients listed, a gilt, cardboard crown . . .)</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is as well not to attempt the following preparation during the hot summer months. Use, if possible, a marble slab for kneading and forming the pastry and a flexible, plastic pastry cook’s <em class="ital">corne</em> for scraping. I have used “instant-blending” flour in this recipe (not because I prefer it for this kind of recipe, but because it more nearly resembles its American equivalent than ordinary pastry flour); it weighs about ⅔ ounce more per cup than regular flour—if weighing instead of measuring, count 12 ounces flour, in all.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Add tepid water to the yeast and sugar (first mashing them together if using compressed yeast), leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to ferment, and stir the flour in, progressively, until the dough is only just stiff enough to handle—a bit less firm than ordinary bread dough. Scrape out onto a lightly floured marble and knead for about 10 minutes, pushing sections of the dough repeatedly away from yourself with the heel of your hand. Scrape your hand clean, form the dough into a ball, lightly floured so that it will not stick to your hand, and heave it, repeatedly and mercilessly, against the marble. Form it again into a ball, lightly floured, return it to the mixing bowl, and leave, covered with a tea towel, in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in volume.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Stir the eggs and the ¼ cup butter into the salted flour and beat, either with an electric mixer or with a wooden spoon, for a long time—until the batter is elastic, the surface glistening and slippery in aspect.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page436">Combine the dough and the batter in the largest of the mixing bowls, mix loosely at first, until the dough no longer resists, and then stir in a wide circle with a wooden spoon, held vertically, grasped firmly in your fist, forearm held at a right angle to the spoon handle, the motion directed from the shoulder, until completely unified. Add the cup of butter, either pinched into small fragments or squeezed repeatedly through your fingers (approximately 1-ounce chunks at a time) to soften it and disperse it to the point of being readily absorbable. Mix, as before, but only until the butter is completely absorbed.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Scrape the dough down from the sides of the mixing bowl, cover with a plate, and leave at room temperature—68° to 70°—for about 5 hours, away from drafts (the bowl may be placed in the middle of a bed, the corners and edges of a heavy blanket lifted loosely up and over it). Scrape the dough loose from the sides and beat it until reduced to its original, unleavened volume. Leave, covered, long enough to begin rising again—½ hour or so—and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The following day, turn the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured marble, scraping it free from the bottom of the bowl, flip it over to flour all surfaces, flatten slightly, press the bean and all but a dozen of the cherries into the surface, and roll the mass in such a way as to enclose the garnish, forming it rapidly, partly by rolling and partly by molding with your hands, into a sausage something over 2 feet long, the ends slightly tapered. Shape in a circle, twisting the ends lightly around each other to simulate a simple knot, and transfer, lifting the ring rapidly with both hands, to a thinly buttered pastry plaque placed beside the marble. Re-form it neatly, embed the remaining cherries in the surface, and leave in a slightly warm corner of the kitchen, covered with a tea towel, for about 2 hours or until approximately doubled in volume. Paint all exposed surfaces with the beaten egg-yolk mixture, sprinkle lightly with sugar, and bake for 40 minutes, starting in a 450° oven that is then turned down to 400°. Turn it around after 25 minutes or so if not coloring evenly (or, if coloring too rapidly, lay a sheet of aluminum foil lightly over the surface—it should, however, be a rich, deep, burnished golden brown when cooked). Slip onto a pastry grill to cool—or partly cool (it is best eaten freshly baked and, preferably, warm).</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Wonderful desserts can be made with <em class="ital">crêpes;</em> their greatest pitfalls derive, no doubt, from their versatility—not in itself a fault, but a quality that teases many a cook into overstepping the boundaries of sense and taste. One should never lose sight of the fragile and delicate, thin, tender thing that is the <em class="ital">crêpe</em> itself. How, transformed into a dribbling, spongy sop for a complicated cocktail of alcohols, can the little <em class="ital">crêpe</em> be good ?</p>
			<p class="Normal">A good preparation is that of <em class="ital">crêpes</em> lightly spread with a sugar and butter <em class="ital">pommade</em> into which has been incorporated either a fruit juice or purée and a small amount of a liqueur or brandy whose flavor is particularly compatible with that of the chosen fruit (pineapple-Kirsch, banana-rum, hazelnut-Cognac, and tangerine-Curaçao are classic examples; the chosen liqueur or brandy replaces the Cognac in the preparation of the <em class="ital">crêpes</em> also). The <em class="ital">crêpes</em> are folded in four and reheated (arranged slightly overlapping in a buttered gratin dish, brushed with butter, sprinkled lightly with sugar and a few drops of the same liqueur as that of the <em class="ital">pommade,</em> and put for a few minutes in a very hot oven). <em class="ital">Crêpes Suzette</em> (although more incendiary crimes have been committed in Suzette’s name than in any other) are a case in point (tangerine juice is used, in part, for moistening the <em class="ital">crêpe</em> batter, Curaçao replaces the Cognac, and the <em class="ital">pommade</em> is flavored with tangerine juice and Curaçao). The following recipe is in a similar spirit; the herbal aura is quite unusual, thyme lending support to the famous secret formula, and, to me, it is particularly attractive in a dessert; a fine Sauternes, well chilled, marries excitingly with it.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page438">Apart from the color, green Chartreuse varies from yellow Chartreuse in that it is less sweet and it contains a higher concentration of herbal infusion and a higher degree of alcohol; for all those reasons, I prefer it to the yellow. Whether green or yellow, the aged product labeled “VEP” is much more interesting.</p>

				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">½ cup sugar	</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons butter</li>
				<li class="IL">Small pinch salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 egg</li>
				<li class="IL">1 cup flour</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Cream the sugar, salt, and butter together with the back of a wooden spoon until of a regular, crumbly consistency, beat in the egg, and gradually stir in the flour. Knead slightly on a lightly floured board or marble until consistent. Roll walnut-size lumps on board or between the palms of your hands into tapered sausage shapes, place on a lightly buttered flat baking sheet, and slit the length of each sausage shape to about ¼ or ⅓ its depth with the tip of a sharp knife. Leave, covered with a towel, in a warm place for 1 or 2 hours and bake at 350° for about 25 minutes or slightly less, depending on the oven.</p>
