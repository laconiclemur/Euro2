<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I started making this fennel as a way to use leftover orange juice from breakfast. The orange mixture can be used for all sorts of things, including dressing raw, sliced cabbage, or poaching fish. Serve this fennel as a first course before a large meal, or as a side dish alongside Roast Chicken (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-202">here</a>) or crispy legs of Duck Confit (<a href="chapter005i-2.xhtml#page-140">here</a>).</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 large orange</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons honey, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small garlic clove, finely minced or puréed on a Microplane grater</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small dried red chili, or a pinch of red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 fennel bulbs, green stems and fronds removed and reserved for another use</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 450°F.</p>
<p>Using a vegetable peeler, remove 3 large strips of zest from the orange and place them into a small saucepan. Set a small sieve over the saucepan. Cut the orange in half and juice it directly into the saucepan through the sieve to catch the seeds and pulp, then discard them. Add the vinegar, honey, salt, garlic, and chili to the orange juice. Stir to combine all of the ingredients and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and allow the orange mixture to simmer until just beginning to thicken ever so slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, taste for seasoning, and add more salt, honey, or vinegar if you think it needs it. Set the mixture aside.</p>
<p>Cut each fennel bulb in half lengthwise and place the halves, cut side down, in a roasting dish or a skillet, anything that will hold them in an even layer and that can go into the oven. Drizzle with the olive oil and pour over the reserved orange mixture. Tightly cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil and roast in the oven until the fennel is tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Transfer the fennel to a serving dish that has a bit of a lip, and pour over the cooking juices.</p>
<p>Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
