<p class="nonindent">When coming up with a winter salad for Cúrate’s menu, I turned to a Spanish classic that combines endive with blue cheese and walnuts. To accentuate the nuts, I candy them and make a vinaigrette using roasted walnut oil. (If you can’t find roasted walnut oil, you can substitute roasted almond oil. Just be sure the oil is labeled as roasted; otherwise, the flavor doesn’t come through.) I had to toss in some pomegranate seeds because they’re among my favorite winter fruits; they offer a bright, sweet pop when few other fresh fruits are in season. Also, each of my salads needs something fruity, juicy, and tart to go with my other must-haves: a little crispness and some bitterness, sweetness, and nuttiness.</p>
<p class="head1"><strong>CANDIED WALNUTS</strong></p>
<div class="side1">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup walnut halves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="head1"><strong>WALNUT VINAIGRETTE</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons minced shallot</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons champagne vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup roasted walnut oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="head1"><strong>ENDIVE SALAD</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 heads Belgian endive, trimmed, leaves separated</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 (5-ounce) package mixed greens</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup crumbled blue cheese, preferably Spanish, such as Valdeón</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Seeds of 1 small pomegranate</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE CANDIED WALNUTS, LINE A HALF-SHEET</span> pan with parchment paper. Heat the walnuts, sugar, butter, and salt in a small nonstick skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, with a silicone spatula. The sugar will melt and begin to caramelize. Once it is a deep amber and just barely beginning to smoke, about 5 minutes, remove the skillet from the heat and immediately scrape the walnut mixture onto the prepared pan. Carefully spread the nuts in a single layer on the pan and cool completely. When cool, coarsely chop into ¼-inch pieces.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette. Whisk the shallot and vinegar in a large bowl. Slowly pour in the oil in a steady stream while whisking constantly. Whisk in the salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To assemble the salad, add the endive, greens, blue cheese, pomegranate seeds, and candied walnuts to the bowl with the dressing. Gently toss until everything is evenly coated. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>TIP:</strong> The best way to get pomegranate seeds out of the fruit is to score a line all the way around its equator, cutting through the skin but not beyond. Use your fingers to pry the halves apart to ensure all the seeds remain intact. Hold a half cut side down in your palm over a bowl and whack the back of the half with a wooden spoon. This act of violence will send the seeds into the bowl below with very little membrane. If any membrane bits fall in, simply pick them out. Repeat with the other half.</p>
