<p class="nonindent">Most of the horchata in the U.S. has its origins in Latin America, where it’s made with rice or seeds. In Valencia, it starts with chufa nuts, also known as tiger nuts, which are actually tiny, starchy dried tubers related to water chestnuts. They have a nutty sweetness similar to almonds and the process of turning them into a drink actually resembles that of making almond milk. Chufa nuts are easy to find online and in health food stores and, increasingly, everywhere since they’re being touted as the next super food. I don’t know about all that, but I do know they’re delicious.</p>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, the milk is sweetened, but it tastes good even without sugar. I’ve started with a minimal amount of simple syrup; you can add more if you’d like. In the summer, the chilled drink is extremely refreshing. In the winter, it’s wonderful as a stand in for eggnog. It shares a creamy richness, but is much lighter.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 cups chufa nuts (tiger nuts)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅓ cup Simple Syrup (<a href="sec98.xhtml#page269">here</a>) plus more to taste</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">COVER THE CHUFA NUTS WITH COLD WATER BY</span> 2 inches in an airtight container. Refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a 1-quart liquid measuring cup; reserve the nuts. Add water, if needed, for 4 cups total liquid. Pour the liquid into a blender and add the nuts. Puree on high speed until very, very smooth.</p>
<p class="indent">Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve in batches, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Pour the mixture through the sieve two more times, but don’t press on any remaining solids. Stir in the simple syrup and add more to taste if you’d like.</p>
<p class="indent">Serve immediately over ice or refrigerate in an airtight container until very cold.</p>
<p class="nonindent">The horchata can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Shake or stir before serving.</p>
