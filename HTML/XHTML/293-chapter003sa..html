<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Fried “in the Jewish style,” these artichokes are said to have originated in the Jewish section of Rome. It’s worth going to the trouble of thoroughly cleaning the artichokes as I’ve outlined below. This double-fry method, often employed in French fry making, ensures that you’ll have artichokes that are both crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">8 small artichokes</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 lemon, cut into wedges</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Working with one</strong> artichoke at a time, hold on to the stem of the artichoke and remove the dark green outer leaves, one by one, to reveal the tender yellow leaves. Turn the artichoke around and, while holding on to the yellow leaves, use a potato peeler to clean away the tough, dark green skin from the stem. Using a teaspoon, dig down to remove the choke, found deep inside the flower between the leaves and at the base of the stem. Be careful not to scoop away the heart, just scratch the choke loose. Set the cleaned artichokes aside.</p>
<p>Heat 3 inches of olive oil in a deep, heavy pot over medium-low heat until it reaches 230°F on a candy thermometer, which is to say hot, but not terribly hot. To test the temperature without a thermometer, place one artichoke in the oil. Small bubbles should gently form around it. If the oil bubbles vigorously, reduce the heat. Place all of the cleaned artichokes into the oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender and barely beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the artichokes to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let the artichokes cool to room temperature. This waiting period is crucial because the steam formed in the covered bowl will continue to cook the artichokes and guarantee that they’re tender all the way through.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, turn the heat up under the oil until the temperature rises to 375°F. Return the artichokes to the pot and cook, turning a few times, until crisp and golden brown all over, about 4 minutes. Transfer the artichokes to a paper towel–lined plate, season with salt, and serve immediately with the lemon wedges.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This classic Roman dish (braised artichokes) creates not only delicious, tender artichokes but also a gorgeous elixir of a broth. Good bread is essential when eating these so that you have something to sop up all of the incredible juice. These artichokes are as good cold as they are warm, so feel free to make them ahead, or for a party.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup packed fresh mint leaves</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 high-quality anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingredient">8 medium artichokes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 375°F.</p>
<p>Chop the garlic, mint, and anchovies together by hand or in a food processor until the mixture resembles a coarse pesto. Set the mixture aside.</p>
<p>Working with one artichoke at a time, hold on to the stem of the artichoke and remove and discard the dark green outer leaves, one by one, until only the tightly packed, pale green and yellow leaves are left. Then, holding each artichoke by the leaves, use a paring knife or a potato peeler to clean away the tough dark green skin from the stem. Trim off and discard the top inch or so of the artichoke and use a teaspoon to dig through the leaves and scoop out the thorny, bristly choke at the base of the vegetable. Be sure not to remove any of the beloved heart! Repeat the process with each artichoke.</p>
<p>In a baking dish or skillet large enough to hold all of the artichokes in a single layer, rub the mint mixture all over the artichokes. Pour the wine and olive oil over the artichokes and season generously with salt. Cover the dish or skillet with a lid or aluminum foil and place it in the oven. Roast, uncovering the dish to turn the artichokes every so often, until they are tender, about 1 hour. Serve warm or chilled, in the cooking juices.</p></div>
