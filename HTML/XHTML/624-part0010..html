<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec01"><a id="page_162"></a>Plum, rum &#38; raisin conserve</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is my most favourite conserve of all times. It&#8217;s for those rare quiet afternoons (parents of toddlers would understand) when you sit down in your kitchen for a minute (instead of tidying the house, sod it), read a book or a magazine and lather your toast in butter and this lusciousness. It has a slight but irresistible sour tang and a head-spinning vanilla kick. Who needs chocolate when you have rummy plums? This is ideal as a Christmas gift and is also amazing to use as an alternative to mincemeat in your mince pies.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 450g (&#190; pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) sultanas</p>

<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Soak the sultanas in the rum overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Dilute the sugar, honey and the rind and juice of both the orange and lemon with the measurement water in a heavy-based saucepan and slowly bring everything to the boil.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec02"><a id="page_165"></a>Watermelon skin jam</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">The Kherson region of Ukraine where I am from is watermelon country, and it&#8217;s where half the country&#8217;s crop is cultivated (they love the heat). Kris, the photographer, said after seeing them that he could never look at a watermelon in the UK the same way again. During watermelon season in August, there are big trucks by the side of the road full of the huge, firm, stripy beasts. We do unbelievable things to watermelons. We even (yes, you&#8217;ve guessed it) ferment them with salt. Whole. In barrels. I thought that might be too much for an introductory Eastern European cookbook though, so here is some slightly less scary watermelon skin jam &#8211; for those who really hate waste and love jams. I add limes to mine, as I like the kick of acidity and bitterness they give, but you can leave them out if you prefer.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 2 x 450ml (&#190; pint) jars</strong></p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) watermelon skin, tough thin green rind peeled and discarded, white skin chopped</p>
<p class="hang">300g (10oz) golden caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang1">4 limes, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Mix all the ingredients together in a container, cover with clingfilm and leave in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Cook the mixture in a non-reactive saucepan over a low heat, making sure the sugar melts before it boils, for 50 minutes or until the watermelon skin turns translucent.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pour into 2 warm sterilized 450ml (&#190; pint) jars, seal and let it cool. Store in the refrigerator. It should keep unopened for several months.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec03"><a id="page_167"></a>Raspberry conserve</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">July was the month of head-spinning smells emanating from the summer kitchen. My favourite was when raspberry compote was made. Mum would collect what some may call &#8216;scum&#8217; but what I call &#8216;delicious jam foam&#8217; and give it to us as a treat &#8211; the foaminess is just the air bubbles trapped in sugar syrup after all. Mum used to put a little bit of this jam into my tea when I was ill, and there is nothing more delicious and comforting. You can add some orange rind and juice to the raspberries while they cook if you wish.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">650g (1lb 5oz) raspberries</p>
<p class="hang">300g (10oz) golden caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang1">a few strips of rind and juice of 1 orange (optional)</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the raspberries, sugar and orange rind and juice, if using, in a heavy-based saucepan and slowly bring to the boil, making sure that the sugar melts before boiling point.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Lower the heat and simmer, stirring from time to time, for 45 minutes. This compote will be pretty liquid, but just cook it longer if you prefer a more jammy consistency.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pour into a warm sterilized 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar and seal, then let it cool and store in the refrigerator. Drop a large spoonful into your tea for comfort.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec04"><a id="page_168"></a>Baked quince</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My uncle had a quince tree in his garden and I have always had an overwhelming love for this fruit. We even used to eat it raw (yes, crazy, I know!), or chop it and turn it into jam. I do love it roasted or poached whole though. Add some sea salt flakes and black pepper, remove the vanilla and halve the quantity of sugar to make a delicious addition to roast duck.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 6&#8211;8</strong></p>
<p class="hang">350ml (12fl oz) water</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">1 vanilla pod, split, seeds removed</p>
<p class="hang">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="hang">2 star anise</p>
<p class="hang">5 juniper berries</p>
<p class="hang1">3&#8211;4 quinces, about 1kg (2lb)</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 160&#176;C/325&#176;F/Gas Mark 3. Place the water with the sugar in a saucepan, add the vanilla seeds and the pod to the pan with the cinnamon stick, star anise and juniper berries and cook over a low heat, stirring regularly, until the sugar dissolves.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Cut the quinces in half, then cut in half again lengthways and remove the core. Place the quince quarters in a medium baking dish.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pour the spiced syrup over the quinces. Cover with foil and pop in the oven for 1 hour, then uncover and cook for a further hour or until the quinces are soft and amber coloured.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Serve this warm with ice cream, or chilled instead of strawberries for a winter version of the <a href="part0011.xhtml#ch08sec10">Birthday Ice Cream &#38; Strawberry Cake</a> on.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec05"><a id="page_171"></a>Gooseberry &#38; strawberry conserve</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Mum has an old Ukrainian baking book that she&#8217;s had since the mid-1970s. It&#8217;s a treasure of a book and this recipe was an inspiration for her, as she loved making all kinds of conserves for serving with <strong><em>mlyntsi</em></strong>: thin Ukrainian cr&#234;pes slathered in melted butter. She would literally place a block of butter on a hot pancake while frying the next one. You can use thinly sliced firm apricots instead of strawberries. This conserve will be a little liquid, but I prefer it to really thick, sugary jams.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">450g (14&#189;oz) gooseberries</p>
<p class="hang">350g (11&#189;oz) strawberries</p>
<p class="hang1">450g (14&#189;oz) golden caster sugar</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Wash the gooseberries and get rid of the stalks. Wash the strawberries, take the green tops off and cut the large ones in half.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Place the gooseberries, sugar and a splash of water in a large, heavy-based saucepan and slowly bring to the boil, making sure all the sugar dissolves before it boils. Cook over a very low heat, stirring from time to time, for 1 hour, making sure that the sugar doesn&#8217;t catch on the base of the pan.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Add the strawberries and simmer for another 30 minutes until slightly thickened. Place in a warm sterilized 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar and seal, then let it cool. Store in the refrigerator. It should keep unopened for several months.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec06"><a id="page_172"></a>Apricot jam</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My mum declares that this method &#8211; involving bringing everything to the boil and letting it cool repeatedly &#8211; ensures that the apricots keep their shape, teasing out the pectin gradually without destroying the apricots&#8217; good looks. It&#8217;s not particularly hard &#8211; it just requires you to peel yourself off the sofa on a rainy Sunday afternoon every two hours to reboil the jam. You can also crush the stones, remove the kernels, peel them off their brown film and add them to the jam along with a drop of almond essence to make &#8216;tsar&#8217;s jam&#8217;. Watch out when you crush the stones though, as shards will shoot straight at your face.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) apricots, halved and stoned, stones crushed, kernels removed and peeled (optional)</p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) golden caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">a few strips of rind and juice of 2 lemons</p>
<p class="hang1">2 drops of almond essence (optional)</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the apricot halves, sugar, peeled apricot kernels, if you are mad enough, lemon rind and juice and almond essence, if using, in a heavy-based saucepan. Slowly bring to the boil, stirring gently but frequently to dissolve the sugar. Simmer the apricots for 10 minutes, then switch off the heat.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Let the jam cool, then bring it to the boil again and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Repeat this cooling and bringing to boil and simmering process twice more until it becomes a jam-like consistency.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Pour the conserve into a warm sterilized 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar and seal, then let it cool and store in the refrigerator. Serve on bread or with some lovely <a href="part0011.xhtml#ch08sec02">Yogurt Drop Scones</a>.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec07"><a id="page_174"></a>Cornel cherry jam</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">It may be hard to find cornel cherries, but I have decided to include this recipe for cultural reference&#8217;s sake. It may sound strange to leave stones in fruit when making jam, but somehow it never bothered me. The fresh berries are sour and slightly resemble sour plums in flavour.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) cornel cherries, stones in</p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) golden granulated sugar</p>
<p class="hang1">200ml (7fl oz) water</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place everything in a saucepan and bring to the boil very slowly, stirring all the time to make sure that the sugar melts before boiling point. Simmer for 1 hour until it thickens.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Pour into a warm sterilized 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jar, seal and let it cool, then store in the refrigerator. It will keep unopened for several months.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec08"><a id="page_175"></a>Rose petal jam</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Apart from fruit, vegetables and berries, my grandmother Lusia grew incredible flowers. Peonies, asters, hollyhocks and roses added explosions of juicy colour to her garden. I will never forget the tea roses and their musky, viscous (if I may say that?) aroma. She preserved her summer roses in jars. This is amazing eaten straight from the spoon with a strong cup of black tea with lemon.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 4 x 200ml (7fl oz) jars</strong></p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) unsprayed edible tea rose petals</p>
<p class="hang">250ml (8fl oz) water</p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) granulated sugar</p>
<p class="hang1">5g (&#188;oz) citric acid</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Soak the petals in some cold water for a couple of hours, then drain well.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Place the measurement water and sugar in a saucepan and slowly bring to the boil; the sugar needs to dissolve completely before boiling. Add the citric acid and the drained petals, give it all a stir, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pour the jam into 4 warm sterilized 200ml (7fl oz) jars and seal, then let them cool and store in the refrigerator. Enjoy all winter with tea.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch07sec09"><a id="page_177"></a>Blackberry sauce</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My Ukrainian love of all things fruit has manifested itself in this sauce. It&#8217;s my own recipe and I love it. Do try lemon thyme with this &#8211; its floral notes go really beautifully with blackberries. Serve this sauce with <em>Deruny</em> (<a href="part0006.xhtml#ch03sec10">Potato Cakes with Goats&#8217; Cheese</a>) or roast duck or chicken.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 2</strong></p>
<p class="hang">25g (1oz) butter</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="hang">60g (2&#188;oz) shallots, very finely diced</p>
<p class="hang">2 teaspoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="hang">40ml (1&#189;fl oz) port</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) blackberries</p>
<p class="hang">4 sprigs of lemon thyme, leaves picked and chopped</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Heat the butter and olive oil in a frying pan, add the shallots and sherry vinegar and sweat over a low heat for 10 minutes until the shallots have softened.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Raise the heat to medium. Now watch your eyebrows and shout &#8216;flamb&#233;!&#8217; as you add the port, tilt the pan away from you to catch the flames and flamb&#233; until the flame dies down. It may not do much in terms of flavour (it just burns the alcohol off more quickly), but it may impress your date.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Add the blackberries, crush them slightly with a fork and cook over a medium&#8211;low heat for about 5 minutes. Add the lemon thyme and sugar, season well with salt and pepper and cook for another minute or so.</p>
