<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">In this combination, the almonds enhance the beets’ earthiness, and the bracing, creamy horseradish dressing offers not just richness but also a bit of a bite. Be sure not to discard the leafy greens from the beets; they are a wonderful vegetable in and of themselves. Chop beet greens and add to a soup, or slice and sauté them with garlic and chili as you would spinach or any leafy green. Waste not, want not, as they say!</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 bunch beets, leafy greens removed (see note above), but leave 1 or 2 inches of the stems, scrubbed and rinsed</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup water</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup Vinaigrette (<a href="chapter008.xhtml#page-258v">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons raw almonds, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup crème fraîche</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ tablespoons prepared horseradish, or 1 tablespoon freshly grated horseradish</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons high-quality, extra-virgin olive oil</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 425°F.</p>
<p>Place the beets and the water in a baking dish or on a rimmed sheet pan. Roast the beets, turning occasionally, until they’re cooked through, about 45 minutes depending on their size. To test for doneness, insert a paring knife into the largest beet—it should be able to go through with barely any resistance.</p>
<p>Let the beets rest until they’re cool enough to handle. Trim off and discard the stem ends of the beets and carefully peel the beets. Cut the beets into bite-size wedges and place them into a bowl. Add the vinaigrette and the almonds to the bowl and stir to combine. At this point the beets can be stored for up to a week; they only get better as they marinate in the dressing.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the crème fraîche, horseradish, and vinegar and season the mixture with salt.</p>
<p>To serve, dollop the crème fraîche mixture onto the beets and drizzle with the olive oil.</p></div>

<p class="noindenth1"><em>Cooking and serving vegetables wrapped in parchment paper is a clever way to prepare side dishes. Cooking them this way keeps them off your stovetop and in the oven, so you have more space to do other things. Plus, it steams</em> and <em>roasts them at the same time so they emerge perfectly cooked. Whether or not I’ve initially cooked vegetables in paper packages, I often serve them that way because I can make the packets far in advance and just pop them into the oven to reheat them when everyone sits at the table. People swoon over the presentation!</em></p>
<p><em>To cook vegetables this way, place them on one half of a large piece of parchment paper, drizzle with a little olive oil, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Add whatever other seasonings you might like (sliced garlic, herbes de Provence, fresh thyme, etc.), and add a tiny splash of water or wine too. Fold the other half of the parchment paper over the vegetables and crimp the edges to form a packet. (If you’re just going to serve cooked vegetables en papillotte, simply wrap them up and don’t worry about the olive oil, water, etc.) Place the packets in a 425°F oven and roast the vegetables until they’re cooked through to your liking, anywhere from 15 minutes for asparagus to about 1 hour for beets. If you want the paper to really brown, drizzle the outside of it with lemon juice before baking.</em></p>
