			<p class="QuotePara">“Pasta is easily one of my favorite foods, it satisfies the soul and fills the belly like no other food I can think of; it is also one of the most challenging foods to perfect. Doing pasta well takes time and practice. I get as much joy out of making it as I do out of eating it, and that’s the secret when it comes to making great pasta—you need to learn how to enjoy the process and pay close attention, and when it’s ready to serve, it must be eaten immediately. As my nonna always used to say, ‘Pasta waits for no one.’”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4 as a main course, 6 as an appetizer </span><span class="Serves"> </span>This dish reminds me of the time Adam Platt, one of the restaurant critics for <span class="ital">New York </span>magazine<span class="ital"> </span>(who gave us one star, by the way), came in to eat. While my sommelier was pouring wine at the table next to him, he overheard Adam’s guest comment that these agnolotti were one of the best pastas she had eaten all summer. However, in his review, he trashed us in every way, shape, and form. As a matter of fact, he didn’t even give us a full review—we got a couple of paragraphs at the end of someone else’s. Thanks a lot, Adam, we really appreciate your thorough assessment.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">The olive oil we use in this dish comes from Tre Olive, a very small producer in Calabria owned by the Maruca family—which also happens to be the family of one of my best friends.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">For a dramatic presentation, if you own a siphon (see <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page173">photo</a>), try putting all the ingredients on top of the siphon and the tomato water on the bottom. Light a flame on the siphon and watch the tomato water beautifully rise and infuse with the aromatics.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">The agnolotti sound a bit tricky to make at first, but once you make them once, you’ll see just how manageable the recipe is. This makes for a terrific summer afternoon lunch or a Sunday dinner.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tomato Consommé</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Place the tomatoes, jalapeño, basil, garlic, salt, and sugar in a food processor and process until pureed (work in batches, if necessary). Set a large fine-mesh strainer lined with several layers of cheesecloth over a stockpot or a deep bowl. (You will need about 1 foot of space between the bottom of the strainer and bottom of the pot or bowl.) Pour the tomato mixture into the strainer and tie the ends of the cheesecloth together. Refrigerate and let strain for 12 hours. (If your refrigerator does not have enough space for the stockpot or bowl, divide the tomato mixture in half and strain in 2 smaller containers side by side.) Transfer the strained consommé to a medium pot. You should have about 4 to 4½ cups of the consommé, depending on how juicy or watery the tomatoes are.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page172">Make the Agnolotti</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>While the Tomato Consommé is straining, make the Pasta Dough. Allow it to rest for 1  hour before using. In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta, shallots, basil, red pepper flakes, egg yolk, and lemon zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch plain tip and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Divide the Pasta Dough into 2 or 3 pieces. Run the dough through a pasta machine on the widest setting. Fold the dough in half, rotate it a quarter turn, and run it through on the same setting. Repeat this process two more times, decreasing the thickness setting each time. The pasta sheets should be at least 5 inches wide and thin enough that you can see the silhouette of your hand (and the light) through them, but not so thin that they are transparent. Because the dough dries out quickly, cover the pasta sheets you’re not immediately filling with a dry kitchen towel.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Working quickly, one sheet at time, fill and shape the agnolotti. Lay a sheet of pasta lengthwise on a lightly floured work surface. Pipe a line of filling ¾ inch from the bottom edge, leaving a ¾-inch border on the left and right sides. Fold the bottom portion of the dough over the filling and press the edge lightly to seal the dough. Do not run your finger down the dough or you risk ripping the pasta. Press to tightly seal the left and right edges of the dough, pressing out any air pockets. You will have ½ inches of pasta overhanging the filled “tube.” Using a crimped pastry wheel, separate the tube of filled pasta from the pasta sheet and cut a small portion from the left and right sides to leave a crimped edge.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Working your way down the “tube” of filled pasta in 1-inch increments, pinch the pasta between your thumb and forefinger, leaving a ¾-inch-wide sealed area. It is important to leave this much space so the agnolotti do not fall apart when you separate them from one another. Working quickly, separate the agnolotti from one another by running the pastry wheel down the center of the sealed area between each “pillow.” Place the finished agnolotti on a baking sheet dusted with flour or cornmeal, making sure they do not touch one another. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough sheets and filling. You should have approximately 48 agnolotti. Reserve 24 agnolotti and freeze the rest for later use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cut a small X at the top of each cherry tomato. Blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water for 30 seconds and immediately transfer them to an ice bath to cool. When the tomatoes have cooled, peel the tomatoes and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. While the water heats up, gently heat the Tomato Consommé in a small saucepot over low heat, but do not allow it to boil.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Add the agnolotti to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds, or until they float to the top. Using a slotted spoon, gently transfer the agnolotti to 4 warmed bowls, dividing them evenly among the bowls. Ladle the Tomato Consommé over the agnolotti to cover. Add a pinch of the red pepper flakes to each and top with some shaved onion and basil chiffonade. Drizzle the basil oil, if using, and the olive oil over each portion, and sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>To make the dish move a little faster, you could make a quick tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes, garlic, and basil and serve it with the agnolotti. It will still taste amazing.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Ian Purkayastha</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Ian Purkayastha is not what you’d call an average teenager. When he first showed up at my restaurant talking about truffles, I thought he was trying to sell us candy. But once we started talking, I realized Ian was trying to sell us truffles, as in the mushroom! His business, despite his youth, turned out to be the real deal. Ian started buying truffles around the age of sixteen and hasn’t stopped since.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Originally from Houston, Texas, Ian’s family moved to Arkansas when he was fourteen years old. Moving from a cosmopolitan place to a small town was a culture shock for Ian, who missed living in a big, bustling city. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">He struggled to make new friends and fit in at his new school. He felt lonely in Arkansas. But at some point, Ian’s uncle showed him how to forage for wild mushrooms, and Ian became obsessed with all things fungus.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">On one visit back to Houston, Ian tried truffles for the first time in a restaurant. “Immediately,” he recalls, “I wanted to get my hands on some truffles and cook with them at home.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">After a little research, Ian bought some summer truffles directly from a company in France. He used his savings, because, he laughs, “My parents weren’t going to pay for truffles for their fifteen-year-old son.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Truffles have a short shelf life, and a pound of them is quite a lot for one person. When the truffles arrived, Ian thought, “Why not try to sell a portion of them and recoup some of what I spent?”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">So Ian went to the three best restaurants in Arkansas and was able to sell almost all of the truffles, pocketing a good profit at the end of the day. When all was said and done, he was able to enjoy both the truffles that he kept for himself and a small financial gain.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">There was another thing, too: Ian enjoyed going out to restaurants, cold-calling, meeting chefs, and trying new foods. He decided that for the remainder of the summer, he was going to start a company, Tartufi Unlimited (tartufi means “truffles” in Italian), and import truffles for restaurants. What was intended to be a summer project turned into a yearlong venture. During the day, Ian would be in school, and in the evenings, he was doing homework and running a truffle import business out of his room.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">A year later, Ian, at the time a senior in high school, was hired by PAQ, an Italian truffle importer, to establish an American footprint. He set up a shipping center out of his parents’ garage and started to ship truffles all over the country. After graduating high school, Ian moved to New York to work for PAQ. Within two years, PAQ had dozens of clients and business was booming.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">In 2012, feeling the need to strike out on his own, Ian started Regalis Foods, shipping truffles, truffle products, and other luxury food items, such as Israeli and Bulgarian caviar, to his clients. Ian is still working around the clock with the help of a few full-time employees. He personally shows up to restaurants with zip-top bags full of truffles, briefly chats with chefs, and departs. Personal contact is very important to him. Clearly, he’s not sitting on his laurels.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Not too shabby for a kid who’s not even twenty yet. With his passion and energy for the business, I look forward to seeing how he grows in the future.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is my interpretation of a dish from the ’50s and ’60s that James Beard used to love called “Asparagus in Ambush”—a very simple hors d’oeuvre composed of asparagus spears, béchamel, and hollowed-out bread. The first time I ever tasted baby white asparagus “in ambush” was at the Greenbrier in Virginia when I was ten years old. I had absolutely no idea what it was, but it was the first time, as far as I can remember, that I was excited by food. Here is my interpretation of the classic dish.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tasso Ham</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Bake the ham slices in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches) on a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined baking sheet for 8 to 10 minutes, checking on the ham slices often to make sure they don’t curl. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Shallot Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat until foaming. Add the shallots and sweat them until soft and translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the white wine and vermouth and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cream, reduce the heat to low, and stir every 4 minutes or so to make sure the cream is not scorching on the bottom of the pan. Simmer the mixture until it has reduced by half, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the reduction from the heat. Reserve half of the reduction for use in the Lasagna Filling and freeze the rest for later use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page176">Make the Lasagna Filling</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Slice the morels into ¼-inch rings. Add just enough oil to a large sauté pan to coat the bottom of the pan and set the pan over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the mushrooms to the pan in one even layer (you may need to do this in batches). Reduce the heat to medium and cook the mushrooms until they release their liquid and begin to brown. Add the shallots and butter and cook until the butter and mushrooms are brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and deglaze the pan with sherry (the sherry might flame up, so stand back). Stir in the reserved Shallot Reduction and the Tomato Concassé, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf. Transfer the morel filling to a baking pan lined with parchment paper and allow it to cool. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lasagna</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Make the Pasta Dough. Allow it to rest 1 hour before using. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Using a pasta machine or a pasta roller attachment for your stand mixer, roll the Pasta Dough on the #1 setting of the machine (about 2.5mm). Cut the dough into sixteen 3x5-inch strips.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter and thyme, and brown the butter until it smells nutty and fragrant. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the asparagus and Tomato Concassé. At the same time, add the pasta to the boiling water. Cook the pasta for 20 seconds, then drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water, and transfer the pasta to the skillet with the brown butter, asparagus, and tomatoes. Add the cooled Lasagna Filling and toss everything together with a few spoonfuls of the reserved pasta water (use more if needed). Add the chopped parsley, and remove from the heat. Discard the thyme.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Place 1 pasta sheet on each of 4 plates and top each sheet with some of the asparagus-morel mixture. Layer another sheet of pasta on top, and repeat until each plate has 4 pasta layers. Top equally with the Tasso ham and micro parsley. Shave the truffle on top, if using, and finish with the Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings. Drizzle with a little of your favorite olive oil.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitle">Tre Olive</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Mike Maruca</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Olive oil, like wine, has a terroir—meaning that it reflects the tasting notes of the region in which it originated depending on type of soil, climate, and proximity to water. Sicilian olive oils tend to be robust and peppery, while Ligurian ones are delicate and grassy.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Chances are that if you are buying olive oil at your local grocery store, you are getting blended oil—oil that doesn’t come from a single origin grove. That’s because large olive oil manufacturers buy their oil in bulk from many oil makers and combine them in their facilities before pouring the oil into bottles. The result might not highlight distinct tasting notes from any particular region.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">I’ve known Mike Maruca and his family since college—we’ve been good friends for years. We even backpacked through Europe together after graduation, and I visited his family’s olive groves in Calabria, which they’ve been tending since 1934 when the family opened up their first olive mill.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">For decades, his family was harvesting olive oil from local farmers from a single estate and pressing them into fine extra-virgin olive oil. The family would then sell large quantities of that oil to a wholesaler at a discount because they were buying in bulk. The wholesaler would then take that oil and blend it with olive oils from Africa, Turkey, and other countries, and sell it to big store brands like Bertolli.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">In 1970, Mike’s parents emigrated from Calabria to Western Massachusetts in search of better job opportunities, but most of the family remained in Italy tending to the olive trees. Mike and his family made frequent trips to visit their relatives, and Mike grew up knowing his Italian cousins pretty well.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">In 2009, during a visit to the family groves, three cousins, including Mike, started to discuss how they could avoid selling their oil to the large companies who often diluted it with lesser-quality oil. They decided to start bottling their single-estate oil and try to sell it directly to the consumer. Thus, Tre Olive (tre meaning “three” in Italian, for the three cousins) was born.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When I first tasted Tre Olive oil, I knew it was the oil I had to carry at my restaurant, and we’ve been doing so ever since. Their oil is exceptional—slightly peppery but also round, sweet, and well balanced, with incredible body. Because it’s from a single estate, you can fully taste the terroir of the region; if you close your eyes, it’s like an instant, momentary trip to Calabria.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>In the summer, it doesn’t get more American than lobster and corn, and this is my favorite twist on this classic combination of flavors. This pasta recipe is one that you should source from the greenmarket as much as you possibly can. During the height of summer, corn is just stunning, and the store-bought stuff just doesn’t begin to compare. Lemon verbena, ample at the greenmarket in summertime, adds a distinct seasonal note to this all-American combo of lobster and fresh summer corn.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lemon Verbena Stock</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Remove the kernels from the cobs and set the kernels aside. Cut the cobs in half, place them in a shallow baking pan, and roast for 30 minutes or until browned. Transfer the cobs to a 3-quart saucepot set over medium heat and add the wine and 3 cups of water. Bring the liquid to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Transfer the pot to a <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page240">bain marie</a> or a nonreactive container. Add the lemon verbena, cover the top of the container tightly in plastic wrap, and let the stock infuse for 1 hour. The accumulated moisture that will gather on the inside of the plastic wrap will look like it is raining. This is where the infusion of flavor takes place. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer, reserving the cobs, and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Sweet Corn Ravioli</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Using a juicer, press 1¼ cups of the reserved corn kernels—you should get about ½ cup of corn juice. Alternatively, if you don’t own a juicer, puree 1¼ cups of corn kernels in a blender, transfer the pureed corn to a kitchen towel or cheesecloth, and squeeze out the juice so that you get ½ cup of corn juice. Set aside the remaining ¾ cup corn kernels—you will need them for the ravioli as well as for assembling the dish.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a 4-quart pot, bring 2 cups of the stock to a boil over high heat. Add the lemon verbena, cover, and remove from the heat. Let the broth infuse for 10 minutes. Discard verbena and return the pot to the stovetop. Over low heat, slowly whisk in the polenta and cook, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let sit in a warm place for 10 minutes. Whisk in the cream cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, reserved corn juice, remaining ¾ cup corn kernels, basil, mint, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cover and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page180"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a small pot, bring the remaining 1¾ cups of chicken stock to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat, and keep warm.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Add enough olive oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the onion, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Do not let the onion pick up color. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until it has been absorbed. Add the thyme and bay leaf, and ladle in the hot stock, 1 ladle at a time, allowing for the stock to be absorbed before adding more. Cook until the rice is al dente. Taste and adjust the seasonings.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Transfer the risotto to a meat grinder set to medium die setting and grind it through. Transfer the ground risotto to the bowl with the polenta mixture and mix to combine. Set the risotto-polenta batter over an ice bath and let cool completely. Once cool, transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch plain tip and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Make the Pasta Dough. Allow it to rest 1 hour before using. Lightly dust the surface of the counter with some flour. Using a pasta machine or a pasta roller attachment for your stand mixer, roll the Pasta Dough on the #1 setting of the machine (about 2.5 mm). Cut the dough into 12x5-inch strips. Divide the strips into 2 parts: tops and bottoms. Brush the bottom strips with some of the beaten egg yolks and pipe 2 tablespoons of risotto-polenta filling every 2 inches or so—the diameter of filling should be about 1½ inches.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Place the top pasta sheets over the bottom ones, and using the dull side of a 2½-inch ring cutter, press down to shape the ravioli. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut out the ravioli. Alternatively, you can do this using a ravioli mold. Set aside 16 ravioli and freeze the remainder for another use. Transfer the ravioli to a lightly floured, parchment paper–lined baking sheet—you may need more than 1 sheet. Note: If making ravioli ahead of time, flash-freeze the ravioli on a baking sheet for 20 minutes before placing them in a tightly sealed container and freezing them until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lobster</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. First, kill the lobsters by stabbing them through the head with a chef’s knife. (This might seem cruel, but it is actually the most humane way to kill them—the lobsters die instantly.) Remove the tails from the lobster bodies and cut the tails into 1-inch pieces while they are still in their shells; set aside. Remove the claws from the lobster bodies and freeze the bodies for another use (such as a <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Lobster">Lobster Stock</a>). Place the claws in the pot of boiling water and cook for 4 minutes, then transfer the claws to an ice bath. Once cool, remove the meat from the claws and knuckles and set the meat aside in a bowl.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Season the lobster tail pieces with salt on both sides. In a large sauté pan set over high heat, heat just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before it starts to smoke, add the lobster tail pieces, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, undisturbed, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more, until cooked through. Transfer the lobster tails to a plate to cool. Once they are cool enough to handle, poke the meat out with a fork and set it aside in the bowl with the claw meat, discarding the shells or reserving them for another use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>When ready to serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat to medium and keep the water at a simmer while you prepare the rest of the dish.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, about 1 to 2 minutes. Once the butter browns, remove the pan from the heat and stir in 1 cup of the Lemon Verbena Stock. Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium-high heat and reduce the stock by about half, until it thickens slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved corn kernels and lobster meat. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 90 seconds to 2 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method" id="page181"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Raise the heat under the pot of salted water to high, make sure the water is at a rolling boil, and add the ravioli. Cook for 20 seconds, and using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer to the pan with the lobster meat. Ladle in a little bit of the pasta water to bind the ingredients together. Shake the pan to emulsify the sauce. Stir in the basil and lemon verbena. Garnish with the corn shoots. Divide among 4 warmed plates and serve.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Make the Lemon Verbena Stock and the lobster. Combine it with wide fresh egg pasta that either you make yourself or purchase at your local fine foods store. Add some fresh corn kernels in the last minute of cooking.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4</span><span class="Serves">  </span>This is a perfect example of taking leftovers, or <span class="ital">avanzi </span>in Italian, and making something delicious out of them. We usually wind up with some leftover veal breast after trimming it to perfect portions, and we didn’t want to waste perfectly delicious meat that wasn’t perfectly cut. One day, my sous-chef, Barry, decided to make tortellini with filling from the veal breast scraps, and the dish took off from there. It became one of our best sellers and a classic on the menu. The truffle-infused balsamic vinegar is a beautiful product brought to us by our “truffle boy,” Ian, from <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page174">Regalis</a>. The balsamic is aged with truffle scraps in Modena and then bottled up. Not bad for a dish that started out as leftovers and ended up on the tasting menu.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pat the veal dry and rub The Cure all over. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. Make the Onion Brulé.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Rinse the veal under cold water, pat dry, and set aside in a roasting pan. Let sit for about 30 minutes or until it reaches room temperature. Meanwhile, make a sachet with the peppercorns, fennel seed, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf using folded-over cheesecloth.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a large stockpot, combine the oil, onion brulé, garlic, carrot, and herb-spice sachet and warm over medium-high heat until the oil temperature registers 200ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Pour the contents of the stockpot over the veal. Cover the roasting pan with parchment paper, and then wrap it in foil. Transfer the roasting pan to the oven and cook the veal for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. Let the veal cool overnight, refrigerated, in the oil.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page184"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Place the roasting pan on the stovetop and, over medium-low heat, warm the pan just enough to pull out the veal. Remove the bones from the meat if there are any and set the meat aside. Stir the liquid with a fork to mix it up, and set aside 3 tablespoons of the cooking liquid for the tortellini. Strain the remaining oil and reserve it for another use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Vinaigrette</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>While the veal breast cooks, in a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar, Pierre Poivre, flaky sea salt, and garlic. Stir to combine well and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tortellini</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Make the Pasta Dough. Allow it to rest for 1 hour before making the Tortellini. In a large bowl, combine the  reserved Veal Breast Confit (or use whatever leftover cooked meat you have on hand), cream cheese, reserved confit cooking liquid, Red Wine Sauce, bone marrow, parsley, shallots, chives, and salt, and mix thoroughly. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Make the tortellini: Roll out the Pasta Dough, either by hand or using a pasta machine, to about ⅛ inch thick. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut the dough into discs. You should get about 48 discs. Place ¼ teaspoon of the filling into the center of each round. Fold the top over and press the edge gently to seal. Lightly brush the edges with the beaten egg. Fold back around your finger and turn down the edge to form a tortellino. Transfer the tortellini to a lightly floured tray and refrigerate or freeze until needed. You may have some extra Pasta Dough left over. If that is the case, cut it into fettuccine, place in a tightly sealed container, and reserve for later use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Place a large stockpot of salted water over high heat and bring it to a boil. While the water heats up, using either a mandoline or a truffle slicer, slice the trumpet as thinly as possible—you will need 16 nearly see-through slices. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Meanwhile, lay out two pieces of parchment paper and very lightly brush both pieces with oil. Lay out the parsley leaves over one of the pieces of parchment so that the leaves are flat against the paper. Place the second parchment piece, oil side down, over the leaves, and transfer to the microwave. Microwave the leaves in 30-second intervals for a total of about 90 seconds to 2 minutes, until crispy. Check on the leaves after each interval to see if they are crisp. Once done, remove the leaves from the parchment and set them aside.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Add the tortellini to the boiling water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and transfer the tortellini to a large bowl and toss with a little bit of the Vinaigrette to coat the pasta. Divide the tortellini among 4 warmed bowls and spoon some more of the Vinaigrette on top. Add the sliced trumpet mushroom, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and crispy parsley. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and Pierre Poivre, and serve.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium pot set over high heat, combine the speck, Parmigiano-Reggiano rind, peppercorns, thyme, and bay leaf with 5 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 1 hour or until the stock is generously flavored with speck. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, discard the solids, and set aside. When ready to serve, warm the Speck Stock until simmering.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Speck Lardons</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Add enough Blended Oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the speck, and once it begins to render fat, reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the lardons are crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the lardons to a paper towel–lined tray. Reserve the rendered fat.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chanterelles</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the mushrooms in one even layer and reduce the heat to medium. You may need to do this in batches. Once the mushrooms begin to sear, add the butter, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf, and toss together to combine. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the butter begins to brown. Add the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Cook until the pan is dry, 5 to 8 minutes; add the chicken stock and cook until the stock reduces and the pan is dry, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a parchment paper–lined tray and set aside in a warm place until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page187">Make the Pasta Dough</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Allow the Pasta Dough to rest 1 hour before making the Ravioli.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Ricotta Filling</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>While the Pasta Dough rests, in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the ricotta, peppercorns, and lemon zest. Whip the filling in the food processor until smooth. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip or to a resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped off. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Ravioli</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Divide the Pasta Dough into two or three pieces. Run one piece of dough through a pasta machine (cover the remaining dough in the meantime) starting at the thickest setting (usually a 1 on the pasta machine). Fold the sheet in half and run it through the machine again. Switch the machine to the next setting and run the sheet through again. Continue running the sheet through the machine until you reach the desired thickness for fettuccine (usually a 4 or 5). Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Cut the pasta to the strips of the same length (about 4x8 inches); you should have 4 strips of pasta. Using the dull side of a 3-inch ring cutter, push down to make 4 indents on two of the sheets. Brush the two sheets of pasta with the indents with some of the beaten egg yolks. Pipe about 2 tablespoons of Ricotta Filling into the center of the indents. With the back of a spoon, make a well in the center of each portion of filling and add an egg yolk to each one. It is imperative that the yolks remain unbroken. Cover with the other two sheets of pasta, and again using the dull side of the ring cutter, push down to seal. (Make sure there is no extra air inside the ravioli.)</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4 (makes about 20 ravioli)  </span>In 2011, inspired by the idea of Shanghai soup dumplings, we started making panna cotta ravioli. With the help of a little gelatin, you can take anything—juice, cheese, soup—and turn it into a semisolid state. And when you encase it in ravioli and warm the ravioli up, the semisolid filling melts again, so when you bite into it, there’s a nice burst of a creamy soup.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">Making a gelée out of olive oil is a little bit tricky; you have to add some unusual components to make it want to solidify a bit. We kept the measurements for those components in grams because precision is key in these kinds of recipes, and grams are far more accurate as units of measurement than ounces. I highly recommend that you keep a digital scale in your kitchen—you will find that it’s easier and more precise, and you’ll have fewer dishes to wash in the end.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Olive Oil en Gelée</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Combine the Isomalt, sugar, and glucose with 1¼ cups (288 grams) of water in a saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until dissolved. Whisk in the gelatin, remove from the heat, and add the olive oil, whisking to emulsify. Pour the liquid into a quarter-sheet pan (9 x 13 inches), transfer to the refrigerator, and chill until set, 1 to 2 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Release the gelée sides from the pan by running a paring knife around the edge of the pan. Place a cutting board lined with parchment paper (with the paper facing the gelée) over the pan, and carefully but quickly invert the pan so the gelée is over the parchment paper. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut 12 gelée discs. Using a small offset spatula, very gently transfer the gelée discs to a parchment paper–lined tray. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Parmigiano-Reggiano Panna Cotta Ravioli Filling</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single" id="page189"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a 2-quart saucepot, combine the milk, cheese, and truffle oil, and bring to a lively simmer over medium-high heat, stirring often so that the cheese does not stick to the bottom. While the milk warms, bloom the gelatin sheets in a small bowl filled with cold water for about 2 minutes. Wring out excess moisture from the sheets, and discard the water. Remove the milk-cheese mixture from the heat and whisk in the bloomed gelatin sheets until dissolved. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer onto a parchment paper–lined half-sheet (13 x 18) baking pan. Transfer the pan to the freezer until the liquid sets, 1 to 2 hours. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Mezzaluna</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Make the Pasta Dough. Allow it to rest 1 hour before making the Mezzaluna. Lightly dust the surface of the counter with some flour, and lightly beat the egg in a small bowl. Using a pasta machine or a pasta roller attachment for your stand mixer, roll out the Pasta Dough, starting on the thickest setting and progressing to the thinnest setting of the machine. Lay the sheets out over the floured counter. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut out 20 discs from the dough. Using a small melon baller, scoop out the Parmigiano-Reggiano Panna Cotta Ravioli Filling and place one ball in the center of each dough circle. Using a pastry brush, brush the top half of the pasta circles with the egg wash, fold up the pasta to create half-moon ravioli, and press the edges together to seal. Transfer the half-moons to a lightly floured half-sheet baking pan and freeze until needed. Repeat with any remaining pasta dough and filling. You will use 20 mezzaluna for this recipe; freeze the remainder for up to 3 months for later use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Balsamic Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Place the vinegar, sugar, peppercorns, and mint in a small nonreactive saucepot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer the liquid for 10 to 15 minutes or until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the liquid to cool. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and keep at room temperature.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Soppressata Salt</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Add 1 inch of oil to a small skillet. Warm the oil over medium-high heat until it registers 300ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Add the soppressata slices and fry until crispy, about 2 minutes. Transfer the soppressata to a paper towel–lined tray and let cool completely. Mince until the soppressata has the consistency of flaky sea salt. Set aside in a dry place.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. While the water warms up, using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut out 12 soppressata discs. Place 3 soppressata circles on each of 4 plates. Place a disc of the Olive Oil en Gelée on top of the soppressata on each plate.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Add the mezzaluna to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pasta to a mixing bowl and toss with enough extra-virgin olive oil to coat. Let the pasta cool slightly before dividing them evenly among the plates, placing them on top of the gelée disc (if the mezzaluna are too hot, they will melt the gelée). Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and garnish with basil. Drizzle the Balsamic Reduction around the mezzaluna and make a small pile of the Soppressata Salt on the side. Serve and eat each mezzaluna with a little reduction and a pinch of Soppressata Salt.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you’re keen on making your own ravioli, but want to skip the gelée part, be my guest. Make the ravioli and Balsamic Reduction and just serve the ravioli drizzled with your best extra-virgin olive oil.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Bottarga is nothing more than pressed, salted fish roe, typically from grey mullet, tuna, or swordfish; and while it sounds like nothing special, it’s an amazing secret weapon, packed with loads of flavor, that every cook should have in his kitchen. Our bottarga comes from Sardinian grey mullet, but there is also excellent domestic bottarga available. While bottarga is very expensive, a little of it goes a long way, and it has a long shelf life if you keep it tightly wrapped. Its flavor is unlike anything else and can’t be replicated by any other ingredient. Slightly metallic tasting (in a pleasant way), bottarga has a clean ocean salinity much like an oyster, and brightens up anything from pasta to simple ricotta crostini. Here, it transforms a plate of simple spaghetti. An impressive accomplishment for humble salty fish eggs!</p>

Just before it starts to smoke, add the bread crumbs and reduce the heat to medium. Stir constantly until the bread crumbs start to brown all over, about 2 minutes. Stir in the bottarga. Keep stirring until the bread crumbs are evenly toasted, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes.

Add the flour and salt, and using a fork, mix well until thoroughly combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured large bowl and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Set up a bigoli press with the small die and make spaghetti. Set the pasta aside on a floured tray or counter while you assemble the dish.</p>

In a large skillet (the largest you have—think 6-quart sauté pan), heat the Bottarga Bread Crumbs with ¼ cup olive oil until warm. Blanch the pasta in the boiling water for 15 to 20 seconds. Immediately transfer the pasta to the skillet with the bread crumbs. Let a little pasta water fall in to bind the pasta to the sauce. Toss everything together until well combined. Your skillet will be full, so toss carefully.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Divide the pasta among 4 warmed bowls. Drizzle olive oil around the bowl.

			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Fine foods stores will sell you excellent fresh pasta, preserved lemons in a jar (though it’s very worthwhile, and easy, to make your own), and bottarga. If you want to make your own pasta, but lack a bigoli press, you can either make whatever pasta you like using your pasta machine or roll out sheets of pasta and cut the pasta by hand. Either way, it makes for a simple, seductive, delicious meal.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pancetta Salt</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Bake the pancetta in a shallow baking pan for 12 minutes or until crispy. Transfer the pancetta to a parchment paper–lined tray and let cool. Mince the pancetta by hand until it resembles flaky sea salt, and let dry in a warm place. Leave the oven on.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Baked Potato Stock</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Pierce the potatoes with a fork in several places to allow steam to escape. Place the potatoes on the oven rack and bake for 40 minutes to 1 hour or until fork-tender. Remove from the oven (leave the oven on) and cut crosswise into ½-inch slices. Place the potato slices on a baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until crispy. Transfer the potato slices to a large saucepot and cover with 4 cups of cold water. Add salt to the water and bring it to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, 45 minutes. Add the peppercorns, thyme, and bay leaves, and transfer to a nonreactive container. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let infuse for ½ hour. The accumulated moisture that will gather on the inside of the plastic wrap will look like it is raining inside. Strain the potato stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Ravioli</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Bloom the gelatin sheets in ice water until soft, about 3 minutes. Once soft, squeeze out any excess liquid. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a simmer over medium heat. Add the bloomed gelatin and whisk until incorporated. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page196"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a medium bowl, mix together the sour cream, chives, crème fraîche, shallots, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon zest, and truffle oil. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Fold in the heavy cream mixture until well combined. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch plain tip and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Make the Pasta Dough. Allow it to rest for 1 hour before making the ravioli. Lightly dust the surface of the counter with some flour. Using a pasta machine or a pasta roller attachment for your stand mixer, roll the Pasta Dough on the #1 setting of the machine (about 2.5 mm). Cut the dough into 12x5-inch strips. Divide the strips into 2 parts: tops and bottoms. Brush the bottom strips with some of the beaten egg yolks and pipe 2 tablespoons of the ravioli filling every 2 inches or so—the diameter of filling should be about 1½ inches.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Place the top pasta sheets over the bottom ones, and using the back end of a 2½-inch ring cutter, press down to shape the ravioli. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut out the ravioli. Alternatively, you can do this using a ravioli mold. Set aside 16 ravioli and freeze the rest for another time. Transfer the ravioli to a lightly floured, parchment paper–lined baking sheet—you may need more than 1 sheet. Note: If making ravioli ahead of time, flash-freeze the ravioli on a baking sheet for 20 minutes before placing them in a tightly sealed container and freezing them until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="potatobrown">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>While you make the pasta, soak the leek in cold water for 1 hour, drain, and dry it in a salad spinner. About 40 minutes later, heat 1 inch of oil in a skillet set over medium-high heat until the oil temperature registers 300ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. At the same time, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the leek in the flour until it is well coated and gently add it to the oil. Fry the leek until crispy, about 30 seconds, then transfer to a parchment paper–lined tray and season to taste with salt. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Add the potato to the boiling water, reduce the heat to medium, and cook the potato at an active simmer until fork-tender, about 4 minutes. Strain the potato and transfer to an ice bath.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>When ready to serve, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and add enough salt so that the water tastes like seawater. In a sauté pan, heat the butter and potato over medium heat until the butter browns. Add 1 cup of the Baked Potato Stock, shallots, and chives. Drop the ravioli in the water and cook for 3 minutes. Immediately transfer the ravioli to the pan with the butter and potatoes, toss together, and cook for about 30 seconds. Divide the pasta among 4 warmed plates. Garnish with red pepper flakes, scallion threads, reserved fried leeks, Pancetta Salt, truffle oil, and truffle (if using).</p>
