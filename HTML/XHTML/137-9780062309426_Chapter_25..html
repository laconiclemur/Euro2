<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or reasons no Gascon has ever satisfactorily explained to me, the denuded carcass of a duck—what’s left once the breasts, legs, liver, and other parts have been removed—is referred to as a <i>demoiselle</i>. Gascons do not throw away the demoiselle. In fact, they take pleasure in grilling it and stripping off the remaining morsels of meat using their fingers, teeth, and, occasionally, a switchblade. A grilled demoiselle is the most irreducible of Gascon meals. It’s what paysans ate after they’d sold off everything else. If you search among the profusion of posters and fliers for local festivals in Gascon villages, you’ll probably find one or two for a <i>soirée demoiselle</i>. Such communal meals are also sometimes called, less euphemistically, <i>soirées carcasses</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Our own soirée was nothing more than me, Michele, and Charlotte sitting in front of the fire on our final night in Plaisance, gnawing on duck bones, our chins shiny with grease. I had cut the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258" title="258"/>hollow carcasses into quarters and grilled them on the hearth. We saved the <i>aiguillettes</i>—the tender strips of meat clinging to the duck’s sternum—for last.</p>
<p class="indent">At some point while we were eating, I asked Michele and Charlotte if they were going to miss Gascony. The words came out in a loud dad-voice—I suppose I was fishing for affirmation.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlotte nodded <i>mm-hm</i> and continued attacking her duck. I decided to take this as a full-throated yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele wiped her hands and seemed to give the question due consideration. Then she smiled and said, “I really am.”</p>
<p class="indent">After dinner I put on my coat, went outside, and sat on the banks of the stream so I could gaze at the bridge for a while. The Arros, glimmering faintly in the dark, flowed around the stone foundations and on toward its union with the Adour, joining the waters of thousands of Gascon brooks and streams.</p>
<p class="indent">I wondered when I’d be able to take in this view again. Suddenly I thought of Amandine. I’d said good-bye to her at the market a few days before and she’d informed me, in her laconic way, that she was selling her van and leaving the Gers to work as a nanny. The news had shaken me a little, disabusing me of the comforting but illusory notion that things in this sleepy corner of France would remain the same until I could return—same faces, same places, everything right where I left it. But Amandine’s revelation had reminded me of an obvious truth: Change <i>does</i> come to the Gers.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, it takes a while.</p>
