<p class="tni">Risotto is a main course at an Italian dinner (<span class="epub-i">pranzo</span>) or supper (<span class="epub-i">cena</span>). Basically, a risotto is cooked thus. Onion or garlic is sautéed in butter and/or olive oil. Then the rice is sautéed for three minutes. Other ingredients are added, after which either chicken or beef broth, heated to a boil, is added cup by cup, constantly stirring, until the rice absorbs all the liquid. This takes about eighteen minutes. Arborio rice imported from Italy must be used because it has the ability to absorb much liquid and to become creamy in consistency but still remain al dente (firm to the bite).</p>

The original recipe called for four, young, fresh artichokes, all outer leaves removed, and stem cut off, the thistle removed, and pared down to the tender hearts. Then the hearts were julienned and placed into cold water with the juice of one lemon to prevent discoloration. I just don’t have the heart to throw away almost all of the artichoke, so I substitute a 14-ounce can of artichoke hearts packed in water. I halve the rest of the artichokes, dip them in egg wash, cover them with bread crumbs seasoned with crushed garlic, chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. I fry them in olive oil until golden brown and serve them as appetizers. I did it again, didn’t I. I gave you two recipes in one. Oh, well!</span></p>

<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">A lot of people tell me that they love brussels sprouts but cannot get their kids near them. In this magnificent risotto, the tiny cabbages take on a wonderful taste. Are you having a rough time getting your kids to eat brussels sprouts? Make them this risotto, and unless your kids are really weird, they’ll eat them. This is a recipe from the city of Milan.</span></p>

<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">When I was a little child, we had a friend named Donna Micuzza Bareca, who emigrated from Cittanova, a mountain village in the province of Reggio Calabria. Donna Micuzza would often visit Bayonne Park in very early spring and gather the young tender leaves of dandelions, which she always shared with my mother, Donna Carmela. (Donna was the formal title given to women of high station. The English equivalent is “my lady.”) The dandelion has a slightly bitter taste and is chock-full of vitamins and minerals. These days you can purchase them from your green grocer or supermarket. This risotto is for you, Donna Micuzza, may you rest in peace.</span></p>

<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">This risotto is so colorful and eye-appealing that your guests will whisper when you serve them as if they were visiting an art museum. In fact, I ate this risotto for the first time right around the corner from the Pitti Palace art museum in Florence, Italy. Perhaps the chef was inspired to create his work of art from viewing the magnificent canvases of Rafaello, Tintoretto, El Greco, Goya, and company. This risotto not only looks beautiful but tastes beautiful. What more can one ask?</span></p>
