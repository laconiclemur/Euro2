<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Brandade de morue</em> is a mixture of whipped salt cod and potatoes and is very satisfying. At Buvette, I serve it in a jar next to a pile of grilled toast. Incidentally, packing it in a jar makes brandade a wonderful picnic snack. Be sure to plan ahead, as the cod must soak for three days.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">¼ pound salt cod, skin removed</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup whole milk</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large russet potato, peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Grilled or toasted bread, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In the refrigerator,</strong> soak the salt cod in a big bowl of water for 3 days, changing the water twice daily. Drain and cut the fish into small pieces.</p>
<p>Combine the milk, cream, garlic, and potato in a pot and simmer over medium heat until the potato is just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the chopped salt cod and continue cooking until the fish is tender, about another 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and transfer the remaining mixture to a large bowl. While stirring constantly with a large wooden spoon, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Stir until the mixture is almost smooth, adding a bit of the reserved cooking liquid if necessary. Season the brandade to taste with salt.</p>
<p>Serve warm with plenty of grilled or toasted bread.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Even though it’s great looking, the potato crust isn’t there just for aesthetics—it envelops the fish, keeping all of its juice and flavor intact. Needless to say, the browned, crispy potatoes are pretty delectable too. If you are averse to cooking a whole fish, feel free to wrap fillets of sea bass with the potatoes and cook as instructed below.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 2]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">One 1½- to 2-pound sea bass, scaled, gutted, and cleaned (or two 6-ounce fillets)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">A few garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 sprigs fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced on a mandoline</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Aggressively season both the inside and outside of the fish with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the garlic and rosemary.</p>
<p>Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a sauté pan large enough to hold the fish. Add the potato slices to the pan, one at a time, creating a single, blanketlike layer. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper, and place the fish on top of the potatoes. Using a spatula, fold the potatoes over the fish so that it’s completely enveloped in the slices.</p>
<p>Transfer the fish to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the fish from the oven and carefully turn it using two spatulas. Return the fish to the oven and roast until the potatoes are nicely browned and the fish is cooked through, 10 to 15 more minutes. To test for doneness, insert the blade of a paring knife or a metal skewer into the fish and then place it on top of your thumb, on your chin, or on your upper lip—it should be nice and hot, indicating that the heat from the oven has moved its way through the entire fish and it’s cooked through.</p></div>
