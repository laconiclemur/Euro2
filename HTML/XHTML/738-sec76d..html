<p class="nonindent">Yes, this is a sandwich made mainly with canned products. But that’s the beauty of Spanish cuisine. So many of its packaged goods are actually whole foods, and delicious ones at that. When I’m wiped after a long day at work, I turn to this sandwich. Not only because it’s so easy but also because I love its stack of juicy vegetables, meaty tuna and egg, and creamy mayonnaise.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">THIS IS A GREAT TUNA SANDWICH. HERE ARE THE</span> components: toasted baguette, Arbequina Olive Oil Mayonnaise (<a href="sec10.xhtml#page49">here</a>) canned Navarra white asparagus, drained piquillo peppers, tuna jarred in olive oil, and sliced hard-boiled egg. Sounds strange, but it is delicious if you use high-quality jarred asparagus, peppers, and tuna. For 4 sandwiches, you’ll need 1 baguette cut in quarters and split, 6 halved asparagus spears, 8 piquillos, a 6- to 7-ounce jar tuna, and as much mayonnaise as you want.</p>
