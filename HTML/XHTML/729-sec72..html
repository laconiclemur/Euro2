<p class="nonindent">There’s nothing not to like about huevos rotos, a hearty breakfast or lunch dish found all over Spain. Potato slices fry until crisp around the edges, but stay tender and sweet in the centers, then get tossed with Serrano ham for a porky saltiness. The savory pile gets topped with crackly fried eggs, which are cut all over the mix so the yolk sauces everything.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 medium Idaho potato (12 ounces), peeled, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Blended oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 ounces very thinly sliced Serrano ham, torn into bite-size pieces</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 large eggs, divided</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">USE A MANDOLINE TO SLICE THE POTATO INTO</span> potato-chip-thin slices. If you don’t have a mandoline, you can use the slicing attachment on a food processor or a very sharp knife and impeccable knife skills. Toss with just enough oil to prevent the slices from sticking to one another.</p>
<p class="indent">Fill a large, deep skillet with oil to a depth of ½ inch. Heat over high heat until hot. Add just enough potatoes to fit in a single layer and cook, carefully tossing and turning, until just golden, about 1 minute. The edges will be browned and crisp, but the centers should be a bit soft. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried potatoes to a large colander. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Sprinkle with salt in the colander and toss to evenly distribute the salt and shake off excess oil. Toss in the ham, then divide among serving plates.</p>
<p class="indent">When the oil is hot again, carefully add an egg. Fry, spooning the hot oil on top, until browned around the edges and the white is cooked through. Use a rubber spatula to carefully transfer to the top of a potato pile. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Serve hot, cutting up the egg and letting the yolk run all over the chips and ham.</p>
