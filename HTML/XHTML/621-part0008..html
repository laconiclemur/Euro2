<h1 class="heading" id="ch05sec01"><a id="page_120"></a>Azerbaijani rice &#38; fruity lamb</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My Aunt Nina&#8217;s introduction to this dish was: &#8216;This plov is never cooked for funerals, only weddings!&#8217;, and it&#8217;s definitely a happy occasion dish. Every Azerbaijani wedding that she went to, if she knew this pilau was coming, she would wait for it patiently and wouldn&#8217;t eat anything else. It takes some time to make, but the result is totally worth it. The meat is cooked separately from the rice.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">750g (1&#189;lb) boneless mutton or lamb neck or shoulder, diced</p>
<p class="hang">350g (11&#189;oz) onions, sliced</p>
<p class="hang">75g (3oz) pitted prunes, soaked in water</p>
<p class="hang">75g (3oz) dried apricots</p>
<p class="hang">75g (3oz) sultanas</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Rice</strong></p>
<p class="hang">450g (14&#189;oz) white long-grain rice</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) plain flour</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">2 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hang">150g (5oz) clarified butter or ghee</p>
<p class="hang">large pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="hang1">1 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Wash the meat but don&#8217;t dry it. Place it in a large, dry saucepan, season with plenty of salt and pepper, cover with a lid and cook over a very low heat for about 1&#189; hours. The meat will cook in its own juices and should be falling apart by the end of the cooking time.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> When the meat is close to its melt-in-the-mouth consistency, add the onions and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20&#8211;30 minutes until caramelized.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> If dry, add some water with the dried fruit and cook, covered, for another 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Add the rice and season well with salt. Give the rice a good stir and parboil it for 5 minutes. It should still be al dente. Drain the rice and spread it over a baking sheet to cool a little and to stop it from cooking further.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Now make the <em>gazmakh</em>, which is the crispy rice shell that will adorn the pilau when you turn it out. Mix the flour, fine sea salt and the eggs together in a bowl, then add 100g (3&#189;oz) of the parboiled rice and mix everything really well. It should look like a thick batter.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> To assemble the <em>plov</em>, wash the rice pan out and add 25g (1oz) of the clarified butter or ghee. Heat it well and then add the <em>gazmakh</em> batter making sure it covers the whole base of your pan (a larger base will make for a thinner crust). I use an oiled hand to spread it out, but I recommend you use a spatula. Cook it for 1 minute until it catches a bit.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Put the saffron and cumin, if using, into the rest of the clarified butter or ghee and let it stand. Spoon the parboiled rice over the <em>gazmakh</em>.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>8</strong> Make holes in the <em>plov</em> using the handle of a wooden spoon and pour over the spiced butter. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and wrap it with a damp tea towel around the edges as well. No steam should escape! Cook the rice for about 45 minutes over the lowest heat possible, checking after 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>9</strong> To serve, place the rice on a large round platter. Gently lift out the crispy bottom, break it into shards and serve on top of the rice. Place the lamb, fruit and its juice around the rice.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is a dish that my Ossetian friend gave to me a while back. It&#8217;s slightly modernized, as they would never use soy sauce or ginger in Ossetian food, but both definitely enhance it. Adding fresh garlic at the end is a typical ploy in the Caucasus region. I know it seems crazy to cook fresh herbs for such a long time, but it works, and when you add the fresh herb leaves at the end, it all sings.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Wash the herbs, especially the coriander stalks and roots. Blitz the stalks (reserve the leaves) with the ginger, bay leaf, pomegranate molasses, soy sauce, honey and piri piri in a food processor.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Rub the herb mixture over the ribs and onion in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and place in the refrigerator to marinate for a couple of hours or preferably overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> The next day, place the ribs and their marinade in a large saucepan, add the carrots and tomato pulp, season with salt and pepper, then cook over a low heat for a couple of hours or until the meat is very tender.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> When it is almost ready, add the green pepper and garlic and the herb leaves, chopped. Cook for 5 minutes and then serve.</p>

But this works as a delicious alternative to your regular roast chicken. <strong><em>Levengi</em></strong> means &#8216;inside the stomach&#8217;, and it is used to stuff both poultry and fish. Add some spices to the stuffing and it will be almost festive. A sprinkling of sumac gives an extra sour note, and walnuts add welcome texture.</span></p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is the most popular Georgian dish outside Georgia. The young spatchcocked chickens were traditionally cooked on special tapa skillets, weighted down with a brick. I have recently learned that in Hungary they call it &#8216;iron chicken&#8217;. I can just picture those hefty vintage irons adorning frying pans all over Budapest, sweet garlicky smells penetrating multi-storey blocks of flats. This was the first dish my mother taught me. I was not even remotely interested in cooking then, so I burned it badly. The trick is to keep the hob on the lowest setting. As for the weight, my mother often used my dad&#8217;s old-school circus dumbbell. It was probably not the safest option and I now use my huge granite mortar, but a couple of food cans should also do the job.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy-based skillet or frying pan. Cook the poussins, cut side down, over a medium heat for 3 minutes, then flip them over and cook them skin side down for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Lower the heat and place a cartouche (a circle of baking parchment or greaseproof paper) over the birds, followed by a smaller frying pan on top. Weight it all down with something heavy.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Cook for 20&#8211;25 minutes over the lowest possible heat. To test that the poussins are cooked, pull away at the legs &#8211; they should come away easily and the juices should run clear.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> When the birds are done, lift them out and rest on a chopping board for 5 minutes. Add the herbs to the buttery juices and cook for another minute or two.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This recipe was inspired by <em>tkhemali</em>, a sauce made from green Alycha plums, which is spicy and very tart in its original form. I add black treacle to mine because I am crazy about sweet and sour flavours. So even though this is not a true <em>tkhemali</em> sauce (please forgive me, Georgian <em>mamushkas</em>), the flavour combination of plums or greengages, smoky paprika and a hint of molasses is a winner. You can also substitute treacle with some soft dark brown sugar. Add as much sweetness as you find pleasing, or don&#8217;t add any at all if your plums are very sweet.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Using a thick metal skewer or a thin knife, make long incisions in the pork neck and insert a strip of carrot into each incision. It&#8217;s easier to leave the skewer in as you push the carrot in. If the pork loin piece is long, make some incisions from one end and then from the other. Repeat the &#8216;pierce-and-stick&#8217; action with the garlic.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Strain the brine liquid and, using a marinade injector syringe (my mum used an old Soviet syringe with a thick needle; just thought I&#8217;d mention that), inject the aromatic brine into the pork.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Next, grind the rock salt with the rosemary and thyme into a paste using a pestle and mortar and mix in the sunflower oil. Rub this all over the meat in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> The next day, preheat the oven to 160&#176;C/325&#176;F/Gas Mark 3. Wrap the meat tightly in foil, place in a roasting tin and roast for 1&#189;&#8211;2 hours for pork loin, longer if using pork neck, until cooked through. Let the meat cool completely, then slice and serve as part of a festive spread.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is normally referred to as <strong>&#8216;<em>Ukrayinskyy narkotyk</em>&#8217;</strong>. I am not even joking. Ex-pats have been known to smuggle kilos of this in their suitcases when emigrating or visiting friends in America (I am not revealing any names!). It is happily eaten straight from the freezer, thinly sliced and gently balancing over some warm rye bread. <em>Salo</em>, vodka, raw garlic, tomatoes and some gherkins were offered to my friend Tom by my father, at 4:30am in a frost-bitten field, just before they went wild goose hunting. Tom said he&#8217;d never had a better breakfast. The following curing technique was kindly given to me by a beautiful butcher named Yury, from Kakhovka market. He salted some for me there and then, and I shall not be telling whether I&#8217;ve smuggled some out or not.</span></p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This 1980s number was our family&#8217;s favourite for many years. That is until Uncle Vadik, who had certain fancy connections, bought my mum her first Western cookbook in the mid-1990s (<em>International Family Favorites</em> by Ron Kalenuik, which we still use!). Mr Kalenuik&#8217;s superb French rabbit au vin (with pork belly and mushrooms) had almost irrevocably replaced this old favourite. But we have now decided to bring the 1980s white rabbit back. Don&#8217;t be alarmed by the amount of garlic &#8211; it will mellow and become sweet.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">80g (3oz) butter</p>
<p class="hang">1 rabbit, about 1.25kg (2&#189;lb), jointed</p>
<p class="hang">16 small garlic cloves, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hang">250ml (8fl oz) soured cream or cr&#232;me fra&#238;che</p>
<p class="hang">300ml (&#189; pint) chicken stock or water</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">sea salt flakes</p>
<p class="hang1">fusilli pasta or rice, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the butter in the bottom of a heavy-based pan. Keeping 2 thinly sliced garlic cloves behind for a crispy garnish later, add the rabbit pieces and lace with the remaining garlic slices on top.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix the soured cream and stock or water together and season generously with salt. Pour over the rabbit and bring to boil, then lower the heat and simmer gently for 1&#189; hours or until the rabbit meat falls off the bone.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan and fry the reserved garlic slices until light golden. Be careful not to burn it. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> We love pulling the meat, mixing it with the sauce and serving it with fusilli or rice. Don&#8217;t forget to sprinkle the crispy garlic on top.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch05sec12"><a id="page_140"></a>BBQ Catfish</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Carp and catfish are a big deal in Ukraine. My dad coaches award-winning fishermen and makes his own bait pellets (called &#8216;The Bomb&#8217;, ha!), so there is always freshwater fish in the house. There are a few recipes using tomato sauces, soured cream, caramelized onions and honey, and the following has been inspired by those ingredients rather than a particular recipe. Use any seriously meaty fish if you can&#8217;t find catfish, but I recommend you look for it &#8211; it has a unique flavour. I think they feed on crayfish, and I personally love fish that taste of crustaceans (red mullet being my other favourite). <em>Morkovcha</em> (Korean Carrots) complement this dish perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 6</strong></p>
<p class="hang">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) dark ale</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) clear honey</p>
<p class="hang">3 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
<p class="hang">625g (1&#188;lb) catfish, cut into 100g (3&#189;oz) steaks or about 5cm (2 inches) thick</p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) shallots, sliced</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) plain flour</p>
<p class="hang">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling</p>
<p class="hang">fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang1"><a href="part0006.xhtml#pg88"><em>Morkovcha</em></a>, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Mix the ale, honey and soy sauce together in a dish. Add the catfish, cover with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Place the shallot slices and flour in a bowl, add some salt and pepper and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan until hot. Shake the excess flour off the shallots and fry them for about 5&#8211;7 minutes until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Take the fish out of its marinade and pat it dry with kitchen paper. Oil the barbecue rack really well and barbecue the fish for 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Serve with the crispy shallots and <em>Morkovcha</em> or a garlicky soured cream sauce.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">We grew up eating buckets of these. There was always a teenage boy by the side of the road with a fishing rod and a crayfish dangling from it. They are so good that we don&#8217;t do much to them &#8211; they are simply boiled in very well-salted water with loads of dill heads. We then serve them with ice-cold beer. My mum has been known to eat about 60 in one sitting. I don&#8217;t know what it is about them, but we say they are like sunflower seeds &#8211; very easy to eat loads in one go. When my parents were still students, my mum (who didn&#8217;t know any better) cooked the live crayfish from cold. My dad didn&#8217;t speak to her after that for two weeks. So make sure you pop the crayfish in the water when it&#8217;s at a rolling boil; they will die instantly.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 6 as a beer snack</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2.5 litres (4 pints) water</p>

<p class="hang1">1kg (2lb) live crayfish</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Bring the water, salt and dill to the boil in a large saucepan. Add the crayfish and cook them for 10&#8211;15 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Drain them and serve with beer. Make sure you open the head &#8211; a real connoisseur will suck all the goodness out of that.</p>

During the dodgy 1990s with its racketeering, inflation and general gloom, my beautiful Aunt Lyuda, an artist by trade, couldn&#8217;t find work, so she moved around villages in a van/portable shop. This was one of her bestsellers (crazy, eh?). Come to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4 as a starter</strong></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Next day, wash the salt off the fish, pat dry with kitchen paper and place in a bowl. Add all the remaining ingredients and toss together. Place all of this in a sterilized jar and seal. Keep in the refrigerator and eat the next day.</p>
