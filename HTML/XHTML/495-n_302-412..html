			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page302a">Stews <span class="French-translation">(Ragoûts, Daubes, Sautés . . .)</span></h2>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Braised meats are those which, discreetly moistened, cook slowly over a relatively long period of time. When the meat is cut into pieces, they are dubbed stews and may be said (without denying the <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> its importance) to form the philosophical cornerstone of French family cooking; they embody—or spark—something akin to an ancestral or racial memory of farmhouse kitchens—of rustic tables laid by mothers, grandmothers, or old retainers.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Les petits plats qui mijotent au coin du feu</em> is a phrase that is used like a word and it rarely fails to garnish a conversation about food. It would be unfair to accuse those who use it—albeit at times as a crutch—of leaning on a vain cliché, for they know it—or sense it—to be a magical formula: the incantational touchspring that unites a diverse people in a single reaction. It means “slow-cooking stews,” but it symbolizes “the good life” and somewhere, shadowlike, behind its words lies a half-remembered state of voluptuous, total well-being <em class="ital">(“Là, tout n’est qu’ordre et beauté, luxe, calme et volupté”).</em></p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page303"><em class="ital">Le coin du feu</em> is the hearth that, even for those who have never known it, recalls the security of the family united before it in warmth. But the magic word in the magical phrase is <em class="ital">mijoter.</em> It describes that condition of near suspension in which there is, nonetheless, a whispering movement, a tiny bubble rising here and there to break a stew’s still surface—and it means, at the same time, a slow ripening. The comfortable satisfaction felt upon lifting a lid and glancing at a stew’s surface—the sense that, merely because a liquid’s surface is sustained at precisely the right point of hardly perceptible movement, all is well, the stew’s progress out of one’s hands and its success assured—is familiar to all cooks.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A stew that is boiled will cook no faster, but the meat will always be dry and stringy, the sauce muddy in aspect and in taste, and it will be indigestible, thanks to the emulsion of cooked fats contained in it.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is a question of taste whether the meats be marinated for a few hours (or refrigerated—which greatly slows down the action of the marinade—overnight). Cognac or other strong alcohols may, during the cooking, intervene as flavoring agents but, in a marinade, they rapidly and insidiously render a meat indigestible, stamping it with a putrid, false high-gamy taste. Recipes involving prolonged marinations—3, 4, 5, or 6 days (depending on the season, it is said)—are not uncommon in cookbook literature; they are relics from an unrefrigerated past when marinades served as much to keep meat from spoiling as to heighten its flavor and, to me, they are simple abominations, trailing sleepless nights in their wake.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A stew without the aromatic support of onion is difficult to imagine—carrots and garlic are usual but not inevitable allies. Thyme, commonly assisted by bay leaf, celery, and parsley, is the constant of all bouquets garnis, but it need not be: oregano, savory, and marjoram are among the very useful herbs too often ignored in French kitchens. Nor is a bouquet, in itself, indispensable; its aim is to prevent the herbs from spreading through the sauce in fragments, making them easily removable in a neat bundle. A sauce that is strained will, in any case, eliminate them, and a simple stew with a rough sauce suffers in no way from finely crumbled herbs being scattered through it. A stalk of celery or a bay leaf is easily removed but, if bouquets of parsley or leek greens are used in quantity, it is obviously less messy to tie them up.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page304">Water, stock, leftover roasting juices (fat removed—lamb or mutton juices should not be used with other meats), tomato, and wines are among the more satisfactory moistening agents (in Normandy cider, sometimes reinforced with Calvados, is often used and, in Flanders, beer). Wine may have transcendental powers but, if improperly treated, the sauce will be “winy” and the flavor raw and harsh—distinctly unpleasant. As the principal moistener in a <em class="ital">daube</em> that cooks for a number of hours (and may be further improved by being left to cool, gradually returning to a simmer the following day), it will eventually melt with the aromatic, succulent, gelatinous strains into a single languid and caressing note, but a stew that cooks for less than some 2½ to 3 hours should never be moistened with wine alone unless the sauce be subjected to a further slow cooking and reduction after the meats are removed (or unless the wine has been simmered apart with aromatics for an hour or so before being added to the meats initially). With tender meats—chicken or rabbit—that require no more than 30 or 40 minutes’ cooking from the moment they are moistened, a relatively small quantity of wine should be used to deglaze the pan, and it should be almost entirely reduced before other less temperamental liquids are added.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Stews that involve neither an initial (flour roux) nor a terminal (egg-yolk, cream, <em class="ital">beurre manié,</em> blood . . .) binding are one-step affairs, and <em class="ital">daubes</em> are the prototype: The meats and the aromatic elements are united, moistened and cooked at a muffled simmer until done; the free-floating fat is lifted from the surface and that is all, the limpid, essential juices’ only body deriving from the natural gelatin contained in the meats and the rinds.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page305">The family contains a few eccentric members (the <em class="ital">blanquettes,</em> for instance, the first part of whose cooking is conducted like that of a <em class="ital">daube,</em> the juices being then transformed into a <em class="ital">velouté</em> and, finally, thickened with egg yolks . . .), but <em class="ital">daubes</em> apart, nearly all stews belong to the branch commonly (some say incorrectly) called <em class="ital">sautés</em> (other examples are <em class="ital">carbonnades, gibelottes, matelottes, navarins, boeuf Bourguignon,</em> and <em class="ital">coq-au-vin</em>)—meats and aromatic vegetables sautéed (which translates, in this instance, “colored in fat”), lightly sprinkled with flour (treated like a roux), and moistened. The sauce (of the radical sauté-type—many a stew, from this point on, is simply cooked until done and served) is strained, simmered, skimmed (or “skinned”—a process known as <em class="ital">dépouillement:</em> the combined slow reduction and periodic removal from the sauce’s surface of the repeatedly formed skin into which are drawn the cooked fats and other impurities otherwise held in suspension in any flour-bound sauce), and reduced to a suave essence that is then returned to cloak the meat and its garnish (a choice of vegetables, sometimes in combination with lardons, each of which has been cooked apart in a manner conceived to respect its nature), the ensemble intermingling at a simmer for another quarter of an hour or so. Croutons, sometimes caressed with garlic or tossed in a <em class="ital">persillade,</em> as well as those vegetables that can support no supplementary cooking—green beans, little peas, or broad beans—are scattered about at the moment of serving.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Whereas the soul of a <em class="ital">daube</em> resides in pervasive unity—the perfect fusion or transformation of individual qualities into a single character, a sauté should comprehend an interplay among entities, each jealous of distinctive flavors and textures—piquant in their diversities—but united in harmony by the common veil of sauce.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The following is an attempt to present an abstract recipe that may successfully be adjusted to any meat or poultry—preferably gelatinous cuts or pieces, game birds being, for the most part, excepted. If they are young and tender, their flesh will remain moistly succulent only if roasted or grilled slightly underdone—older specimens may lend fine flavor to a stew, but the flesh will always be dry. Do not forget, meanwhile, that a stew—perfect of its kind—may always be made by throwing pieces of leftover roast or grilled meats or lean meat parings into a couple of spoonsful of hot fat, adding a few minutes later a handful of chopped onions, after another short interval a light sprinkling of flour, a minute later a healthy pinch of dried, crumbled herbs and liquid to cover—if you happen to have a wine glass in hand, empty it in first. Be certain to scrape the bottom well with a wooden spoon to dissolve all caramelized material and simmer for about an hour and a half, carefully removing any fat that appears on the surface . . .</p>

				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">About 5 ounces lean salt pork cut into lardons (⅓-inch widths cut from thick slices), parboiled for a minute or two, rinsed, drained, and cooked until superficially crisp with carrots and onions at the beginning, then put aside to be added with other garnish later on</li>
				<li class="IL">20 to 25 whole onions the size of a small walnut, gently stewed, salted, in butter until just tender but not colored</li>
				<li class="IL">The carrots from the stew—or 5 or 6 ounces peeled small carrots (or carrot sections) cooked with ¼ cup water, salt, pinch sugar, 1 tablespoon butter until tender and glazed, all liquid evaporated</li>
				<li class="IL">8 ounces small mushrooms (or halved or quartered if larger), rapidly sautéed, salted, in butter over high heat</li>
				<li class="IL">Tender artichoke hearts, whole, halved, or quartered, depending on size, stewed, salted, in butter until only just tender</li>
				<li class="IL">1½-inch lengths of leek whites, parboiled at a simmer for about 5 minutes, drained, stewed, salted, in butter</li>
				<li class="IL">Tiny new potatoes, scraped, rinsed, wiped dry, cooked gently, salted, in butter, tossed often, until tender but not browned</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h2 class="Heading-B-ital">The following to be joined to the stew (usually scattered over the surface) only at the moment of serving:</h2>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">Green vegetables (peas, beans, peeled broad beans), rapidly parboiled</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h2 class="Heading-B-ital">(with rabbits and chickens)</h2>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">The liver (cut into small pieces), the heart (thinly sliced), the gizzard (fleshy parts cut free of all gristly skin and thinly sliced), sautéed, salted, together in butter for a few seconds</li>
				<li class="IL">Croutons, cooked gently in butter, tossed often, until golden and crisp but not hard; they may be tossed at the last minute over a higher flame with a persillade—finely chopped or pounded garlic mixed with chopped parsley. For a formal presentation, the stew meats are presented on a heated platter, sauce and other garnish poured over, and the croutons are fashioned—2 or 3 to a slice—from thin slices of bread, in the form of triangles, a clove of garlic rubbed over each crisp triangle, a point of each dipped first in sauce, then in chopped parsley, and arranged, crown-like, parsleyed tips pointing out, around the edge of the platter</li>
				<li class="IL" id="page309">Chopped fines herbes (tarragon does not mix well with herbs other than parsley, chives, and chervil, but it may be used alone, discreetly, and is more interesting with white meats; it also goes well with tomatoed sauces), fresh basil flowers and leaves torn to fragments, finely chopped fresh marjoram flowers and leaves, small amount of finely chopped tender young savory (best mixed with parsley)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">The strips of fat pork, rolled and tossed until well coated in the mixture of garlic, herbs, and seasoning, are each forced with one’s finger into a deep, narrow incision pierced with the grain of the meat using a small knife; depending on the size and the structure of each piece of meat, it may receive one, two, or three lardons. The double purpose of seasoning interiorly, forming tiny pockets of isolated flavor, and nourishing it to keep it moist is served particularly well with long-cooking stews, although rabbit—and especially the saddle section—also profits from this treatment. The aromatic elements may be altered to taste. The meats should be larded before being put into a marinade.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Use, if possible, a heavy copper <em class="ital">plat à sauter</em> for the browning process, large enough to hold all the pieces of meat at their ease, side by side. Lacking that, use a skillet and transfer everything to a large <em class="ital">cocotte</em> for the braising process.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If the garnish includes lean salt-pork lardons, begin cooking them in the fat over a medium flame until they begin to take on color. Add the carrots and onions and cook all together, stirring or tossing regularly, for about ½ hour, removing the lardons and putting vegetables aside as each arrives at the correct stage of surface crispness and color. The carrots and onions should be lightly colored, the onions caramelized but not dark brown. Empty them into a sieve, being certain that no fragment of onion remains in the pan (it would burn over the high heat necessary to brown the meat, lending an acrid taste to the sauce), and return the fat to the pan.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page310">If the pieces of meat have been marinated, drain them (collecting the liquid for subsequent moistening), sponge each dry with a towel or absorbent paper, and salt on all sides. Brown them over high heat in the same pan and the same fat used for the vegetables, turning the heat up or down as necessary to keep them from either stewing or burning and, when all are regularly colored on all surfaces, sprinkle over the sugar (if included), turning the meats around, permitting it to caramelize lightly, thus reinforcing the color of the sauce and effacing the flat sweetness of the sugar.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Lower the heat, sprinkle over the flour, and continue turning the pieces of meat until the flour is lightly colored. Turn the heat up and moisten, first with the marinade—if the meats were marinated—or with wine, scraping vigorously all the surfaces of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula to dislodge and dissolve all traces of caramelized adherences. If tomato is used, add it at this point, reducing it with the wine so that it may cook apart a bit, mingling with and coating the meat—or, if no wine is used, add the tomato, stirring around well before adding the other liquids. Return the onions and carrots to the pan, add the garlic (if it has not been added with the marinade) and the cayenne, and tuck the bouquet garni into the heart of the thing. If an <em class="ital">eau de vie</em> is to be added, heat it in a small saucepan, set fire to it, and, when the flame has subsided, pour it over. Add enough stock or water to barely cover the contents of the pan, gently packed together so that they may be moistened with a minimum of liquid, bring to a boil, and adjust the heat so that, covered, the liquid’s surface is maintained at the suggestion of a simmer (if you have been working with a pan—or with pans—too small to contain all the ingredients, transfer meats, vegetables, and bouquet to a large <em class="ital">cocotte</em> before sprinkling the pans first with sugar, then with flour, deglazing, and, finally, pouring the slightly thickened liquid over the meats and vegetables to cover). The stew may be cooked in a slow oven or on top of the stove—the precise adjustment of heat necessary to maintain the desired simmer is more easily achieved on top.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page311">Skim off surface fat two or three times and, when the meat is tender—still slightly firm, remove it, piece by piece, to a plate and pour the remaining contents of the pan into a large, fine sieve placed over a saucepan. If a particularly delicate, translucid sauce is desired, press the solid remainder gently to extract all the juices and discard the vegetables and the bouquet. For a rougher sauce with more body, remove the carrots (they may be added to the meats to serve as garnish—overcooked and impregnated with flavors other than their own, they add little; their work has already been done), press the bouquet and discard it, and purée the onions and garlic into the sauce.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Return the meat to its cooking vessel, add the garnishes chosen from the first part of the list, cover, and put aside until the sauce is ready.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Bring the sauce to a boil and move the saucepan somewhat to the side of a medium flame in order to maintain a light boil at one side only of the sauce’s surface. A skin will form on the undisturbed part of the surface that should be gently pulled to the edge with a tablespoon, removed, and discarded. Give it time to form—the firmer it is, the more fat and impurities will be contained in it and the easier it will be to remove. Repeat this procedure four or five times over a period of ½ hour or so. If at this point the sauce isn’t sufficiently reduced (there should be only enough to generously coat the meats and garnish and it should be light-bodied but consistent—not watery), turn the flame high for a couple of minutes and reduce, stirring the while with a wooden spoon. Taste for salt.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Grind pepper to taste over the meat and garnish, pour the sauce evenly over, return to a boil over a low flame and simmer, covered, for another 15 or 20 minutes, gently shaking the pan from time to time to encourage the intermingling of flavors and the even coating of all the elements by the sauce. Remove any further evidence of fat on the surface (cast off by the lardons or the vegetables that have been cooked in butter), soaking it up with the corner of a paper towel, if in tiny globules. Scatter over the terminal garnish, freshly prepared, and serve, preferably from the cooking vessel.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page312">Dry Heat: Roast and Grilled Meats <span class="French-translation">(Chaleur Sêche: Viandes Rôties Et Grillées)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">An uncomplicated roast is better cooked before an open fire than in an oven, probably because it turns in a dry open air unoppressed by vapors and condensations of moisture, although, just as a fireplace that does not smoke will perfume a room deliciously with the odor of burning wood, the flames, their smoke rising with only their heat radiating outward, undoubtedly alter the flavor in a delicately different way from the heat of an oven.</p>
			<p class="Normal">But so many things influence taste . . . The eloquence of a roast slowly turning before living flames, its visible transfiguration as it contracts, swells, and, fondled by repeated basting, assumes a luxuriant brown satin glaze, has an entrancing effect on a company. If a leg of lamb spitted in a fireplace seems more succulent than its delicious counterpart roasted in an oven, so much the better—nothing, in any case, ever tastes better than it is (in the absence of euphory, things rarely taste as good as they are . . .); perhaps the ritual beauty of the thing and the excitement and suspense it engenders collaborate to rivet attentions and sharpen palates in the service of total appreciation. I remain convinced of the matter-of-fact superiority of a roast cooked in this way; beyond the fireplace, the turnspit, and something to serve as a dripping pan, no special equipment is essential—although an upright grill within the fireplace, designed to hold the burning logs, provides a more manageable source of heat—a solid face of flames—than a fire built on the hearth itself. The intensity of the heat is controlled by adjusting the distance of the spit from the source of heat.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The flavor of grilled meats depends on the nature of the wood burned: fruit woods are most satisfactory and, for rapid grills that do not need a bed of coals of great sustaining power, dried grapevine prunings, reduced in a holocaust of flame to incandescent embers in the space of a few minutes’ time, will put other woods to shame. A fire fed regularly with logs for heating purposes contains an incandescent heart from which a bed of coals may be raked to the side or the front but, if a fire is built specifically for purposes of grilling, care should be taken to choose relatively small wood all of approximately the same size; the smaller wood will, otherwise, have dissipated into ash before the larger pieces are reduced to coals. A preheated heavy welded iron grill with feet 3 to 3½ inches high gives the best results. It may be placed over the coals to heat before the flames and smoke have completely disappeared, but only glowing coals should be in evidence when the meat is placed there and, for that needing a longer cooking period (poultry, lamb’s shoulder . . .), the bed of coals should be deep but its intensity should be allowed to subside a bit, a film of gray ash veiling the embers’ ardor. In the absence of a fireplace or a back yard in which to build a bonfire, charcoal barbecue devices are practical; when circumstances permit, a bundle of dried fruitwood branches added to the hot coals and left to blaze up and die down before grilling the meat will improve the result—commercialized charcoals often stamp foods with strange flavors.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page313">Meats, whether oven roasted, turned in the open, grilled, broiled, or pan fried, will always cook better if at room temperature, rather than chilled, at the moment they are put to cook. A steak should be removed from refrigeration at least ½ to 1 hour earlier and a leg of lamb 2 or 3 hours earlier. Roasts should be salted some 10 minutes after being put to cook; grilled meats should be salted on the side first to be grilled at the moment they are thrown on the grill and on the other side just before turning. The searing process prevents any loss of juices that the salt might otherwise draw out.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Olive oil is the best fat for rubbing roasts and grills, both for the quality of the coloration and of the flavor. The thin sheets of fat pork <em class="ital">(bardes de lard)</em> commonly wrapped around all roasts in France are valuable only for poultry and, especially, for game birds and guinea fowl, whose breasts would otherwise be overcooked and dried out before the legs were sufficiently cooked. They should be unwrapped and frequently basted for the last 10 minutes or so of cooking. The old-fashioned method of larding a roast’s surface by threading narrow strips of fat pork into and out of the flesh with a larding needle is another thing, and it is a pity that it has, for the most part, been abandoned; the lardons nourish the meat interiorly and exteriorly while permitting the surface to brown at the same time, and the decorative effect is delicious—their presence, however, should not proscribe rubbing the roast in olive oil and subsequent basting. Grilled meats should be basted but slightly each time, preferably with a brush or a bouquet of herbs, to discourage fat’s falling onto the coals and blazing up.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page314">Although I think it a mistake to scatter herbs over certain meats before grilling—good beef, for instance—any meat will be enhanced by the slight caress of smoke from a handful of herbs being tossed onto the coals shortly before removing it from the grill; the most exciting is that of rosemary.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Meats to be served rare or pink throughout, if left to relax in a warm place for a period of time relative to their size—5 minutes or so for a steak and up to ½ hour for a large leg of lamb—will be tenderer and more succulent; the heat contained within the meat will continue to penetrate to the heart and the juices will be freed, a relaxed firmness supplanting the somewhat rubbery, elastic resistance of uncooked flesh. This may not always seem practical for grilled meats (I usually place the meat on a heated plate, cover it with another heated plate or shallow bowl, and leave it for a few minutes on the edge of the grill), but it is important for a roast. For an open roast, leave it, unspitted, in the dripping pan, near the fire, covered by some preheated container; for an oven roast, remove it from the oven to arrest the cooking, turn the oven off (leaving the door open if it holds heat well), and return it to the warm oven a few minutes later.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page315" style="page-break-before:always;">Lamb and Mutton</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Agneau et Mouton</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">The flesh of grass or yearling lamb (often incorrectly and confusingly called “baby lamb”) is tender but its structure is that of a mature animal. It is, when of good quality, well furnished with white, dry, and rather crumbly fat and the flesh is a clear rose-tan. Older mutton has a reddish-brown flesh and the flavor is stronger, but all the methods of treating it are the same. Milk lamb, a traditional Easter dish, has a pale grayish-pink flesh, is best roasted to assume a glorious, crackly golden surface; it should always be cooked well done. It is as different from grass lamb as is veal from beef and, for those of delicate digestion, should probably be avoided. All of the following recipes are for grass or yearling lamb.</p>
			<p class="Normal">American habits of cutting lamb are a windfall to the stewmaker and a disaster for the roaster: The shanks (easily the best stew pieces for flavor, moistness, and leanness) are chopped off both the legs and the shoulders, a “leg of lamb” being often composed only of the upper half of the leg plus a section of the saddle, creating a bizarre form and a complication of bone structure at the heart of the roast that renders both decent presentation and elegant carving out of the question; the animals are usually split and often cut up in advance, thus destroying the double saddle, one of the handsomest and, when kept pink, finest of roasts . . . If you have a good butcher and order in advance, everything can be arranged. Lamb should be aged for perfect flavor and tenderness; American butchers are often more serious on this score than the French.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The spareribs are the most economical and probably the commonest stew cut. They are, for some tastes, unpleasantly fat and their structure does not permit its being removed; unless you are certain of your company, you’d best stick to the shanks. Stock will not improve a lamb stew, but a certain amount of tomato will flatter its distinctive flavor and lend warmth to the sauce. A <em class="ital">navarin,</em> the classic French lamb stew, is prepared like the stew recipe-type, moistened only with water and about ½ cup of puréed tomato (or one large, ripe, peeled, seeded, and chopped tomato) and garnished with butter-cooked little onions, carrots, and tender young turnips, tiny new potatoes being put to cook in the sauce during the last ½ hour and freshly shelled little peas during the last 10 or 15 minutes; butter-stewed artichoke hearts provide a lovely garnish, better alone than in combination with others—or precooked white beans may be drained and simmered in the stew for the last ½ hour or so. Chopping the onions finely (they may be cooked directly with the meat after it has half browned), eliminating the initial flour thickening, and increasing the quantity of tomato, the stew may be transformed into a sublime pilaf by the addition, some 45 minutes before serving, of a cup of long-grain rice that has first been cooked dry over low heat in a spoonful of butter or olive oil, stirred regularly, until the grains turn opaque or “milky.” Before adding the rice, carefully skim the sauce of all fat. Stir in the rice so that no grain remains unsubmerged, and then do not touch it until it is done.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Daube à l’Avignonnaise</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Were lambs’ trotters marketed in the United States, they would replace the calf’s foot or the pig’s feet in this recipe. White beans usually accompany this <em class="ital">daube;</em> fresh egg noodles seem to me the perfect accompaniment. The white wine may be replaced by red wine. The thyme may be eliminated from the bouquet and either it alone or a mixture of dried, crumbled herbs sprinkled over the layers of meats and vegetables. The presence of dried orange peel in a bouquet is specifically Provençal and was originally that of the bitter Seville orange, or <em class="ital">bigarrade</em> (just as duck in orange was originally wild duck finished with a bit of bitter orange juice for relief: <em class="ital">canard à la bigarrade</em>). A 5- or 6-inch strip (when freshly peeled; dried, it will wither to a small curl) is about right. It is practical to keep a few dried peels ready for use in a jar; peel the orange thinly to eliminate the white inner part, string the peels up with needle and thread, and hang them so that air circulates freely around each until well dried—3 or 4 days.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The stew will be at its best if prepared the previous day, left at room temperature, uncovered, overnight, skimmed of surface fat the following day, slowly reheated, and left to simmer for another ½ hour or so.</p>

Sprinkle with Cognac, strain over the marinade through a sieve, and add just enough water to cover.

			<p class="Normal-noind">Irish stew is the common denominator of all the meat and potato <em class="ital">daubes</em> and, by virtue of its purity, it may be the best. The French have long since adopted it, and it is, apparently, closer to theirs than to the Irish heart, possibly because of its affinity to cool, young Beaujolais. A typically French refinement consists of using two different potato varieties in alternating layers, one a firm, waxy-fleshed type that will not cook apart and the other a soup variety that melts into a purée, forming the body of the sauce.</p>

An asbestos pad may be necessary to disperse the heat—the shanks should only very gently stew in their own juices. In heavy copper their natural juices will hold for about 1 hour—in other metals, for a much shorter time.

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">8</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The recipe may, of course, be halved; it is convenient to prepare two shoulders because of the way the tied-up melon forms fit so neatly into an oval <em class="ital">cocotte,</em> a bouquet garni wedged between them, thus solving once again the sempiternal braising problem of filling all possible space so that complete immersion may be achieved with a minimum quantity of liquid. For a single shoulder it is best to eliminate the cumbersome bouquet garni, substituting a loose bay leaf and a healthy pinch of crumbled herbs and replacing the <em class="ital">cocotte</em> with a heavy saucepan.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Boning is merely a highly simplified exercise in dissection; a superficial understanding of the structure at hand and a small, sharply pointed knife are the only prerequisites to a rapid execution (a boning knife is useful because the large handle may be firmly grasped while directing the small, pointed blade, but a sharp paring knife will serve perfectly well).</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page322">To Bone a Shoulder</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Place the shoulder skin side down (cut side facing up) on the table. It contains three bones: the shoulder blade, a flat, triangular wing with a rudder-like protrusion on the under side; the marrow bone of the upper foreleg, a straight bone with knobs at either end (the dog’s bone of the comic strips); the lower foreleg (shank), a straight bone that thickens and curves slightly as it moves into the knuckle.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Move the joints back and forth several times to familiarize yourself with the structure. Feel with your fingertips the shoulder blade, the better to define its form. Make a straight incision, cutting to the bone, from the point of the shoulder blade at the first joint, moving outward to the extremity of the shoulder and describing approximately the triangle’s median. Fold the flesh back, to the right and to the left, from the bone, forcing with fingertips and scraping with the knife blade. When the upper surface and the borders of the shoulder blade are entirely exposed, feel your way, going slowly the first time, with the tip and the blade of the knife, alternating with fingertips, following the contours of the underside of the bone and trying not to cut through the skin at the point at which the rudder shape approaches the surface. Grasp the freed shoulder blade in one hand and the lower part of the shoulder in the other and crack the underside smartly against the edge of the table at the joint. The bone will not come completely free, but will be torn out of joint so that you may see clearly the points at which to sever tendons and cartilage with the knife tip and where to scrape free the extremities of flesh touching the joint.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Make an incision to the bone between the shoulder joint and the upper shank joint, free the flesh (the marrow bone is simple in form and the flesh offers little resistance except for the tendonous attachments at the joints) and crack the shank joint against the table edge as before; a protuberant extremity of the shank joint often breaks free at this point, but it may easily be cut free from the flesh after the marrow bone is removed. Separate the flesh from the shank bone in the same way, making a circular incision to the bone at its base, just above the hock, to free it completely. Turn the shoulder over and remove all excess fat.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page325">	Marinate the shoulders for several hours or, refrigerated, overnight, turning them around several times in the marinade.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Smear the interior surfaces of the shoulders with the <em class="ital">persillade</em> and seasonings, gather the extremities in upon themselves, forming each shoulder firmly in your hands and turning it over on the table, leaving only smooth skin surface in view; the form should be that of a slightly flattened sphere. The <em class="ital">persillade</em> clings to the surface on which it has been smeared and is, therefore, enclosed, albeit imperfectly, within the shoulder, which has been closed up. If another, more plentiful stuffing is used (usually a bread and <em class="ital">fines herbes</em>—or bread and <em class="ital">persillade</em>—I often add fresh marjoram and egg and chopped beef marrow), the shoulder must then be tied up, the stuffing enclosed, before turning it over. Tie up the shoulders, using a length of about 1½ yards kitchen string for each. Feel your way and take your time; a length of string should be first tied, forcing slightly, around the “waist,” then the form should be encircled in the other sense (vertically) at least four times and, if necessary to hold it neatly and firmly in its melon form, five or six times. Once the first vertical round is tied in place, the top-center of the melon may be used as an apex at which point the string is repeatedly looped and circled vertically around the melon again. It should, in the course of its journey, be looped occasionally around the horizontal round of string, the better to hold everything, un-budging, in place.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Wipe the tied shoulders dry with a towel, sprinkle them with salt, and brown them lightly on all sides in a skillet or other heavy pan in about 3 tablespoons olive oil, over a medium flame—there should be no smoking or burned oil. Transfer them to an oval <em class="ital">cocotte</em> just large enough to hold them without forcing, the bouquet garni fitted in between them.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cook the carrots, turnips, and onions in the same pan, salting lightly and adding a bit more oil if necessary, over a low flame, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for 15 or 20 minutes—until softened but not browned. Stir in the garlic and pack the mixture gently around the shoulders and the bouquet, filling all spaces. Deglaze the pan with the marinade, pour it and the white wine over the meat and vegetables, and add enough boiling water to almost cover the shoulders. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, at a bare simmer for 1½ hours. Remove the shoulders and the bouquet and pour the vegetables into a sieve, gathering the braising liquid in a saucepan. Return the meat, the bouquet, and the vegetables to the <em class="ital">cocotte</em> as before. Reduce the liquid in the saucepan, skimming it first several times, the pan kept slightly to the side of the flame, a light boil maintained only at one section of the surface, then boiling rapidly over a high flame, stirring all the while, until slightly syrupy in consistency—it should be reduced by about two thirds.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page326">While the meat and the first batch of vegetables have been cooking, the peppers and eggplant will have been put to cook, salted, in about 3 tablespoons olive oil, over a medium low flame, tossed regularly, until softened; add the tomatoes and the sugar and cook, tossing regularly or stirring cautiously, for about 15 minutes longer or until all of the tomatoes’ water has been evaporated. Add these vegetables to the <em class="ital">cocotte,</em> pour over the reduced juices, shake the container gently to settle the contents, and cook, covered, still at a bare simmer, for another hour.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove the shoulders, discard the bouquet, pour the vegetables into a sieve, and, when well drained, arrange them on a large, deep heated platter. Clip the strings from the shoulders, place them on the bed of vegetables, and sprinkle the whole with basil or parsley. Skim any fat off the cooking juices and serve the liquid apart in a sauceboat. Cut the meat into wedges.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Gigot en Marinade Rôti</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">6</span> to <span class="oldstyle">8</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Order the leg from your butcher ahead of time; the leg bone should be sawed off at the extremity of the shank, just above the knuckle joint, and the leg should be cut somewhat above the pelvic joint—more or less depending on the size desired—and boned as far as the joint (that is to say, the section of pelvic bone removed) but no more. Correct carving is impossible in the interfering presence of the pelvic bone, but a boned leg of lamb, whatever its other virtues, always suffers a loss of succulence that refined little forcemeats do nothing to redeem.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page327">Preferences in degrees of doneness may legitimately vary from rare to pink (which means well done in France), but those who are nervous if flesh is not cooked until gray will never understand what a glorious thing roast lamb can be; count from 10 to 12 minutes per pound, depending on the degree of doneness (from 45 minutes to 1 hour and 10 minutes should encompass both extremes, size being taken into account) and from 15 minutes to ½ hour of relaxation in a warm place (the time necessary to eat the preceding course—the relaxation period should not be too brief, but it may be prolonged with no damage done).</p>
			<p class="Normal">If rosemary grows in abundance and if the leg of lamb is being spit roasted, shortly before unspitting it remove the dripping pan for a minute while holding a large bouquet of smoldering rosemary beneath the revolving joint . . .</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 leg of lamb, pared clean of surface fat</li>
				<li class="IL">1 teaspoon crumbled mixed herbs (thyme, oregano, savory)</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup dry white wine</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Mix the herbs and the seasonings together. Pierce the roast deeply and repeatedly on all sides with a small, sharply pointed knife, directing it on a bias toward the bone, each time forcing a small pinch of the seasoned herbs deeply into the vent with your finger. Rub all over with olive oil, pour over the wine, and turn the roast around in its marinade several times over a period of a couple of hours or so.</p>
			<p class="Normal">For an oven roast, wipe it dry with a towel (this is not necessary for an open roast), rub it again with olive oil, seasoning with salt and pepper at the same time, place it in a shallow oven dish just large enough to hold it, and start it in a 450° oven, turning it down to 375° after about 10 minutes. A spit roast is best salted and peppered only some 15 minutes after it has been turning. Begin basting, in either case, after about ½ hour, first only with the fat drippings (or with a bit of olive oil if they are too sparse), then 10 minutes or so later, as the roast begins to color, begin basting with the marinade: For an oven roast, add a spoonful to the pan from time to time, basting with the mingled juices in the bottom of the pan and adding no more marinade until the liquid in the pan has nearly disappeared; for a spit roast, all of the marinade may be added to the dripping pan, washed around that part closest to the fire occasionally to keep it deglazed, while basting regularly at the same time. The liquid will dissolve the caramelized meat juices, reducing to a syrupy consistency, and the meat, from repeated basting, will acquire a rich, glossy surface; basting and roasting should be conducted in such a way that practically no juice remains in the roasting or dripping pan when the roast is done. What little juice remains in the pan should be poured over the roast at the time of serving, so that as the meat is carved the juices that flow from within will mingle with the basting juices, a spoonful or so taken from the tilted platter to pour over each serving.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">“Mutton Chops” Grillés</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">An unboned shoulder is also marvelous grilled, its only drawback being the impossibility of neat carving; after surface fat has been removed, it should be slashed to the bone on both sides (about ½-inch-deep slashes) several times at about 1½-inch distances to permit the heat to penetrate and cook the meat in a regular way. It is then treated in the same way as chops (herbs and oil being rubbed well into the slashes, as well); a shoulder requires about the same length of cooking time as a thick chop, but since it has only two sides on which to grill, whereas a chop has five, the former is sometimes a bit charred when finished—few people mind that and some prefer a lightly charred surface.</p>
			<p class="Normal">For those who prefer the savor of a single herb, oregano has a distinct affinity to lamb and may easily replace the thyme-savory-oregano mixture that recurs throughout this book.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The apron of a loin chop is usually rolled up and fixed into place against the filet mignon with a small skewer. I have come to prefer wrapping it fairly tightly around the entire chop for several reasons: It, unlike the filet and the filet mignon, is best well done—even rather crisp—and only in this way is its entire surface exposed to crisping; it protects both the filet and the filet mignon from too much exposure to direct heat so that they cook more slowly and remain, if desired, pink throughout; if the apron is rolled against the filet mignon, the protection is so thick as to keep it nearly raw, while the filet may be overcooked.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST" id="page330">				
				<li class="IL">1 loin chop per person, 2½ to 3 inches thick</li>
				<li class="IL">1 pinch mixed herbs per chop</li>
				<li class="IL">Olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Remove all fat except for the bit joining the apron (the extension of belly which is always left attached to loin chops or saddle roasts) to the filet and carefully remove all layers of membranous tissue and fat from between the thin layers of flesh composing the apron. Sprinkle lightly with herbs and rub all over with olive oil. Pull the apron gently up over the filet mignon, across the flat bone end of the chop and down against the filet as far as it will reach, fixing it in place by running a small skewer or sharpened stick through the chop, piercing the apron wrap on both sides; thus prepared, the form should be that of a solid block of approximately equal thicknesses in all senses. Grill the chops on a preheated grill over a bed of coals of moderate intensity and good depth, counting about ½ hour and turning them every 3 or 4 minutes; first sear the two exposed filet surfaces and finish cooking by turning from one part to another of the apron surface (which will be so formed as to present three additional grilling surfaces—a swelled triangular form), the longest and last amount of time being given to the apron-covered bone surface (the bone disperses the heat, which radiates around the chop and penetrates more gently to the heart—the heat should also be lessened during the last 8 or 10 minutes by spreading out the coals, moving the chops to the edge of the grill, or by raising the grill, the relaxation period being incorporated into the final part of the cooking).</p>

Beige-colored lambs’ kidneys are delicate in flavor; if dark reddish black, they tend to be strong. The lambs’ kidneys may be replaced by a veal kidney, membrane removed, split lengthwise, interior fat cut out, each half sliced crosswise into to 1-inch thicknesses. Sharpened rosemary branches, a tuft of leaves left at the unsharpened end, may replace metal skewers, affording much the prettiest and most appetizing presentation.

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Animelles d’Agneau; Rognons Blancs</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Of great delicacy and, in the past, much used as a garnish in combination with little quenelles for vols-au-vent and similar dishes, testicles have, apparently, fallen from grace—at least in the cookbooks; their abundance in the market is sufficient proof that they are still appreciated in French homes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Whatever their ultimate preparation, they should always be first peeled, disgorged, and parboiled (usually they are soaked for several hours in cold water, then parboiled, before being peeled, which serves little purpose, the impermeable skins’ preventing disgorgement): Only the egg-like form of flesh is retained; it is contained within a tough, loose outer skin and two inner skins, the last of which clings tightly to the flesh. Split the skins the entire length of the swelled surface with a sharp knife—you will have to cut some quarter of an inch into the flesh—and carefully peel the oval flesh form free, damaging it as little as possible. Put to soak in a basin of cold water for about 3 hours, changing the water two or three times. Transfer to a saucepan, cover largely with cold water, salt, bring to a boil, simmer for 6 or 7 minutes, drain, plunge into cold water and leave until cool. They may be kept, drained and refrigerated, in a covered bowl or wrapped in plastic, for a day or so before being used.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Frivolities are often braised like sweetbreads, but prolonged cooking toughens the flesh. To best retain their tender delicacy, cut them into ¼-inch slices and stew them simply in butter, tossing occasionally, for 6 or 7 minutes, adding chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> at the halfway point (tarragon is very much at home in this context) and finishing with a few drops of lemon juice. Cream may be added or a cream and egg-yolk mixture thickened over low heat, stirring constantly, without approaching the boil; they may be tossed in olive oil over high heat and finished with a <em class="ital">persillade</em> and a bit of lemon like the hearts and liver in the preceding recipe; or attractive stews may be imagined in combination with veal kidneys, sweetbreads, mushrooms, etc., each prepared separately to suit its demands and combined at the last moment in the sauce of one or another. Dipped in batter and deep fried, they are exquisite.</p>

Slip them all at once into the frying batter and, when the oil is hot enough to sizzle when a drop of batter touches the surface, pick them out of the batter, one by one, in a teaspoon, making certain that each is well coated in batter before dropping it into the hot oil. Do not try to fry too many at a time. When golden and crisp on the underside, turn each over in the oil with the tines of a fork and, when done, remove with a large flat wire spoon, first to absorbent paper to drain the excess of oil, then to a folded napkin arranged on a heated platter. Keep them covered with the napkin while frying the others. The flame may have to be adjusted a couple of times during the frying process. When the last fritter is removed from the oil, throw in the parsley, leaving it only long enough to have finished sputtering—when it is quiet, remove it, drain it a moment, and transfer it delicately to the fritters’ surface.

			<p class="Normal-noind">Veal sautés all follow the basic pattern outlined in the <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page306">sauté recipe-type</a>. The meat is not larded. Most are deglazed with white wine, which is almost completely reduced, lightly tomatoed, and moistened with veal stock. A veal Marengo hardly differs from the Milanese <em class="ital">osso-bucco</em> except that the sauce of the former is sieved; the bones are missing, as is the genial <em class="ital">gremolata</em> (garlic <em class="ital">persillade</em> mixed with grated lemon and orange peel) and the wonderful <em class="ital">risotto</em> accompaniment (Piedmont rice, which, by nature, is gummier than others, cooked in a suggestion of olive oil like a pilaf, onion and saffron flavored, moistened first with white wine and, as the liquid is absorbed, repeatedly remoistened with veal stock or water, stirred well after each moistening to enhance the natural gumminess, and, finally, stirred up with grated cheese and butter—a revelation in sticky sensuosity). Both, however, are deglazed with white wine and moistened uniquely with tomato—or, at the most, a bit of veal stock added as a symbolic gesture. A veal <em class="ital">matelotte</em> is moistened with about 2 parts of red wine to 1 of veal stock or water and garnished with the <em class="ital">Bourguignon</em> little onions, sautéed mushrooms, and browned salt pork lardons; calves’ lungs may be prepared in exactly the same way (they should be beaten first to rid them of their air) and are delicious—the sauce, in either instance, should be cooked apart, skimmed, and reduced for a good ½ hour after the meats are done.</p>

It goes without saying that it is entirely different from both in effect.

			<p class="Normal-noind">Veal is the most versatile of meats; its succulent juices, the flesh colored in a bit of fat, rapidly caramelize to form, when de-glazed, the finest of simple meat-sauce bases; the flavor, apparently anonymous in its lack of eccentricity, is nonetheless of a sapid density and a chameleon receptivity that demand only the spark of one or a combination of other agents—wine, lemon, sorrel, mustard, herbs, aromatic vegetables—to open up a sharply defined personality. Thick chops or a small roast from a moist cut—round heel, for instance—cooked gently in a covered heavy pan, copper, earthenware or iron, in a bit of butter or olive oil with pieces of onion or whole small onions, carrot, unpeeled garlic cloves, a bouquet or a pinch of herbs, turned regularly and, once the meat and vegetables have begun to color and caramelized scrapings have formed in the bottom of the pan, moistened lightly with a white wine or one of the fortified wines, will eventually, after repeated moistenings, be enveloped in a voluptuous, syrupy glaze that is one of the glories of old-fashioned French home cooking. The process is one of repeated deglazing. The liquid must be added in small quantities at a time, never more than a film in the bottom of the pan, and it should be permitted to completely evaporate, caramelized adherences beginning to re-form in the pan before more is added. After the first couple of deglazings, it is best to substitute water or veal stock for the wine, particularly if it is one of the richly flavored fortified wines—and a close eye should be kept throughout, for a sumptuous glaze may, in a moment’s time, be transformed into an acrid disaster should any element begin to burn . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page340">Veal birds (<em class="ital">paupiettes de veau,</em> also quaintly called <em class="ital">alouettes sans têtes</em> or “headless larks”) may be glazed like the chops discussed above or they may be treated like a stew, the sauce usually being generously tomatoed. The cutlets used for their assemblage should be cut thinly from a single muscular structure so that the body of the cutlet is of a solid piece; they should be trimmed and lightly but firmly flattened (not pounded) with the flat of a large heavy knife blade or cleaver. The stuffing should be in the spirit of a <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page195"><em class="ital">farci</em></a>. Too often it is only ground sausage meat, which cooks into a savorless, hard, and heavy ball. A good stuffing may be prepared like the mixture of the following recipe (sweetbread loaf), substituting for the sweetbreads ½ pound or so of chopped lean veal, pork, or leftover meats and a couple of ounces of chopped fatback or beef marrow, eliminating 1 or 2 eggs, and leaning more heavily on the herbs. A heaping tablespoonful is rolled into each cutlet, its sides first neatly tucked in, and the giant cork shape is looped twice around the “waist,” once around the long way and tied with kitchen string (in the south of France, housewives often secure them with thread wrapped dozens of times around, a detestable practice that may be easier than tying up a neat and simple package; to be faced with such a mess on one’s plate is upsetting). The <em class="ital">bardes,</em> or sheets of fat pork often wrapped around them, nourish them very little, prevent their coloration, and render the sauce troublesomely greasy. Larding is not essential, but the meat’s surface interlarded with narrow strips of fatback, using a larding needle, will give happier results than <em class="ital">bardes.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">Unless they be used as a wrap for veal birds, veal cutlets, being so thin, really shouldn’t be cooked in contact with liquid; it is done, but they are always dry. If they are sautéed rapidly—they should be only just done—the pan will still contain enough scrapings to form the base of a simple sauce. Remove the cutlets while finishing the sauce. Formulas for sauced cutlets are endless, but they are all pretty much the same. If chopped shallots or finely sliced mushrooms find their place, they are sautéed rapidly before the pan is deglazed—usually with a fortified wine—and the liquid radically reduced (juices that drain from the cutlets are poured back into the pan). Sometimes the reduction is the sauce—or butter may be swirled into it away from the heat. Often it is finished with heavy cream, which is then boiled down to the desired consistency before the cutlets are slipped back into it to reheat (without boiling). Wine omitted, the pan may be deglazed directly with cream, a bit of lemon juice added at the last minute for relief. Dried morels may serve as a garnish and, after being soaked and cleansed, should be stewed gently apart, first in butter, then in cream, the lot being then combined with the deglazing reduction. Or any of a variety of vegetable stews may be tossed with it. Fresh parboiled little peas are an exquisite last-minute addition to a creamed sauce . . . And so forth.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page341">The goodness of breaded veal cutlets is sealed in, the juices (that, freed by other cooking methods, may be transfigured into burnished glaze or fragrant broth) remaining virgin. They, too, should be trimmed free of any fragments of fat, skin, or nervous tissue surrounding them and slightly flattened, the muscular structure sufficiently bruised to relax and not shrink during the cooking, but they should not be pounded to paper-thin death, the fiber hopelessly crushed and unable to contain its natural moisture. An hour’s marinade (in a bit of lemon juice, a few drops of olive oil, and either finely chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes,</em> including a bit of tarragon, or a pinch of finely crumbled dried herbs, including oregano) will lend relief to veal’s bland savor. For sharper, but less delicate relief, the cutlets may, first salted and peppered, be lightly spread with Dijon mustard before being breaded. If marinated, they should be sponged gently dry and then salted and peppered just before breading.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A light coating of flour before the passage in egg will greatly increase the adhesive quality of the breading, but the pastiness within the casing is always vaguely unpleasant (not so if lightly floured, dipped in egg, and sautéed without being breaded—the flour then becomes an integral part of the slightly crisp, batter-like surface). I usually dredge them in freshly grated Parmesan instead of flour, but sometimes dip them directly into the egg.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The spoonful or so of water that is usually added to the egg—beaten only enough to mix yolk and white—is designed to prevent the casing’s buckling while cooking.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Finely crumbled stale, but not dried out, crustless breadcrumbs give a lighter and more delicate result, but with less adhering strength than the customary finely ground dried breadcrumbs; the cutlets must be handled with greater care and, although it is essential to avoid the dispersion of loose crumbs in the cooking fat, they may never be altogether eliminated with this method.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Once the cutlets are breaded (sprinkling more crumbs over and patting them into place with your hand to ensure an even coating), transfer them to a board sprinkled with breadcrumbs and flatten each side, tapping gently with the flat of a heavy knife blade or cleaver to render the breading more compact. Finally, a crisscross pattern created by tapping each surface gently with the back of a heavy knife blade at approximately 1-inch distances will break up the surface tension, reinforcing adherent strength and creating an attractive pattern—the principle is the same as that of the regularly spaced lines that are pressed into cement sidewalks to prevent their cracking.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page342">Deep fried in olive oil, breaded cutlets are delicious, but a normal 3- to 4-ounce cutlet divided into three or four small ones will be easier to handle. If they are cooked in a frying pan there should be a good ½-inch depth of fat (olive oil, mixed, olive oil and butter, or pure butter), preheated, the heat reduced to medium-medium-low when the cutlets are put to cook. It is probably wiser to first clarify the butter if it is used alone (I rarely bother).</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page342a">Veal Sweetbreads <span class="French-translation">(Ris De Veau)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Sweetbreads are the thymus gland of a young animal; it shrivels to no more than a memory in an adult animal. It consists of two connected sections—the elongated throat sweetbread and a large full lobe called in French <em class="ital">la noix.</em> Lamb sweetbreads are treated in the same way as veal sweetbreads, but, because they are so much smaller and less presentable, they are usually treated as a <em class="ital">ragoût.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page343">Whatever the ultimate preparation, sweetbreads should first be soaked in cold water for, ideally, several hours (½ hour of soaking will not be disastrous, however), then covered generously with new cold water, brought slowly to a boil, and left to simmer for a very few minutes, drained, plunged into cold water and, when cool, freed of all fat, cartilaginous tubes, and superficial membranes (but the connective tissue holding together the sweetbread sections should be left intact). Placed between two towels, a weighted board on top, they are left for several hours—or overnight. For most purposes a weight of 4 or 5 pounds is enough, but for a particularly firm, easily manageable, and attractively presentable grilled <em class="ital">noix,</em> it is well to count up to a 10-pound weight. Dipped in melted butter, seasoned, and grilled for about 30 minutes over well-sustained but not intense wood coals, turned several times and regularly basted with melted butter—using a little brush fashioned from fresh thyme or rosemary branches, if possible—the sweetbreads’ pristine beauty is best understood. Sauce is superfluous. They are most often <a href="h_63-89.xhtml#page72">braised</a> and are, then, never better than when garnished with fresh little peas. They may be treated like a fricassée (floured, lightly colored in butter, moistened with a bit of white wine and veal stock to cover, simmered for ½ hour or so, garnished, if one likes, with precooked little onions and mushrooms, the liquid skimmed and finished, like a <em class="ital">blanquette,</em> with egg yolks or egg yolks and cream) or simply stewed gently in butter for ½ hour. However cooked, the process should be gentle and should last a minimum of 25 to 30 minutes—undercooked, sweetbreads are not pleasant.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In the following recipe, because they are trapped in suspension in a congealed pudding, the sweetbreads need not necessarily be subjected to weighting. I have tried a number of sauces with the sweetbread loaf; the one I prefer is a so-called <em class="ital">sauce bâtarde,</em> which is nothing more than flour-thickened water finished with egg yolks, lemon juice, and butter; traditionally, it accompanies poached fish (melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan, stir in 1 tablespoon flour, remove from heat, pour in slowly, stirring the while, 1 cup salted hot water, return to heat and stir until boil is reached, remove from heat, pour in an egg yolk beaten with a bit of cold water, whisking constantly, return to low heat, continue whisking until lightly thickened, but not approaching a boil, remove, add lemon juice, and whisk in about 3 ounces or approximately cup butter, softened or cut into little pieces—it takes about as long to prepare as to read the instructions. Because the flour is not cooked, the sauce does not have a “floury taste”; it should be only lightly bound and, thanks to the whisking, frothy).</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page345">Calves’ Brains <span class="French-translation">(Cervelles De Veau)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Good fresh brains are firm-looking, the form cleanly and symmetrically defined, the surface moistly glistening in aspect; they are white with a pearl cast, only the filigree network of thread-like veins in the surface membrane showing red. These conditions are not always met—otherwise good brains are often discolored by blood clots. In any case, those whose form and whose superficial cannular structure are ill-defined, the surface dull and messy in appearance, should be rejected.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Brains should be put to soak in cold water and the vein-threaded surface membrane carefully peeled off; it often facilitates the work to dip them repeatedly in water while removing it. Usually, with healthy-looking, firm, fresh brains, it slips free with little difficulty, but, occasionally, it offers frustrating and sometimes insuperable resistance; if after further soaking, it refuses to come free, leave it . . . Brains that have been badly bloodstained should be soaked again for 1 hour or so with several changes of water in order to draw from them the maximum discoloration (in professional kitchens, they are often parboiled to hasten the work of peeling, a process which, although permitting the membrane to be removed more easily, firmly stamps the flesh with a brown color and a muddy flavor that detracts greatly from their delicacy).</p>
			<p class="Normal">In the south of France and in Italy I have often eaten brains (usually those of sheep), the membrane of which had not been removed and which were put to cook raw, dredged in flour, in butter or olive oil. The crisp golden surface disguises, although imperfectly, the presence of the membranes; the flavor, without the support of court bouillon, borders on the insipid with a vaguely sweet edge—not altogether unpleasant—and the texture, even when well cooked, remains somewhat mushy. Neither is that disagreeable, but no hint is contained there of the wonderful creamy body, at once firm and melting—something of the same texture as that of foie gras cooked pinkly—that takes form through a preliminary passage in court bouillon. And the imprecise taste of faded things is transformed into subtlety and nuance by an aromatic vinegar court bouillon. Perhaps because I do not want anything else to imperfectly resemble the savor that I associate with brains—the fragrance of the court bouillon alone contains that single association for me—I reserve vinegar court bouillon for that limited use, preferring white wine in most other instances. Whatever their destiny, poach calves’ brains for about 25 minutes (lambs’ brains 18 to 20 minutes) in a court bouillon, slipping them gently into the simmering liquid and keeping it at a near simmer, saucepan covered, without permitting the boil to be reached. The court bouillon may first be strained to remove herbs and vegetables (there are, however, certain kitchen pleasures that are not shared at table—the beauty of a pair of brains floating among carrot and onion slices and straggles of herbs is among them. It is the only reason, also, for slicing the onion into rings rather than halving it and slicing it much more rapidly).</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Only veal kidneys have a special finesse. There are, as far as I know (Ali Bab’s stuffed and braised fantasy apart), only three ways to prepare them. Whole, a thin layer of their fat is left surrounding them and they are cooked in a covered casserole either over low heat or in a medium oven, turned regularly, for from 40 to 45 minutes. To be grilled or sautéed, their fat and the thin protective membrane should be first removed; they are then split lengthwise and the fat pared out of the heart. Rub the halves in olive oil for grilling, season and grill first on the cut side for a couple of minutes, turn them, and, as soon as tiny pearls of blood appear at the surface, remove them.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A simple, classic recipe for sautéed veal kidneys is given in <em class="ital">The French Menu Cookbook.</em> For a rapid, sauceless sauté, try them <em class="ital">à la Provençale,</em> the split halves sliced crosswise more thinly (about inch thicknesses) than for a regular sauté, tossed rapidly, seasoned, in a heavy pan over high heat in butter, olive oil, or a combination. After a minute’s tossing add a handful of mixed finely chopped parsley and garlic (or mix the parsley with garlic pounded to a purée for a more delicate flavor), toss for another minute, sprinkle over lemon juice, and serve . . . Croutons are a welcome garnish.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page349">Calf’s Liver <span class="French-translation">(Foie De Veau)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">On the French market, one finds <em class="ital">foie de veau</em> and another mysterious and darker-colored liver baptized <em class="ital">foie de génisse</em> (literally “heifer’s liver”). The butchers carry no other products claiming to derive from the heifer. In parts of the United States, similarly obfuscatory methods are deployed to confuse the public, calf’s liver and so-called veal liver being differently colored and differently priced.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sublime calf’s liver is pale beige with a pink cast. Livers of a well-sustained rose hue may, nonetheless, be very good. The tightly clinging sheer surface membrane must be carefully peeled off; it shrinks in contact with heat, warping or otherwise deforming the liver.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Calf’s liver is nearly always sliced and pan fried in butter, thin slices being cooked rapidly (and usually imperfectly) over high heat, thicker slices more slowly over lower heat. It must always be pink throughout, the heart of the flesh having just turned firm, its juices in released suspension within the tender structure (those accustomed to eating liver overcooked find even calf’s liver “strong”; the strong taste, in company with an ugly, dull, dry texture, appears only—and then with progressive intensity—as grayness begins to pervade the moist pink realm). A few drops of lemon juice may be welcome to some people; bacon, fried onions, or fortified wine deglazing juices can only obscure its perfect finesse.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Thick slices (¾ to 1 inch) rubbed with olive oil and cooked on a well-heated grill over coals of no more than moderate intensity deserve all of one’s favorite superlatives. The time is probably about 4 minutes to a side—but, once turned, watch them; press the surface with your finger to test firmness, and the moment the first tiny rose and translucent pearl of liquid begins to ooze up through the grilled surface remove them to a heated platter. It is impossible to grill thin slices correctly and useless to attempt to cook liver, thick or thin, in a broiler.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page350">Recipes for braised whole livers are common enough, though not commonly executed. A true braising process necessitates a more or less prolonged cooking whose raison d’etre is to permit a slow and progressive interpenetration and intermingling of the braising liquids and the natural juices of the material being treated. The quality of melting tenderness that one hopes to achieve is dependent on the combined dissolution of the meat’s (or vegetable’s) primitive structure, and this perfect fusion of sapid essences. Any meat, on the other hand, whose qualities depend on the flesh’s remaining rare or pink, requires a precisely opposed treatment: there can be no question of a liquid’s being absorbed from outside (except by marination before the seared seal is put). The meat’s structural composition, while relaxed by a gentle penetration of heat, must, above all, not be broken down.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If my definitions are acceptable, then it must follow that the notion of braising a calf’s liver is nonsense. And so it is. By which I do not mean to suggest that the thing cannot be good—if the liver has been correctly “braised,” the cook will have taken every possible precaution to <em class="ital">prevent</em> its braising while, at the same time, respecting all of the time-consuming formal complications integral to a true braising process: The liver will have been marinated (a great pity, but, if one prefers to deform its flavor, a roast, too, can be marinated), its entire surface will have been larded with a hundred tiny lardons, and it will have been seared; aromatic braising bases (<em class="ital">mirepoix</em> or <em class="ital">duxelles</em>) will have been prepared in advance as well as veal stock or <em class="ital">demi-glace,</em> destined to share with the marinade and a fortified wine the moistening honors; truffles and cèpes or morels may find their place; and, of course, but half submerged in liquid, it must be basted. The trick is to arrest the cooking before the seared surface is so damaged, its resistance weakened by contact with external liquids, as to permit the commencement of a braising process. The liver, if its surface has not been too damaged, will be pink and will have retained its own juices, untainted by outside savors, and the sauce, if it is good, will owe its success to the quality of its initial ingredients, having drawn, ideally, nothing from the liver—it may as well have been prepared apart.</p>
			<p class="Normal">All of which leads us to roast liver: It requires absolutely no preparation (its delicacy and beauty would be masked by a sauce) and its flesh looks and tastes exactly as “braised” liver <em class="ital">should</em> taste; it is one of the most exquisite things I know. Mushrooms, in one form or another (mushroom pudding, purée of mushrooms, <em class="ital">cèpes sautés à la Bordelaise,</em> creamed morels . . .), accompany it perfectly, as does a choice of vegetable purées.</p>

With my oven, which is extremely hermetic, holding heat for long periods of time, I start it out at from 450° to 475°, turning the oven off immediately and the roast is ready some 30 to 35 minutes later, the oven having gradually descended to about 200°. With friends’ ovens I have usually found the best method to be: (1) 8 to 10 minutes at about 450°; (2) another 10 minutes or so with the thermostat reduced to 275° to 300°; (3) 10 to 15 minutes with the oven turned off.

			<p class="Normal-noind">Beef stews (prepared like the sauté recipe-type) in a number of regions assume the name of <em class="ital">estouffade</em> or one of a number of dialectical variations on that word. Most <em class="ital">estouffades</em> are simplifications of the genial <em class="ital">boeuf Bourguignon,</em> the traditional garnish of lean lardons, little onions, and mushrooms being eliminated or altered, the red wine, in some instances, being replaced by combinations of white wine, tomato bouillon, water . . . Often the sauce is not passed and purified but merely skimmed of surface fat before serving.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Black or green olives creep into a number of Provençal beef stews, dried orange peel may join the herb bouquet, and, in the curiously named <em class="ital">grillade des mariniers</em> (the mariniers—or sailors—in question are the Rhône river boatmen), bizarre overtones of anchovy and capers—probably more pleasing to the Provençal palate than to others—lace the sauce, whose liquid constituents are vinegar and water.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Oxtail (in America, it is usually more richly endowed with fat than in France and it is as well to pare off the excess), cut into sections, lends itself admirably to a <em class="ital">Bourguignon</em> or an <em class="ital">estouffade</em> treatment. Its structure does not permit of interlarding, but moist succulence is ensured by a particularly gelatinous constitution. It demands a bit more cooking time than other stew cuts (something over 3 hours, precise timing depending on the age of the animal). It is also a splendid <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> element and, left over, is delicious stewed gently for ½ hour or more in a tomato sauce and accompanied by a pilaf or fresh noodles—or simply coated with melted butter and breadcrumbs and gently grilled, butter-basted, until golden and heated through, accompanied by mustard.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Leftover <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> meats should not be cooled in their bouillon—they will turn flabby and tasteless. Boneless (or, in the case of spareribs, subsequently boned) leftover <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> cuts are transformed into <em class="ital">mirotons,</em> the meats sliced very thinly (an easy task when cold and firm), warmed, and gently simmered in a sauce made of onions and the <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> bouillon, lightly tomatoed. Onions in quantity—to taste—are finely sliced, gently stewed in butter until melting soft but not colored, sprinkled lightly with flour, and, after a moment’s cooking and stirring, moistened with a tablespoonful each of vinegar and tomato purée to each approximate cup of bouillon; a pinch of powdered herbs may be added; then the sauce is simmered for a good ½ hour. A <em class="ital">miroton</em> is perhaps better transformed into a gratin (alternate layers of the boiling sauce and cold meat slices, beginning and ending with sauce, liberally sprinkled with fresh breadcrumbs lightly colored in butter, are cooked ½ hour or so in a 350° oven). The gratin can be simple or include vegetables (finely sliced, sautéed zucchini or peeled, sliced, fried, and drained eggplant, in alternate layers with beef and sauce or arranged as a border around the edges of the gratin dish) or may be arranged within a border of noodles or mashed potatoes (if the potatoes, too, are left over, best doctor them up a bit by the addition of an egg, a suspicion of grated nutmeg, or a handful of <em class="ital">duxelles</em> . . .).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page353">Beyond the suggestions in the preface to this chapter, there is little to be said about grilled or roast beef. It is my conviction that, if one dislikes the idea of rare meat, there is no point in eating these cuts and that, if the meat is aged and of fine quality, no sauce will enhance its natural, clean, robust flavor. The filet is the tenderest but the least flavorful of grilling and roasting cuts. In the service of extravagance and out of mingled curiosity and suspicion, profiting from the number of mouths to feed, my students and I recently prepared in class Lucien Tendret’s celebrated but rarely executed filet of beef: The whole filet is split, incompletely, lengthwise, opened out, whole truffles forced into some twenty slits and a handful of peeled pistachios into tiny intermingling slits; the opened filet is folded closed into its original form, tied up, the surface larded with a larding needle, put to marinate overnight with herbs, white wine, and a bit of olive oil, and roasted—7 minutes per pound—the next day, accompanied by a buttered juice composed of reduced deglazing marinade, a bit of lemon juice, chopped parsley, truffle peelings pounded to a purée . . . The perfumes were heady and exciting and the thing could hardly be said to have been bad, but a simple truffle stew or a simple roast beef would have, one or the other, made a great deal more esculent sense.</p>

				<li class="IL">Pepper</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Cook the onions in something over half the oil in a skillet over a low flame, stirring or tossing regularly, until softened and lightly caramelized—turn the flame up slightly, if necessary, toward the end in order to color them. Empty them into a sieve over a mixing bowl or over the oven casserole that will serve for cooking the dish, being certain that no fragment of onion remains in the skillet.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour the drained fat back into the skillet, add a bit more oil, if necessary, and, over a fairly high flame, brown the slices of steak, first salted. This will have to be done in two or three shifts; remove those that are done to the strainer with the onions and pour back into the skillet, from time to time, the fat and juices that drain from the onions and seared meat. When all the steaks have been browned, turn the flame low, add the sugar, stir around, then add the flour and cook, stirring, for a few moments and deglaze with the beer, adding it slowly and stirring the while, scraping well to loosen all caramelized adherences. Stir in the stock, bring to a boil, and remove from the heat. Taste for salt.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Arrange the slices of meat in alternate layers with the onions (three layers of meat slices and two of onions), a bay leaf and a sprinkling of herbs on each layer of onions. Pour over the liquid—the contents should be well immersed; add a bit more beer or some water or stock, if necessary. Bring to a boil on top of the stove and cook, tightly covered, in a 300° to 325° oven for about 3 hours, testing for tenderness after some 2½ hours. Carefully lift all fat from the surface, first with a tablespoon, then with absorbent paper, before serving. Season with pepper at table and accompany with steamed potatoes or fresh egg noodles. Customarily, beer is drunk with it—I prefer a cool, light-bodied, young red wine.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Cover the slices of salt pork with cold water, bring to a boil, drain, and rinse. Brown the steaks (in two or three shifts, transferring them to a plate when finished), drain off the fat from the pan, and deglaze with a bit of red wine or water.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Choose a terrine (earthenware or enameled ironware) of a size, as nearly as possible, corresponding to that of the steaks. Arrange alternate layers of steak and salt pork slices, beginning with a steak and finishing with slices of salt pork, sprinkling the surface of each steak with the seasoned herb mixture. Pour over any juices that may have drained from the steaks, the deglazing liquid, the Cognac, and, finally, the wine and the stock, first a bit of one, then a bit of the other, in order to finish with approximately equal parts of each when the meats, well packed into place, are just submerged.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page356">Prepare a flour-and-water dough containing a bit of oil (which, as the paste cooks, will prevent it from hardening to the point of being nearly unbreakable—one risks breaking fragile earthenware when breaking the seal of the paste, otherwise). Roll it out into a long ribbon on a floured board and fit it into the ridge designed to receive the lid before pressing the lid into place. Put the terrine into a 450° oven and, after about 15 minutes, turn the oven down to about 275° to 300°. Count 3 hours. Break the seal and carefully lift off all the surface fat before serving.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Queue de Boeuf Farcie Braisée</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The preparation is relatively long, requiring a couple of hours’ preliminary work and, in all, some 6 hours’ attention on the following day, the last 2 of which should be more or less undivided. The result is attractive but unprepossessing in appearance; the flavors are sumptuous, well worth the time spent. Served cold, it is an altogether different experience—and at least as good. If a section is left over, choose a small oval terrine just large enough to contain it without forcing; if to be unmolded, line the bottom with the remaining braised vegetables and braising liquid, placing the section of tail on this bed; if to be sliced and served directly from the terrine, place the meat first in the bottom, pouring vegetables and juices atop, then pour over to cover the remaining reduced stock —doctored with a bit of sherry if desired—and refrigerate for a day.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is of the greatest importance that the stock be undersalted, for it will be subjected to not only a reduction by half, doubling its salt content, but also a subsequent and continuing reduction during the final braising process. See <a href="i_90-117.xhtml#page109">its preparation</a>: It can cook longer than a veal stock; maximum flavor will have been drawn from the ingredients after about 4 hours’ cooking time, but the bones will continue to release their gelatin for several hours longer. I usually put it to cook as soon as the tail is boned, simmering it for 3, 4, or 5 hours, leave it to cool overnight, degrease it, add more water if necessary, and simmer it for several hours longer before straining it.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page357">The truffle may be eliminated from the stuffing (a breath of its soul will be sacrificed); mushrooms or <em class="ital">duxelles</em> may be added, but should not be thought of as a substitute, for they bear no relation, one to the other. If the truffle is retained, best prepare the stuffing the previous day, refrigerating it overnight, so that its perfume may permeate the mixture.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The size and shape of the cooking vessels should both correspond to those of the stuffed tail, that used for poaching the wrapped and tied tail representing about twice the volume of the oval <em class="ital">cocotte</em> used for the final braising; the flesh shrinks radically during the first cooking process, and when braised (further shrinking is imperceptible) it should be contained in a receptacle permitting partial immersion by a minimum of reduced stock.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page357a">To Bone an Oxtail</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">In guise of instruction, the cookbooks say, “Bone an oxtail without piercing the flesh.” The practitioner who is able to bone an oxtail without ever piercing the flesh is a rare bird; I know none. The flesh is tough and sinuous and the cartilaginous extremities of the vertebral joints are not tender and easily sliced through as in smaller and younger animals. Even using a small, razor-sharp, and sharply pointed paring knife (a boning knife is too large to work with precision), it is practically impossible to avoid the knife’s slipping from time to time. Furthermore, as one progresses down the tail, the spinal protuberances themselves often tend to pierce the flesh’s surface, sheathed only by a taut, tough and sheer membrane. The lesson to be drawn from this is not to worry; do the best you can, but do not imagine that a few slits here and there are a disaster.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page358">Only the first six joints are boned, the terminal third of the tail (8 or 10 inches) being cut off and joined to the bones for preparing the stock. The vertebral extremities touch the surface of the flesh on the top and on the underside the entire length of the tail; the sides, at the upper half, are fleshy and pose no problem. The tail should be boned from the underside, slit open, following a median line described by the points at which the bones touch the flesh’s surface. It is useless to attempt to describe the complex form of the bones to be removed (there are five major protrusions to each vertebra whose contours should be closely followed); the first and largest at the fleshy base of the tail is easily removed and can be studied, the better to know what to expect from the succeeding and progressively smaller units. The cartilaginous attachment at each joint is easily sliced through and each bone should be removed as it is freed from the flesh. Work mostly with the tip of the knife, scraping and keeping the blade tip always in contact with the bone—go carefully when approaching the flesh surface and, as soon as bone gives way to cartilage, slice through, leaving the cartilage embedded in the flesh. The boned tail, its tip cut off, should describe an elongated triangle some 10 to 12 inches wide at the fleshy base and 18 to 20 inches in length.</p>

				<li class="IL">6 to 8 ounces each sweet onions and carrots, peeled and chopped or cubed into a coarse brunoise (½- to ⅓-inch squares)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Sprinkle the meat lightly on both sides with herbs and put to marinate, turned well and folded in the oil and the wine, in a covered crock, refrigerated, overnight.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The firmness of the stuffing is important and is ensured by the marrow’s being well chilled. If it has not been prepared in advance and chilled, be certain that both meat and marrow are chilled and thoroughly combine all the ingredients, using a fork rather than your hands, whose warmth would soften the mixture.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page360">Remove the tail from its marinade and spread it out, boned side facing up, on a square of cloth (that will be used for wrapping it up before being tied—I use old sheets, torn into squares). Mound the stuffing evenly along the center of the upper two thirds of the tail, fold the lower third in a flap up and over the surface of the stuffing, draw the edges of the tail together at the point where the flap has been folded, running the trussing needle and a 2½-foot length of string through, tie the far end of the string in a knot and sew up the length of the tail and the opening at the wide base, spiral-wise, piercing the edges at approximately 1-inch intervals. Clip the string, leaving several inches hanging free. The stuffing will be loosely contained in the sewn-up tail; despite the important loss of fat from the marrow, the stuffing will swell somewhat, whereas the flesh of the tail shrinks. Don’t worry if a bit of stuffing is visible through inadvertent slits. Wrap gently but firmly, the cloth pulled tight, gathering together and twisting the cloth at one end of the package and tying it tightly. Loop the string 3 or 4 times around the length as if tying up a roast, tie the other end of the cloth, gathered and twisted, and clip off any excess. Place the package in its pot, pour over the marinade, and enough warm but not boiling stock to cover well (if you have not quite enough stock, add water). Bring to the boiling point and adjust the heat so that the liquid will just simmer, counting 2½ hours from the time that a continued simmer has been reached. Carefully lift off all the fat from the surface two or three times during the last hour of poaching (there will be a good cupful).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove the wrapped tail to a platter (or, better, to a small pastry grill placed on a platter), clip the strings, unwrap it, permitting the cloth to drain, and leave the meat to drain while reducing the stock and sweating the vegetables. The liquid drained from the wrapping cloth and the piece of meat will be very fatty; it can be poured into a bowl, chilled, the fat removed in a piece, and added to the leftover stock later.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Skim the stock, a light boil maintained at one half of the surface, pulling the skin that forms to the other side with a tablespoon and removing it, repeatedly, over a period of about ½ hour. Lift loose floating fat from the surface with absorbent paper. When no more traces of fat are visible and a skin no longer readily forms on the surface, turn the flame high and reduce at a rolling boil to about half of its original volume.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page361">Scatter the <em class="ital">brunoise</em> of onions and carrots in the bottom of the <em class="ital">cocotte</em> that will serve for braising the tail (no fat, no liquid, no seasoning) and put, covered, into a 350° oven for about ½ hour, checking from time to time—they should sweat and become semitender without coloring. Remove the lid and leave them for another 5 or 10 minutes or until they just begin to stick to the bottom, a suggestion of golden edges appearing here and there.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Place the drained tail, sewn side down, on the bed of vegetables, ladle over enough hot reduced stock to immerse the meat by from one half to two thirds (if the <em class="ital">cocotte</em> is just large enough to contain it at ease, only something over half of the remaining stock will be necessary), and braise at a bare simmer for an additional 2 or 2¼ hours, basting every 10 or 15 minutes, the first hour covered over a low heat, and the second hour uncovered in a 325° to 350° oven. Use a tiny ladle for basting and, during the period in the oven, take care to scoop up vegetables with the braising liquid, scattering them over the surface so that they, as well as the surface of the meat, will acquire a rich, caramelized glaze.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove carefully, with spatulas, to a heated serving platter, clip the string at the knot, pulling gently from the other end while holding the meat in place, to remove it. Serve the remaining vegetables and braising liquid apart in a preheated sauceboat.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page362">Tripes</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Because tripe is sold precooked, the mythical <em class="ital">tripes à la mode de Caën</em> and a host of other folklorique and <em class="ital">daube</em>-like recipes are either impossible or impractical to prepare. Others of the <em class="ital">daube</em> family may be simplified and given only a couple of additional hours of gentle cooking with the happiest of results. <em class="ital">Tripes à la Niçoise,</em> for instance: a bed of <em class="ital">mirepoix,</em> a parboiled split calf’s foot, large bones removed, tripe cut into narrow 2- or 3-inch strips, salt and a generous sprinkling of herbs, a glass of white wine, peeled and seeded, chopped tomatoes or canned ones, crushed or chopped garlic, sometimes a very light flour thickening; the dish is brought to a boil and barely simmered, tightly covered, for a couple of hours. Prepared in this way, tripe is often gratinéed, as in Florence—spread in a shallow oven dish, sprinkled with Parmesan, and put for 15 minutes in a hot oven.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Most recipes that call for precooked tripe, because that which is commercialized is prepared without any aromatic support, will be improved by an hour’s simmering in a richly flavored (onions, carrots, and lots of herbs) court bouillon: Hot, <em class="ital">à la vinaigrette;</em> “sauced” with stewed sorrel in soft scrambled eggs; sautéed <em class="ital">à la Lyonnaise</em> (sliced onions cooked apart, tossed with thin strips of sautéed tripe, the pan washed up with a bit of vinegar). Or, as with the Lyonnais <em class="ital">tablier de sapeur,</em> several hours in a marinade may sufficiently revivify the somewhat emasculated product (I have more than once known friends, incomprehensibly trepidant at the thought of tripe, to be seduced by this preparation): 3-inch squares of tripe marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, mustard, white wine, a few drops of olive oil, salt, pepper, chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em>—the marinade should be plentiful enough to only coat the pieces, which should be well turned around in it from time to time; the tripe then dipped in beaten egg and fresh breadcrumbs, left to set, basted with melted butter, and grilled with repeated bastings for 6 or 7 minutes on each side. Serve with <em class="ital">sauce tartare.</em></p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pot-au-Four</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">For well over a year, two Ardèchois friends had spoken to me repeatedly of two preparations remembered sentimentally from childhood—vulgar, rustic, robust, savory dishes: the <em class="ital">bombine</em> and the <em class="ital">pot-au-four.</em> But neither friend had practical experience in the kitchen and their memories of these dishes were mainly those of a general experience, memories of specific details being vague and often contradictory. Furthermore, the gastronomic chroniclers had, in their repeated dragnetting of the provinces for obscure, traditional family recipes, somehow missed these two, and no recipes were to be found in any of the cookbooks known to my friends or to myself. They were insistent that I should re-create these recipes for them and, finally, managed to gather together five other friends and contemporaries originally from the Ardèche; in the course of an hour’s discussion and occasionally violent disagreement, I was able, finally, to define both dishes in a general sort of way. The <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page314"><em class="ital">bombine</em></a> is a mutton and potato dish. Some, in discussing the <em class="ital">pot-au-four,</em> remembered the presence of olives, others of finding always a collection of <em class="ital">osselets</em> in the bottom of the earthenware cooking utensil (<em class="ital">osselets</em> are the small digital bones from calves’ or pigs’ feet, well known to French children, who play tiddly-winks type games with them), no one remembered onions but everyone was certain that garlic was present, several remembered “a lot of bay leaves,” and so forth.</p>
			<p class="Normal">With the first tryout, there were several serious faults: The potatoes were sliced much too thinly; there were far too few in relation to the quantity of tripe; the <em class="ital">osselets</em> were too large (I had used a calf’s foot instead of a pig’s foot); the juice was too “rich” (I had moistened the dish with a veal stock) . . . I later met the mother of one of my friends—an old lady who had learned to prepare these dishes from her mother but who, having fallen victim to the deepfreeze and other facilities, had prepared neither for some quarter of a century. Her memory, however, confirmed my final recipe with the exception that the olives should be green instead of black (I do not like green olives in cooking; if readers care to try them, they should first be parboiled for 5 or 10 minutes before being added to the preparation).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page364">The black olives should be either of a sort prepared in herb-flavored brine or a very simple natural preparation in which the flavor is clean and almost “sweet.” Strong-flavored olives, like the Greek ones, should not be considered—better eliminate the olives altogether.</p>

Press the surface to pack the contents slightly, pour in water to cover, bring gently to the boiling point on top of the stove, fashion a ribbon of dough from flour, water, and a bit of oil, rolled with your hands on a floured board, and seal the lid to the edges of the casserole.

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page365">Pork <span class="French-translation">(Porc)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">There is an edge—somewhat flat, slightly sweetish, fatty, and insidious—to fresh unsalted or uncured pork that palls on many a palate. The most successful remedy is to play something else a bit sweet against it, often supplemented by a sharp or acid element. The American spoonful of cold tinned applesauce as an accompaniment to roast pork may not be very exciting but, more imaginatively used (sliced and sautéed in butter; cored and peeled cross-sectional slices prepared as fritters with unsweetened batter), apples are among the more useful accompaniments to fresh pork (to blood sausage also).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sage is the herb most often used and, if it is fresh, it does its work well; dried, it tends to lend a musty flavor. Inch-thick pork chops, fat trimmed, seasoned, rubbed in olive oil, 2 or 3 fresh sage leaves pressed to each side, grilled over wood coals for about 8 minutes on each side, are very good indeed and perfectly accompanied by apple fritters. Sage is a powerful herb, but the quantity used in this instance will not be aggressive, for the leaves only caress the chops with their perfume and are not, themselves, eaten—often some disappear into the bed of coals.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In stews, pork is treated as other meats; in the south often as a <em class="ital">civet,</em> prepared in red wine, heightened by marc (instead of Cognac), the herb mixture strengthened with a bit of sage, the sauce finished with a mixture of blood and finely chopped or pulverized liver; in the north, it is prepared as a <em class="ital">carbonnade</em> with beer (like the <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page354">beef recipe</a>); in the Touraine, soaked and pitted prunes may be added to a red or white wine stew. Count on 1½ to 2 hours cooking from the time of moistening.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The hint of anise in wild fennel, usually reserved for fish preparations, is a perfect foil to the dullness of fresh pork, bringing a vibrant delicacy to its flavor. Wild fennel is much more richly perfumed than the bulb fennel found in the market, but if the former is unavailable, the feathery leaves of bulb fennel may be substituted—the pastis will reinforce their somewhat attenuated accent. The subtlety of mingled flavors is more pronounced when the pork is eaten cold the following day.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page367">Potatoes and large sweet onions, both baked in their skins, the skins of the latter removed before serving, a chunk of butter placed on each, are a good accompaniment . . . Or little new potatoes cooked gently in butter, sautéed, with a handful of unpeeled garlic cloves.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">2 pounds single loin roast, boned (ask your butcher to bone it if you prefer, but not to tie it up), pared of all but a thin sheet of surface fat</li>
				<li class="IL">Large handful of chopped tender leaves and branches of fresh fennel</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon (or 2 if cultivated fennel is used) pastis (Ricard or Pernod 51)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 cup dry white wine</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Pierce the meat, with the grain, with a sharply pointed, narrow-bladed knife, the length of the roast, 3 or 4 times through the filet, once through the filet mignon (the muscle corresponding to the filet in beef) and two or three times through the apron, forcing generous pinches of chopped fennel into these slits in sufficient quantity so that, when the roast is carved, the cross-section will present a pattern of green spots. Place the meat in a large mixing bowl, sprinkle over the remaining fennel, add the pastis, and ⅔ cup of the wine; marinate, unrefrigerated, a plate covering the bowl, for 4 or 5 hours, turning the meat around in the marinade two or three times during this period.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Lift the meat out, leave it to drain for a few minutes in a sieve placed over the marinade, sponge it dry with absorbent paper, salt and pepper the interior lightly, and roll it up into its original form, the apron wrapped around the outside as far as it will go. Tie it up, sprinkle the outside with salt, and roast it, using a small skillet or heavy gratin dish as a roasting pan, for about 1 hour and 10 minutes in all, beginning it at 450° and turning the oven down to 350° after some 10 or 15 minutes. After ½ hour begin to baste regularly with its fat and about 20 minutes before removing it from the oven, drain the fat from the roasting pan, pour in the marinade, and continue basting regularly. The end of the cooking time should correspond to the moment, more or less, that the liquid of the marinade is completely evaporated, the bottom of the pan containing only caramelized adherences and additional fat drawn from the roast, the roast itself handsomely glazed from repeated basting. Transfer the roast to a heated serving platter, removing the strings, discard the fat from the pan, and, over a high flame, deglaze with the remaining white wine, reducing it by about two thirds. Pour the juice over the roast and, when carving, serve a spoonful of the mingled deglazing liquid and the juices that escape from within the meat over each slice.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Some 10 years ago, after a long and arduous day of tasting in the vineyards of Beaujolais country, having returned to Lyons late in the evening, a hungry handful of our group left the others to their beds and unearthed a bistro called La Queue de Cochon. I have never returned, self-inflicted duty having led me, on subsequent trips, to new experiences among the array of celebrated restaurants in the star-studded Lyonnaise region. But neither have I ever so enjoyed a meal in that region—if it could be called a meal—as I did the huge platter of boiled ears, rinds, and tails that was served us in an atmosphere of a kind that is already anachronistic in a fast-changing world; the bar was small—an old-fashioned carved wooden affair—and three colorful ladies stood, each with a glass of Beaujolais in hand, awaiting, perhaps not too hopefully, the evening’s client; the dining room, too, was small, the floor scattered with sawdust, the lighting rather dull with only the brass rails gleaming and, at the marble-topped tables, all the clients were eating ears, tails, and rolled-up rinds and drinking the house Beaujolais. The Beaujolais was six months old, light and cool—a green and ravishing explosion of fruit. I no longer remember how many bottles passed that evening . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page369">Any pork destined to be boiled will be better if salted down with a sprinkling of herbs for a couple of days first.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Served ungarnished as a first course or, as a main course, accompanied by boiled potatoes (which may be scrubbed and thrown, un-peeled, into the pot with the meats a ½ hour before removing them from the heat), a <em class="ital">ravigote</em> (vinaigrette to which has been added finely chopped onion, chopped <em class="ital">fines-herbes,</em> and capers) or a <em class="ital">gribiche</em> sauce will be appreciated (or each guest may fabricate a sauce to taste from a table laden with dishes of chopped onion, peeled hard-boiled eggs, capers, <em class="ital">fines-herbes,</em> gherkins, mustard, horseradish, vinegar, and olive oil). <em class="ital">Gribiche</em> (3 hard-boiled egg yolks still tepid, salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon mustard, 1 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar) is supposed to mount like a mayonnaise but rarely does and is none the worse for it—some people add a raw egg yolk to the cooked yolks to ensure its mounting; sour gherkins, capers, <em class="ital">fines-herbes,</em> and the egg whites, all chopped, are stirred into the emulsion. Accompanied by lentils, cooked apart, imperfectly drained and tossed with butter and chopped parsley, sauce is impertinent. Snout may be added to the ears, rinds, and tails.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">

			<p class="Normal">Pack the meats into a terrine or large mixing bowl, the layers generously sprinkled with coarse salt and lightly but evenly sprinkled with dried herbs and leave, covered, in a cool place, or, lacking that, refrigerated, for a couple of days. Discard the liquid, rinse the meats, cover well with cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer for about 10 minutes (or until the rind is supple enough to be rolled and tied). Drain and rinse.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page370">Roll the strips of rind up tightly and tie a string around each. Cover the meats again with a large amount of cold water, bring to a boil, add the carrots, the bouquet, and the onion stuck with cloves, skim, and regulate the heat to keep the liquid, the pot covered, at a bare simmer. After 1 hour’s time taste the cooking liquid for salt. Count about 1¼ to 2½ hours, testing for tenderness. When serving, split the ears in two—or cut them into narrow strips (there is little to them but cartilage—therein lies their deliciously crunchy, but sufficiently tender, goodness).</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page370a">Rabbit <span class="French-translation">(Lapin)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">One thing has not changed in France: Everywhere in the country and wherever in the villages a few yards of space can be found, there are rabbit hutches, rabbits being famously reproductive and inexpensive to raise. One often sees people wandering along the roadsides, in the fields, or on the hillsides with great burlap bags collecting weeds and herbs, clipping tender shoots from the branches of trees and shrubs, to supplement the rabbits’ regular diet of kitchen debris, soups made of stale bread crusts, and whatnot.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The French affection for rabbit is general (the roadside inn whose menu includes <em class="ital">gibelotte</em> is certain to be the choice of all passing truckdrivers); if, in the past, it was considered in bourgeois households to be “common”—which means only that it was eschewed for Sunday or occasional meals, being sacrificed, instead, for weekday stews—it has now come into its own, the Sunday chicken having lost all claim to its antique titles of nobility (the Sunday leg of lamb now costing the eyes of one’s head and the Sunday <em class="ital">pot-au-jeu</em> demanding more time than today’s housewife willingly devotes to the kitchen). For rabbits, like the hysterical guinea fowl, although now commercially raised, stubbornly reject the mass-production treatment applied to chickens, and their flesh still retains some of the qualities of once-living creatures. Many in the cities, are in despair before the pasty-fleshed and tasteless scourge of chickens on the market; rabbits have gained greatly in popularity.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page371">Opinions differ as to whether the flesh of domesticated rabbit is “insipid” or “delicate”—the same foolish quarrel that is often dedicated to veal. There is no doubt but that, for many preparations—and in particular those involving rich and robustly flavored sauces like <em class="ital">civets</em> or <em class="ital">poivrades</em>—a few hours in a marinade is an improvement. This is not true of wild rabbit, whose flesh has a much more pronounced and personal flavor, less gamy but otherwise not unlike that of hare; a marinade only masks its finesse, lending it too strong a flavor rather than a welcome support, as in the instance of the domestic cousin. But for that difference, recipes for the two are interchangeable. Wild rabbit should be young (tender ears, easily torn); there is no problem with commercialized domestic rabbit, it being always killed young—at about 3 months.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Because wild rabbit is shot, it bleeds internally, the flesh being infused with some of the blood, lending it part of its quality (this is true of all game), the remainder gathering in the rib cage, imprisoned there by a thin membrane separating it completely from the abdominal area. If a blood-thickened sauce is planned, this should be carefully emptied into a bowl and beaten with a tablespoon of vinegar to prevent its clotting (hutch rabbits are bled from the jugular vein before being skinned, the vinegar beaten in immediately).</p>
			<p class="Normal">There are a number of standard methods of killing rabbits; since I have no first-hand experience, I quote from a serious and sensible book on rabbit raising and care:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-noind">The classic method of killing a rabbit is to deal an abrupt blow to the nape of the neck, either with the side of the hand or with a round stick, so as to rupture the spinal column. When the blow is well delivered in the right place, death is instantaneous, but an internal hemorrhage occurs at the point at which the blow was dealt.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The stretching method, also destined to break apart the vertebrae at the base of the skull, seems preferable because it does not provoke a blood clot.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page372">One holds the rabbit by the hind feet in the left hand, the head seized in the right hand, the thumb firmly pressed against the spinal column at the base of the skull; with an abrupt movement, one pulls, stretching the rabbit while forcing the head completely backward, the thumb serving as fulcrum point; the rupture of the vertebrae at the base of the skull provokes instant death.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Most professional killers sacrifice rabbits in this way and their dexterity is really extraordinary, many being able to kill, skin and gut fifty rabbits per hour.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">To skin a rabbit, cut off the forepaws at the first joint, hang it, tied firmly with a cord between paw and heel, from one hind leg, cut a circular incision through the skin just above (or just below, since the rabbit is hanging) the heel or first joint, taking care neither to sever any tendons nor to cut into the flesh (pinch the skin between thumb and forefinger to keep it distant from the flesh while cutting it); slit the skin on the inside surface of the leg in a straight line from the circular incision to the base of the tail and peel the skin free, leaving it to hang loosely. Switch the cord to the other hind leg, leaving the exposed leg hanging free, and repeat the process. Cut through the base of the tail with a small sharp knife, leaving the tail attached to the skin and, pulling gently, peel the skin back, glove-like, turning it inside out. The knife will be needed again to sever the ears from the base of the skull (they, too, remain attached to the skin) and to help loosen the skin from the skull, slicing it free, finally, at the mouth. Slit the belly from the anus to the apex of the rib cage, discarding all the insides except for the liver, heart, and lungs.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To cut up a rabbit for a sauté, use a large, heavy, sharp knife, cutting with pressure rather than chopping with a cleaver, which leaves splintered bones in its wake. Cut off the head and split it in two symmetrically (it will add flavor, and many people enjoy nibbling at the cheeks and the brains); slice the forelegs free (they are not jointed to the body, but only attached muscularly); detach the liver and cut across the body, separating the rib cage from the saddle; cut the rib cage crosswise in two and the saddle into three sections; split the section of backbone connecting the hind legs to separate them.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page373">Rabbit may be sautéed without liquid additives, garnished or lent the same savory supports applied to chicken sautés (see <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page389">“Chicken”</a>), counting the same cooking time as for chicken. Colored first in fat, smothered in braised cabbage, its deglazing juices dribbled over, and left to braise gently for about 45 minutes, it is a comforting winter dish; or replace the cabbage by half-braised fennel.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Rabbit is most often prepared as a stew along the lines of the <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page306">sauté recipe-type</a>. (I have indicated there 30 to 40 minutes’ cooking time from the moment of moistening, but that is largely a question of taste. With about 30 minutes, the flesh will be slightly firm, but moist; those who prefer it to be “falling off the bone” should count closer to an hour.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">A <em class="ital">civet</em> (larded interiorly, red wine marinade, a bit of Cognac added to the moistening elements, sauce sieved, skimmed, and reduced, <em class="ital">Bourguignon</em> garnish of lardons, mushrooms, and little onions) is finished by stirring in a mixture of the liver, the lungs (these puréed through a vegetable mill or a sieve), and the sieved blood, the sauce returned to the boiling point and simmered very gently for but a few minutes (if you do not have the rabbit’s blood, it may be replaced by ¼ cup of pig’s blood purchased from a pork specialty butcher—or, if the notion of a blood-thickened sauce is distressing, the stew will be perfectly good without it). Rather than dressing the stew classically with garlic-rubbed crouton triangles neatly disposed around the border of the platter, leave it in its cooking vessel without loss of heat and scatter the surface with little golden butter-crisp croutons, tossed at the last minute over a higher flame with a handful of chopped parsley mixed either with finely chopped garlic or with puréed raw garlic.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page374">The Provençal <em class="ital">lapereau en poivrade</em> is a sort of amalgam of recipes applied traditionally to hare <em class="ital">(à la royale, poivrade, civet).</em> It is also (but need not necessarily be) blood-thickened; white wine replaces the red of a <em class="ital">civet,</em> a large handful of unpeeled garlic cloves are added while the rabbit is being sautéed, the mushrooms and onions are eliminated from the garnish, and 5 minutes before the sieved sauce (being certain that all the onion and garlic have been puréed into the sauce), simmered, skimmed, and reduced, is removed from the heat, a scant teaspoonful of coarsely broken-up peppercorns is thrown in. The sauce is then resieved over the rabbit pieces to eliminate the solid pepper.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Gibelotte</em> is another of those magic words whose mere utterance causes saliva to run in a French mouth. My dictionary places its origin in the old French <em class="ital">gibelet</em> (“a dish of birds”). Both words, in any case, are obviously derived from <em class="ital">gibier</em> (“game”), and <em class="ital">gibelotte</em> may, at one time, have been an indiscriminate label attached to all soups or stews made of small feathered and furred game. Today it means only rabbit and white wine stew. It is thought of as vulgar, popular, unrefined (in this context, all considered to be positive virtues): <em class="ital">un plat canaille.</em> And, as if duty-bound to respect the dish’s connate vulgarity, most cooks determinedly prepare it in the sloppiest possible manner, some cookbooks, moreover, specifying that it should be boiled rather than simmered: Rabbit, cut-up onions, lardons are all fried up together; flour, thyme, bay, mushrooms, white wine, and water are thrown in; and the lot is boiled until done . . . The elements are all there and it is not bad—how could it be? But the rabbit is dry and stringy, the mushrooms are black, and the sauce is greasy, something less than digestible. Boiled potatoes accompany it. The Provençal version is perfumed with mountain savory and dubbed <em class="ital">chasseur.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">With a modicum of respect and very little effort a <em class="ital">gibelotte</em> can be transformed into a savory and attractive dish with no compromise imposed on its humble pretensions: The pieces of rabbit need neither be larded nor marinated and, assuming the cooking to have been conducted at a gentle simmer, the sauce carefully degreased, it is not absolutely necessary to strain the sauce. But one should not forget that, before its straining, its skimming, and its proper reduction, it is nothing but an inconsistent soup full of half disintegrated debris, full of promise but not yet a sauce. Garnishing elements may be eliminated; but, if they are included, at least the little onions and the mushrooms should be prepared apart and, having conceded this much to refinement, the sauce may as well be strained and purified, its sapid and textural unification offsetting the individual textures and flavors of the garnish; if the sauce is a confusion of taste and texture, added garnish will only reinforce the confusion.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page375">Any of the garnishes suggested in the recipe-type go well with rabbit; little butter-stewed onions, alone or in combination with others, are always welcome, as are crisp croutons (in the absence of potato garnish).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Steamed potatoes, rice pilaf, or fresh egg noodles are the usual accompaniments; in most instances, I prefer the latter. For a change, a finely sieved and generously buttered lentil purée is a good thing.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A basic <em class="ital">gibelotte</em> sauce may be finished in a number of ways. Two particularly exciting transformations consist of (1) slowly stirring in a mixture of (parboiled and drained) butter-stewed sorrel and heavy cream (about ½ pound fresh sorrel or ¼ cup sorrel purée to ¾ to 1 cup cream—more or less of each to taste) and returning to the boiling point; fresh egg noodle accompaniment; (2) stirring in a mixture of about ¼ cup (more or less to taste) Dijon mustard and ¾ cup heavy cream; garnish of scraped, rinsed, and dried little new potatoes, sautéed gently in butter until tender and pale gold and drained on absorbent paper before being eased into the sauce and simmered for a minute, served sprinkled with <em class="ital">fines herbes;</em> no accompaniment.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A rabbit fricassée is a <em class="ital">gibelotte</em> finished like a <em class="ital">blanquette,</em> bound with egg yolks (or egg yolks and cream). A mushroom purée may also attractively finish the sauce (½ pound raw mushrooms passed through a mechanical device, sautéed, seasoned, in butter, a bit of lemon juice for bleach, until all liquid has vanished), creamed or not—or egg-yolk-bound, if one likes . . . Artichoke hearts, first stewed in butter, are a pretty garnish with a mushroom sauce.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Use a large, heavy <em class="ital">plat à sauter.</em> Lacking that, begin in a large skillet, transferring everything to a casserole at the time of moistening.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Salt the pieces of rabbit and color them in the hot olive oil, adjusting the flame to medium after a couple of minutes. Add the onion and the garlic cloves immediately after turning the rabbit pieces over, shifting rabbit and onions regularly to prevent the latter from browning. When the rabbit pieces are sufficiently colored, sprinkle with sugar, turn the pieces over, and a minute later sprinkle over the flour, lowering, at the same time, the flame. Displace all the contents of the pan, turning the rabbit pieces over two or three times during a period of about 5 minutes—the flour should be lightly colored. Sprinkle over the saffron and cayenne and continue turning things gently around and over until all the elements are saffron-stained. Turn the flame high and pour in the white wine, scraping the bottom of the pan at all points and repeatedly with a wooden spoon until all adherent material has been dissolved into the sauce. Add enough water to the boiling sauce to just cover the contents of the pan, return to a boil, and cook, covered, over a very low heat, at a bare simmer, until the rabbit is tender, but still slightly firm—about ½ hour for a young rabbit.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page377">Remove the pieces of meat to a platter and strain the sauce through a sieve, working the debris vigorously with a wooden pestle to purée the onions and garlic—only the garlic hulls should remain in the sieve. Scrape the purée from the underside of the sieve and stir it into the sauce. Return the rabbit pieces to their cooking vessel, add the tomatoes and the cucumbers (see below), distributing them regularly and shaking the pan to settle the contents. Grind over pepper to taste and leave, covered, in a warm place while finishing the sauce.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface of the sauce. Bring it to a boil, pull the saucepan a bit to the side of the flame, adjusting the heat so that a light boil is maintained at one side of the surface. Skim (skin) each time a skin forms on the still surface area, gently gathering it to the edge with the tip of a tablespoon, lifting it free and discarding it. After 15 or 20 minutes, the sauce should be fat free; if it still seems light-bodied (it should be relatively so) or overabundant, reduce over a high flame, stirring all the while with a wooden spoon, to the desired consistency.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour the sauce over the rabbit and garnish, shake the pan gently, bring to a simmer, and leave, covered, over very low heat for about 10 minutes—long enough for the pieces of rabbit to be thoroughly reheated and for the flavors to intermingle. Sprinkle with the sautéed liver (see below) and the basil, the leaves torn into tiny pieces rather than chopped with a knife (if tiny-leafed variety, leave the leaves whole). Cover and leave, off the heat, for another 5 minutes, permitting the basil to expand. Accompany with a rice pilaf.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page378">Garnish Preparations</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Stew the tomatoes, salted and peppered, in 1 tablespoon butter over low heat, tossing them occasionally, for about 10 minutes. If the liquid is still abundant, turn up the flame and reduce rapidly, shaking the pan all the while.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Peel and rinse the cucumbers. If they are small, the seeds still unformed, they may be cut crosswise into ½-inch lengths. Larger cucumbers should be split either into halves or quarters, depending on their size, seeds removed and cut into ½-inch to 1-inch lengths, depending on thickness (the dictates of the nineteenth century still oblige the professional cook to pare them in the form of large olives—the waste of time and cucumber involved makes no sense in the home kitchen unless one’s guests are addicted to mechanical decoration). Plunge them into heavily salted water and simmer for no more than a minute—they should not be cooked, only ever so slightly softened—drain and put them to stew gently in 2 tablespoons butter, tossing from time to time, for 6 or 7 minutes—they should be tender, but absolutely intact.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cut the liver into small pieces or thin strips and toss, seasoned, in hot butter for a few seconds—long enough to turn the pieces gray; they should remain pink inside.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The recipe indicates only the rear of the rabbit; there is practically no flesh on the rib section and the forelegs, and although they are as nicely flavored as any part of the rabbit and are the least likely to dry out during cooking, they are too skimpy to serve, at least first. If more than one rabbit is being prepared, these pieces can be put aside with the heads for a stew. Otherwise, split the rib cage, marinate it and the forelegs with the rest, and put all four pieces into a single large <em class="ital">papillote</em> to serve as seconds. (The liver cannot be used in this preparation; rabbit livers are extraordinarily large, one being a sufficient portion for a person. Cooked gently, seasoned, in butter on each side until firm but still pink, it is surpassed in delicacy only by calf’s liver.)</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page379">The aluminum foil is not as attractive as parchment paper, but the preparation is extremely rapid and the result otherwise as good. Care should be taken that no sharp edges or fragments of splintered bones are bared, perhaps piercing the aluminum foil and thus letting either steam or juices escape during cooking. The rabbit pieces may each be wrapped in a slice of bacon and, there too, if the bacon is fixed with a toothpick or other sharp stick, it must be so placed as to not touch the foil casing.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">The saddle of the rabbit, cut  across into two equal sections and the two hind legs</li>
				<li class="IL">Finely crumbled mixed dried herbs (thyme, oregano, savory, marjoram—your choice)</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">Snail butter (1 large clove garlic pounded to a paste, 2 heaping tablespoons finely chopped parsley, large pinch finely ground mixed dried herbs, salt, pepper, 3 tablespoons butter, all mashed together until thoroughly mixed)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Pierce each piece of meat deeply, a number of times, using a small and sharply pointed knife and following the grain of the meat (straight through from one cut side to the other for the saddle sections; pierce at a sharp bias, almost parallel to the bone, but directed toward it, for the legs), forcing a healthy quantity of snail butter into each vent as you go. Sprinkle the pieces lightly but evenly with dried herbs, turn them around in a bowl with the olive oil, and leave to marinate for several hours (if time permits—not essential).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page380">Enclose each, salted and peppered at the last minute and well coated with oil, in a large (12- to 14-inch) square of aluminum foil, placed flat on a table, the sides drawn up, pinched together and folded twice upon themselves (or more when necessary to avoid bizarre forms), firmly pinched for air-tightness, the pinched border forming a crest the length of the vaguely omelet shape. Place them, not touching, on a flat pastry sheet and bake in a hot oven (450°) for from 35 to 40 minutes. Slit open at table. A potato or a vegetable gratin provides a good accompaniment.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">A whole unboned stuffed roast rabbit may be a thing of beauty, but it is impossible to carve; the stuffing is crushed and scattered and the flesh shredded as one attempts to sever sections of the backbone and the large quantity of stuffing engulfed by the rib cage can only be reached with a spoon once the initial carnage is finished. A boned stuffed saddle is cut into neat slices without further ado.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page380b">To Bone a Saddle</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Cut the rabbit in two at the vertebral joint between the second and third rib, the two terminal ribs adhering to the saddle section (scrape the meat free from the remainder of the ribcage and from the forelegs and put it aside with the liver and the heart for the stuffing; the bones will be joined to the neck, the head, and those from the saddle to prepare a stock).</p>
			<p class="Normal">A small, sharply pointed paring knife is easier to work with than a boning knife: Lay the saddle out flat, back to the table, legs farthest away from you (best work seated and relaxedly). Remove the ribs from the inside surface of the thin apron of flesh, pinching the flesh downward, away from the rib on each side, slipping the point of the knife through the flesh just beneath the rib and slitting it free; break it loose from its point of attachment to the spinal column.</p>

			<p class="Normal">The median described by the spinal column inside the carcass serving as a starting point, loosen the flesh progressively the entire length of the backbone, working mostly with the tip of the knife, following carefully the undulating cross-like contours of the vertebrae. Don’t attack the filets until the filets mignons have been folded outward, remaining attached to the filets but exposing the wing-like protrusions to each side of the vertebrae. Loosen the flesh between the wings of joining vertebrae with the knife tip. Now free the filets almost to the back, leaving the summit of the spinal column attached the whole length.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The final detachment of the length of spinal column is the only delicate part of the operation, for each vertebra is terminated by a cartilaginous attachment reaching to the outside surface of the flesh; to avoid piercing the flesh at any point, one must snip through each vertebral extremity, leaving its cartilaginous tip embedded in the flesh, the tip of the knife then describing an inverted U to free the flesh between joining vertebrae. It may be easier to break off sections of two or three vertebrae as they are freed from the back, and one may, without inconvenience to carving, leave the final joint at the base of the tail.</p>
			
			
			
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page382">To Lard the Saddle</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Turn the saddle over, legs spread out, back facing up. Cut the fatback into long strips about ⅛ inch square (it is easier to cut if well chilled). A larding needle with a hinged crochet at the larger, hollow end (rather than the classic splayed blades) will prevent the lardons from slipping free of the needle while larding. The needle should pierce the flesh with the grain (in the sense of the length of the saddle and of the legs rather than running crosswise), shallowly, surfacing again at about ¾ inch, pulling the lardon in its train so as to leave a ¾-inch section embedded in the flesh; each lardon is then trimmed, leaving about ¼ inch visible at each end (1¼- to 1½-inch lengths, in all, but it is only practical to work with much longer lengths, trimming after they are in place). Lard in rows of alternating alignments (the flesh of the second row being pierced on a line with and at the halfway point between the points at which the lardons of the first row have surfaced).</p>
			<p class="Normal">A pound of green chard leaves without ribs, parboiled, squeezed dry, and chopped, will render the stuffing even more <em class="ital">bonne femme</em> in spirit and more rustic in flavor.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is possible to leave the rabbit whole (removing the eyes for aesthetic reasons), but the spinal column, from the rib cage to the base of the tail, must, in any case, be removed; in this case, there being nothing from which to prepare a stock, the breadcrumbs are soaked either in water or in the strained marinade and squeezed dry (the marinade saved for basting).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Parboiled little peas scattered over the rabbit at the moment of serving affords a pretty picture and a delicious accompaniment—or parboiled, drained, and butter-stewed, creamed sorrel will marry wonderfully.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Marinate the boned and larded section of rabbit for several hours, turning it around and over in the marinade two or three times (or, covered and refrigerated, marinate overnight). Just before preparing the stuffing, remove it from the marinade, sponge the outside surface dry with a towel, and leave it, back down, on the towel, waiting to be stuffed. Strain the marinade.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Reduce the strained stock, over a high flame, in a small saucepan, to a syrupy consistency—there should be only about ⅓ cup remaining. Pound the clove of garlic to a paste in a mortar, add the breadcrumbs, the Cognac, and the reduced stock, mashing and mixing with a fork to an even consistency.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Mix together the <em class="ital">duxelles</em> and all the other stuffing ingredients in a large mixing bowl, using your hands, squishing, swirling, and beating until completely homogeneous.</p>
			
			
			<p class="Normal">Begin sewing the rabbit up before stuffing it, allowing a single long (about a yard) length of string, passing the trussing needle first through the flesh joined by the legs at the base of the tail and tying the end of string, then sew, in a spiraling manner, holding the borders of the aprons together and piercing them ¼ to ½ inch from the edge at about 1-inch intervals, closing about one third of the belly. Spoon stuffing into and at the entrance to the sewn-up area, lift the rabbit, legs hanging down, and shake it gently to settle the stuffing into place, replace it on its back, and spoon the remainder of the stuffing, mounded, into place; because the flesh shrinks during cooking and the stuffing swells, the stuffing should not be tightly packed. But, with an overabundance of stuffing, one may place a rectangle of sheet pork fat <em class="ital">(barde)</em> over the molded surface of stuffing and continue sewing without drawing the borders of the belly aprons completely together, the string thus forming a zigzag pattern across the <em class="ital">barde</em>’s surface. Cut a round of <em class="ital">barde</em> (or buttered kitchen paper) to hold the stuffing in place at the open end of the saddle, tucking the edges in between the wall of flesh and the stuffing, and, when the whole length of belly has been sewn, continue, crossing the string several times from border to border, forming a large hatchwork to hold the protective <em class="ital">barde</em> or paper in place.</p>

As the tips of the lardons and the surface of the roast begin to take on a bit of color (after, say, 30 to 40 minutes—one must feel one’s way), start basting with the marinade, 3 or 4 tablespoons at a time, continuing to baste regularly and, when the liquid is almost completely evaporated, adding more marinade until (after a theoretical 1 hour and 10 minutes’ of total roasting) the marinade is all gone. Continue basting, watching carefully, until no liquid remains, the juices in the pan having separated into caramelized adherences and loose fat (it happens in a moment’s time); remove and discard the fat from the pan and begin basting with the cream, 3 or 4 tablespoonsful at a time, never letting the pan run dry. After another 20 minutes or so the cream should be used up, the rabbit thickly coated with a voluptuous clotted and mottled glaze. Transfer to a large, preheated serving platter (to facilitate carving), remove strings, clipping the knot and pulling gently from the other end of the string, holding the roast in place the while. If a paper seal was used to replace the <em class="ital">barde,</em> remove it.

			<p class="Normal-noind">In old cookbooks, <em class="ital">andouillette, boudin,</em> and <em class="ital">saucisse</em> are more or less interchangeable terms, the first two identifying practically any bound and precooked mixture that takes the form of a sausage, is usually but not necessarily stuffed into a sausage casing, and is reheated by grilling (an <em class="ital">andouille</em> is a large <em class="ital">andouillette</em> and shares with <em class="ital">cornichon</em> the additional and derogatory meaning of “dolt”); <em class="ital">The Cuisinier Méridional</em> (1855), for instance, gives one recipe for <em class="ital">andouillettes</em> whose stuffing is a truffled mixture of lambs’ sweetbreads, chopped roast chicken, chicken livers, and the roof of beef mouth, bound with a stiff <em class="ital">velouté</em> and eggs and another of pounded, cooked white meats, cow’s udder, and <em class="ital">panade</em> with beaten egg whites added.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Today <em class="ital">andouillette</em> means chitterling sausage and <em class="ital">boudin</em> most often means <em class="ital">boudin noir,</em> or blood sausage (<em class="ital">boudin blanc</em> is casing stuffed with a pounded raw white meat—chicken or pork—and <em class="ital">panade quenelle</em> forcemeat and poached).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Prepare these sausages in advance (they may be kept refrigerated for several days—or they may be deep frozen) and, before being served, bring them to room temperature, rub them with olive oil, and grill over hot wood coals (or broil) until golden and slightly crisp—about 10 minutes, turning every 2 or 3 minutes. A generously buttered, fine-textured lentil purée accompanies them perfectly—as does a potato purée.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Chopping the different meats separately by hand, to varying degrees of finesse, is a valuable refinement, but, pressed for time, you may put everything together through a meat grinder with satisfactory results.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If you cannot get blood, eliminate it rather than discarding the recipe; if you cannot find sausage casing, fashion the <em class="ital">boudins</em> by hand, rolling them in flour, place them in a large, buttered <em class="ital">plat à sauter</em> or skillet, pour in boiling water (against the side of the pan so as not to disturb the <em class="ital">quenelles</em>) to cover generously and poach at the suggestion of a simmer, covered, for 10 minutes; remove to a pastry grill to drain and cool and wrap individually in plastic or aluminum foil for storing.

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page389a">Chicken <span class="French-translation">(Poulet)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">When dealing with chickens, a sauté is not a stew, for a true stew, it is claimed, never contacts a liquid during the cooking process (why only chicken should be distinguished with correct denominations is a mystery). There are hundreds of formulas for chicken sautés (they may be applied, as well, to rabbit, milk lamb, or baby goat), but they are all the same: The cut-up chicken is colored in butter, olive oil, or a combination of the two, covered, and cooked gently for another 15 or 20 minutes (a garnish, usually precooked, is added at some point during the last 15 minutes), and a rapid sauce is prepared by deglazing, usually with white wine, occasionally with red wine, sherry, or another fortified wine or, very rarely, with a blazing brandy (in Normandy the pan is deglazed with flaming applejack and the reduction finished with cream); the sauce is finished, often only by swirling butter into the deglazing reduction, sometimes with cream, tomato, prepared sauces, etc., boiled down to the desired consistency, butter whisked in away from the heat. Normally, the chicken pieces are dressed on a platter with their garnish and the sauce is poured over at the moment of serving. The most practical method of operating in a home kitchen—and one that eliminates the loss of precious heat—consists of coloring the chicken in a large skillet or <em class="ital">plat à sauter,</em> transferring the pieces to an oven casserole to finish cooking (the garnish being added at this time or a few minutes later), deglazing the original cooking receptacle, draining off the juices from the casserole into the deglazing liquid, and pouring the finished sauce back over the chicken and its garnish, which will then be served directly from the casserole.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page390">Chicken breasts, to remain moist, can support but a short cooking period; color them after the other pieces, adding them to the casserole only 8 to 10 minutes before finishing the sauce (or remove them from the casserole early if they have been started at the same time as the other pieces, keeping them in a warm place and returning them at the last minute), or forget about them, preparing your sautés with legs only . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">If the sauce is to be creamed, it is just as well to have a bit of fairly thick <em class="ital">velouté</em> on hand to lend it body.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Vegetables, alone or in combination, constitute the most rational garnish (certain fantasies involve grapes, bananas, melon, apples . . . with results not destined to please all palates; and crayfish is a persistent accompaniment to many <em class="ital">grand-cuisine</em> chicken preparations)—butter-stewed artichoke hearts; asparagus tips; glazed carrots (usually in combination with other vegetables); little new potatoes sautéed gently in butter until lightly colored (often in combination with lean lardons and little onions); thinly sliced, rapidly sautéed little zucchini; parboiled little peas (added at the last minute—or, if very tender, added raw when the chicken is transferred to the casserole); rapidly parboiled and butter-stewed cucumbers; drained <em class="ital">ratatouille</em> (its liquid reduced with the deglazing liquid); sautéed mushrooms, cultivated or wild (chicken smothered in <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page218"><em class="ital">chanterelles sautées à la Provençale</em></a>, the liquid that has first been drawn from them reduced to a syrup and added to a white wine deglazing reduction—is a wonderful thing); and, of course, truffles (deglaze with Cognac for black truffles; if you should come by one of the white Piedmont truffles flown fresh from Italy during the months of October and November, shave it paper-thin over the chicken only a minute before serving, simple white-wine deglazing mounted with butter). Tarragon often perfumes a chicken sauté; cook a bouquet of fresh tarragon with it and discard the bouquet before saucing the chicken and sprinkling with <em class="ital">fines herbes</em>—I sometimes dribble over a very short white wine reduction and simply drop globs of stiff heavy cream on the surface, leaving it to half melt and mingle with the juice during the service. Liquid cream is best incorporated into the sauce and either radically reduced or given binding support by a <em class="ital">velouté.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page391">A chicken sauté garnished with a <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page177">vegetable stew</a> (little onions, artichoke hearts, broad beans or peas, lettuce <em class="ital">chiffonade</em>) prepared apart and added to the chicken 10 minutes before finishing the sauce, its juices reduced with those of the chicken and the deglazing liquid and buttered away from the heat, cannot fail to excite admiration.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Chicken stews, all prepared like the sauté recipe-type, take a host of names: <em class="ital">coq-au-vin</em> or <em class="ital">estouffade à la Saint-Emilionnaise</em> (red wine moistening, <em class="ital">Bourguignon</em> garnish); <em class="ital">poulet au sang</em> or <em class="ital">coq en barbouille</em> (the same thing finished with blood—see <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page370a">discussion of <em class="ital">civet</em> under Rabbit</a>); <em class="ital">coq à la flamande</em> (with beer); <em class="ital">coq-au-Riesling</em> (self-explanatory); fricassées (all with white wine and, like a <em class="ital">blanquette,</em> finished with egg yolks, usually combined with cream—<em class="ital">géline a la Tourangelle</em> is, theoretically, a fricassée prepared with an old hen . . .). Gizzards, the lobes of flesh carefully sliced free of the gristly skin, can be transfigured into a dozen different and glorous <em class="ital">ragoûts,</em> choosing the possibilities from and respecting the methods of the recipe-type—they are done in ½ hour’s time but will not suffer from 2 hours’ cooking. Breasts are best reserved for other preparations.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page392">A preparation resembling that of American fried chicken—with the difference that the chicken pieces were first marinated—was current French fare until a century or so ago. Old books recommend fairly rough marinades (wine, spices, and herbs in great variety, vinegar, onions, garlic, orange and lemon zests, olive oil); bitter (or Seville) orange was squeezed over at the moment of serving, or the marinade was reduced and used as a sauce, or both. The rare recipes in books from this century simplify the marinade to <em class="ital">fines herbes,</em> lemon juice, and olive oil. After a couple of hours in either marinade, the chicken pieces are sponged dry and either dredged in flour or dipped in batter and fried. I have found the archaic marinade to be better with chicken legs and prefer the simpler modern version with breasts. The total eclipse of <em class="ital">marinade de poulet</em> is even less comprehensible in view of the excruciating poverty of integral flavor in the commercially raised chicken of today and of its crying need for outside support. A marinated whole chicken, split down the back, opened, flattened, legs fixed through slits in the abdominal skin (preparation identical to that of the split, stuffed chicken except for loosening and stuffing the skin), grilled over a well-sustained but not violently hot bed of coals (about 40 minutes in all, turning several times and basting, but counting a good two thirds of the cooking time, beginning and finishing, with the split-open surface face to the coals), is delicious, and young guinea fowl or pheasant prepared like this and kept slightly underdone is a revelation. A potato <em class="ital">paillasson</em> is the perfect accompaniment.</p>

Add the fatback and the breadcrumbs, sprinkle with Cognac, and mash with a fork (or work with your hands), adding enough stock to bring it to a malleable consistency.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page395">Stuff the legs (without packing—the flesh shrinks and the stuffing swells). Each leg will use something less than a foot of string, but the work is easier if a much longer length is threaded to the trussing needle. Sew the borders of the skin together, starting at the top of the leg, run the needle through the drumstick tip, and tie the two ends of string together, pulling gently to form a neat package of the stuffed leg.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cook the fennel, seasoned, in half the butter over medium heat, tossing or turning it from time to time, for about an hour. Remove to a plate and color the seasoned stuffed legs in the same fat. Return the fennel, if the receptacle is earthenware or heavy copper (if a skillet is used for coloring, transfer everything to a casserole, deglazing the skillet with some of the stock and pouring it over), arranging neatly to permit maximum covering with minimum liquid, pour over stock to cover, and cook, covered, at a bare simmer, for about 50 minutes, degreasing the surface two or three times and, after ½ hour, gently turning the legs over.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove legs and fennel, draining well, clip the strings and remove them from the legs, pour the cooking juices into a small saucepan, and return fennel and legs to their casserole, placing the legs on the bed of fennel. Keep covered in a warm place while reducing the braising juices.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Lift as much fat as possible from the surface of the liquid, skim (skin) for 10 minutes or so, a light boil maintained at one side of the pan, and when no more fat is visible, reduce by half over a high flame. Whisk in the remaining butter (softened or cut into small pieces) away from the heat and pour over the meat and fennel.</p>

Scatter the garlic over the chicken pieces, distribute the lemon slices, and put the casserole aside, covered, until the sauce is prepared.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove any excess fat from the pan in which the chicken was browned (leaving just enough to absorb the flour), add the flour and cook, stirring, over low heat for a few moments. Deglaze with the white wine over high heat, stirring and scraping with a wooden spoon, add the stock, and pour into a small saucepan; this is important, the small surface permitting a more rapid and complete skimming and degreasing of the sauce while preventing, at the same time, an exaggerated reduction. Skim (skin) for about 15 minutes, removing any traces of loose fat from the surface with absorbent paper. Pour the sauce over the chicken and its garnish and cook, covered, in a 375° to 400° oven for 40 to 45 minutes. The lemon will have almost completely disappeared into the sauce; the garlic cloves should be absolutely intact with a consistency of melting purée; the sauce must be tasted to be believed.</p>

			<h1 class="RT" id="page401" style="page-break-before:always;">Split, Stuffed, Baked Chicken</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Poulet Fendu Farci au Four</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">This recipe has excited a great deal of enthusiasm in my classes. It seems to be possessed of a multitude of virtues, the ease of its preparation and the beauty of its presentation being not among the least; the breasts, moreover, being both protected from the direct onslaught of heat and nourished by the melting fats of the stuffing, remain moist and are delicately perfumed; the skin, basted from within as well as from without, crispens evenly to a rich golden brown, a miracle of beauty and flavor; it is elastic and, unlike stuffed flesh, will not shrink in contact with the heat, splitting beneath the pressure of a swelling forcemeat. I have often packed as much as a 2-inch thickness of stuffing between most parts of the flesh and the skin with perfect results.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Carving presents no problem, and it would be a pity not to carve it at table. A fairly large, stiff-bladed boning knife, which is, nonetheless, a good bit smaller than the usual carving knife, is the easiest to work with; split the bird in two (the breast bone, wishbone, and collar bone, having been broken and partially separated when the bird was flattened out, offer little resistance); delicately cut through the skin and the stuffing with the knife tip, in an arc described by the leg joint and the contour of the thigh, from the split edge to the outside extremity of the thigh; slip the knife beneath the thigh, loosening it, and far down, at the point of its contact with the backbone, cut through the fragment of vertebra—the breast and the leg will slip apart.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page402">The stuffings I find most interesting are a <em class="ital">cheese and fresh sage</em> ravioli filling (3 ounces ricotta or other fresh white cheese mashed with 4 tablespoons softened butter, an egg beaten in, seasoning, several finely chopped fresh young sage leaves, chopped parsley, and, finally, a large handful of freshly grated Parmesan and a small handful of breadcrumbs), <em class="ital">spinach</em> (same recipe as the <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page242">filling for stuffed <em class="ital">crêpes</em></a>), <em class="ital">zucchini</em> (recipe following), and <em class="ital">mushroom</em> (like the preceding recipes, the vegetable being replaced by 8 or 10 ounces of mushrooms, finely chopped or passed through the medium blade of a Mouli-juliènne and sautéed in butter over high heat until dry, a bit of lemon added). A handful of rapidly parboiled little peas or skinned tender broad beans is an attractive addition to the mushroom stuffing, or it can be treated to more fanciful variations: A quantity of unpeeled garlic cloves gently stewed with eggplant in olive oil until both are purée-tender, the two sieved together and incorporated into the cheese and mushroom mixture is quite spectacular; shredded prosciutto may be added, as may be dried morels, soaked and butter-stewed; retaining the sautéed juliènned mushroom base, the cheeses may be eliminated, the mushrooms mixed only with breadcrumbs and softened butter—<em class="ital">fines herbes</em> will help—or soft crumbs soaked in heavy cream; mushrooms, crumbs, and snail butter mashed together, and so forth . . . An egg binds but is not absolutely necessary. If the vegetable preparations are added still hot or warm to the butter and cheese mixtures, the whole becomes soupy and difficult to manage; cool them or chill them first.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The stuffing may often be sufficient garnish in itself; a potato <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page229"><em class="ital">paillasson</em></a> is a perfect supplementary garnish.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page402a">To Prepare the Chicken for Stuffing</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Note: The following directions are for chickens as they are usually dressed, throat and abdomen ripped open, for the American market; in France, chickens are bled from the beak and the intestines are unraveled through the anus before being marketed, the skin being punctured at no point. If you have the good luck to find an unemptied chicken (Kosher butchers sell them), singe it, cut off the head, the oil duct above the tail, and the feet at a halfway point, leaving about 1½ inches beyond the drumstick heel (the extra length makes it much easier to secure the leg ends in the abdominal slits); slit the neck skin along the <em class="ital">back,</em> detach it from the neck without tearing it, cut off the neck and split the chicken down the back before emptying it; the abdominal skin thus remains intact, as does the neck skin, which serves as a flap that folds over the throat opening and is tucked beneath the stuffed chicken, sealing it.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Split the chicken the entire length of the back, beginning at the tail, using heavy poultry shears, and cutting it, as nearly as possible, through the center of the backbone. Open it out on a chopping board, skin side up, the joints joining drumstick and thigh forced inward, facing. With the flat side of a mallet or cleaver—or with the heel of your hand—flatten it out with a firm (even violent) whack, fracturing breastbone, ribcage structure, collarbone, and wishbone (don’t try to remove any of the broken ribs from beneath—they are attached to thin sheets of flesh that help contain the stuffing).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page404">Only at the summit of the breastbone, at the extremities of the drumsticks, and, to each side, the length of the spinal column is the skin securely attached to the flesh by tendons; it should remain so at these points. Elsewhere only fragile and easily ruptured membranes keep skin and flesh together. Take care not to tear the skin (intact, it is supple and resistant to tearing but, once a section is torn, the flaw transforms itself easily into a gaping wound): Work, first with fingertips and, as the skin is progressively loosened, with your entire hand, reaching in through the throat cavity and separating the skin, first from one breast, then from the thigh, and, finally, from the drumstick. Before you have the drumstick in your hand, your fist and wrist will be nearly lost to view (proof of the skin’s supple resistance); repeat with the other breast and leg. If the butcher’s original damage was serious, now is the time to patch things up with a needle and some kitchen string. Cut off the wing tips at the second joint, leaving shoulder section attached—or fold them under.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Stuff the chicken, taking a handful of stuffing at a time and forcing it into place, pushing with the fingers of one hand beneath the skin while molding and forcing with the other from the outside. Coat drumsticks and thighs well first before worrying about the breasts. When all of the stuffing is in place, fold the neck-skin flap (if there is any) over the throat orifice and tuck it beneath the bird. With a small sharply pointed knife, pierce the web of skin and thin flesh between the inside of the thigh and the tip of the breast, making a slit just large enough to receive the drumstick tip. Force the drumstick gently up and push its tip through the slit to the underside. Place the bird in its roasting pan (a large skillet or a round, shallow earthenware baking dish are ideal receptacles) and mold the surface with your hands to force the skin and stuffing into a plump version of the natural form. Salt and pepper and roast, starting at 450° and turning the oven down to about 375° some 10 minutes later. Start basting regularly after ½ hour. Count 50 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the chicken, and if, after about 40 minutes, it seems to be coloring too rapidly, turn the oven down further, placing a sheet of aluminum foil loosely over the bird.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Transfer to a round, heated serving platter; don’t attempt to serve the juices—they are too fat and the dish needs no sauce (chill scrapings and juices, discard the fat, and use for flavoring a dish of leftovers).</p>

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page408">Restaurant owners in the Lyonnaise and Bressoise regions faithfully serve a crayfish sauce with this custard. It is a marriage dictated by tradition (and by Lucien Tendret) rather than by harmony. A creamed tomato sauce, a <a href="n_302-412.xhtml#page343"><em class="ital">sauce suprême,</em> or a rapid <em class="ital">sauce bâtarde</em></a> will all serve perfectly. A chicken liver custard is an exquisite thing, but it does not take well to garnish and belongs to the realm of first courses. Cold, it is another kind of splendor and needs no sauce.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A custard (liver or not) that is subjected to an excess of heat, be it ever so slight, will break; the body (which, when correctly cooked, is set in a moist and trembling, tender suspension) shrinks within itself, shot with holes bound in a honeycomb of vaguely rubbery structure, its precious liquid cast off in the unmolding. It is difficult, under the circumstances, to give precise oven temperatures; the important thing is that the water of the <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> must never approach a boil. Keep an eye on it and, if there is the slightest suggestion of a simmer, turn the thermostat down further, leaving the oven door open for a minute to reduce the heat.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Considering the relatively small proportion of livers (they make up less than one third of the bulk of the mixture), the result has an astonishingly pure-liver effect; the quantity may be reduced for a more custardy effect and a more attenuated liver flavor.</p>

				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">The liver, the marrow, and the crushed garlic may be reduced together to a purée in a blender or with a mortar and pestle. In any case, the resultant purée must be stirred together with all the other ingredients, the lot passed through a fine sieve and whisked until smooth. Pour into a generously buttered 3-pint charlotte mold, into the bottom of which has been pressed a round of buttered parchment paper (fold a square of paper in quarters and continue folding, over and over, from the central point to the center of the triangular base until only a wide-based needle remains; measure it out from the approximate center of the overturned mold, clip off the excess, open it out, and butter it). Cook in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> (the mold placed on a small grill or folded towel within a larger container that is filled with warm but not hot water to the level of the custard surface—about two thirds of the mold’s height) in a 300° to 325° oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the center is firm to the touch, the edges having just begun to shrink from the sides. Leave to relax for 5 or 6 minutes before unmolding; when unmolded, delicately peel off the round of paper, and, if you like, coat lightly with the chosen sauce, serving the rest in a sauceboat apart.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Foie gras, itself, remains, even in the regions of its production, a luxury product, gracing the tables only on very special occasions. It enjoys, there, a quality of reverence shared, perhaps, only by the truffle. (I once listened in amazement to a Périgord farmwife describing—in what was intended to be a vehement denial that the raising of geese destined to produce foie gras involves cruelty to animals—the tenderness and gentleness with which the birds are treated and, with mounting enthusiasm and in the most extraordinarily sensuous language, the suspense and the excitement experienced as the moment arrives to delicately slit the abdomen, to lovingly—ever so gently—pry it open, exposing finally the huge, glorious, and tender blond treasure, fragile object of so many months’ solicitous care and of present adoration. One sensed vividly the goose’s plenary participation, actively sharing in the orgasmic beauty of the sublime moment for which her life had been lived.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">Duck foies gras are rarely tinned commercially and a large proportion of them remain to embellish the home tables, but the prized fattened goose livers are mostly sold, fresh or sterilized, far from home. Their by-products, however—rendered goose fat and preserved goose—remain to stamp a distinctly different personality on the cooking throughout the southwestern part of France. Perhaps the best way to understand, analytically, the flavor that goose fat can impart to a preparation is to sauté raw potatoes, cut to any form, in it—and its power to refine a texture is perfectly demonstrated in a <em class="ital">garbure.</em> Omelets are prepared in goose fat, macaroni is flavored with it, soup vegetables are removed from the soup, fried in goose fat, and returned to the pot (unless you prefer to spread it on toast while eating foie gras, the fat from a tin of foie gras should be scrupulously saved for some small preparation that will appreciate it)—in short, goose fat permeates this food no less than does butter the food of Normandy or olive oil the food of Provence. The indigens’ claim that it is the only altogether digestible cooked fat should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page410">Only a goose especially fattened for the production of foie gras will be fat enough to be preserved in its own fat without a compensating addition of lard. In a country where not only is this practice abhorred, but where the deep freeze has replaced most other methods of preservation, to preserve a goose may seem like a quaint anomaly. Necessity, today, plays no role, but the necessity of the past through which a unique flavor was created may tempt us to imitate its methods to recapture a glimpse of a world apart—there is no other way to an empathie comprehension of the soul of cooking throughout the entire lower lefthand corner of the map of France.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Confit d’oie</em> is often served simply reheated, lightly browned in a bit of its fat, and garnished with potatoes or cèpes sautéed in goose fat, or sometimes with sorrel purée stewed in goose fat . . . Those who have not grown up on preserved goose will best appreciate it reheated in an undersalted liquid preparation (warmed for ½ hour in a pot of lentils or beans and added to any of a variety of thick vegetable soups); this produces an interchange normalizing both elements.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The neck (skin) is, traditionally, stuffed and preserved also, rewarmed in a pot of lentils or braised cabbage, sliced to serve—or served cold, sliced thinly like a sausage, as an hors d’oeuvre. If your goose passes through normal commercial channels, the neck will be in no condition for stuffing; order it from a Kosher butcher or ask a farmer to behead it close to the neck, keeping the neck skin intact. Remove it at the time of cutting up the goose, first cutting off the wings at the shoulder joints and separating the neck skin from the rest by cutting, front and back, between the holes left by the removed wings. Peel the skin backwards from the body toward the head end and off the neck, turning it right side out again. Sew up the small end, stuff it with the finely chopped liver, fleshy lobes of gizzard, heart, and lungs of the goose, a thick, boned, chopped pork chop, herbs, spices, and seasonings to taste, sew the large end closed, even out the stuffing in its enclosure with your hands, and refrigerate until the salted goose is ready to be cooked. Chopped truffle peelings are often added. Peeled chopped pistachios or a few green peppercorns may be added . . .</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST" id="page411">				
				<li class="IL">An approximately 8-pound goose  (or 5½ to 6 pounds cleaned and cut up)</li>

				<li class="IL">About ½ cup (4 ounces) coarse (or Kosher) salt</li>
				<li class="IL">The goose’s fat</li>

			<p class="Normal">If you have a bird with feet still attached, remove them, blister the skin of the feet regularly over a flame, and remove it with the help of a towel or paper toweling. Cut the bird up, breast split in two, legs left whole, neck detached from back, back cut into 3 or 4 flat-shaped pieces; wings and feet.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sprinkle salt and herbs into the bottom of a large stoneware jar, an earthenware <em class="ital">marmite,</em> or a porcelain or enameled ironware receptacle, taller than it is wide, pack in layers of the goose pieces, sprinkling each layer with salt and herbs. Leave, covered, in the coolest part of the house for 2 days and 2 nights.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Wipe the pieces dry with a clean towel (paper toweling will turn soggy, fragments will tear loose and cling to the flesh), discarding liquid and herbs in the jar.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Put the goose fat, lard, and water into a large skillet or <em class="ital">plat à sauter,</em> heat over medium low flame, and when the lard is melted but before the goose fat is entirely melted, arrange the cut-up goose in the pan so that, as nearly as possible, all pieces are submerged. Cook, covered, lowering the flame if necessary to keep the fat only lightly bubbling. The neck, feet, and wings may be removed after about 50 minutes to 1 hour (the stuffed goose neck, which requires about 45 minutes, replacing them). The larger pieces require from 1½ hours to 1¾ hours.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page412">The stuffed neck, which will be eaten in the days to come, can be cooled, wrapped in plastic, and refrigerated. Arrange the other pieces in a stoneware jar or other non-metallic container (not glass, which would break in contact with the hot fat), closely, leaving a minimum of air space, and pour over the hot fat, completely covering them. Leave to cool and refrigerate, tightly covered (heavy aluminum foil held in place with a rubber band, for instance). To remove pieces of <em class="ital">confit</em> without damaging them, it is usually necessary to heat the jar in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> until the fat is melted, making certain each time that all remaining pieces are submerged before permitting the fat to congeal again.</p>
