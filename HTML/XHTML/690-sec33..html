<p class="nonindent">Córdoba, in the center of the Andalucía province, specializes in this hearty braise. Oxtails, a bargain cut of meat, need to cook long and slow, to the point where the meat is falling off the bone. When you touch it with a fork, it should flake apart immediately. If it doesn’t, don’t be tempted to remove it from the oven. The seasonings here are straightforward because the cut of meat is the star. There’s a lot of bone, marrow, and collagen in oxtails, and they enrich the sauce with an incomparable beefiness. You’ll want to spoon it over <a href="sec53.xhtml#page165">Olive Oil Potato Puree</a> or scoop it up with crusty bread. An aged reserva tempranillo from Rioja balances the richness well. If you’re looking to explore the world of sherry, try an Oloroso. All you need to round out the meal is a crisp salad.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>5 pounds oxtails</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 ounces bacon, cut into ½-inch strips</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup all-purpose flour, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 celery stalks, cut into large chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large yellow onion, cut into large chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon tomato paste</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 750-ml bottle dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 rosemary sprig 4 thyme sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 fresh or dried bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 whole cloves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 cups <a href="sec33.xhtml#page113">Beef Stock</a> or store-bought unsalted beef broth</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325°F. LET THE OXTAILS</span> stand at room temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven or a large, deep ovenproof pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the bacon is crispy and brown and the fat has rendered, about 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, leaving the fat in the Dutch oven.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, season the oxtails with 1½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, then dust with the flour. Shake off the excess flour and reserve, along with any unused flour because it will be added to the pan later to help thicken the sauce. Add a single layer of the oxtails to the hot bacon fat, spacing the pieces apart. Sear, turning to brown evenly on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oxtail in two or more batches. Keep an eye on the temperature of the bacon fat so you don’t burn the residual flour that begins to gather in the pan. Lower the heat if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic to the Dutch oven. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables begin to caramelize, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the remaining flour to the Dutch oven and stir to coat all the vegetables. Add the wine, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and cloves. Bring to a simmer, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Nestle the oxtails in the vegetables and wine. Add the beef stock and bring to a simmer. Cover and transfer to the oven.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until the meat is falling off the bones, flipping the oxtails about halfway through, 3½ to 4 hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Carefully transfer the oxtails to a large bowl. Strain the sauce in the pan through a sieve, then return to the Dutch oven. Discard the solids in the sieve. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat. The sauce should have thickened during the cooking, but if not, you can reduce it by simmering it until it thickens slightly. Taste the sauce and add salt if you’d like.</p>
<p class="indent">Return the oxtails to the Dutch oven and carefully turn to thoroughly coat in the sauce. Serve hot. At this point, the entire dish can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 325°F oven for 30 minutes when you want to serve it.</p>

<h2 class="serve"><span class="small"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 2½ QUARTS</strong></span></h2>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 pounds beef bones</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 medium onions, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup tomato paste</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 parsley sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 thyme sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 whole cloves</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small"><strong>PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 450°F.</strong></span></p>
<p class="indent">Arrange the bones in a single layer in a roasting pan. Roast for 30 minutes. Turn the bones over and stir in the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, and tomato paste. Roast for 30 minutes more, stirring halfway through. You want the bones nice and golden brown and the vegetables to be on the verge of browning.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer everything to a large stockpot. Add the wine to the hot roasting pan and stir and scrape up all the browned bits. Pour into the stockpot. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then add just enough cold water to cover the solids. Add the parsley, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, and cloves. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer for 8 hours, replenishing the water if it falls below the solids.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Carefully ladle as much fat as possible off the top. Refrigerate the stock until cold. Remove and discard the solid pieces of fat on top. The stock can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.</p>
