A walk through the greenmarket supplies inspiration for an entire menu, and each plant has a particular story to tell. Vegetable combinations are stealing the spotlight more frequently than ever, at home and in our restaurants, giving us a chance to celebrate the responsible, solid, and committed work of farmers we rely on to grow an inspired community.”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>There is no pasta in this dish. Instead, the beets are thinly sliced, then baked at a low temperature to soften them. As a result, their texture becomes delicate, almost like fresh pasta sheets. At the restaurant, we use Coach Farm goat cheese, but any fresh goat cheese will do. The walnuts are a natural pairing to the beets and the watercress provides a necessary bite for a little contrast.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Candied Walnuts</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 325ºF; position the rack in the middle. Spread the walnuts out on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for 10 minutes or until fragrant. Set the walnuts aside while you make the sugar glaze.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a medium pot, combine the sugar with 1 cup of water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the cinnamon, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 4 minutes, until you smell the cinnamon and sugar caramelizing. Fold in the walnuts and cook for 30 seconds more. Transfer the coated nuts to a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined baking sheet and spread them into an even layer. Allow the nuts to cool to room temperature, then crush the nuts using your hands or a mallet.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Walnut Vinaigrette</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Using a fork, in a small bowl blend the olive oil, sherry vinegar, and walnut oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The vinaigrette will look “broken,” not uniform or emulsified.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Watercress and Endive Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a large bowl, toss the watercress and endive together. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Beet Ravioli Sheets</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Using an adjustable mandoline, slice the beet into 1/16-inch-thick slices. You will need 24 slices. Using a ring cutter, cut each slice into a 2½-inch circle. Lay the cut circles on a Silpat-lined baking sheet and brush them with a little olive oil. Bake the beet circles for 10 minutes or until soft. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Goat Cheese Filling</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the goat cheese, chives, parsley, shallots, salt, and pepper, and mix on low speed until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a #8 tip. Line a large cutting board or a counter with parchment paper. Lay 12 of the beet circles on the paper. Pipe the filling onto the circles, leaving a ½-inch unfilled border around the filling. Repeat until all 12 circles are filled. Place the remaining beet circles on top of the filled beet circles, and using the dull side of a <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page187">½-inch ring cutter</a>, gently mold the ravioli into shape and press the edges of the beet circles together. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut the ravioli into shape.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page162">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Divide the ravioli among 4 chilled plates—you should have 3 ravioli per plate. Place the Watercress and Endive Salad on top of the ravioli and around each plate, and drizzle the Walnut Vinaigrette over. Crumble the goat cheese and sprinkle some Candied Walnuts on top and around the ravioli. Drizzle some walnut oil on top before serving.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Instead of making the ravioli, make a beet and goat cheese salad instead. Simply wrap the beets in foil and roast at 400ºF until you can easily pierce the beet with a knife, then thinly slice the beets as if for ravioli. Make the Candied Walnuts and the Walnut Vinaigrette; Toss the beets and the walnuts with the watercress and endive, add the goat cheese and the accompanying herbs, and dress with the vinaigrette for a simple, delicious salad.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4 </span>I got the idea for this dish when I was on <span class="ital">The Next Iron Chef</span>, battling Chef Marco Canora. He made this amazing Eggplant Parmigiano-Reggiano that the judges absolutely loved. When I got back to New York, it happened to be eggplant season, and I started to play around with various combinations. In the end, I loved how the eggplant worked with tomato confit and creamy, runny burrata. Thank you, Marco, for the inspiration.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small, dry skillet, toast the black pepper over low heat for about 3 minutes or until fragrant. Transfer the pepper to a small saucepot and add the oil. Warm the oil and peppercorns over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 180ºF. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the oil to infuse at room temperature for 4 hours before using. Strain the oil through a coffee filter into a bowl and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tomato Confit</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 275ºF; position the rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice the tomatoes crosswise into ½-inch-thick slices and lay them on the lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the garlic slices evenly over the tomatoes, drizzle them with olive oil, and season with some sugar, salt, and pepper. Scatter the thyme and bay leaves on top. Bake for about 1 hour or until the tomatoes are wilted and look a little dry. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature. Leave the oven on. Discard the thyme and bay leaves. Remove the skins from the tomatoes and roughly chop the tomato flesh. Place the tomatoes and the pan juices in a medium bowl. Add the basil, toss to combine, and set the mixture aside in a cool place. If making the eggplant via Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions, raise the oven temperature to 300ºF; otherwise, raise the heat to 350ºF.</p>

Divide the eggplant, olive oil, basil, and garlic equally among 4 vacuum-seal bags. Press out the extra air from the bags and seal. Poach the eggplant in the immersion circulator for about 45 minutes. Transfer the bags to an ice bath and cool the eggplant for 10 minutes. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="step4"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions:</span> In an ovenproof pot set over medium heat, warm the oil until the temperature registers 180ºF on a deep-frying thermometer.

Add the eggplant, basil, and garlic to the oil and transfer the pot to the oven. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the eggplant is soft. Transfer to a cooling rack and set aside to cool. Raise the oven temperature to 450ºF. When the eggplant is cool, transfer it to a fine-mesh strainer and drain, discarding the basil and garlic.</p>

Shake the pan a little bit so the cubes do not stick together. Cook until the bread is evenly toasted on all sides. Add the garlic and toss to coat. Cook until the garlic is toasted. You must watch the pan carefully—you do not want to burn the garlic. As soon as it is toasted, add the parsley, and immediately transfer the mixture to the lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the bread cubes with the lemon zest and red pepper flakes, and season with salt and black pepper. Set aside.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Did you know that the original Caesar salad dressing contained no anchovies? The salad, which is one of my favorite things to eat, was invented at Hotel Cesar in Tijuana, Mexico, by a chef who was an Italian immigrant. In the 1920s, at the height of Prohibition, Los Angeles socialites were coming to Tijuana in droves to drink and party, and many stayed at this upscale hotel on the water.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">The story is that the salad was a result of kitchen resourcefulness on the part of the chef; the kitchen had ran out of fresh vegetables, and the chef had to come up with a salad with what was in the pantry: Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, eggs, lemon, garlic, and lettuce. Originally, the salad was served without forks. Hotel guests were brought a large plate of lettuce leaves, the ends of which were left undressed so the guests could pick them up with their hands and not bother looking all that civilized.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">While our dressing is closer to the original in that it, too, contains no anchovies, that’s purely a coincidence. I learned of the traditional dressing recipe well after I had started making this salad at the restaurant as an attempt to create something a little lighter for the spring.</p>
