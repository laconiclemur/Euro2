<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Many years ago, a talented actor from <em>The Sopranos</em> gave me his grand-mother’s beloved meatball recipe. He went into great detail about her method and encouraged me to try the meatballs. Indeed, they sounded delicious, and quickly became a signature dish in many of my kitchens.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4 GENEROUSLY]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">Tomato Sauce (<a href="chapter008f.xhtml#page-269">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup dried currants</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 yellow onion, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 cups homemade fresh bread crumbs (<a href="chapter008f.xhtml#page-268">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup whole milk</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ pound ground pork</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ pound ground veal</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ pound ground beef</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ pound ground mortadella</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup pine nuts, toasted</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ teaspoons coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredient">Flour, for dredging</p>
<p class="ingredient">Oil, for frying (corn, peanut, vegetable, canola, or grapeseed oil all work well)</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In a large pot</strong>, bring the tomato sauce to a simmer and keep it warm over low heat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, put the currants and sherry vinegar in a small bowl and cover them with warm water. Let the currants soak for 10 minutes, drain, and set aside.</p>
<p>Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, basil, and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Remove the aromatics from the heat and set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, put the bread crumbs in a large bowl with the milk and stir to combine so that the mixture is nice and soft. Add all of the ground meats and the cooled aromatic mixture, along with the drained currants, pine nuts, chili flakes, oregano, nutmeg, salt, pepper, cheese, and eggs.</p>
<p>Generously coat the surface of a baking sheet with flour. To form the meatballs, <a id="page-195"/>grab a handful of the meat and squeeze it to allow for some of the meat to escape from the top of your hand just beside your thumb. This squeezing will create wonderfully rustic, not-too-perfectly-round meatballs that you can allow to simply fall to the baking sheet as you make them. This method will naturally portion the meatballs and keep you from overhandling them, which is what causes most tough meatballs.</p>

<p class="img"><img alt="image" src="images/Art_P0195-2.jpg"/></p>
<p>Give the baking sheet a shake, allowing the meatballs to roll around and coat themselves in the flour. A meatball that is not necessarily smooth, round, and uniform will have a delicious crunchy surface with dimples, which will hold more sauce.</p>
<p>Set a large sauté pan over medium heat and coat it with a shallow layer of vegetable oil. Add enough meatballs to fit in a single, uncrowded layer and fry until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a paper towel–lined plate to drain and continue frying off the meatballs, in batches, until you’ve browned them all.</p>
<p>Carefully transfer the meatballs to the simmering tomato sauce and finish cooking them in the sauce for 20 minutes.</p>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTES</h1>
<p class="noindenth1"><strong>1.</strong> These meatballs freeze beautifully in their sauce, so feel free to double the recipe and stow some away for a rainy day.</p>
<p class="noindenth1"><strong>2.</strong> Remember that miniature meatballs are great for cocktail parties.</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This humble, old, quaint dish is a French shepherd’s pie of spiced, ground meat topped with mashed potatoes. I like to imagine it being served in cafeterias to schoolchildren. You can make the <em>hachis</em> in one large baking dish, or divide it among individual gratin dishes or ramekins, so everyone gets one for him- or herself. With a simple salad and a basket of bread, dinner is served.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">10 allspice berries</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ teaspoons whole black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon fennel seeds</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon coriander seeds</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 pound ground beef (at least 20 percent fat)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small carrot, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small celery stalk, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small red onion, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups water</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Combine the allspice</strong> berries, peppercorns, fennel seeds, and coriander seeds in a coffee grinder or spice mill and process them to a fine powder. Set the spice mixture aside.</p>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Crumble in the meat and cook, stirring occasionally, until it renders off most of its fat and starts to take on a lovely brown color, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the reserved spice mixture and the carrot, celery, and onion to the meat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and the mixture is incredibly fragrant, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Add a teaspoon of salt to the meat mixture along with the white wine. Increase the heat to high and let the mixture boil until the wine has nearly evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the water to the pan and let the mixture come to a boil. Reduce the heat and allow the mixture to simmer, skimming off and discarding any fat that rises to the surface. Cook until the mixture becomes concentrated and the liquid has nearly evaporated, about 30 minutes. Season the meat to taste with salt and set it aside.</p>
<p>While the meat mixture is cooking, prepare the potato purée. Put the potatoes into a large saucepan filled with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Let the potatoes cook until they’re completely soft, about 25 minutes. Test them by piercing them with a paring knife, but don’t overdo it; you don’t want the potatoes to get waterlogged. When the potatoes are cooked through, drain them in a colander.</p>
<p><a id="page-197"/>Peel the potatoes (see Recipe Notes) and press them through a tamis (see Recipe Notes) or pass them through a potato ricer or a food mill into a large bowl.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, warm the cream and the butter in a small saucepan until the butter has melted, then vigorously mix them into the potatoes. Season the potatoes to taste with salt and set them aside.</p>
<p>To assemble the final dish, spread the meat out in a thin, even layer either in a large baking dish or among four individual gratin dishes. Spread the potato purée evenly over the meat. Bake in the oven until the potatoes are browned on top, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<h1 class="simplesect-titlehs">On Peeling Hot Potatoes</h1>
<p class="noindent">While there’s something comical about handling a hot potato, there’s nothing efficient about trying to peel one. To overcome this without wasting the time it takes for a potato to cool, I simply stab a potato with a fork and hold the handle of the fork, spinning it so I can use a small paring knife in my other hand to quickly and easily peel the potato without having to actually hold it. How cool!</p>
</div>
<div class="simplesect">
<h1 class="simplesect-titlehs">What’s a Tamis?</h1>
<p class="noindent">A wonderful kitchen utensil often used in restaurant kitchens, but rarely in home kitchens, a tamis looks a bit like a cake pan but with a fine-mesh sieve for a base. Soft foods, like cooked potatoes, get pushed through, using a wooden spoon or a plastic scraper to help the process. The result is an incredibly smooth, silky purée that doesn’t require an appliance, engine, or button.</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Don’t be fooled by the elaborate name of this incredibly simple dish—it means “garnished sauerkraut” and is just cabbage adorned with a bit of pork. In my version, I warm a bed of good sauerkraut with hard cider and a few crushed juniper berries and then tuck in bits of leftover pork. Below I include a step for roasting pork belly since it’s incredibly tasty and easy to prepare, but it’s in no way required. Use whatever you like and whatever you might have on hand.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 pounds pork belly, skin intact if possible</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 cups sauerkraut (see sidebar, opposite), rinsed and drained</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup high-quality hard apple cider or beer, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">5 juniper berries, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon sugar (optional, depending on sweetness of cider)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 pound leftover cooked pork (ham, shank, shoulder, sausages, etc.), thickly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">Mustard, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</p>
<p>Coarsely grind the salt, peppercorns, and fennel together in a coffee grinder and rub the mixture all over the pork belly. Place the pork belly on the prepared baking sheet and roast in the oven until the fat has rendered significantly, the skin is browned and crisp, and the meat is tender, 2 to 3 hours depending on the thickness of the belly. Cut the meat into thick slices and set it aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the sauerkraut, cider, and juniper berries in a large pot and bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat so that it’s just barely at a simmer. Taste the sauerkraut and add the sugar if you think it needs it, and salt too; it all depends on the flavor of the sauerkraut and sweetness of the cider you’re using.</p>
<p>Tuck the reserved pork belly into the sauerkraut along with the additional cooked pork and simmer everything together until the meat is warmed through and the sauerkraut is soft, at least 20 minutes, but possibly up to 2 hours. The longer it goes, the more succulent it gets, and feel free to add a splash more cider as it cooks if needed.</p>
<p>Serve warm, with plenty of mustard.</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="special">If choucroute garnie is the best possible way to use up leftover bits of pork, then a choucroute garnie sandwich is the best use of leftover leftovers. For this, one of the most satisfying, incredibly wonderful sandwiches ever, spread both cut sides of a crusty ciabatta roll with Dijon mustard and stuff it full of warm, leftover sauerkraut and whatever bits of pork belly, pork shank, ham, anything!, that are left too. This sandwich is reason alone to make choucroute garnie.</span></p>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">On Sauerkraut: How to Buy It and How to Make It</span></h1>
<p class="noindenth1"><em>This dish is all about the cabbage—the meat is just the garnish. Therefore, it’s essential that you use sauerkraut with good crunch and tremendous flavor. For local, artisanal sauerkraut, check out what’s available at your farmers’ market. Sometimes I do a quick sauerkraut</em> à la minute. <em>For that, simply slice half a green cabbage, put it in a large bowl, and pour boiling water over it. Let it sit in the hot water for a minute, then drain it. In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons of white vinegar with 3 tablespoons of water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and a few crushed juniper berries. Pour this mixture over the barely wilted cabbage and stir to combine. Let it sit for at least 1 hour before eating. This makes a very nice, fresh sauerkraut that’s especially lovely on sandwiches. You can cook it down for choucroute garnie, but really it’s best as a crunchy salad.</em></p>
