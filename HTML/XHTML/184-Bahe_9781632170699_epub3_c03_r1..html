<p class="left" id="p1"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">BECAUSE OF THEIR NORTHERN LATITUDES,</span> Scandinavian countries have long, dark winters, which make the light-filled days of summer even more highly prized. In far northern parts of the region, the days are so long at Midsummer that the sun doesn’t set at all! Midsummer is one of the biggest annual celebrations in Scandinavian countries, second only to Christmas. Friends and family gather to make crowns from wildflowers, dance around a flower-covered maypole, build glorious bonfires, and eat favorite summer foods. Businesses close their doors, and everyone flocks to the countryside to celebrate the fleeting beauty that is summer in Scandinavia.</p>
<p class="section_pg" id="p2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" title="47"/><strong>CREATING THE GATHERING</strong></p>
<p class="left" id="p3">Midsummer celebrations are all about being outside and enjoying the beautiful weather. A backyard patio table or card table set up in the garden is a great spot for a Midsummer lunch or dinner. Casual white table linens look crisp and fresh and provide a wonderful backdrop for the abundant floral decorations, fresh greenery, and delicious summer fare. White lights strung in trees or on patio structures lend an air of magic, as do candles tucked in among the flowers on the table, and lawn games like croquet and badminton offer guests good old-fashioned summertime entertainment.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p13">Every summer, a little community, called Junction City, near my hometown in western Oregon holds a four-day festival celebrating Scandinavian culture, and it draws crowds from all over the state and beyond. Children perform folk dances dressed in homemade <em>bunads</em> (traditional Scandinavian costumes), holding hands and whirling around the stage, stomping their feet and clapping their hands. Members of the festival association, outfitted in impressive Viking garb and horned helmets, wander the crowd and pose for pictures with tourists. There are exhibits and displays featuring Nordic painting, needlework, and crafts. And the food! People line up for blocks to try <em>aebleskiver</em> (Danish pancake balls), meatballs and gravy, Finnish funnel cakes, and every kind of Norwegian cookie imaginable. One of the longest food lines every summer is for the Swedish meat pie booth. These tasty pasties are filled with a savory mixture of meat, potatoes, cheese, and spices. My husband has been known to buy them by the dozen and put them in the freezer in case a craving hits. I created my own version of Swedish meat pies so that we can enjoy them fresh all year long.</p>

<p class="IL_text" id="p32">Swedish meat pies actually taste best when they’re not piping hot. They get better (and won’t burn your mouth) after cooling for a little while. This—plus their portability—makes them great make-ahead party food!</p>
</div>
<p class="step" id="p33"><span class="step_num">1.</span> To make the crust, in a large bowl with an electric mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sour cream on medium speed until smooth, about 15 seconds. Add the flour and salt, and beat on low just until smooth, about 20 seconds. Wrap the dough in a piece of plastic wrap, and chill it until firm, at least 1 hour.</p>
<p class="step" id="p34"><span class="step_num">2.</span> While the dough is chilling, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the onion, celery, and carrot, and sauté until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and potatoes, and sauté for 2 minutes more, until the garlic is fragrant. Add the ground beef, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice. Crumble the meat, and cook it until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat, and stir in the cheddar cheese until evenly distributed. Cover the skillet, and allow the mixture to cool until the crust is thoroughly chilled. Once the beef mixture has cooled slightly, you can put it in the refrigerator to continue cooling while the crust chills.</p>
<p class="step" id="p35"><span class="step_num">3.</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" title="50"/>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="step" id="p36"><span class="step_num">4.</span> Divide the chilled dough into eight equal portions. On a well-floured surface, roll each portion of dough into a circle about 8 inches in diameter. Divide the filling into eight equal portions. Place a scoop of filling on one side of a dough circle, and spread the filling out to cover half of the circle. Stay about 1 inch from the edge of the dough, and make sure the filling is only on one side of the circle. Use your finger to lightly brush the edge of the dough circle with water, then fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to seal the pie. Dip a fork in flour, gently press the fork along the edge of the pie to crimp it, then poke two or three holes gently in the top of the pie to let steam escape.</p>
<p class="step" id="p37"><span class="step_num">5.</span> Put the pie on a prepared baking sheet, and repeat step 4 to assemble the remaining seven pies.</p>
<p class="step" id="p38"><span class="step_num">6.</span> Bake for 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden and bubbly. Allow the pies to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p41">Skansen is a lovely outdoor folk museum in Stockholm. There are authentic cottages and manor houses, churches, farmsteads, and workshops from over five hundred years of Swedish history, all populated by workers in traditional Scandinavian costumes. My mom and sisters spent a magical Midsummer at Skansen one year. Out of all the fun things they did—making crowns out of fresh flowers and greenery, dancing around a maypole, and eating all of the delicious Swedish food—the thing my mom came home from that vacation raving about was a salad she had at one of the Skansen restaurants. It was full of beautiful colors, flavors, and textures, and it made as big an impression as anything else from the Midsummer festivities. <em>Mangoraja</em> is a Swedish condiment that is flavored with curry and mango. It is sweet and creamy, and makes this colorful salad truly unique.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p100">June kicks off strawberry season all across Scandinavia. For as long as anyone can remember, Scandinavian children have spent their summers picking wild, sun-ripened berries and stringing them onto pieces of straw or grass. To me that sounds like the very best use of a summer day. This simple recipe highlights the sweet flavor and rosy color of those most precious summer strawberries.</p>
<p class="yield" id="p101">MAKES ABOUT 3 QUARTS</p>
<div class="ingredients" id="div39">
<p class="IL_item" id="p102">1 pound fresh or frozen strawberries</p>
<p class="IL_item" id="p103">1 quart half-and-half</p>
<p class="IL_item" id="p104">2½ cups sugar</p>

<p class="IL_text" id="p113">This recipe works best in those old-fashioned ice cream machines that have a large-capacity canister and use ice and rock salt to freeze the ice cream. If you only have a smaller ice cream machine (one that makes ice cream using a prefrozen bowl), never fear—you can still make this delicious strawberry treat! You have two options: you can make the full recipe and freeze it in batches, or you can cut the recipe in half.</p>
</div>
<p class="step" id="p114"><span class="step_num">1.</span> In a blender, combine all of the ingredients, blending until smooth. You will need to work in batches. As you finish each batch, pour it into a large pitcher. When all of the ingredients have been blended and poured into the pitcher, use a long-handled spoon to stir the mixture and make sure it is well combined.</p>
<p class="step" id="p115"><span class="step_num">2.</span> Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve and into the canister of an ice cream machine. Churn the mixture and freeze it according to the ice cream machine instructions. The ice cream is done churning when it has reached the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.</p>
<p class="step" id="p116"><span class="step_num">3.</span> Scoop the ice cream into an airtight container and put it in the freezer to harden.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p117">Midsummer and fresh flowers were practically made for each other. Floral crowns grace the heads of the womenfolk, and towering maypoles festooned with blossoms preside over community and family gatherings. A garland made of fresh greenery and summer blooms brings the natural beauty of the summer season to the table, and is a fun alternative to the usual dinner party floral centerpiece.</p>

<p class="IL_text" id="p125">This fresh flower garland will only look its best for a few hours after being made. Be sure to make it the same day you want to use it, and store it in a cool place until needed.</p>
</div>
<p class="step" id="p126"><span class="step_num">1.</span> Measure a piece of 12-gauge wire so that it extends the entire length of your table, and trim it with the wire cutters.</p>
<p class="step" id="p127"><span class="step_num">2.</span> Use the pruning shears or floral scissors to trim all the flowers and greenery so that they are ready to be arranged. Snip off any dead ends and remove unnecessary leaves. I like to separate mine into piles by variety.</p>
<p class="step" id="p128"><span class="step_num">3.</span> Make a small bouquet with some greenery in the back and flowers in the front. Since this is going on a table, it only needs to look great from one side. Use the floral tape to wrap the bouquet tightly about 2 inches from the stem end.</p>
<p class="step" id="p129"><span class="step_num">4.</span> Continue making small bouquets until you have used up all of your flowers and greenery. Reserve a few flowers for the final step.</p>
<p class="step" id="p130"><span class="step_num">5.</span> Place a bouquet on one end of the 12-gauge wire. Using the thinner 24-gauge wire, securely fasten the bouquet to the thick wire by wrapping it until it feels stable. Trim the wire, and tuck the end behind the bouquet.</p>
<p class="step" id="p131"><span class="step_num">6.</span> Place the next bouquet on the thick wire so that it is overlapping with the first bouquet enough to cover any wire and floral tape. Attach the second bouquet with thin wire just like you did in the last step.</p>
<p class="step" id="p132"><span class="step_num">7.</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page59" title="59"/>Continue placing and wrapping bouquets until your thick wire is completely covered. Add the last bouquet going the opposite direction, overlapping the wired section with the previous bouquet’s wired section. After placing the garland on the table in its permanent spot, tuck the reserved flowers gently into the garland to cover the wires and fill in the space between the last two bouquets.</p>

Technically, Midsummer is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, which usually falls around June 21. But over the years, each country in Scandinavia has adapted its Midsummer celebration to suit its needs. In Norway and Denmark Midsummer is always celebrated on June 23, while in Finland and Sweden it is always on a Saturday between June 20 and 26.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p135">Midsummer crowns are made of beautiful, fresh greenery and wildflowers. They adorn the head of every fair maiden in attendance at any Midsummer celebration. They are lush and gorgeous…and fleeting. The only bad thing about fresh flower crowns is their incredibly short lifespan—you only get to wear them once! Flower crowns made with faux flowers and greenery are equally beautiful and have the added bonus of lasting forever, so you can wear them even after your Midsummer feast.</p>

<p class="IL_text" id="p141">Lots of faux greenery comes in plastic now, which looks very realistic but gets tangled easily in hair. Try to find softer materials for your garland, such as fabric or silk.</p>

<p class="step" id="p142"><span class="step_num">1.</span> Wrap the length of greenery garland around your head (or the head of the person for whom you are making the crown) until the edges touch. Add another 2 inches past the place where the ends overlap, and use the wire cutters to cut the garland. Wrap the overlapped ends of the garland tightly with green floral tape until the crown is secure.</p>
<p class="step" id="p143"><span class="step_num">2.</span> Trim the silk flowers so that their stems are about 3 inches long, and trim off any greenery along the stems. Gather small bunches of three or four flowers into little bouquets, and tightly wrap the stems with the floral tape.</p>
<p class="step" id="p144"><span class="step_num">3.</span> Tuck these small bouquets into the greenery garland crown, and secure them with more floral tape. Add bouquets all around the crown, or put a big cluster on one side to be worn over the ear.</p>
