<p class="nonindent">Canelones come steaming out of Catalan kitchens throughout the holidays. They’re often served the day after Christmas because they’re a good way to use up leftover meat. Plus, whole casseroles filled with the meaty pasta rolls smothered in creamy sauce are great for feeding big families. It’s just what you want on a chilly winter day. I prefer to stuff my canelones with freshly braised meat sauce, but the technique below can be used with any cooked meat you have on hand or even tuna. That’s what I love about Spanish food. Basic formulas are infinitely adaptable.</p>
<p class="indent">The other thing I like is how easy it is to re-create authentic Spanish food in the U.S. The only specialty item for canelones is the dried pasta squares, but I found a readily available substitute. Barilla makes and sells flat no-bake lasagna sheets that taste just like the originals and are even easier to use since they don’t require pre-boiling.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 no-boil straight-edged lasagna noodles</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3½ cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup all-purpose</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 to 4 cups <a href="sec32.xhtml#page108">Braised Meat and Chicken Liver Tomato Sauce</a></strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>flour</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 ounces Manchego cheese, grated (1½ cups)</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">ARRANGE ONE OVEN RACK IN THE UPPER THIRD</span> of the oven and one in the center and preheat to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indent">Place the lasagna noodles in a 9- by 13- by 2-inch baking dish; it’s okay if they overlap. Pour boiling water over them and separate them to make sure they don’t stick to one another. Let stand for 5 minutes. Use a flat spatula to carefully transfer each noodle to a cutting board without breaking, then cut each in half crosswise to form two squares. Empty the dish and wipe clean.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pour the milk into a large measuring cup with a spout. Microwave on high until hot, about 3½ minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the flour and raise the heat to medium. Cook, stirring continuously with a silicone spatula and scraping the bottom. Let the mixture bubble to cook the raw flour taste out of it, but don’t let it brown, stirring the whole time so the flour doesn’t burn. Take it to just before it begins to color so you know the flour’s cooked out, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the milk, a little at a time, whisking continuously.</p>
<p class="indent">It should be the consistency of a runny sauce, thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, but not stiff. This béchamel is thin because you want it to be saucy even after it bakes. Bring it to a boil and whisk for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and whisk in the nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</p>
<p class="indent">Spread 1½ cups béchamel in the bottom of the dish. Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons meat sauce in a line down the center of 1 pasta square, then tightly roll the noodle around the filling. The ends of the pasta should overlap by a scant ¼ inch. Place the filled canelone seam side down over the béchamel in the dish in one corner. Repeat with the remaining noodles and meat sauce and arrange the filled canelones side by side in the dish. You should have 2 rows of 8 canelones.</p>
<p class="indent">Dollop the remaining 1½ cups béchamel over the canelones and spread evenly over the <a id="page108"/>pasta. Be sure to cover the pasta entirely, all the way to the edges of the pan, to prevent the pasta from burning when you broil the cheese. At this point, the dish can be covered tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 1 week. Uncover before proceeding.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When ready to bake, cover the dish tightly with foil and bake on the center rack until really hot throughout and bubbling, about 45 minutes. It’ll take longer to cook if it’s been refrigerated. Change the oven setting to broil. Uncover the casserole and sprinkle the cheese evenly on top.</p>
<p class="indent">Broil on the upper rack until the cheese is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
<h2 class="sec2"><span class="border1">BRAISED MEAT <span class="small">AND</span> CHICKEN LIVER TOMATO SAUCE</span></h2>
<h2 class="serve"><span class="small">MAKES 6 CUPS</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Growing up, I loved my mom’s Bolognese sauce, especially her combination of beef, pork, bacon, and chicken liver. When I decided to create a canelone dish for Cúrate, I immediately thought of that sauce. Even though it’s not Spanish, it has the soulful warmth common to canelone fillings. I started with ground meat, but quickly switched to big cuts so I could braise chunks and end up with a shredded meat sauce. Chicken livers and bacon take it over the top with their decadence and are balanced by sweet carrots and dry wine. Be sure to cook with a bottle you’d drink. Your sauce tastes more elegant with it and it’s the perfect pairing for this dish.</p>
<p class="indent">This sauce is meant for the Canelones (<a href="sec32.xhtml#page107">here</a>) but you can spoon it over a pile of <a href="sec53.xhtml#page165">Olive Oil Potato Puree</a> or any type of pasta, rice, or bread.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound pork butt or shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound beef bottom round roast, cut into 2-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>5 slices bacon (5 ounces), cut into ½-inch strips crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large or 2 small yellow onions, very finely chopped (1¼ cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ large stalks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>celery, very finely chopped (¾ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ large carrot, peeled and very finely chopped (½ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup tomato paste</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 quart <a href="sec40.xhtml#page136">Chicken Stock</a> or store-bought unsalted chicken broth</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ pound chicken livers, veins removed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350°F.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Get the oil ripping hot over high heat in a very large Dutch oven. You want it almost smoking. If it’s not hot enough, the meat won’t brown properly. You’re going to brown the meat in batches because you’re never going to be able to fit all of it in one pan. You want them to brown and not steam. We’re developing flavor in this step. Add the pork to the hot oil in a single layer, spacing the pieces 2 inches apart. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook, turning when the bottom is golden brown, and lightly brown the other side, 2 to 4 minutes total. You’re only browning 2 sides because you don’t need to cook it all the way at this point. Transfer the pork to a plate. Spoon out excess oil; you want just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Repeat with the remaining pork and beef, working in batches with the meat spaced 2 inches apart. You can mix the pork and beef.</p>
<p class="indent">Turn off the heat and add the bacon. Turn the heat to medium and cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp. Add 2 tablespoons butter, the onions, celery, and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender and just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Push the vegetables to one side and add the tomato paste to the other side of the pan. Cook alone on that side of the pan, stirring, until caramelized, about 2 minutes. Stir with everything else in the pan and cook, stirring, until the mixture changes from bright red to a dark orange, almost amber color, about 4 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil, and reduce, stirring frequently, until the liquid has almost all evaporated. Cook out all the wine to take out the flavor of the alcohol and to lessen the acidity.</p>
<p class="indent">Add all of the meat with its accumulated juices and the chicken stock. Stir well. The chicken stock should just cover all of the solids. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover with a lid and transfer to the oven. Braise until the meat is really tender, about 3 hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Uncover and let cool slightly, then shred all of the meat in the pot with forks until finely shredded.</p>
<p class="indent">Melt the remaining tablespoon butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the chicken livers and sear until the bottoms are browned, then flip and cook until other side is browned and they’re firm to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes. When you poke a liver, it should bounce back. Transfer to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, finely mince as you would if you were putting them in giblet gravy.</p>
<p class="indent">Mix the chicken livers into the meat mixture. Add 2 teaspoons salt, and taste. Add more salt if you’d like and season to taste with pepper. Use the sauce immediately in Canelones (<a href="sec32.xhtml#page107">here</a>) or cool completely before chilling. The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month.</p>
