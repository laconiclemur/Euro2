			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page3"><span class="lead-in">the food in this book</span> has been culled from all the corners of France, but I have done little to prevent the spirit from veering sharply toward the south, not only because the flavors of Provençal food tend to be direct and uncomplicated, reflecting the sharp clarity of the light and the landscape, but also, in particular, because for the last ten years my shopping has been done in Mediterranean markets, my day-to-day cooking inclines to respect the local formulas, the tables I share are Provençal, and perhaps most of all because a certain intimacy has bred an uneasy sense of the gentle dissipation of regional culinary traditions and the need to succor them. The internationalizing influence is not unique to Provence—or to France. My alarm is merely greater.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The alarm is generally shared—indeed it is as familiar a topic of casual conversation as the weather—but the active countermovement is limited largely to gastronomic journalists, professional cooks, and restaurant owners, passionate defenders of <span class="text-italic">la cuisine de bonne femme</span>. These sympathetic warriors have done tremendous good, but theirs is a worldly and sophisticated public and they are powerless to reach the heart of the cancer lodged in the country kitchens. The result is that regional cooking is slowly being transplanted from the home to the restaurant with, except in the hands of a few cooks of unusual talent, an accompanying loss of personality.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page4">It has seemed to me, at least among the working-class men—masons, carpenters, truck drivers, plumbers, blacksmiths with whom I have been in contact over the years as I consolidate one corner of the house or another—that they are much more attached to the time-honored eating habits of the region than the women; admittedly the men are not in the kitchen and the time-saving devices, so attractive to their wives, seem of little interest by comparison to the succulence of a <em class="ital">daube</em> remembered from a grandmother’s kitchen. When the men gather around the <em class="ital">casse-croûte matinal,</em> an early morning work break, with charcuterie, cheese, and red wine, the conversation unfailingly turns to food. The descriptions of the <em class="ital">bons gueuletons,</em> past or to come, are marvelous (<em class="ital">gueuleton</em> cannot be translated in a word; it means a meal among friends comporting many dishes washed down by great quantities of better-than-ordinary wine, lasting for hours and accompanied by much gaiety and laughter. Any non-working day is an occasion for a <em class="ital">gueuleton.</em> The dimensions of such a Bacchanal may vary from <em class="ital">un bon petit gueuleton</em> to <em class="ital">un gueuleton à tout casser</em>). The regularity with which they ask me to write out recipes for their wives is astonishing (flattering and amusing as well—although the wives are sometimes not amused). It is never a question of a preparation unknown or unusual—adventurers they are not; they always ask for a traditional regional dish, something remembered sentimentally and mouth-wateringly from childhood that mothers and grandmothers prepared to perfection—dishes that belonged to every Provençal housewife’s repertoire until World War II threw everything out of joint: rabbit civets and terrines, snails <em class="ital">à la suçarelle,</em> stuffed braised cabbage, sautéed chicken <em class="ital">à la Provençale, daube à la Provençale, pieds et paquets à la Marseillaise.</em> The <em class="ital">pieds</em> and <em class="ital">paquets</em> are braised mutton tripes; bourgeois families, while remaining loyal to local traditions of cooking, sift them carefully to eliminate “vulgar” elements. A neighbor now in her mid-eighties, <em class="ital">la grande dame du pays</em> and a charming and cultivated remnant of <em class="ital">la vieille France,</em> to whom I recently served <em class="ital">pieds et paquets,</em> admitted, while broad-mindedly accepting a third serving, that, although knowing well its reputation, it was her first confrontation with the dish and she added, with regret, that she would never be able to serve a preparation of that sort at her own table. When she receives, the preparations are simple but the products must be noble: the fish are local rock lobsters, Mediterranean sea bass, or the little coastal red rock mullets; the roasts leg of lamb, guinea fowl, or, during the game season, pheasant, thrush, or partridge.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page5">Inhabitants of neighboring towns consider the village near which I live to be backward—some say inbred—“because it is off the main road.” It is, in fact, but a few meters off the main road, which means that “foreigners” (Parisians) are not driving in a constant stream through the heart of the village. The streets are regularly blocked by the insouciant passage of the shepherd and his troop; the women still beat their laundry along the streams; stuffed eggplant and zucchini are carried through the streets at eleven o’clock in the morning to be installed in the ovens of the local bakery and picked up an hour or so later; the men devote half the year to playing pétanque and drinking pastis and the other half to playing cards and drinking pastis, and if, upon entering the general store, a couple of housewives happen to be discussing with the shopkeeper the various merits of their respective <em class="ital">ratatouilles</em> or <em class="ital">soupes au pistou,</em> one may as well expect to wait half an hour before being served. These are picturesque details, perhaps of minor importance, but they are comforting—one is tempted to hope that the reins of stubborn habit are strong enough to frustrate the famous industrial revolution for some time to come.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page6">Comforting also are the fantastic, crowded out-of-door morning markets, of which that in Toulon is exemplary, bearing ample witness to the fact that people still want fresh garden produce and seafood and to the certainty that, on the whole, the French willingly spend a great deal more on food than a similar budget in any other part of the world would permit. The banks of fruits and vegetables, freshly picked (depending on the season, baby violet artichokes, tender young broad beans, tiny green beans, peas, tomatoes, fennel, squash, and zucchini squash with its flower still clinging; creamy white cauliflower the size of one’s fist, giant sweet peppers, and asparagus—white, violet, and green; figs, cherries, peaches, strawberries, raspberries, and medlar; the endless tresses of garlic and wild mushrooms of all kinds (including the divine amanita of the Caesars); and crates full of live snails and crabs, both of which constantly escape and wander in a wide circle around the vendor’s stand. There are the odors of basil and <em class="ital">pissaladière;</em> the mongers’ cants, melodic and raucous; and the Renoiresque play of light through the plane trees’ foliage, an all-over sense of gaiety and well-being. The concert is a vibrant experience, the beauty of which is breathtaking. The peasants from the near countryside have stands with small quantities of varied produce—a few eggs, a couple of live chickens or rabbits, a dozen or so fresh cheeses from goat or sheep milk, squash flowers (to be dipped in batter and fried in olive oil for lunch—they will be wilted by evening), and a few handfuls of varied vegetables plus whatever they may have picked wild on the hillsides—shoots of wild asparagus, dandelions and other wild salads, bundles of thyme, rosemary, fennel, savory, and oregano. Hand-scribbled notices inform the customer that the vegetables are “untreated” and that the chickens, whose eggs were laid that morning, are grain fed.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Simple">Simple Food</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">A dreary old cliché has it that “one should eat to live and not live to eat.” It is typical that this imbecile concept, a deliberately fruitless paradox born of the puritan mind, should deny sensuous reaction at either pole, and it is fortunate that neither pole really exists, for man is incapable of being either altogether dumbly bestial or altogether dumbly “mental.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">I have sometimes been accused of thinking of nothing but food and wine—of being bound irreparably to the bestial pole. I do, in fact, think a great deal about food and wine and I would like my readers to share with me the belief that food and wine—that the formalization of gastro-sensory pleasure—must be an essential aspect of the whole life, in which the sensuous-sensual-spiritual elements are so intimately interwoven that the incomplete exploitation of any one can only result in the imperfect opening of the great flower, symbol of the ultimate perfection which is understanding, when all things fall into place (such was the concept, thanks no doubt to its pretty if somewhat pretentious subtitle, “Méditations de Gastronomie Transcendante,” that I had hoped and expected would unfold in the pages of <em class="ital">La Physiologie du Goût.</em> Those pages revealed little more than the glutton that Carême had early divined in Brillat-Savarin—joined to a pompous and puzzling self-esteem; my resentment and disappointment rankle to this day).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page7">Simple is the password in cooking today: If food is not simple, it is not good. But, unless the supremely social acts of eating and drinking, of human communion at table, of analyzing and sharing voluptuous experience evolved and refined within the nonetheless flexible boundaries of tradition, find their place as primordial and essential threads in the larger fabric of simplicity, Simple Food as a concept can have no meaning beyond that of elementary nourishment for the anti-sensualist or ease of preparation for the lazy cook.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Those definitions are often present to confuse the issue, the chameleon word assuming nearly as many meanings as there are tongues from which it so glibly slips. Simple may also imply, depending on the user or the context, “shorn of extraneous décor,” the presentation being dictated by the nature of the dish rather than by the artistic conceits of its interpreter; “possibly involved preparations, the end results of which, because they are harmonious, are simple in effect” (such as the endlessly repeated preparation-type of classical cooking: a meat or fish prepared in a way least apt to modify its native qualities—poached, grilled, or roasted, accompanied by a sauce that though compounded of separately prepared essences strikes a single suave note, quietly enhancing the integrity of the basic product. Typical also, but in the agrestic tradition, are the <em class="ital">cassoulet</em> described later and the various meat stews whose souls are dissected in the meat chapter). Simple may also mean “pure,” in the sense that a single flavor is sought out and accented (a terrine of foie gras nourished only by goose fat or a roast pheasant unaltered by hanging, forcemeats, alcoholic deglazings, or overcooking); “rustic” (peasant cooking whose flavors are sturdy, vigorous, and direct—sometimes rough but not necessarily “pure” in the sense of the preceding instances; inexpensive materials—salt pork, cabbage, potatoes, and dried vegetables—play important roles). Before even attempting to formulate a satisfactory definition, I think that one must, inverting the key phrase, say, “If food is not good, it is not simple.”</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page8">A grain-fed farm hen’s freshly laid egg, soft-boiled, has been chosen by some, defenders of an integral, naturally determined logic of the single element, as the symbol of ultimate perfection. Others of the same school lean toward the freshly plucked, vine-ripened, sun-hot August tomato, while, for those of the rustic school, the <em class="ital">aligot,</em> a gummy but tasty enough mess of potato purée and fresh Cantal cheese, has assumed the heroic dimensions of a symbol.</p>
			<p class="Normal">One well-known journalist amuses himself by pretending that the gourmet world is broken into two camps: the eaters of the rustic <em class="ital">aligot</em>—true lovers of the good and the pure—and the eaters of the elegant woodcock in its foie gras-tainted sauce—pretentious fools deceived by appearances and false gastronomic tradition. French writers on various regional cookings, while claiming respect for the traditions of other provinces, rarely fail to express a certain critical snobbism toward Parisian cooking, and if, in passing, the Parisian <em class="ital">concièrge’s</em> potato and leek soup may suffer a dig, the malice is mainly aimed at the sophistication of “rootless” professional traditions. It cannot be doubted that roots in Carême, Taillevent, and the Sun King’s kitchens have nourished a somewhat exotic growth—an uneasy companion to the vigorous and essential structure rooted in lives led close to the soil and the seasons. <em class="ital">La vraie cuisine de bonne femme,</em> a near synonym of rustic cooking in the minds of those who fancy the phrase, is usually associated with <em class="ital">les plats mijotés:</em> stews that cook at a bare murmur for hours on end. When one of these little stews is thus denoted, one understands that it flirts with divinity—that it has reached heights of simple purity unattainable by a man’s cooking. Shorn, through translation, of its mystical sheath, the phrase means “real home cooking.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">A celebrated chef, recently interviewed, said, “Anyone can produce <em class="ital">la grande cuisine</em>—all that is necessary is a lot of foie gras and truffles and a few bottles of fine wine to throw into the sauces.” But half-hidden behind the flipness is the conviction that expensive products too often replace imagination in the kitchen—that same imagination without which rustic culinary traditions could not exist (and with a bit more of which one might find fewer quails stuffed with foie gras on the menus of France’s star-heavy restaurants).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page9">But, were one to accept unaltered natural flavors or simplicity of execution as fundamental to the concept of simple food, rustic cooking (which necessarily embodies complicated aspects, one of its roles being essentially alchemical—the magical transformation of poor or vulgar elements into something transcendental) could not be admitted.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Consider the <em class="ital">cassoulet,</em> a voluptuous monument to rustic tradition: The beans are cooked apart, their flavor enhanced by prolonged contact with aromatic vegetables, herbs, and spices; the mutton is cooked apart, slowly, the wine and other aromatic elements refining, enriching, or underlining its character; apart, the goose has long since been macerated in herbs and salt and subsequently preserved in its own fat; a good sausage is famously allied to witchcraft. All of these separate products are then combined; a bit of catalytic goose fat—with the aid of gelatinous pork rind—binds them together in a velvet texture, and a further slow cooking process intermingles all the flavors while a gratin, repeatedly basted, forms, is broken, re-forms, is rebroken, a single new savor moving into dominance, cloaking, without destroying, the autonomy of the primitive members.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Escoffier wrote, <em class="ital">“Faites simple”</em> and he is often quoted. Yet, while not one to sneeze at the sun-hot tomato on the one hand nor, on the other, at the sticky <em class="ital">aligot</em> (the one representing an obvious necessity, the other a homely pleasure unrelated to his metier), he surely was aiming, rather, at safeguarding all that was valuable in the elaborate tradition of nineteenth-century professional cuisine, precisely by eliminating the encumbering decorative paring that, when not merely superfluous or distracting, was often detrimental to the basic quality of a preparation.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page10">Curnonsky, whose entire life was devoted to eating and to thinking, talking, and writing about eating, took great pride in having been instrumental in popularizing regional cooking traditions in France and, in particular, in convincing restaurant owners and professional cooks of the virtue of presenting regional specialties. On his banner were inscribed Escoffier’s two famous words, but he has bequeathed us, as well, a number of maxims of his own fabrication and a throng of disciples who regularly recite them. Coupled with the knowledge that Curnonsky’s passion for the garden-fresh vegetable and the farm-kitchen stew failed to temper his admiration for the apparently involved refinements of the classical French tradition, these aphoristic pronouncements may shed a bit of light on what “simple food” means to a relatively complicated (gastronomic) intelligence:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-noind"><em class="ital">En cuisine, comme dans tous les arts, la simplicité est le signe de la perfection.</em> (“In cooking, as in all the arts, simplicity is the sign of perfection.”)</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">Presumably the analogy to the other arts applies, as well, to the means of achieving the simplicity. The painter, tortured before his canvas, effaces here, redraws there—alas, a few tiny details, overworked, constipate increasingly the effect of the whole as, discontent, he smears a clean edge, sharpens a vague contour, until, finally, in a rash of frustration, everything is scrubbed out, rebegun, and hours, days or, perhaps, months later, the unadorned statement emerges vibrant—a casual breath of life.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Happily a stew is rarely subject to quite such a complicated and uncertain conceptual process, but decidedly the simplicity that Curnonsky (more symbol than a man in this context) admired in cooking was, above all, the simplicity of art, the purity and the spontaneity of the effect justifying any means.</p>
			<p class="Normal">And:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-noind"><em class="ital">La cuisine! C’est quand les choses ont le goût de ce qu’elles sont.</em> (“La cuisine! That’s when things taste like themselves.”)</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">This is none other than the artist’s precept, “Respect your medium,” transposed into the world of food. No more, it says, should a leg of lamb be altered to imitate venison than clay should be made to imitate marble, the quality of the basic material being, in each instance, destroyed while the noble material, insolently imitated, remains aloof.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page11">Defined as “pure in effect,” not only rustic cooking but also classical French cooking, with its refined methods and subtle harmonies, must, insofar as its integrity remains unmarred by sophistication, be admitted as well to the fold of simple food.</p>
			
			
		
		<div class="section-break">
			<img alt="ornament" src="../image/piii.gif"/>
		</div>			
			
			

			<p class="Normal-noind">A menu, too, must be pure in effect. Its successful composition depends, no less than the conception of a recipe, upon the cultivated art of simplicity; one of the commonest faults among France’s most talented chefs is a compulsion, fired by the touching and too human desire to flatter a Sybaritic guest, to compose a menu, each of the parts of which may be of an exquisite purity but which, in its plethoric whole, adds up to something in the way of barbaric orgy, leaving the would-be Sybarite exhausted, uneasy in spirit as in body—far indeed from the beatific plane. (La Mère Fillioux, a Lyonnaise legend, is said, on the other hand, to have attained near perfection in both the confection of her individual preparations and her menu composition by limiting her talents to the execution of some six dishes—the two most celebrated were artichoke bottoms garnished with foie gras and truffled poached chicken. She claimed to have mastered only those and pretended, furthermore, that the intelligence, progressively refining over the years, that she brought to their elaboration would have been impossible in the demanding presence of a larger repertory. A goal of perfection set within such rigid and limited boundaries might easily train boredom in its wake, and it is fortunate that we, as amateurs, can afford to live more dangerously.)</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page12">I attempted in my first book to analyze a menu as I understand it and doubt that I could offer a more satisfactory dissection here. The essence of the thing is this: For a menu to emerge as a single statement, a coherent entity, it must be made up of single statements, each of which relates to the others creating larger single (or simple—or harmonious) effects within the whole. Courses relate to each other as well as each to its accompanying wine, and each wine is chosen not only in terms of its perfect fusion with a course, forming one statement, but as a harmonious prelude to the wine that follows it, forming another . . . </p>
			<p class="Normal">Simplicity—no doubt—is a complex thing. And the complexity of conceiving the larger symphony, a simple menu, must receive a bow of respect; my main objective in this book, however, is to deal with that fragment of a menu which is the single preparation: You, the cook, must also be the artist, bringing understanding to mechanical formulas, transforming each into an uncomplicated statement that will surprise or soothe a gifted palate, or from your knowledge drawing elements from many to formulate a new harmony—for such is creativity, be it in the kitchen or in the studio: the application of personal expression to an intimate understanding of the rules. The Renaissance master was lent visionary wings precisely by virtue of being bound by rules of religious and social convention, tyrannical iconography, despot-patrons’ whims, and technical traditions. (His modern counterpart, exalting in the new freedom, sometimes fancies that were he so bound he would surely suffocate, the bright flame of genius snuffed. But as total freedom—never totally achieved—can exist only in a vacuum, there he flails, helpless in thin air, in desperate self-expression.)</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page13">The painter-cook analogy does not seem too far flung to me. There are many who believe a healthy dose of imagination is all that one need bring to the kitchen. The cacophonous results are in quite the same spirit as the poignant failures of the liberated artist. When, on the other hand, to the beginner respectful of the rules, cooking appears involved and difficult, the reason is certainly that the internal logic of the thing has not been grasped: He who blindly opens a cookbook and follows to the letter a series of minutely described steps with no comprehension of their raisons d’être—of why, if at all, each was necessary—may or may not produce a masterpiece, but he is likely to heave a sigh of relief at being released from that precarious teeter-totter—nor, once executed, will any of the steps—motifs in an unperceived pattern—be remembered. They, like the child’s desperate problem of pegs and holes, round and square, were too complicated—chaos is always complicated: When the logic of each step is understood in its relation to a total formula, everything falls into place; it is accepted and retained without effort. There are no secrets, no sleights of hand, no special talents unique to a culinary elite; and no technique integral to a preparation is complicated or difficult (the processes aimed at transforming a cooked preparation into a decorative object do often seem complicated—probably because, to many of us, they appear meaningless. Of course, food should be presented as attractively as possible and cold dishes in particular may support a certain amount of fantasy without their deeper qualities suffering. But, to be appetizing as well as attractive, food should always look like food, and we may be grateful that the chilly bits of baroque architecture with sumptuously inlaid façades of jewel-cut truffle, egg-white, and pimento mosaic belong largely to the past. The casual grace of a field bouquet touches us more deeply today than the formal splendor of a funeral wreath . . .).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Rules in cooking are not iron-cast (and, as in any medium of expression, they are often bent or broken by practitioners of talent—but to break rules, one must <em class="ital">have</em> rules). They are merely the expression of a well of experience formed and enriched over the centuries, re-examined, modified, or altered in terms of changing needs, habits, and tastes. They are welded out of knowledge—an understanding of what happens to a material when treated in a special way, how an ingredient may act differently if added at one point during a cooking process rather than at another, which aromatic elements fuse happily together and which, when combined, create a discordant effect, which and in what combinations will enhance the primitive qualities of a raw material, why some things should be subjected to high heat and others to the tiniest of flames or why a number of different qualities of heat must apply to a single preparation at different points in a cooking process . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">One’s own set of rules will form itself and become increasingly elaborate as one comes to understand the logic behind each detail, each step, to recognize the repetitions or variations of basic steps from one recipe to another; and the more elaborate the set of rules—that is to say, <em class="ital">the better one understands and is able to define an intricate framework of limitations</em>—the greater is the freedom lent one’s creative imagination. Only a cookbook is needed to prepare a <em class="ital">boeuf Bourguignon</em> but, without rules, improvisation is impossible—and that is what cooking is all about.</p>
			
			
			
			<hr class="Subhead" style="page-break-before:always"/>
			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Thoughts">Thoughts About Improvisation</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page14">A number of friends have felt—and I agreed—that this book should contain a chapter on improvisational cooking. But the more I have worried about it, the more impossible it seems, in the context of writing, to lend life to the spirit of the thing—to make it felt that, by knowing and accepting rules, one frees oneself of rules. It is easy enough to say, “You must bring freedom, relaxation, knowledge and imagination to the thing and, above all, do not be afraid; a failure is no disgrace and may very often be more instructive than a success . . .” (The sense of failure is, in any case, always sharper in the mind of the practitioner than in those of the guests—I know that I have often diminished my table companions’ pleasure in a meal that would otherwise have ravished them by a helpless compulsion to critically analyze each preparation.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">And it is the more difficult inasmuch as a recipe once set down—its pound of flesh, its ½ teaspoon of salt, its level tablespoon of flour, and ¼ cup olive oil trapped in black and white—no longer belongs to the realm of improvisation. The act of recording it robs it of the license responsible for its creation. It is self-evident: All that is recorded is born in improvisation—sometimes it has been deliberate, searching, analytical; the creation, so to speak, achieved in a single stroke, its elements drawn from the knowledge and experience of a great chef. Such are the endless appellations of classical cuisine, each conceived by a specific person to honor a personality or to commemorate an occasion. More often, in the instance of regional dishes, the improvisation is more or less unconscious, its nature dictated by “socio-economic-geographical” conditions, accident, or intuition. It is a study in depth, a continuing, slow, dumb, perfecting process stretching through generations of a family—and in horizontal penetration, the contributions of one family or another melting into a general concept. In detachment, one may think of these growing, changing, impersonal but living formulas as symbolic of a sort of culinary <em class="ital">anima mundi.</em> Their continuing evolution has often been frustrated by the intellectualizing interference of codification (and, more recently, by the leveling influence of internationalization).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page15">It is true that nothing is more amusing than to be caught empty-handed—faced only with dibs and dabs of leftovers and (hopefully) a few staples and, on the spur of a moment, to be obliged to transform these disparate fragments into an acceptable meal. And the gratification of having been able, thanks to mere imagination, to formulate a few drab odds and ends into a bright, coherent, and often exciting statement is great. But this very excitement seems to be at odds with the solidly planted intentions of a cookbook and the expectations of its readers. I finally abandoned the notion of consecrating an entire chapter to this aspect of cooking, preferring, throughout the book, to present recipes as illustrations to theoretical discussion in the hope that they may serve as points of departure no less often than as satisfactory entities in themselves.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Note-taking is, moreover, an ill-assorted and dull companion to extemporaneous cooking, and when a good, honest, comforting dish throws itself together, I most often let myself off by commending its beauty and assuring myself that it will not easily be forgotten. My consciousness is cluttered with memories of memories and half-memories of endless pilafs garnished with a variety of sautéed vegetables arid scrapings from roast chicken or game carcasses—or combined with <em class="ital">ragoûts</em> concocted from leftover roasts or firm-fleshed fish stews, heightened perhaps with butter-stewed onion, saffron, mushrooms, dried or fresh, one or several of the garden’s native and denizen herbs; of <em class="ital">cromesquis, crêpes,</em> raviolis, or cannellonis stuffed with refrigerator remainders become soufflé mixtures, mixtures cheese-bound or <em class="ital">béchamel</em>-bound, held together with mushroom purée, stiff <em class="ital">soubise,</em> egg and breadcrumbs or rice (a recent and happy memory in this vein is that of cannelloni stuffed with a mixture of braised sweetbreads and braised fennel, each drained, coarsely chopped, mixed with chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> and bound with fresh sheep’s milk cheese, egg and Parmesan, the cannelloni moistened with the braising liquids, sprinkled with Parmesan, and gratinéed); salads and soups; myriad vegetables sweated in butter, herbs, and their own vapors; vegetable gratins, puddings, hashes, stews, and <em class="ital">daubes.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page16">Certain of these terms suggest “extemporaneous” or “makeshift.” <em class="ital">Daube,</em> for instance, means (approximately) “a mess,” the origin of the word being presumably the same as that of “daub” in English. I have executed, with loyal respect, printed formulas for <em class="ital">daubes</em> in the interest of analysis and comparison but, left to my own devices, a <em class="ital">daube</em> is never twice the same. One of the best I’ve ever made (my judgment confirmed by a group of friends, all experienced and impassioned <em class="ital">daube</em> eaters) consisted of . . . several pounds of <em class="ital">entrecôte</em> and rumpsteak parings and a leftover roast put to marinate with a half-dozen ends of bottles (some flat Champagne, remainders of Brane-Cantenac, Beaujolais, Bandol rosé, and a local white wine) for a morning, then hastily assembled at lunchtime with leftover roasting juices, a remnant of <em class="ital">demi-glace,</em> a handful of herbs scattered at random through the layers of meat along with dried cèpes, soaked, rinsed, and chopped, and the usual aromatic vegetables. The <em class="ital">daube</em> was left at a murmur for an afternoon, skimmed of its fat the following morning, gently reheated and escorted by the inevitable <em class="ital">macaronade;</em> the sumptuous luxury of the slap-dash thing astonished my guests, wary of the results of such methods (leftover <em class="ital">daube</em> is, in Provençal cooking, after first being savored cold in its jelly, traditionally made into ravioli stuffing, much as the sweetbreads above were described, often with cooked, chopped chard or spinach—try it).</p>
			<p class="Normal">The approach to improvisation must vary with the individual. I have to see everything before me: The refrigerator is emptied out, down to the last drop of a jellied roasting juice or dribble of rice and the cupboards and vegetable bins are examined; all possible ingredients are lined up on a table. From a given line-up a number of possibilities will always present themselves and, when one’s path has been chosen, the rejects may of course be removed and examined anew for some other course for the meal . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">The following recipe, which friends begged me to record, is reproduced merely for the purposes of illustration, the likelihood of the various ingredients reuniting under other circumstances being slight; this ham, pathetically banal, had been purchased in error by an innocent guest, and its urgent need of a camouflaging cloak was the motivating force behind the dish’s conception:</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Improvisation is at war with the printed word. It either defies analysis or, in accepting it, finds its wings clipped. The classroom facilitates things; with one’s hands deep in the mixing bowl, eliminating a chosen ingredient, deciding to add another, tasting, altering, discussing, the spontaneity is alive and contagious and the result is there to be tasted.</p>
			<p class="Normal">My recent venture into teaching led the class progressively toward experiences of this nature. At first there was a certain amount of panic among the students—there were no more neatly transcribed recipes to be studied in advance and even note-taking was robbed of its solacing teaspoons, tablespoons, and cups. But distress rapidly succumbed in most instances to enthusiasm and I was delighted at the general excitement when, one day, weary of presenting timeworn formulas, I cleared the market of the freshest and most attractive produce on display, lined it up along with all the classroom leftovers and we began to invent: a playful selection of vegetables thrown together more or less <em class="ital">à la Grecque</em> and others <em class="ital">en estouffade;</em> eggplant gratin; <em class="ital">crêpes</em> soufflés; ravioli stuffed with a concoction of leftover frogs’ legs <em class="ital">poulette;</em> salads, composed and simple; braised red cabbage and, with a fish soup cooking, more frogs (boneless) wrapped in <em class="ital">crêpes,</em> moistened with the saffroned rich essence and gratinéed; a series of flat omelets, potato straw cake, grilled peppers, cucumbers in dill cream, and I know not what.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page20">Another day we were faced with leftover braised lamb shoulder and a quantity of generously truffled fresh egg noodles. After taking an inventory of the larder, several pounds of zucchini, a quart of heavy cream, and a block of Parmesan were retained. A heavy round copper utensil some 6 inches high and 2½ feet in diameter was unearthed and in it were thoroughly mixed the noodles (already freely buttered), the slivered meat and its juices, the zucchini, first coarsely grated, salted, squeezed, and tossed in butter, a healthy amount of freshly ground pepper, a memory of nutmeg, the whole smoothed down, smeared thick with cream, and thickly dusted with Parmesan. An hour later the vast expanse of golden crispness was glorious to behold. The zucchini juliènne, imitating the form of the noodles, was meltingly different in texture and its delicate flavor fused happily, holding its own with the penetrating heady truffle, providing a unique taste experience that is stamped the more clearly in my memory thanks to the class’s enthusiasm.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Herbs">Herbs</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">For my part, the classroom has been instructive in many ways. One forgets so easily and I had long since come to think of herbs as an unquestioned presence in the kitchen. I discovered that, for the students, the summer course was a revelation in “herb cookery.” The “recommended improvements” forms filled out at the end of the course nearly all suggested a series of herb lectures, and many of my students returned home to plant herb gardens.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page21">Interesting books on herbs are not lacking, although a number of them are better informed in the ways of religious rites, witchcraft, and medicine than in those of the kitchen. For practical purposes, Tom Stobart’s <em class="ital">The International Wine and Food Society’s Guide to Herbs, Spices and Flavorings</em> (London: David and Charles; 1970) seems particularly good. <em class="ital">Of Herbs and Spices,</em> by Colin Clair (London: Abelard-Schuman; 1961) I have enjoyed for its historical and anecdotal content and another, <em class="ital">Les Soleils de la Cuisine</em> by Robert Landry, is, in French, amusingly but seriously written. It has recently been translated into English, published by Abelard-Schuman under the title of <em class="ital">The Gentle Art of Flavoring.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">Herbs most often suffer from underuse (in bouquets garnis) or from overuse (with grills and roasts), and of course from emasculation—one must, above all, not think of all those little canisters of powdered condiments, vaguely peppery and dusty to the nose, as herbs. Even those herbs that are as good (or, as in the case of oregano, better) dried as fresh should be (relatively) freshly dried. Dried on the branch, the perfume holds best, and certainly the leaf holds better than a powdered version (I have, however, kept herbs I had ground for up to a year in glass jars without their suffering greatly).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Few are those who cannot permit themselves at least a few pots or a window box of herbs; and in a garden, borders, hedges, and clumps of herbs, in particular the labiates (rosemary, thyme, hyssop, savory, etc.—all have flowers of varying blues and lavenders that resemble, although minuscule, the snapdragon in form, the word itself describing the lip-like formation of the flower) can be of great beauty. Many of the herbs of this family, taken as infusions, have a relaxing and cleansing effect on the system. They are mostly vermifuge and antiseptic. Strong infusions added to a bath are also tonic and relaxing.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is useful to keep a pot of mixed herbs at hand’s reach for use in marinades, rapid stews, and grilled meats and poultry. Some may prefer to add a bit of rosemary or sage—I content myself with approximately equal quantities of thyme, oregano, and winter savory, adding fragments of marjoram from time to time.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Basil"><span class="BOLD">Basil</span> <em class="ital">(Ocimum basilicum).</em> French: <em class="ital">Basilic.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page22">Annual. Easily raised from seed and may be kept as a potted plant. There are many varieties, ranging from tiny leaves hardly larger than pins’ heads to large lettuce-like leaves. The small-leafed varieties tend to be more peppery in flavor and somewhat less characteristic. They can be an attractive addition to salads, but the large light-green leaves are preferable for general use.</p>
			<p class="Normal">As usual an element in bouquets garnis as thyme or bay in pre-Carême French cuisine, basil disappeared almost completely and, even today, its only common use is in the Provençal <em class="ital">soupe au pistou.</em> The author of a booklet on rabbit cookery, dating from the early part of this century, in which some of the recipes were culled from antique sources, notes that he has eliminated such bizarre herbs as basil, leaf thyme, rosemary, and marjoram, “aromatic plants employed in olden times, the taste of which would seem strange to us today.” That attitude was and remains very general in France today (the Italians have never faltered in their loyalty, basil-flavored tomato sauces and the Genovese pesto having been borrowed into many an American kitchen as well).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Basil has a natural affinity for tomatoes, both raw and cooked, sweet peppers, olive oil, saffron, garlic—in short, for most things Mediterranean. In salads, it will lift certain lettuces from the realm of banality and forms an exciting alliance with a number of other herbs and salad greens—rocket, purslane, dandelion, leaf thyme, hyssop . . . Tarragon and dill should be kept out of its reach. It is only marvelous fresh and, in cooking, its qualities are best served as a terminal addition to a sauce. It is addictive, and few who form the habit of using it can do without it. By all means use the flowers as well as the leaves and, rather than chopping, tear the latter into fragments; then they won’t blacken.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Bay"><span class="BOLD">Bay</span> <em class="ital">(Laurus nobilis).</em> French: <em class="ital">Laurier.</em> Laurel.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial small tree or bush. Cannot survive severe winters but, in Europe, is a common potted plant used widely as a geometrically pruned decorative element on café terraces or in hotel lobbies. Sacred to Apollo, it crowned the heads of poets, heroes, and warriors and was chewed by the Bacchante and the Delphic pythoness to hallucinogenic ends.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page23">Imported bay will serve you better than the harsh and aggressive California bay leaf. Bay (with thyme and parsley) belongs to the basic trinity of the bouquet garni, and it alone rarely finds other uses (see <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page235"><em class="ital">Pommes de Terre en Daube</em></a>. Pieces are sometimes alternated with skewered meats and vegetables. In prolonged cooking processes, the fragment of bay leaf used in a bouquet garni is insufficient, its initial self-assertion being attenuated and refined over a period of several hours.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Celery"><span class="BOLD">Celery</span> <em class="ital">(Apium graveolens).</em> French: <em class="ital">Celeri.</em> Umbellifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Biennial. The small dark-green garden celery looks like a large version of common parsley and is easily grown from seed. Slightly bitter, with a more concentrated flavor than cultivated branch celery, it is commonly grown in French gardens for use in bouquets garnis and is a more interesting herb for bouquets, but may be replaced by the branch celery.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Chervil"><span class="BOLD">Chervil</span> <em class="ital">(Anthriscus cerefolium).</em> French: <em class="ital">Cerfeuil. </em>Umbellifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Annual. It should be seeded in rich earth every three weeks or so throughout the summer in order to have a constant supply. During the heat of the summer a shady spot should be chosen for seeding; watering is essential.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The most delicate of the <em class="ital">fines herbes.</em> It may be used alone in quantity, its light anise flavor, unlike that of tarragon, remaining discreet, or in combination with parsley, chives, tarragon, hyssop, leaf thyme, lemon thyme (but not all at the same time). Omelets and scrambled eggs, salads of all kinds, and certain cream soups or consommés most often receive its benediction. Its flavor dissipates rapidly in cooking and it should be added to soups only at the time of serving.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Chives"><span class="BOLD">Chives</span> <em class="ital">(Allium schoenoprasum).</em> French: <em class="ital">Ciboulette.</em> Lily.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Tiresome to grow from seeds and hardly worthwhile in view of its widespread availability as a potted plant. It is useful to have several clumps, as it should be cut back to the ground regularly to keep the new leaves growing. It is so easily found that many people content themselves with replacing the plants.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page24">Its role is identical to that of chervil.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Dill"><span class="BOLD">Dill</span> <em class="ital">(Anethum graveolens).</em> French: <em class="ital">Aneth.</em> Umbellifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Annual. Easily grown (the seeds keep badly and should be used as fresh as possible) but goes to seed rapidly and, if raised for its feathery foliage, should be sown several times during a season. The ancient Greeks admired it for its magical and medicinal qualities and it has often served to thwart witches’ curses.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Dill is used abundantly in northern European countries and, in particular, in Scandinavia for quantities of fish preparations. It is practically unknown in France and, when found, is often confused with fennel, which bears a strong physical resemblance to it.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The fresh leaves, chopped, seem predestined to flavor cucumber (cream and lemon sauce, not vinaigrette) and fish—it is divine with crayfish. Good also whipped into fresh curd cheese or as a replacement for parsley with steamed and buttered potatoes. Although the perfume is attenuated by drying, it is not altered, and the dillweed of commerce is a useful addition to the kitchen shelf.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Fennel"><span class="BOLD">Fennel</span> <em class="ital">(Foeniculum vulgare).</em> French: <em class="ital">Fenouil.</em> Umbellifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. May be grown from seed. Not to be confused with the cultivated bulbous or Florentine fennel, whose flavor is similar but less intense.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Wild fennel, in Provence, flavors a host of fish preparations with, sometimes, a bit of pastis being added to a marinade or a soup to reinforce its native liquorice-tinged taste. Bouillabaisse and snails’ court bouillons cannot do without it, and it perfumes most grilled fish—famously the Mediterranean sea bass <em class="ital">(loup de mer).</em> The feathery leaves can be chopped and added to salads or vegetable preparations. The flowers and stalks are dried for winter use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Hyssop"><span class="BOLD" id="page25">Hyssop</span> <em class="ital">(Hyssopus officinalis).</em> French: <em class="ital">Hysope.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Easily grown from seed and may be raised in pots. A small bush whose dark-green leaves resemble those of tarragon, it is one of the sacred herbs of the Ancients, an obligatory element in the monastery gardens of the Middle Ages and much used in medieval cooking. Hyssop today is to most people only a word with vague Biblical associations—a pity, for it is an exquisite thing.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It shares a refreshing light bitterness with many of the labiate herbs but its perfume is apart. Writers mostly claim that it is too strong for the modern palate, but I love it and have never known it to trouble my guests, who regularly insist on eating “hyssop salad” at my table and have returned home to plant it in window boxes, pots, or gardens. The tiny intense blue flowers, scattered over a background of varied greens and sliced hard-boiled eggs, are ravishing but, if the salad has been sprinkled with the chopped leaves as well, one is hardly aware of the more delicate flavor of the flowers.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Lovage"><span class="BOLD">Lovage</span> <em class="ital">(Levisticum officinale).</em> French: <em class="ital">Livèche.</em> Umbellifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Easily grown but needs garden space. Just as celery looks like a large version of parsley, lovage resembles a large version of garden celery (and a small version of angelica) in appearance. Like hyssop, it was much used in the past and its name is known to many, but few know the herb.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The flavor recalls that of celery but is more penetrating and “wilder.” It may be added, chopped, to vegetable soups—try it in small quantity at first; but its logical place is in a bouquet garni for a preparation—<em class="ital">pot-au-feu, poule-au-pot,</em> or a long-cooking stew—whose unhurried development permits the lovage to refine and fuse with the other aromatics, its own slight arrogance dissolving into the whole.</p>

			<h2 class="Herbs" id="CultivatedMarjoram"><span class="BOLD" id="page26">Cultivated Marjoram,</span> called also Sweet or Knotted Marjoram <em class="ital">(Majorana hortensis).</em> French: <em class="ital">Marjolaine cultivée, marjolaine vraie, marjolaine à coquilles.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial, but usually considered annual because of its fear of frost. Easily grown from seeds and may be cultivated in pots. Its confusion with oregano or the various oreganos (wild marjorams) in literature is extremely frustrating and, in Provence, the oregano that grows wild on the hillsides is called <em class="ital">marjolaine,</em> its correct name, <em class="ital">origan,</em> being generally unknown and <em class="ital">la marjolaine vraie</em> being equally unknown although another variety of oregano is often called <em class="ital">marjolaine cultivée</em> . . . Most books, French or English, claim that cultivated marjoram is widely used in Provence, but I have never encountered anyone from the region who was familiar with the herb. Its appearance—the tiny shovel-shaped velvety blue-green leaves and the miniature white flowers half lost in the shell-like geometric construction of surrounding leaves—is totally unlike that of oregano, as is its heavenly fragrance. Many authors pretend that its perfume is akin to that of thyme and that the two herbs are interchangeable—they who claim that have never tasted the herb. The commercialized versions are not even parodies of the real thing, no memory of the original perfume remaining.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The contrary of oregano, marjoram is marvelous in all sorts of preparations fresh, the tender young leaves and flowers finely chopped, and less interesting than its wild cousin dried, although still a valuable addition to a bouquet garni. It marries caressingly with eggs and many vegetables and, in the event that I failed to express myself strongly enough in the discussion preceding the <a href="i_90-117.xhtml#page93">omelet loaf</a>, I can but insist here also that the zucchini-marjoram omelet be extracted from the whole and tried once alone.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Mint"><span class="BOLD">Mint</span> <em class="ital">(Mentha viridis).</em> French: <em class="ital">Menthe.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page27">Perennial. There are endless varieties of mint—and subvarieties, hybrids, etc. The, variations of spearmint are the most interesting in the kitchen—the French hardly use it except as a tea for tired stomachs; they consider the English affection for this herb an aberration. Arab and Middle Eastern cooking often makes interesting use of mint.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Oregano"><span class="BOLD">Oregano</span> <em class="ital">(Origanum vulgare).</em> French: <em class="ital">Origan.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Apparently seeds are available, but it is likely that the bundles of dried oregano available in Italian shops will be more interesting than the seeded product (Southern California might lend itself to a production of good quality). There are endless varieties (according to Tom Stobart, there are at least ten varieties in Greece alone, of varying flavors and intensities, all known indigenously as <em class="ital">rígani</em>). The Cretan oregano is so different from the others that it takes a different name—in English, that of “dittany”—and it is said that Mexico adds to the confusion by applying the name to other herbs as well . . . In my own experience, the Greek varieties are by far the most powerful, that of southern Italy (apparently <em class="ital">Origanum onites</em>) is still more pungent than the French varieties, but that which I know from the hillsides here is the finest—the same, however, growing wild in other parts of France, under another sun and from an earth less rude, is of relatively little interest. Oregano grows wild in England as well, but the quality corresponds to the climate.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Oregano must be dried to give of its perfume, but a few days’ drying will bring it all out. In the south of France it comes into flower in July and, thanks to the dryness and the heat, is finished by the first week in August. Elsewhere in France one finds it in full but unfragrant flower through September. It must be picked in flower and dried, preferably in tied-up bouquets. I begin using it a week after picking, but at times bouquets remain in storage for up to two years and the full power of the perfume remains. The finest fragrance is in the flowers, but the leaves crumble and mingle with them automatically in usage and lend their perfume as well.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page28">Oregano’s use in France was restricted to Provence and the Côte d’Azur (and even there surprisingly little used in view of its natural abundance) until the international pizza movement swept the country some years ago; it is now known to many, but only as <em class="ital">l’herbe à pizza.</em> In Italy it is used more than thyme and deserves a place of importance in any kitchen. Alone or in combination with thyme and savory, it is a valuable flavoring for grilled and roast lamb, certain game birds (of those available in the United States, quail in particular), and no other herb so effectively flatters guinea fowl. It is useful in fish soups and sauces and with cooked tomato preparations . . .</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Parsley"><span class="BOLD">Parsley</span> <em class="ital">(Petroselinum sativum).</em> French: <em class="ital">Persil.</em> Umbellifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Biennial. Grows easily from seed, flowers in its second year and dies. Should, therefore, be planted every spring in a garden. Parsley roots, scraped and well washed, lend a very particular and delicate flavor to stews or court bouillons and, if possible, should be included in all bouquets garnis. The second-year plants, destined, in any case, to disappear, should be dug up for this use. The stems, whose presence adds nothing to chopped parsley, should also be added to bouquets garnis rather than being discarded.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Parsley is too often thought of merely as a decorative element and showered in tasteless quantity over everything—it is true that the bundles of curly parsley bought in the market have little other quality. The common, flat-leafed, or Italian, parsley has a much finer flavor but, curly or flat, parsley must be freshly picked, its perfume disappearing rapidly. Deep fried (a handful of leaf clumps, each attached to a fragment of stem) for a few seconds in hot oil, it is the perfect garnish for fried whitebait or any nonsweet fritters—vegetable, brains, squid . . . The Provençal <em class="ital">persillade</em>—garlic-flavored chopped parsley—which is sautéed at the last minute with a ream of preparations is, if the garlic is not left coarsely chopped and in too great an abundance in the mixture, an attractive method of throwing into relief the parsley’s particular perfume. A garnish of golden, butter-crisp croutons rapidly sautéed with a <em class="ital">persillade</em> can enhance many a stew or certain scrambled eggs.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Purslane"><span class="BOLD" id="page29">Purslane</span> <em class="ital">(Portulaca oleracea).</em> French: <em class="ital">Pourpier à salade.</em> Portulaca.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Annual, self-seeding. A small ground-spreading midsummer garden pest with rounded fleshy leaves. The French have developed cultivated garden varieties that may be more interesting for their larger leaves, but are not otherwise noticeably different in flavor.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Braised as a vegetable or added, chopped, to an herb or a vegetable soup, it is mostly a curiosity, its great value being as an addition to a salad where, in combination with bitter herbs and flavorful lettuces, its different texture and separate flavor serve a real purpose. Cooked, its raw, mild taste turns sharp and bitter.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Rocket"><span class="BOLD">Rocket</span> <em class="ital">(Eruca sativa or Brassica eruca).</em> French: <em class="ital">Roquette.</em> Crucifer.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Annual, easily grown from seed. Its use is almost entirely limited to salads, but for that purpose, it is one of the most exciting green things I know. Most people assure me that it is the same herb as that known as arugula in the Italian-American markets. My memory is of a less distinctive flavor, but growing conditions may be responsible. Rocket does take a number of other names in Italy: <em class="ital">Rochetta, ruchetta, ruccola, rughetta,</em> some suspiciously resembling arugula in sound.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The deeply cut-out dark green leaves look somewhat like an elongated oak leaf. The flavor may be described as lightly bitter and peppery, but such general adjectives are helpless to touch the personality of that lovely weed. In the south of France it is not happy with the dry heat of summer and begins to flourish only in autumn. Both the wild and the cultivated varieties are common in meridional markets.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Rosemary"><span class="BOLD">Rosemary</span> <em class="ital">(Rosmarinus officinalis).</em> French: <em class="ital">Romarin.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page30">Perennial. More practical to buy the plants than to attempt seeding, although in its natural habitat it is self-seeding. Little used except in Italy, where sprays of fresh rosemary are often tied up with a roast before being sold from the butcher’s (and, today, in France where the meats of the modish restaurants specializing in charcoal grills with Provençal herbs are often thickly coated with rosemary). It is among the most exhilarating of all garden scents, but, brought to the kitchen, rosemary turns troublesome and aggressive. It can be good with pork, lamb, and certain strongly flavored, oily fish (such as sardines, smelts, mackerel, eel), but it is wiser to leave these in contact with branches of the fresh herb in a simple olive oil marinade, removing the herb before cooking (unless, for instance, a branch is placed inside a fish’s abdominal cavity before being grilled and removed before serving).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Its greatest virtue lies in the gentle beauty of its smoke—totally different from its green presence—whose caress, when a branch is thrown to smolder on the hot coals a few seconds before removing any fish, fowl, meat, or vegetable from the grill, is subtle and genial.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Sage"><span class="BOLD">Sage</span> <em class="ital">(Salvia officinalis).</em> French: <em class="ital">Sauge.</em> Labiate.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Easily grown from seed and, whatever its eventual use in the kitchen, it is a glorious addition to a garden. Its bluish-purple flowers share the beauty and the form of those of the other labiates but, larger than most, are particularly spectacular against their gray-green background of soft downy leaves. Its name and its history are synonymous with good health—sage has often, during the last couple of millenniums, been considered a cure-all and sometimes been thought to beget immortality.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is now snubbed in America, no doubt because of its once abusive use in poultry dressings and probably justly also, for, dried, it acquires an unpleasant musty flavor. Fresh, it should be used with discretion—but it should be used. The French use it sometimes with pork, and a leaf of fresh sage in the stomachic <em class="ital">aïgo-bollido</em> is obligatory. The Italians use it often and often to excess with veal, but always fresh. One of the best ways I know to critically enjoy the qualities of the fresh sage leaf is as a (sparse) element, finely chopped, in a basic ravioli farce of ricotta, butter, egg, and Parmesan, the cooked ravioli simply sprinkled with Parmesan and brown butter.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Savory"><span class="BOLD" id="page31">Savory</span> (<em class="ital">Satureia hortensis:</em> summer savory and <em class="ital">Satureia montana:</em> winter savory). French: <em class="ital">Sarriette.</em> Labiates.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">The summer savory is annual; winter savory is perennial. The former is easily grown from seeds, but it is more practical to buy plants of winter savory, which, in a garden, may be reproduced by dividing and transplanting the roots in early spring.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Most authors agree that the summer savory is the more interesting of the two. I do not share their opinion and, although I regularly plant the annual variety, many a summer passes without its ever being touched, whereas the borders of winter savory find abundant use: in the spring the tender young leaves, chopped, transform a salad, and tradition justly renders them obligatory with cooked broad beans; later the leaves become too tough and brittle to be pleasant in salads, but they remain, fresh, a superior flavoring agent, and, in full late-summer flower, the branches are cut back to serve throughout the winter in herb mixtures and bouquets garnis.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The perfumes of the two savories are somewhat alike, but that of the summer savory seems to me to have an unclean edge of kerosene, its wild parent being stronger but purer. In Provence the perennial savory (known only as <em class="ital">pèbre d’aï</em> or <em class="ital">pèbre d’ase: poivre d’âne,</em> or “donkey pepper”) always replaces thyme in rabbit stews and often is wrapped around fresh white goat cheeses, its fragrance penetrating. Useful also for grilled meats and poultry.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Sorrel"><span class="BOLD">Sorrel</span> <em class="ital">(Rumex acetosa).</em> French: <em class="ital">Oseille.</em> Polygonum.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Easily grown from seed (slow to sprout) and the plants continue to produce plentifully for easily six or seven years. Requires practically no care but for superficial weeding and continued use—the leaves should be cut back regularly, inciting the tender young leaves to grow anew (and flower stalks should be removed as they appear). There are a number of varieties of large-leafed cultivated sorrel. A tiny-leafed wild sorrel grows in the United States.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Too little known outside of France, sorrel’s refreshing acidity can enhance endless meat, fish, poultry, egg, and vegetable preparations used in small quantities as a flavoring herb, as the principal element in a soup or sauce, or as a vegetable garnish in itself. A graceful and welcome change from the sempiternal lemon.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Tarragon"><span class="BOLD" id="page32">Tarragon</span> <em class="ital">(Artemisia dracunculus).</em> French: <em class="ital">Estragon.</em> Composite.</h2>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Perennial. Reproduction by breaking up and separating the roots before the shoots begin to appear in the early spring. In any case, for the plants to remain healthy and vigorous, the roots must be dug up every two years, cleaned of any rotted ones, and then transplanted.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Tarragon is quarrelsome in the company of the bitter herbs and, but for its role among the <em class="ital">fines herbes,</em> is best used alone. Very pleasant when handled with discretion, it can become repellent—and this is especially true in cooked dishes—if too liberally dispensed; in combination with parsley, chives, and chervil, a few leaves, finely chopped, bring sufficient flavor to a full tablespoon of each of the others. It often flavors chicken preparations, either hot or cold, rabbit stews, and accompanying sauces for grilled or poached fish and grilled meats. Crustaceans welcome its presence.</p>
			
			<h2 class="Herbs" id="Thyme"><span class="BOLD">Thyme</span> <em class="ital">(Thymus vulgaris).</em> French: <em class="ital">Thym.</em></h2>

			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page33">Perennial all three. It is probably easiest to buy plants, although with ordinary thyme, even though but a few seeds from a packet will sprout, it may be worthwhile to prepare a bed and sow them in the early spring. Germination is very slow. There may or may not be a number of subspecies of ordinary thyme—it is certain that, from one climate and soil condition to another, thyme differs greatly. The garden thymes of the Parisian region and of England are, in appearance and in fragrance, of another world from that which grows wild in Provence (as, in a very different way, is that of the Peloponnesian hills). I have sown both here (one package labeled “Thym des Jardins” and the other “English Thyme”) and both produced identically the same plant that grows wild in profusion on the hillsides and that I have planted in borders throughout the garden. It was an interesting experiment, in no way disappointing, for the Provençal thyme has much more character than that of more northern climates and richer soils—no doubt but that a poor rocky, limey soil and arid summers produce the best thyme. The garden thymes have more fragile stems and the vegetation is thicker, bushier, and greener. Provençal thyme is straggly, its leaves silver-gray-green and its stems heavy and gnarled in microscopic imitation of the proximate olive trees.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The best for drying is picked at the moment of flowering—April in Provence and somewhat later in other regions, but no doubt the best habit elsewhere is to keep one’s garden thyme for uses fresh and buy dried Provençal thyme for bouquets garnis.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It may be the only altogether indispensable herb in French cooking. It is a pity that other herbs do not more often share the honors of the bouquet garni but, of them all, thyme, while positive and personal, is the most discreet, the least eccentric, harmoniously binding disparate savors with no self-assertion—this is true of preparations that require long cooking—stews, <em class="ital">potées,</em> etc. Grillades require the light touch; a little thyme, as with other herbs in this case, goes a long way.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Lemon thyme and leaf thyme are both most interesting fresh. Leaf thyme has the slightest of odors, but a light, bitter, refreshing taste and its tiny leaves may be scattered in quantity over green salads—or over lentils, grilled peppers, tomatoes, etc. It is agreeable in combination with hyssop. Lemon thyme is there mostly to touch and smell—and it is a lovely scent. It is useful in salads or omelets. A friend who is an herb-tea enthusiast claims that lemon thyme is the most beautiful of all.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Wine">Wine in Cooking</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page34">I do not want to suggest that cooking with wine is a special kind of cooking in a world apart—it is not (any more so than cooking with onions, cooking with herbs, cooking with carrots, eggs, or bread). It is as natural and as logical a moistening agent in viti-cultural country as is milk in dairy country or water the world round. And yet, be it the responsibility of innocence, cynicism, or a super, but questionable refinement, the concept seems sometimes hopelessly clouded.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In innocence, many believe that a product designated as “cooking wine” has a place in the kitchen (nor are foreigners the only sinners—many a Frenchman is convinced that if a recipe calls for “very good wine,” it means a cheap wine that titles 12 or 13 percent alcohol rather than a meager 10 or 11 percent). To taste a dish in which a dishonest wine has been used is conclusive, but that should not be necessary; it is only too reasonable to assume that a wine not good to drink can bring no positive quality to a cooked preparation. There should be no question of using a wine in the kitchen that one does not consider good enough to serve at one’s table (which is not to say that wine should not be kept in the kitchen for cooking purposes—ends of bottles should certainly be kept, wines of a color poured together and corked in bottles or half-bottles, protecting them as nearly as possible from contact with the air).</p>
			<p class="Normal">The cynic—he whose chicken boiled up in <em class="ital">gros-rouge</em> is labeled <em class="ital">coq-au-Chambertin</em>—may really believe that it makes little or no difference, finding it more practical to pay lip service to a “noble” tradition that he privately believes to be a lot of pretentious hocus-pocus, but, more often, his own palate is not that naïve; he is convinced that the client (alas, he often wears chef’s clothing) cannot tell the difference. In any case, if a restaurant menu lists <em class="ital">coq-au-Beaujolais</em> (or <em class="ital">coq-au-vin de Chinon, de Nuits,</em> etc.), it is a near certainty that it will be prepared with a wine superior to the one used in the <em class="ital">coq-au-Chambertin,</em> for no restaurant owner is crazy enough to pour a ruby fortune over an old cock.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page35">Super refinement, whose seat is more often cerebral than “palatial,” is peopled by a number of precepts, some of which are valuable and many of which are deceptively plausible: Good wines are rightly used in cooking, but great wines are often recommended, and repeated insistence is placed on the importance of serving the same wine at table that has been used in the confection of a dish, an eminently artistic conceit, mainly unrelated to the palate, although it is often possible to respect the form without inconvenience. Few, however, are those who would complain if their lobster, poached in a Pouilly-Fumé, were accompanied by a Montrachet; few, on the other hand, would willingly drink a white wine with a pheasant <em class="ital">salmis</em> or with beef braised in white wine . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">One may respectfully find a place in the kitchen for a great wine only if heat never comes into contact with it, the wine’s unique personality defining a dish—sparking its general character with a personal note in much the same way that a slight detail in a sketch may rescue it from impersonal abstraction (meat jellies, fresh fruits macerated in wine, and dessert jellies are cases in point, and it is to avoid the blunting effect of heat that the chosen wine should never be added to a jelly until it is nearly cold but before the jell stage).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Heat cannot efface the offensive qualities of a bad wine and it can, indeed, put to good use those of a robust and honest wine with a frank fruit, a solid structure, and a firm, uncomplicated bouquet, but, depending on the length or the intensity of the cooking process, it nonetheless alters or completely transforms the wine’s original nature.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If one refuses to judge a wine’s greatness by the dent it makes in one’s purse, it is not easy to find a satisfactory yardstick: What precisely differentiates a perfect bourgeois growth in Pauillac from its seignorial neighbor—or a Vosne-Romanée from La Tache–? It is the same thing that separates de Hooch from Vermeer. It can only be sensed, but one knows that between the two is an abyss; the one is terrestrial, the other divine. And the mystery remains intact.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The mystery has it, also, that a good wine, loyal and solid, will remain exactly that in our memories whereas a great wine will continue to evolve, barely perceived nuances and, if it is a very old wine, distant associations taking fuller form, unveiling fragile complexities—and that without bringing the slightest deception to a subsequent tasting.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Relegated to the kitchen, all wine becomes earthbound; the mystery is erased. If a great wine is thus sacrificed, we have destroyed a marvelous thing.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The eye often betrays the palate and preconceived ideas confuse it. A system of rules has been more or less consciously elaborated concerning the roles of red wine and white wine in the kitchen that is more closely allied to a cerebro-visual aesthetic than to a sapid reality.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Classical recipes for fish cooked in red wine (one of the most celebrated being <em class="ital">sole au Chambertin</em>—the word’s consonance must surely be the main factor in its choice) are well known but usually considered as curiosities (the uses of white wine in the preparation of meats—red and game—are far more common but less known, simply because the eye fails to detect the presence).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Among the whites and the reds alike, each, after all, runs the gamut from light-bodied, fruity, and refreshing to muscular, chewy, powerful, and richly bouqueted. Yet, in a general way, and above all when we think of wines for cooking, the first run of adjectives means “white wine” and the second “red wine” and the laws are smugly laid down: Fish and white meats should be treated with white wine, red meats and game with red.</p>
			<p class="Normal">But, as a matter of fact, any dish traditionally prepared with white wine can as well be prepared with red and conversely; depending on the qualities of the chosen wine (assuming them to be positive) the result will be different but good. The only real reason—and it is valid—to insist absolutely on a white wine, for instance, in a creamed sauce bound by egg yolks is to avoid the dull and shadowy, violet-brown cast lent by the red wine—nor, even with the blood, will one ever have a richly velvet, nearly black civet with white wine.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Bread">Bread</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Apart from its importance at table, bread, in many of the recipes in this book, has an important place: Stale or completely dried out, it accompanies soups; crumbs, soft or dried, are used for certain gratins and for breading; soaked and squeezed dry, it is a major element in other gratins and a minor but vital one in many <em class="ital">pâtés</em> and stuffings; it is cooked crisp in butter for croutons and <em class="ital">croûtes</em> and baked in puddings.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page37">For our purposes, the best of American breads are less than ideal because of over-sweetness and their much-admired soft and tender texture. The long loaves marketed as French bread in American bakeries leave much to be desired, as do the plastic-wrapped, preservative-drenched baguettes flown in from France, but I have found very good bread in Italian neighborhood bakeries in New York—large, round, crusty loaves reminiscent at the same time of Tuscan country loaves and of French peasant bread.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Superior-quality commercialized American breads—those with a firm-textured, heavy crumb—can be serviceable for croutons, for breading, or as crumbs for gratins, the native flavor and texture being sublimated to nutty, butter-flavored crispness and, when soaked in small quantity to lend smoothness and consistency to the body of well-seasoned stuffings or terrines, the disagreeable sweetness is imperceptible.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The dried crusts in a soup, on the other hand, should resemble, as nearly as possible, rough, tough old slices of peasant bread—the result, otherwise, will simply not be good. Many people think of bread saved and used in this way as a foolish, skinflintish economy measure and a repellent idea. They do not know and refuse to believe that it is, in fact, not only delicious but often integral to the soup’s character.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Good bread is increasingly difficult to find in France, although sentimental memories of that of the past abound—of the great sourdough loaves prepared in the homes and brought to the village ovens, brick igloos preheated with the coals of wood fires. Anecdotal tradition claims that, during the winter, the bread dough often shared the honors of the conjugal bed, thus profiting from body heat to raise during the night while gaining in homely flavor as well.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page38">I gave a recipe in <em class="ital">The French Menu Cookbook</em> for an approximation of the French <em class="ital">country</em> loaf of bread which I continue to find adequate. Instructions for oven temperatures and lengths of cooking times vary greatly among authors (and so they should, depending on the size of the loaves and the desired thickness of the crust). Any of the recipes, either for American white bread or for French bread, to be found in American cookbooks (French cookbooks simply don’t give bread recipes—they expect you to buy your bread at the baker’s) will give good results if you cut out the milk, shortening, and sugar and bake the loaf on a flat surface rather than in a bread tin (my oven contains a heavy plaque rather than the grill to be found in most kitchens and I have taken to the habit of putting the loaf to raise on a sheet of aluminum foil that has been sprinkled with semolina, a stiff cardboard beneath it, and, with an abrupt motion, slipping the aluminum foil directly onto the hot oven plaque). A pan of water should be kept in the bottom of the oven. It is valuable to experiment with different flours (I have had interesting results with small additions of barley flour—about ½ cup to 3 or 4 cups of regular flour) and, in particular, one might profit from the current health food fashion to use the unbleached, stone-ground flours available. Those I have found in France have a fine flavor—they raise less than the more highly refined flours and give a heavier crumb.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Chapter">Chapter Organization</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The chapter organization in the following pages has strayed but little from that usual to French cookbooks, respecting in its progression the traditional concept of a menu: Salads have been placed at the beginning because those considered are all conceived as first courses; soups are a bit tardily presented because so many serve as an entire meal. The only major displacement—that of the vegetables—is designed to emphasize the importance that vegetable preparations may—and too rarely do—assume in a menu. In France, only Provence has conceded to vegetables a placement on the menu worthy of their possibilities, giving them the opportunity to expand in beauty as a first course or to provide a light interlude between a fish and the roast in a more formal context. Elsewhere they are apparently considered as a banal, but necessary, accompaniment to meats and are loyally treated in manners contrived to reinforce that gray vision. Even vegetarians expend most of their ingenuity trying to destroy the vegetableness of the poor fresh things, welding them into horrible imitations of meat dishes in pathetic compensation for self-imposed deprivation.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page39">Treated with respect, a vegetable can undermine the single-mindedness of the most bloodthirsty of carnivores. There is, moreover, no reason to take seriously the French claim that vegetables and wine do not go together.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous Thoughts</h2>
			
			
			<h3 class="Misc" id="Oven">Oven Temperatures</h3>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">It is more important to know your oven—to understand its faults and its eccentricities—than to blindly respect the instructions of cookbooks concerning precise thermostatic regulations. Electric ovens act differently from gas ovens. Thermostats are not always accurate. Ovens in professional kitchens are usually kept at a higher temperature than that recommended for most preparations in cookbooks (say, at a guess, 425°) and nearly everything is cooked at that same temperature (the bakery ovens are a different matter). Those that are heated by a system of hot air circulation around the outside of the oven cavity can cook at higher temperatures than those that receive heat from a direct source. Throughout the preparation of this book I have kept two American thermometers in the oven and, inasmuch as they agree, I believe them to be accurate. But I know from experience that, when working with ovens in friends’ kitchens, I must usually work with lower temperatures than at home. Oven temperatures here have often been altered in view of this experience.</p>
			
			
			<h3 class="Misc" id="Butter">Butter</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">When possible, use sweet (unsalted) tub butters—the taste is quite different from that of French butters, but they do have a taste and, often, quite a good one. “Lightly salted” packaged butters are, but for their heavy saltiness, disappointingly flat.</p>

			<h3 class="Misc" id="Mouli">Mouli-Juliènnes</h3>
			<p class="Normal-noind">“Mouli-juliènne” is the trademark name for a simple gadget manufactured by the French “Moulinex” company. It is equipped with a series of removable discs for slicing and shredding. They are exported to America and there are also American equivalents. The electrical “robot-cutters” have attachments that will do the same work. The “medium blade” that is repeatedly recommended here transforms vegetables into cylindrical threads of about 1⁄10 to 1⁄12 of an inch in diameter.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A “vertical cutter mixer” is useful in a kitchen for the rapid reduction of raw flesh to a purée in the fabrication of <em class="ital">mousselines,</em> for reducing soft bread crumb to fine crumbs with a whir, etc. It has a number of attachments for cutting, slicing, shredding, juliènning, etc. The manufacturer is:</p>

			<p class="Normal">Jackson, Mississippi 39236</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">The machines are quite expensive, but solid: The smallest (2½-quart capacity) is priced, as of this writing, at 219 dollars.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="Chopping">Chopping</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Chopping means cutting cleanly into minuscule fragments. Grinding, crushing, and pureeing, for all their apparent similarity, physically change the structure of a material, releasing the juices that are held within it. The particles of a correctly chopped article remain unbruised and intact, their primitive structure unaltered, their juices and, in the case of herbs, their perfumes retained. Machines and dull knives bruise, wound, bleed . . . Only with sharp knives and an absolutely plane and smooth wooden surface can one chop without damage. It is a gentle and a rational act; violence will get you nowhere. Use a so-called “chef’s knife,” the blade of which is wide enough to prevent your knuckles from rapping against the chopping board. First slice thinly, if the material calls for it, fingertips of the guiding hand turned inward out of reach of the blade, knuckle against the side of the blade to guide it. Cross-slice, then chop, keeping the fulcrum point of the knife always in contact with the board by a light pressure from the flat of your non-chopping hand, an inch or two back from the point of the knife blade. An excess of enthusiasm can only lead to an erratic result and, very disagreeably, to a certain amount of chopped chopping board incorporated into the product. Have at least three or four good sharp knives and always keep a sharpening steel within reach. There are very good stainless steel knives on the market today; they sharpen well, are easy to care for, and will not blacken artichokes and certain other vegetables as will carbon knives.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page42">Apart from the slicing and cubing, meat requires a different approach that, when necessary, is discussed in the text.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="Tomatoes">Tomatoes</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Fresh tomatoes are good only in season and marvelous only at the height of the season, when they are also at their cheapest. Throughout some nine months of the year, they are perhaps the only canned product indispensable to a kitchen. Some commercially canned tomatoes are quite good, but all contain too many seeds and often there is a slight edge of the unpleasant metallic taste that, in tomato pastes, is so aggressive as to ban them from the kitchen. Peeled, halved, and seeded, home-canned tomatoes are always the best. Sterilizers carry their own instructions, which vary with the method. Season only with salt, count a pound of tomatoes for a pint jar, cover them with a purée of rapidly boiled and sieved tomatoes, leave a good inch of space at the surface, and sterilize for forty minutes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To peel and seed tomatoes, cut out a conical shape to remove the core from the stem end, dunk them into boiling water for a couple of seconds, slit the skin at the flower end (or bottom), and peel, holding sections of peel between thumb and knife blade and pulling toward the stem end. Cut in two horizontally and either squeeze each half in your hand, shaking abruptly to extract seeds and water or, preferably, loosen each seed section with your little finger or with a teaspoon handle and shake gently to remove the seeds without crushing the tomato half.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="Green">Green Olives</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The delicious <em class="ital">olives cassées</em> that garnish Provençal luncheon tables during several months of the year (put into their brine the first part of October, they are best from the end of October to mid-January, but will last through March or April), slightly bitter, refreshing, with a flavor that is nervous and exciting, resemble in no way olives commercially available in the United States. During early autumn, fresh green olives are sold widely in Italian neighborhoods for home preparation.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page43">Each olive should be given a brisk tap with a wooden mallet—just forceful enough to split the skin without crushing the olive or breaking the pit. They are then put into a large basin of cold water and kept for ten days, the water being changed each day. This draws out their excessive bitterness. Rinsed well and well submerged in an herb-flavored brine, one may begin eating them two weeks later (any drained for serving and not consumed should be returned to the brine—they spoil in contact with the air).</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">The Brine:</em> For each quart of water mix in 2½ ounces coarse salt (just under ¼ cup), bay leaf, thyme, several branches of fennel (or fennel seeds), a tiny bit of rosemary, 2 or 3 sage leaves (if fresh), oregano, savory, ½ teaspoon coriander seeds, a strip of dried orange peel.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Thyme and fennel should dominate. Bring the salted water to a boil, add all the other ingredients, boil for 10 minutes, and leave to steep until completely cold. Strain and pour the herb brine over the olives. Keep in a covered stoneware, porcelain, or earthenware jar. A scummy, mucous substance may form eventually on the surface of the brine—it is in no way harmful and should be left there, disregarded.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="Cheeses">Cheeses</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Compose your cheese platters with care—and, particularly, if you plan to serve a fine wine as an accompaniment. Strongly flavored fermented cheeses, very sharp cheeses, or heavily salted cheeses will annihilate a wine with any delicacy. If they are generally admired as companions to wine, it is because nothing else so effectively masks the negative qualities of a bad wine. Roquefort is a wine killer, as are most of the indifferent Camemberts found on the market today. Among the fermented cheeses, Reblochon and Pont l’Evèque are probably the safest, but only if they have been well cared for and remain delicate—almost sweet in flavor, soft, creamy, and uniform of texture. A Pont l’Evèque, even at best, has an astonishing perfume that belies its natural elegance. Good English Cheshire is a splendid cheese wine, as is Swiss Gruyère. Fresh chèvres, if properly drained and not oversalted, number among the truly sublime things of the table—it is rare to find decent examples outside of their areas of production. Some thirty-five or forty years ago, the general store in Marathon, Iowa, used to keep giant wheels of a Cheshire-Cantal type of cheese which I still remember very sentimentally. The only name we ever gave it was “rat cheese,” and it wouldn’t harm a Lafite.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="WineVinegar">Wine Vinegar</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page44">Wine, during its life in a barrel, must be regularly replenished from smaller containers—bottles or barrels—of the same wine to compensate for loss by evaporation, because if the wine is left in contact with air, an insidious culture in the form of a frail, white powdery veil will develop on the surface, eventually transforming the entire body of wine into vinegar. The same detested <em class="ital">fleur blanche,</em> for the fabrication of a good vinegar, must be pampered, kept at room temperature (60°F.–75°F.), a body of air always in contact with the surface, which should not otherwise be disturbed; the mold lives only in contact with air and, if submerged, is transformed into a heavy viscous matter called colloquially <em class="ital">mere de vinaigre</em> (“mother of vinegar”), which settles, harmless but inactive, to the bottom of the container.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A number of folklorique misconceptions, built largely around “mothers of vinegar,” their various qualities and their care, have made the whole business of vinegar-making seem more complicated than it really is: Pieces of mother are lent out or exchanged to be dropped into vinaigriers (for it is believed that mothers differ greatly, one from the other, and that the vinegar culture resides in the mother). Odds and ends of wine are usually poured in daily—or at least with varying regularity—and vinegar is drawn from the spout as needed so that at times the mother is blamed for having nurtured an excessively strong vinegar and at others, if a large quantity of wine has been recently added, it is said that the mother has been drowned (and one must hasten to a neighbor or friend to borrow another piece of mother).</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Le Cuisinier Parisien</em> (1833) gives the following instructions for making vinegar:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote" id="page45">
			<p class="Normal-noind">Have a keg containing 30 litres more or less, depending on your consumption. A hole 1 inch in diameter should be bored at one end as closely as possible to the border joint. Place the keg in such a way that the hole will be at the highest point. At the same end a wooden spigot should be installed 2 inches from the bottom. The cask should be placed in a warm place. It will be well off in a corner of the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Heat 1 or 2 litres of good vinegar and pour it, boiling, into the barrel through the hole at the top of the end. Agitate the barrel so that all surfaces are impregnated with vinegar; then pour in five litres of good wine. Always leave the hole to the top uncovered.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Eight or ten days later add five litres of wine and continue, thus, every eight or ten days until the barrel is filled by two-thirds. Then (after another eight or ten days) you may begin to draw off the vinegar and, by always adding an equal quantity of wine, you will have a constant supply of vinegar of the same quality, assuming the wine employed to be of unchanging strength.</p>

		</div>
		</div>
		
			<p class="Normal" id="page46">No mention is made of the bond hole to the top-center of the staves (before being put into service, a new keg should have the hole bored for the spigot and the spigot pounded into place with a wooden mallet, but the aeration hole should not be bored until after the keg has been filled with water through the bond hole and left to soak for a day or two—there are always minor leaks until the wood, both of the keg and of the spigot, swells by soaking). A hole bored through the cork with a long-necked glass funnel (from a laboratory supply house—the length of the neck somewhat shorter than the width of the barrel) fixed through it so as to keep the neck tip in a stationary position well beneath the vinegar’s surface permits wine to be fed in from the top without disturbing the surface—a dab of cotton closes the funnel entrance when not in use and a bit of plastic screen can be tacked over the aeration hole to discourage insects.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is best to draw off large quantities at a time, replacing them with the same quantity of wine, and not to disturb the vinaigrier in between major operations except to occasionally draw off a few drops to check on its progression—if left for a long period, vinegar will become very strong. Leftover bottles of wine that have begun to turn, filtered dregs from decanted wines, and, notions of decorum and hygiene notwithstanding, undrunk glasses from the dinner table should all be joined together and stored in filled corked bottles to prevent further alteration until they are added as a lot to the vinaigrier. All wine that is added should be limpid, any containing sediment being first filtered. Use only dry wines.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page47">It is important to start out the life of a vinaigrier with the addition of a certain amount of good vinegar to make certain that noxious cultures other than the acetic fermentation do not attack in its place. No metal should contact vinegar and, when heating it, earthenware, enamelware, or stainless steel should be used. I am not convinced that heating the vinegar to season a keg serves any purpose—the fumes may more rapidly penetrate the fiber of the wood—but, having started out my own vinaigrier that way and being satisfied with the results, I have preferred to quote my source. Friends have small earthenware or stoneware vinaigriers—approximately one-gallon jars with a hole toward the base into which a cork-tipped wooden spigot is fitted—and produce good vinegar; the top should be covered only with a cloth or other arrangement to keep out dust and insects while permitting a free passage of air.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The acid fermentation of vinegar, although it may be incomplete, is arrested when the vinegar is drawn off and bottled up, tightly corked, out of contact with air, but the vinegar itself, like the wine from which it is made, then takes on a life of its own, its aromas expanding, aggressivity succumbing to nuance with age; the difference between a freshly drawn vinegar and one that has two or three years of bottle is quite astounding—and perhaps even more marked with specially prepared vinegars into which other flavors have been suffused. Vinegar, although less temperamental than wine, should also be stored in a dark, cool place, the bottles on their sides. It is worthwhile labeling different vinegars and their vintages.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The vinegar I use to the near exclusion of all others is made by boiling down a large quantity (in enamelware or stainless steel) of vinegar by half, throwing in an abundance of garden and mountain herbs—oregano, savory, thyme, marjoram, bay leaves, hyssop—and a few crushed but unpeeled garlic cloves, leaving it, covered, to cool and to steep for several hours or overnight before straining it (funnel lined with a towel) into bottles.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page48">A wonderful and unusual vinegar is prepared by steeping a large quantity of elder flowers (rapidly dried in the sun and crumbled free of the stems) in vinegar for 3 or 4 weeks, covered or corked, before straining and bottling it. Elder vinegar seems particularly suited to meat salads; cold sliced or diced <em class="ital">pot-au-feu,</em> in particular, is never as good as when marinated in an elder blossom vinaigrette with finely sliced sweet onions or scallions (elder grows wild throughout the United States—even if one does not make one’s own vinegar, there is nothing to hinder one from transforming a good commercial wine vinegar into elder vinegar). Tarragon vinegar is prepared in the same way, using, preferably, fresh branches.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Charles Barrier (Chez-Barrier, Tours) prepares a very pretty raspberry-perfumed vinegar which I have never attempted to concoct myself. (Prosper-Montagné: “Pour 2 litres of vinegar into a stoneware jar and as many picked-over raspberries as the jar can contain; leave to macerate for 8 days; strain, without pressure, through a horsehair [nylon] drumsieve.”)</p>
			<p class="Normal">Any of these vinegars, if kept for some time on the kitchen shelf in a partially emptied bottle, may form the familiar white surface veil—and, as it is submerged while bits of the contents are being poured out, a viscous mother occasionally forms, as well. Neither affects the quality of the vinegar but, for aesthetic reasons, the vinegar might be filtered. In home preparations, a certain amount of eau de vie is sometimes added to vinegar at the moment of bottling to stabilize it; commercial vinegars are undoubtedly stabilized in less innocent ways.</p>
