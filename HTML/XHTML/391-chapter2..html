<p class="co">Most of these recipes, except for the desserts, of course, require either chicken or beef stock, or broth. I like to make my own stocks and keep them on hand in my freezer. There are times when I run out of my homemade stocks, and I will use canned chicken or beef broths. Swanson is the brand I prefer. I also stock my pantry with Goya chicken and beef bouillon cubes. They are very convenient and make acceptable stocks.</p>
<p class="txs">Many of these recipes use Arborio rice imported from Italy. It is a must where indicated. It may be mail-ordered from:</p>
<p class="ex">Dean and Deluca’s</p>
<p class="ex">121 Prince Street</p>
<p class="ex">New York, N.Y. 10012</p>
<p class="stx">Where long-grain rice is indicated, I prefer Uncle Ben’s Converted Rice. Of course, you may choose your own brand. But please, no instant or quick cooking or boil-in-the-bag stuff! Don’t even think about it, okay?</p>
<p class="tx">Most of these recipes require grated Parmesan cheese which is mild and delicate in taste. Buy it by the piece and grate it freshly yourself. Stay away from grated Parmesan cheese that comes in a cardboard or glass container. It won’t do your cooking justice. A few recipes require Pecorino Romano cheese, which is more robust in flavor. My advice for buying and using this cheese is the same as for Parmesan.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Julienne</span> is a cooking term that means to cut the ingredient with a sharp knife so that the slices will resemble matchsticks.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Dice</span> means to cut the ingredient into cubes.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Mince</span> means to chop the ingredient into fine pieces.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Parsley</span>—use only the flat leaf (Italian) variety. It has more flavor.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i">Herbs</span>—use only fresh herbs unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p class="tx">If you have the time, please use the following recipes for your own homemade stocks.</p>

<p class="rh"><span class="script-i">Brodo di Manzo</span></p>
<p class="rha"><span class="epub-sc">(BEEF BROTH)</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">5 quarts water</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">3 pounds boneless beef chunks</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">3 pounds boneless veal stew chunks</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 pounds beef bones</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">4 teaspoons salt</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 large onions, unpeeled</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 celery ribs</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 large carrots, unpeeled but scrubbed</span></p>
<p class="rt1">Rinse all the ingredients (except salt) under cold running water. Place 5 quarts water and the salt in an 8-quart pot. Bring to boil on high heat, then add all the ingredients and return to full boil. After five minutes, reduce heat to low and simmer broth very slowly for two and a half hours. Skim foam from the surface from time to time. Remove the meat, bones, and vegetables from the broth. Strain the broth through a muslin kitchen towel or several layers of cheesecloth lining a colander. Refrigerate overnight and skim any solid fat from the top. Store in plastic containers in the refrigerator for one more day. Skim off any remaining fat. Then store in the freezer for up to three months.</p>
<p class="rt">What to do with the meat? Shred it and refrigerate it. You can add quantities of it to your soups or you can make an Italian meat salad by adding chopped celery and onion to the meat and dressing it with salt, pepper, vinegar, and olive oil. The vegetables and bones must be discarded.</p>
