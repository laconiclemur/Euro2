<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Yes, this recipe works with chicken; but if you haven’t ever tried rabbit, I encourage you to seek it out from your local farmers’ market or butcher shop. Its mild flavor and tender texture go so beautifully with this simple, creamy mustard sauce, and the entire dish is easy to make. It also reheats beautifully if you’d like to make it ahead. Serve with plenty of good bread to sop up all of the gorgeous sauce.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">One 3- to 4-pound rabbit, cut into serving pieces</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 shallots, peeled and finely minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon Herbes de Provence (<a href="chapter008b.xhtml#page-261h">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon dried thyme</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup smooth Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons whole-grain mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 pound small potatoes, boiled until tender and halved</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Pat the rabbit</strong> pieces dry with paper towels and season aggressively with salt.</p>
<p>Melt the butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the rabbit pieces and cook, turning only once, until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the rabbit pieces to a plate and set aside.</p>
<p>Add the shallots and garlic to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the herbes de Provence, thyme, and wine to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Whisk in the cream and both of the mustards, then lower the heat and allow the mixture to simmer so that all of the flavors combine, just a minute or two. Season the mixture to taste with salt.</p>
<p>Return the browned rabbit pieces to the pot and simmer, uncovered, until the rabbit is tender, about 20 minutes. Add the cooked potatoes during the last 10 minutes of cooking just to heat them through. Serve hot.</p></div>
