<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Vin brûlé</em>, literally translated, means “burned wine” and is how the French refer to mulled wine. The tradition of warming wine with spices and fruits is ancient, and we keep it alive at Buvette. During the winter we keep a steady stream of vin brûlé in a silver samovar behind the bar and let the smell of winter spices and orange peel perfume the entire restaurant.</p></div>

Bring the mixture to a simmer—be careful not to boil it—and let it cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the spices are fragrant. I like to think of it as the moment when the spices begin to sing. Serve warm.</p></div>

<div class="step">
<p class="step">There’s a lot of attention being paid to “natural wines,” an umbrella term that describes any type of wine made without chemicals and with old-school traditions all the way from the planting of the grapes to the bottling of the wine. The wines can be a little bit less predictable than regular wine since so few variables can be controlled. That said, natural wines are exciting precisely because of all of their variation. Like anything that’s encouraged to be completely itself, natural wine develops all sorts of wild characteristics. The natural wine movement is full of good stories like that of certified biodynamic winemaker Oliver Cousin, who is a local wine renegade in the Loire Valley. He plows with draft horses, picks grapes by hand, and crushes them by foot. Only ambient yeasts are used and sulfites are never added.</p></div>

<h1 class="procedure-titlehs"><span class="underline"><span class="special">THE TEN FRENCH WINE REGIONS</span></span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="noindenth1">1. <strong>Alsace</strong> produces aromatic terroir-driven wines grown on the wooded foothills of the Vosges—think choucroute garnie! Grapes include: pinot gris, gewürztraminer, muscat, and Riesling.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">2. Wines from the <strong>Jura</strong> are traditional yet highly idiosyncratic, often unfiltered with a uniquely yeasty flavor. Grapes include: chardonnay, ploussard, and trousseau.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">3. The <strong>Loire Valley</strong> is known as the garden of France and includes Sancerre, Vouvray, Pouilly-Fumé, Cheverny, and Bourgueil. Wines from the Loire Valley are prized for their fruitiness and fresh clean flavors. Grapes include: sauvignon blanc, muscadet, vouvray, pouilly-fumé, chenin blanc and chenin rouge, and cabernet franc.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">4. <strong>Burgundy</strong> is divided into the upper and lower slopes. The more prestigious wines are found on the upper slopes, known as the Côte d’Or, near Dijon. Grapes include: chardonnay for chablis, cabernet sauvignon, and pinot noir. There are some good wines from the lower slopes, near Lyon, including: Aligoté Bouzeron, Pouilly-Fuissé, Meursault, and Pommard. Interestingly, monasteries played a key role in developing the originality of Burgundian wine culture. Monks not only introduced the fundamental concept of terroir, dividing vineyards according to soil, climate, and orientation, but also planted the pinot noir and chardonnay grape varieties as well.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">5. Wine has been made in <strong>Beaujolais</strong> for more than 2,000 years, ever since the ancient Greeks founded the city of Marseille in 600 BC. Gamay is the only red grape permitted in Beaujolais and by law all the grapes must be picked by hand.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">6. The <strong>Rhône</strong> valley is known for its warm, rich, and juicy reds. In the north, with its cooler climate and mistral winds, syrah is the only grape grown. In the warmer, dryer climate of the south, they plant grenache, syrah, and mourvèdre.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">7. <strong>Bordeaux</strong> is split into two banks—the left is dominated by cabernet, while merlot features prominently on the right.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">8. The <strong>Languedoc</strong> borders the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean Sea. It is France’s largest and most diverse wine-producing region. Traditional varieties are Carignan, cinsault, mourvèdre, grenache, and malbec.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">9. <strong>Provence</strong> is one of the oldest wine-growing regions in the world, established in 600 BC when ancient Greeks first planted syrah grapes outside of Marseille. Look for rosé from this region; it is usually superb.</p>
<p class="noindenth1">10. Wine from the <strong>Sud-Ouest</strong> (the southwest) comes from a wide range of growing conditions, from the mild, rainy climate of the Basque Country to the dry, limestone terroirs of Cahors. This area is best known for gastronomic exports like Roquefort, foie gras, and cassoulet. I always try to pair regional food and wine.</p>
