<p class="para">Before I begin I would like to thank my dad Petro and my mum Olga for everything that they have done for me. As much as I love my little Kakhovka, Ukraine, I would have never been able to see the world and do the things that I have done and tell this story if it wasn&#8217;t for their hard work and their love. You have given me such a strong core and such a huge appreciation of family. One of the hardest things I have to deal with every day is being so far away from you and the rest of our crazy <em>simiyka</em> Adamsiv aka the Adams family.</p>
<p class="indent-para">I would then like to thank my agent Ariella Feiner for noticing my work. I will never forget that very first email you&#8217;ve sent me. I immediately phoned my family and said I just knew that something miraculous was soon to happen.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Thank you also to Eve O&#8217;Sullivan, an amazing editor and writer at the <em>Guardian</em> for her enthusiasm for my mother&#8217;s recipes which I first (gingerly) supplied and then got more and more encouraged to explore. Also a huge thank you must go to the brilliant Michail Tait, who spotted and loved my chicken tabaka video and raved to everyone about it. You have all in quick succession led me to the most incredible publishers in the industry.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Stephanie Jackson, our first meeting actually came at a painfully tough time for me. Your elative positivity and kindness have given me strength and self-belief that I thought I may have been losing. Thank you for digging my style and letting me write organically without trying to be anything that I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sybella Stephens, thank you for your input and constant support, you have been encouraging and insightful, someone a first-time writer could only dream to work with. Juliette Norsworthy, thank you for being so patient and for your insanely hard work, and for letting me inject even more of my vision into this project. Jo Richardson, Grace Helmer and the rest of the Octopus team, you have helped me create something so personal and so true, I never thought that was even possible. Thank you for going with the vibe and for producing something as incredible as this.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Kris Kirkham, you are not just a talented photographer. You are now one of my closest friends. You said you left a part of your heart in Ukraine and I think it was mutual. Thank you for seeing it through my eyes and thank you for loving it and for making my family feel so comfortable and happy especially when the situation in Ukraine was so devastatingly sad and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Linda Berlin, thank you for helping me carry that buzz we started with Kris in Ukraine and transcending it into a studio in London.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Diana Henry, thank you for letting us use your beautiful house and for all of the energy and casual swearing. You know how much I love a spicy conversation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Rosie Reynolds, thank you for your push with my styling career when I went solo. I will never forget your kind help when I needed it so badly. Thank you for keeping the photoshoots sane and for picking up things like the 2kg of crayfish by the London Zoo without blinking an eyelid. You are the coolest scouser and one of the best food stylists that I know.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A special thank you goes to my extended family in Ukraine. This book is yours. Aunt Lyuda, thank you for helping me bring Lusia and Zhenia&#8217;s recipes back to life. Thank you for putting up with my annoying scales and my pathetic measuring spoons. Sorry we nearly made you faint in that heat, you are one of the best cooks that I know. Thank you Aunt Nina for all your Armenian and Azerbajani recipes and above all for your breath-taking stories, I can&#8217;t stop thinking about your childhood in Karabakh, it is so mind-blowingly inspiring. Irochka, thank you for sending me Zhenia&#8217;s recipes during the most devastating time of your life. Thank you to all of my family in Odessa, especially Lenochka.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Thank you to my beloved brother Sasha, his wife Alyona and the kids (especially Danila) for helping me test. Thank you to my beautiful babushka Vera and Aunt Valya for their Uzbeko-Russian feast. Poor gluten-free Kris said your <em>beshbarmak</em> was worth the pain. Babushka, you are one of the strongest women I know, you are simply my hero.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_240"></a>Thank you to all of the lovely people we encountered at the Kakhovka market and beyond. It just made me feel so proud to be part of such a friendly, beautiful, open people. I really hope I am doing you proud.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Thank you to all of my best friends in London and beyond. Caroline, Emma, Eve (again) thank you for your support with the testing. Emma the dough explosion in your fridge will forever make me chuckle. Eve, your mum devouring the whole of Napoleon made me the happiest woman alive.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Rachel thank you for giving me Sweetapple work when times were super tough. Eleanor, Jimmy, thank you for being there always.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Thank you to everyone who has helped me look after my son. Caroline, Colin, Reggie and Dotty, you are my family. I am so lucky I have you in my life.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Caroline, Terry, Ira and of course the Catley family &#8211; especially Julietta and Tim &#8211; thank you for holding my back when I had to carry on and work hard.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Finally, thank you Tom Catley, you have been an incredible inspiration for the past four years and you have given me my little Sasha aka Sashimi. Without you, Sashims, I do not think I would have pushed this hard to succeed. This is for you from your mama and three generations of mamushkas.</p>
