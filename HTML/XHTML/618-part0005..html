<h1 class="heading" id="ch02sec01"><a id="page_42"></a>Ukrainian garlic bread</h1>
<p class="paral1"><a id="pg42"></a><span class="grey">The word <em>pampushka</em> can be used to describe a gorgeous plump woman and is one of my favourite words. Pam-poo-shka! These <em>pampushky</em> are traditionally served with red <em><a href="part0004.xhtml#page_12">borshch</a></em>. In Ukraine, we would use regular garlic, so if you can&#8217;t find wet (new) garlic don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it will still be delicious.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 8 breads</strong></p>
<p class="hang">15g (&#189;oz) fresh yeast or 7g (&#188;oz) dried active yeast</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">225ml (7&#189;fl oz) warm water</p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">8g (&#8531;oz) fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">3 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling</p>
<p class="hang">20g (&#190;oz) wet (new) or regular garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of parsley, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang1">1 duck (or chicken) egg, beaten, to glaze</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> First make a &#8216;sponge&#8217;, which is a type of yeasty starter. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the measurement water (make sure it&#8217;s blood temperature &#8211; hot water would kill the yeast!). Add 200g (7oz) of the flour and mix roughly. Cover with clingfilm and leave to prove in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> The next morning, add the rest of the flour and fine sea salt to the starter and knead on a well-floured work surface until the dough is smooth and comes away from your hands easily.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Divide the dough into 8 pieces and shape into round buns. Put them side by side in an oiled round ovenproof dish or a 24cm (9&#189; inch) round cake tin, cover and let them prove again, this time in a warm place, until doubled in size. They will join together just like hot cross buns do.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220&#176;C/425&#176;F/Gas Mark 7. To make the basting oil, simply stir the crushed garlic through the oil with a small pinch of sea salt and the parsley, then let it infuse.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> When the <em>pampushky</em> look plump and ready, brush them generously with some beaten egg to glaze and bake for 20&#8211;25 minutes or until they form a glistening golden crust. Take them out and baste them with the garlic oil. Serve immediately.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch02sec02"><a id="page_44"></a>Greek breads with spring onions</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">There were Greek communities in Crimea for many centuries, but most of them were relocated to the Ukrainian northern shores of the Sea of Azov under Catherine the Great, who annexed Crimea from the Ottoman Empire in 1783. A Greek friend of ours from one such community taught us how to make this. We would normally use salted <em><a href="part0007.xhtml#pg109">Syr</a></em> here, but feta works just fine. I sometimes add chopped herbs, such as dill, parsley, coriander or basil, for an extra boost of flavour.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">200ml (7fl oz) cold water</p>
<p class="hang">1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hang">450g (14&#189;oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) feta cheese, crumbled</p>
<p class="hang">10 spring onions, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hang">50ml (2fl oz) sunflower oil, plus extra for brushing</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Mix the water, egg and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl. Gradually add the flour, mixing it in with a fork first and then with your hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Flour your work surface really well and knead the dough until it stops sticking to your hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Mix the feta with the spring onions. Taste and add salt only if needed. Divide the filling into 4 portions.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Flour the work surface well and roll one piece of dough out as thinly as you can into a 30cm (12 inch) circle. Moisten the top of the sheet with a little sunflower oil. Take one-quarter of the filling and spread most of it over the rolled-out dough, leaving about a 5cm (2 inch) border. Then fold 2 opposite sides of the dough inwards to overlap, brush with a little more oil and sprinkle over the remaining filling, then fold the other 2 sides over to form a square. Flour and lightly roll over the folded bread, then set aside.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Repeat with the rest of the dough pieces and filling.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Heat the 50ml (2fl oz) sunflower oil in a large frying pan and fry the breads, one at a time, for 3 minutes on each side, lowering the heat if you see them catching a bit.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Let the breads cool for a minute and then eat with some <em><a href="part0003.xhtml#pg8">kefir</a></em> or <em>ayran</em> (a salty yogurt drink).</p>

<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1 x recipe quantity <a href="part0005.xhtml#ch02sec04"><em>Kefir</em> Dough</a></p>
<p class="hang">plain flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="hang1">50ml (2fl oz) sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) feta cheese, crumbled</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) sorrel or fresh spinach leaves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang">4 spring onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons chopped dill</p>
<p class="hang1">4 scant tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Divide the <em>Kefir</em> dough into 4 pieces. Flour the work surface really well and roll out each piece of dough, one by one, into a 20cm (8 inch) diameter circle.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> For the filling, mix the feta, sorrel or spinach, spring onions and dill together, making sure that the feta is finely crumbled.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Moisten the surface of one dough circle with 1 scant tablespoon of the sunflower oil and sprinkle one-quarter of the filling over the whole surface.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Next, take one edge of the circle and fold it into the middle. Now bring the edge of the first fold into the middle and fold again. Repeat until you have created about 7 folds (fewer won&#8217;t seal the filling in properly). The dough should resemble a flattened moneybag.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Make sure all the edges are firmly pinched together in the middle of the flatbread, flour the top lightly and gently flatten the moneybag with your rolling pin.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Repeat with the remaining dough circles and filling.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>8</strong> Heat the 50ml (2fl oz) sunflower oil in a frying pan until hot and gently lower in each flatbread, one at a time. The first one will take about 3 minutes on each side, but as the oil heats up, the next ones will take about 2&#8211;2&#189; minutes on each side. You can alternatively brush them with oil and cook them under your grill. The result will be somewhat different but still delicious.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">It was really hard to write this recipe, as my grandmother always said to add as much flour as the liquid would take. Go by your instinct &#8211; if the dough is too wet, add a little more flour than my recipe specifies. You will also incorporate more flour when you knead the dough. My grandmother often used the whey that was left over from making cheese (<em>see <a href="part0007.xhtml#pg109">Syr</a>,</em>) instead of <em><a href="part0003.xhtml#pg8">kefir</a></em> for this, but you can also use natural yogurt let down with a little water.</span></p>

<h1 class="heading1"><a id="pg52"></a>&#1042;&#1077;&#1088;&#1090;&#1091;&#1090;&#1072; | <em>Vertuta</em></h1>
<h1 class="heading" id="ch02sec06"><a id="page_52"></a>Moldovan giant cheese twist</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">There are many versions of this dish including sweet ones, and Moldovan friends tell me that their grannies call this dish <em>invirtita</em> and <em>saralie</em>. My half-Moldovan grandmothers used to make this all the time and it&#8217;s hard to stop eating it &#8211; the pastry is crispy on the outside and soft and salty on the inside. There is also a version using goose or duck scratchings instead of cheese that is equally glorious, but pieces of crispy streaky bacon would work equally well. Don&#8217;t be scared of this dish &#8211; you should attempt it when in a playful mood. The pastry will start stretching slowly and then it can suddenly go nuts, so have fun with it, embrace the holes and stop stretching just in time before it tears completely.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 8</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hang">175ml (6fl oz) warm water</p>
<p class="hang">360g (11&#190;oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">4 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling</p>
<p class="hang1">400g (13oz) salted <em><a href="part0007.xhtml#pg109">Syr</a></em> or feta cheese, crumbled</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Mix 1 of the eggs and the measurement water together in a large bowl. Gradually add the flour, stirring the mixture well with a fork and working it into a slightly sticky pastry dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Cover the dough with clingfilm and leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, preferably 1 hour. It should be firm and only slightly wet.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Flour the work surface really well and knead the dough briefly until it stops sticking to your hands. If the dough feels soft and very sticky, then add more flour to your work surface and knead it into the dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Roll one piece into a 30cm (12 inch) diameter circle. Gently stretch the edges of the circle with your hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Flour your work surface very, very heavily &#8211; you will later place your stretched pastry on it and it will have to be very well floured so that you can roll it up.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C/400&#176;F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Now lift the pastry circle and (gently!) suspend the edge over the back of your hands. Keep spinning it, moving your knuckles gently around. The weight of the pastry at the bottom will help stretch the thicker edges of the pastry over your knuckles. Holes will probably appear, but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; a couple are fine. The trick is to be confident when handling the dough. If you can see that a particular area needs stretching, then move your hands round to it; don&#8217;t feel you have to stick to manipulating the edges. Just watch that it doesn&#8217;t break completely, so stop immediately if you feel that it&#8217;s about to collapse.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_53"></a><strong>8</strong> The dough should stretch to about 60&#8211;80cm (23&#189;&#8211;31&#189; inches) in diameter and ideally, as my mum says, you should be able to read a newspaper through it. Carefully place it on your well-floured work surface. If the edges are still a lot thicker than the middle, stretch them gently.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>9</strong> Carefully brush 2 tablespoons of the sunflower oil all over the pastry &#8211; my grandmother used sterilized goose feathers to do this. Then sprinkle over half the cheese.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>10</strong> Next, roll out the second piece of dough and stretch it like you did the first one, again into a thin sheet about 60&#8211;80cm (23&#189;&#8211;31&#189; inches) in diameter. Gently place it over the first sheet. Oil the top of it as before and sprinkle over the remaining cheese.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>11</strong> Starting at the edge nearest to you, roll both sheets of pastry up together into a long sausage, keeping it an even size all the way along; if the middle becomes too thick, try to roll it out to the edges. Cut off any extra dough that doesn&#8217;t have cheese to avoid the twist getting too fat. Twist it at either end as if you are gently wringing a piece of clothing. If you feel that both ends are too thick and don&#8217;t have enough cheese in them, just cut them off!</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>12</strong> Finally, keep one end still and curl the other around it, creating a beautiful shell shape (think ammonite fossils).</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>13</strong> Brush the <em>vertuta</em> very generously with the remaining beaten egg. I simply tip the whole beaten egg on and rub it over the <em>vertuta</em> gently with my hands. Oil a baking sheet or a large, shallow cake tin lightly, pop the <em>vertuta</em> on and bake it for 40 minutes or until golden brown all over. Let it cool slightly and eat half of it at one sitting.</p>

I have included three of my favourite fillings here, egg and spring onion, potato, and hearts and livers as I love offal &#8211; chicken gizzards have always been one of my favourite things to eat. Hearts add great texture and the livers add flavour. We would run back to the tiny beach hut, sandy and ravenous, get our bodies covered in <em>kefir</em> (there was no sunscreen back then, so that was the sunburn remedy) and devour loads of these with a light soup. There was also more than one sweet version. Sliced fresh ripe apricots and sour cherries have always made the most delectable of fillings.</span></p>

Add enough flour to make it doughy &#8211; it may still be a little damp, but don&#8217;t worry, as you can incorporate more flour when you knead it later. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to prove in a warm place for 45 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Knead the dough on a well-floured work surface. It should be pleasantly soft but should not stick to your hands. Divide the dough into 8&#8211;10 pieces (about 80&#8211;60g/3&#8211;2&#188;oz each) depending which filling you are using.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Next make your chosen filling.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>For the egg and spring onion filling</strong>, mix the hard-boiled eggs with the spring onions and dill, and season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>For the potato filling</strong>, place the potatoes in a saucepan with cold water to cover, season well with salt and bring them to the boil. Cook for 15 minutes or until they can be easily pierced with a knife. Drain the potatoes and mash them finely with the butter and milk.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan and fry the shallots for about 10 minutes or until they are soft and nicely caramelized, then mix them with the potato and check the seasoning.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>For the hearts and liver filling</strong>, heat 1 tablespoon of the sunflower oil in a frying pan and cook the shallots over a medium-low heat for 10 minutes or until they start turning golden. Add the Madeira and deglaze the pan and let almost all the liquid boil off. Remove the shallots from the pan.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil and saut&#233; the chicken hearts over a medium-high heat, stirring a few times, for 5 minutes until they start to caramelize. Add the livers to the pan, season well and saut&#233; over a medium-high heat for another 5 minutes. Lower the heat, return the shallots to the pan and cover with a lid. Let it all steam for another 7 minutes, then let the mix cool in a bowl.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Flour the work surface really well and roll each piece of dough out into a 10cm (4 inch) diameter circle. Place about 25g (1oz) of your chosen filling in the centre of each dough circle. Bring the edges up and pinch them together to seal, then flip the buns seam side down (on the floured work surface) and gently flatten them with your hand.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a large frying pan until very hot and fry the <em>pyrizhky</em>, 4&#8211;6 at a time depending on the size of your pan, for 3 minutes on each side or until golden all over, lowering the heat if you see them catching. Drain them on kitchen paper and serve immediately instead of bread with some lovely broth or as a snack on their own.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch02sec08"><a id="page_58"></a>Tartar lamb turnovers</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is Crimean Tartar&#8217;s national dish. When I was little we used to spend half the summer in Crimea with my Russian grandma Vera. People would carry <em>chebureky</em> &#8211; one of the most beautiful street food snacks &#8211; along the beach. The filling must be incredibly juicy, and originally Tartars would add some lard from a type of fat-rumped sheep. In Ukraine, we add a little bit of <em>kefir</em> to the filling instead. But don&#8217;t be alarmed if the mixture looks really liquid &#8211; this is the way it should be &#8211; although be careful when you bite into them, as there will be a lot of juice. Meat provenance is important here, so make sure you use the best lamb possible. We normally use a mixture of minced pork neck and beef rump, but of course this is a blatant Ukrainization; Muslims would only use mutton or beef.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 6</strong></p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Pastry dough</strong></p>
<p class="hang">250ml (8fl oz) cold water</p>
<p class="hang">1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; tablespoon sugar</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; tablespoon sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang1">500g (1lb) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) minced lamb</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) onions, grated</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon <em>kefir</em> (optional)</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang1">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) sunflower oil</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> To make the pastry dough, place the measurement water in a large bowl and add the egg, sugar, salt and oil. Gradually add the flour and mix it into a firm dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Knead the dough on a floured work surface and then cover in clingfilm and chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> For the filling, place the lamb, onions and <em>kefir</em>, if using, in a bowl, season with the salt and mix together really well, preferably with your hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll out each piece on a floured work surface as thinly as you can, about 23cm (9 inches) in diameter. Place 2 full tablespoons of the mince mixture inside each dough circle and spread it thinly, leaving a 5cm (2 inch) border around the edge. Fip one side of the circles over the filling and pinch the edges firmly together to make large half-moon turnovers.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a large frying pan and fry the <em>chebureky</em> one at a time over a medium-high heat for 3 minutes on each side, lowering the heat if you see them browning too fast. Eat immediately, but watch that you don&#8217;t burn yourself!</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch02sec09"><a id="page_61"></a>Caucasian barbecue flatbreads</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">These make ideal barbecue food, and this is my brother Sasha&#8217;s signature barbecue recipe that he picked up at our local Armenian restaurant. If you can&#8217;t find lavash flatbreads (Turkish and Persian ones are very similar to the Armenian ones), you can also use flour tortilla wraps. Suluguni is a stringy, salty cheese from Georgia; do give it a go if you can find it, as it is more stretchy and makes a nice change from the ubiquitous haloumi, which has a more crumbly texture.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 6</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) suluguni or haloumi cheese, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) fresh coriander, stalks and leaves</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) parsley stalks and leaves</p>
<p class="hang">1&#189; lavash, about 30 x 50cm (12 x 20 inches) each, or 6 flour tortilla wraps</p>
<p class="hang1">50g (2oz) butter, melted, or 50ml (2fl oz) sunflower oil</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the garlic, cheese and herbs in a food processor and blitz them into a paste.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Cut the whole lavash into quarters, and cut the &#189; lavash in half so you have 6 flatbreads. Divide the filling between each flatbread or tortilla and wrap them up into parcels.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Brush the parcels with the melted butter, then wrap them individually in foil, pop them on the barbecue and cook for about 10 minutes. The filling will melt inside. Alternatively, brush them with the sunflower oil and cook in a griddle pan over a high heat or under a preheated hot grill for 3 minutes on each side. Serve with the <a href="part0008.xhtml#ch05sec12">BBQ Catfish</a>.</p>
