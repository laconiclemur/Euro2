<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><strong>When I was</strong> growing up in California, fresh fruit was in abundance, and a colorful salad was sometimes dinner. It’s impossible to give an exact recipe for a great fruit salad since it depends entirely on the quality of your fruit and what’s available. I love a mix of whatever I can get my hands on, including all varieties of melon, papaya, mango, pineapple, green and red plums, kiwi, fresh apricots and cherries, and all sorts of berries. Peel, seed, and trim the fruit as necessary and cut into pieces that are neither too small nor too big. You don’t want each bite to taste the same (which is what happens when the fruit is cut too small), but you don’t want to have to cut the fruit while you’re eating it or struggle to get a bite (which is what happens when the fruit is cut too big). Squeeze fresh orange juice over the fruit salad when you serve it and also spoon over the contents of a passion fruit if you can find one. The fresh juices naturally sweeten the fruit salad, ensuring that each bite is well seasoned and juicy.</p></div>
