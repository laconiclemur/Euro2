<p class="intro">From soft buns to real flaky Danish pastries, there is a huge tradition in Scandinavia for baking with sweet yeasted dough. There is nothing cosier than watching the world go by while making a batch of cinnamon buns. Or for those days when you don’t feel like something sweet, make a batch of savoury waffles instead.</p>

<p class="head1">CUSTARD ‘SPANDAU’ PASTRIES</p>
<p class="intro"><i>Spandauer</i> pastries are named after Spandau, the Berlin borough, although they don’t have anything to do with Germany – this pastry is as Danish as they come. In Denmark, these are most often made with either pastry cream or raspberry jam/jelly in the middle. They’re nicknamed ‘the baker’s bad eye’. Not a very charming name, admittedly, but you can forgive it because they are so delicious. Try experimenting with different fillings such as cherries, blueberries or even apricots. At home, I often add rhubarb pieces on top of the custard.</p>

<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> portion of Pastry Cream OR good-quality raspberry jam/jelly</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon single/light cream, for brushing</p>
<p class="ingrd">2–3 tablespoons roughly chopped toasted hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingrd1">ICING/FROSTING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup plus 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1–2 tablespoons hot water</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag fitted with a small plain nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 12–14</p>
<p class="noindent1">On a lightly floured surface, carefully roll out the Danish pastry dough and cut into 12–14 squares of around 10 x 10 cm/4 x 4 inches each.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place a generous teaspoon of remonce almond paste into the middle of each pastry square, then carefully fold each of the 4 corners in to meet in the middle, using the sticky remonce to hold the corners down. Place the pastries on the prepared baking sheets, then cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and set aside to rise for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brush the tops of each pastry with a little of the beaten egg and cream mixture. Add a teaspoon of your preferred filling (pastry cream OR jam/jelly) into the centre of each square. Lastly, add a sprinkling of chopped toasted hazelnuts to the centre, too.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 10–15 minutes or until golden brown, then remove and allow to cool before decorating.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the icing/frosting, mix the icing/confectioners’ sugar with 1–2 tablespoons of hot water, adding more if needed. You are looking for the consistency of runny honey. Fill the piping/pastry bag and pipe a loose spiral of white icing/frosting around the edges of each pastry.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Note</b>: Leftover bits of this pastry work very well to make the Romkugler (Rum Treats) on <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#page_56">page 56</a>.</p>

<p class="head1">DANISH PASTRY POPPY SEED SQUARES</p>
<p class="intro">Ask any homesick Dane for the pastry that they simply cannot get outside Denmark, and I bet you, <i>tebirkes</i> will be first on the list. There are two versions – the more savoury one (less sugar in the dough and no filling) and then this slightly sweeter one with the remonce filling. Up until the 1960s, only the more savoury variety was available, but a baker from Copenhagen once had some leftover remonce, and this beautiful sweet version was born, it became known as the <i>Copenhagener</i>. It does make such a decadent Sunday morning breakfast treat.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">1 portion of Danish Pastry Dough (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_13">page 13</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 portion of Remonce Almond Paste (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon single/light cream, for brushing</p>

<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 12</p>
<p class="noindent1">On a lightly floured surface, carefully roll out the Danish pastry dough to a large square of around 40 x 40 cm/15<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> x 15<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches. Cut the square in half and roll each half a little wider. Trim the edges straight.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spread the remonce almond paste on <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of each piece of dough lengthways. Fold the ‘naked’ side towards the middle and the other side on top of that so you end up with two long bits of pastry with three layers each.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Slice each long piece into 6–7 portions, making sure that the slices are nice and thick, around 5 x 6 cm/2 x 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches. If the slices are too thin the pastries may collapse when they bake. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to rise for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place the pastries on the prepared baking sheets and brush with the beaten egg and cream mixture. Add a generous amount of poppy seeds on top.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 10-15 minutes or until baked through and golden-brown all over. The filling may seep out a bit as it bakes so you may want to add a tray at the bottom of your oven to catch any drips of melted butter. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before eating.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Savoury variation:</b> omit the remonce almond paste, and when cooled slice open and serve with butter and cheese as a delicious savoury roll.</p>

<p class="ingrd1">MAKES A 9-BUN WREATH</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add it to the warm milk and mix until dissolved, then pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. If using dried/active dry yeast, sprinkle the yeast granules into the warm milk and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to activate and become frothy and bubbly. Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Stir in the melted butter, then stir in the sugar. Add half of the flour with the salt, baking powder and ground cardamom. Add half the beaten egg (reserve the other half for brushing before baking).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mix well until all the ingredients are incorporated and then more flour, bit by bit, until you have a slightly sticky dough. Take care not to add too much flour. Knead the dough for at least 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the bowl with a kitchen cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for 30–40 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead it through again, adding more flour if needed. You want a firmer but not dry dough. Split the dough into 9 equal portions and roll into round balls as neatly as possible. Place on the prepared baking sheet in a tidy circle, ensuring equal space of around 2.5 cm/1 inch between each bun. Cover with a kitchen cloth and leave to rise for a further 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brush the wreath lightly with beaten egg, then bake in the preheated oven for 10–12 minutes or until golden and baked through. Remove from oven and immediately cover with a damp kitchen cloth.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Transfer the cooled bun wreath to your serving platter. Using a very sharp serrated knife, cut deep triangular holes into each bun and reserve the lids. Scoop out <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the inside and mix these crumbs with the marzipan and a good dollop of pastry cream to make the filling. Pipe the filling mixture into the hole in each bun.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whip the whipping cream until stiff with a little icing/confectioners’ sugar and vanilla sugar. Pipe even swirls of cream on top of the filling, on each bun. Place the ‘lid’ back on each bun – facing same direction – and dust lightly with icing/confectioners’ sugar before serving.</p>

<p class="intro">Having a good recipe for <i>kanelbullar</i> is essential, because it’s the Scandi treat you will make over and over. Don’t forget to knead some love into the dough; it makes them extra-delicious.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">DOUGH:</p>
<p class="ingrd">13 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons dried/active dry yeast or 25 g/1 oz. fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 ml/1 cup whole milk, heated to 36–37°C (97–99°F)</p>

<p class="ingrd">80 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> stick plus</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla sugar</p>

<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 16</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the warm milk to a mixing bowl and add the yeast; stir until dissolved, then pour into the bowl of the food mixer. If using dried/active dry yeast, pour the warm milk into a bowl, sprinkle in the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to become bubbly. Pour into the bowl of a food mixer fitted with a dough hook.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mix in the cooled, melted butter. Allow to combine for 1 minute or so, then add the sugar. In a separate bowl, weigh out 400 g/3 cups of the flour, add the cardamom and salt and mix. Start adding the flour and spices into the milk mixture, bit by bit. Add half the beaten egg. Keep kneading for 5 minutes. You may need to add more flour – you want the mixture to end up a bit sticky. It is better not to add too much flour as this will result in dry buns. You can always add more later.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cover the dough with clingfilm/plastic wrap. Allow to rise for around 30 minutes or until it has doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead through with your hands and work in more flour if needed. Roll out the dough to a 40 x 50 cm/16 x 20 inch rectangle.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a bowl, add the butter, flour, spices and sugars and mix together well to make the filling. Using a spatula, spread the mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough. Fold the dough in half lengthways.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut 16 widthways strips of dough. Take one strip and carefully twist it a few times, then curl into a ‘knot’, ensuring both ends are tucked in or under so they do not spring open during baking. Place the folded ‘knots’ on the prepared baking sheets spaced well apart. Leave to rise under a kitchen cloth for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brush each bun lightly with beaten egg and place in the preheated oven to bake for around 10–12 minutes or until golden.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven. Brush the warm buns lightly with syrup then decorate with the nibbed ‘pearl’ sugar. Immediately cover with a damp, clean cloth for a few minutes to prevent the buns from going dry.</p>

<p class="intro">I love to make fun variations of the everyday <i>fika</i> bun. These delicious chocolate buns come from our Sally at the café, who makes them at home when she fancies something different from the usual cinnamon bun. We felt that just using chocolate spread doesn’t work because it burns easily, but mixing it to a paste with some extra chocolate helps make the most indulgent and chocolatey buns possible. These are pretty hard to resist, for kids and adults.</p>

<p class="head1">BIRTHDAY BUNS</p>
<p class="intro">My <i>farmor</i> (grandmother) Inger used to bake these for us on birthdays and treat days. After running around in the cold getting rosy cheeks, we’d head back into the warm house for one of these sweet buns. We’d eat them with so much butter our teeth would leave an indent (this phenomenon is known as <i>tandsmør</i> – literally meaning tooth butter!). In Denmark, these birthday buns are traditionally arranged in the shape of a stick man or woman, then baked and decorated with icing and wine gum mouths, liquorice eyes and gummy laces for hair.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 ml/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup whole milk</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 ml/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons single/light cream</p>

<p class="noindent1">Mix together the milk and cream and heat to finger-warm (around 36–37°C/97–98°F).</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the yeast and warmed milk-cream to a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved. If using dried/active dry yeast pour the warmed milk and cream into a bowl. Sprinkle on the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to activate and become frothy. Pour into the stand mixer with a dough hook.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the caster/granulated sugar and stir again, slowly adding half the flour mixed with the salt, bit by bit. Add the egg and softened butter and keep mixing. Slowly add the other half of the flour. You may not need all the flour or you may need a bit more, but keep mixing until you have a slightly sticky dough that is starting to let go of the sides of the bowl. This should take around 5–7 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cover the bowl with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to rise for around 35–40 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead through with your hands, adding only a little more flour if needed.</p>

<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the yeast and warm milk to a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved. If using dried/active dry yeast, pour the warm milk into a bowl. Sprinkle on the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to activate and become frothy and bubbly. Pour into the stand mixer with a dough hook attached.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the caster/granulated sugar and egg and mix again at medium speed. Start to add some of the flour, along with the salt and cardamom. Add the butter, at this stage mixing it in alternatively with bits of the flour. Stop adding flour once you have a fairly soft dough – you can always add more later. Cover the bowl with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 40 minutes to rise.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead through. Set two thirds of the dough aside. Roll the one third out into a circle that will fit into the cake pan. Spread on a layer of remonce almond paste, then a generous, even layer of pastry cream to cover the dough (you may not need it all). Add the raisins and put the pan to one side.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the remaining two thirds dough to a 30 x 30 cm/11<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> x 11<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch square and add the rest of the remonce filling, spreading evenly. Roll the dough up into a tight roll and cut into 8 equal swirls. Place one swirl in the middle of the pan on top of the pastry cream and the rest around it, evenly. Squash the swirls down a bit if needed. Cover the pan with clingfilm/plastic wrap then leave to rise for another 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brush the cake with beaten egg, scatter over the flaked/slivered almonds and bake in the preheated oven for around 20 minutes. After this time, cover the top with foil and turn the heat down by about 20°C/70°F. Bake for another 20 minutes or until cooked. Remove from the oven and immediately cover with a clean, damp kitchen cloth to prevent a crust from forming. Leave to cool before serving.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the topping, sift together the icing/confectioners’ sugar and cocoa powder and stir with a few spoons of hot water until smooth. Swirl over the cake and leave to set. This cake does not keep very well so is best served the same day it is made.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Mix together the egg yolks, buttermilk, double/heavy cream and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, sift together all the dry ingredients including the cardamom.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In another clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff using a hand-held electric whisk on high speed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the egg and cream mixture to the dry ingredients, then carefully fold in the beaten egg whites and lemon zest. Leave to rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator before using.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place the pan over high heat to warm through and add a little melted butter to the pan to stop the pancakes from sticking. If you are using an æbleskive pan, carefully add enough batter to each hole so that it reaches about 0.25 cm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch from the top. If you are using a normal frying pan, add spoonfuls of batter as you would if making normal small pancakes. Leave to cook for a few minutes until the edges become firm then, using a fork or knitting needle (knitting needle is easier!), gently turn the pancakes over to cook on the other side. If you have filled the holes too much, this can be tricky – you’ll get the hang of it after a few.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Once browned on both sides (3–4 minutes per batch), keep the cooked æbleskiver warm in the oven until you have finished frying.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Serve dusted with icing/confectioners’ sugar and a little pot of raspberry jam/jelly for dipping.</p>
<p class="head2"><a id="page_158"/>For the love of baking</p>
<p class="intro">One of my earliest memories is sitting in my <i>farmor</i> Inger’s warm kitchen. I remember her kneading dough for me and my sister to make <i>boller</i> (buns). I recall the warmth of her kitchen and the smell of spices. I remember trying to make lots of different shapes of bun and brushing them with egg wash. Impatiently watching them rise, then waiting for them to bake, pacing backwards and forwards by the oven door…</p>
<p class="noindent1">Finally, when my grandmother took the buns out of the oven, she let us split them open and spread them with butter, which melted on the warm fluffy surface. The taste was out of this world and at that moment I knew I loved baking. To this day, with every batch of bread I make, I hope to have this same feeling of delight.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Many of our dearest childhood memories are associated with food. The taste of ice cream on the beach on a summer’s day, the picnics, the birthday cakes, the hot chocolates on cold days.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sometimes, just a taste of the same flavour of ice cream can transport us back in an instant to a moment in time. The memories we develop through the foods we make and eat as children are incredibly powerful. At the café, where a lot of customers are ex-pat Scandinavians living in London, I often tell people that my job is to provide a temporary remedy for homesickness. Scandinavians seek out a specific brand of chocolate or a particular cake, so that they can be instantly transported back home just for a few moments.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="img" src="images/C8-F10.jpg"/></p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_159"/><img alt="img" src="images/C8-F11.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">The food we make and share in our homes with the people we love creates so many important memories in our lives, and I truly believe that what we learn in the kitchen helps shape us as people. The art of cooking and baking teaches us about everything, from the science of the ingredients to patience. For me, the kitchen was – and still is – a place where we talk, we learn, we connect and we love. We <i>hygge</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I know I’m very lucky: the amount of love in the kitchens I grew up in is unfathomable. I try to make sure that both my kitchens – at home and in the café – are full of the same warmth. Teaching my children to make recipes from their heritage is how I teach them about where they come from. There is no subject we can’t discuss when we bake. Scandinavians have a long tradition of home baking and we have a sweet tooth generally, but we also understand how to balance it by making sure that it’s home-baking – not mass-produced stuff – that wins out.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In my family, we are both home cooks and bakers. My great-grandfather was a trained <i>Konditor</i> in Denmark and he met my great-grandmother as they worked in a restaurant where she was making open sandwiches. In my home, my husband Jonas teaches our kids to cook and create, and I get to be the Mamma who is always happy to bake a batch of buns.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I’m not a trained baker. I’m a cook who runs and owns a café in London with a mission to bring simple Scandinavian food to everyone. I am also a mother. First and foremost I am a lover of sweet things, of spices and of warm ovens. We hope you enjoy our book full of authentic Nordic treats – it was created with love in my warm kitchen during the dark autumn and winter months of the year, with help from two eager little girls called Astrid and Elsa, who love cracking eggs and testing warm cakes as they come out of the oven. And so the circle is complete.</p>

<p class="head1">FINNISH DOUGHNUTS</p>
<p class="intro">Did the Finns invent the doughnut? Perhaps not, but the Finnish version of doughnuts – known as <i>munkki</i> – are absolutely delicious. They have been an integral part of Finnish baking culture for generations and are especially popular around Walpurgis Night. In Swedish, these doughnuts are called <i>munk ringar</i> (monk rings), which refers to the iconic hairline of the monks. My friend Maija and her mother Tuula have been so kind as to share their family recipe.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">25 g/1 oz. fresh yeast or 13 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons dried/active dried yeast</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 ml/1 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk heated to 36–37°C (97–98°F)</p>
<p class="ingrd">30 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">400–500 g/3–3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour, plus extra for kneading</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons melted butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg, beaten</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 litre/34 fl oz. vegetable oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="ingrd2">granulated sugar or cinnamon sugar (mixed at a 1:5 ratio), to coat</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a cook’s thermometer</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES ABOUT 20</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the yeast and milk to a mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved. If using dried/active dry yeast pour the milk into a bowl. Sprinkle over the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to activate and become frothy and bubbly. Pour into the mixer with a dough hook attached.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the sugar and mix with the dough hook until dissolved. Combine the flour, salt and cardamom and start to add to the mixer bit by bit. Pause adding flour when the dough begins to stick and add the butter, egg and lemon juice. Continue again to add the flour until you have a firm yet sticky dough. Be careful not to add too much flour at this stage or the doughnuts will be dry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cover the bowl with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave the dough in a warm place to rise for about 30–35 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it through. Add a little more flour if needed. Portion off a piece of the dough and roll it into a small sausage of about finger thickness. Join the ends together to make little rings of around 5–6 cm/2–2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter, leaving a good sized hole in the middle. Scatter more flour on a surface and place the rings there as you go along.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cover the dough rings with a kitchen cloth and leave to rise for a further 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan to 180°C (350°F). Carefully test a doughnut in the hot oil. It should need between 1–2 minutes each side to turn light golden-brown all over.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cook the doughnuts in batches then remove and drain on paper towels before rolling in cinnamon sugar (or just granulated sugar, if preferred) to coat. Eat on day of making. <b>Tip:</b> You can also make round doughnuts and pipe them full of raspberry jam/jelly or pastry cream (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>).</p>

<p class="head1">CRISPY SWEET WAFFLES</p>
<p class="intro">In our first book, we gave you a recipe for a breakfast waffle. You may think that a waffle is just a waffle – but there are different types. These ones are called <i>frasvåfflor</i> and are crispier, best eaten straight away with a dollop of jam or sticky vanilla syrup and fresh fruit. You’ll find this type of waffle served in most huts on the <i>fjells</i> where people go to ski. This recipe is from my mother-in-law, Eva. She makes these for us when we visit their house in Sälen in Sweden. After spending the precious daylight hours in the snow on the mountains where they live, we’ll get back to the cottage and warm up in front of the log fire. Then we all gather at the table to eat freshly made <i>frasvåfflor.</i></p>
<p class="ingrd1">150 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter, melted, plus a little extra for greasing</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>

<p class="ingrd">cloudberry or strawberry jam/jelly and whipped cream, OR vanilla bean syrup and fresh fruit to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a heart-shaped waffle iron – available online. You can use a different shaped iron, but cooking time and yield may vary</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 16</p>
<p class="noindent1">Heat up the waffle iron and brush with melted butter. Mix all the ingredients (apart from the serving suggestions) together to form a smooth batter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add a ladle full of batter to the preheated waffle iron and close the lid. Leave to cook for 2–3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Remove and serve immediately with plenty of cloudberry or strawberry jam/jelly and whipped cream. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Vanilla bean syrup:</b> To make a quick vanilla bean syrup to serve with the waffles, combine 150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar with the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean and 100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup water. Bring to the boil then simmer for 4–5 minutes over high heat, taking care not to let the mixture bubble over or the sugar burn. If it’s reducing too quickly, shorten the cooking time or you will end up with a syrup that’s too thick. Remove from the heat and add sea-salt flakes to taste. Pour over the waffles to serve.</p>

<p class="intro">On one of those days where only an abundance of cheese will do, you will find me hogging all the <i>Västerbotten</i> to myself – it’s such a delicious Swedish cheese. I make these waffles on cold winter days when the rain and sleet forces us to cosy up inside. This is the perfect low-effort snack – just throw everything together and cook in the waffle iron. Jonas, my husband, loves the bacon/pancetta pieces in these waffles – but you can omit if preferred.</p>

<p class="head1">HOMEMADE CRISPBREAD</p>
<p class="intro">In Scandinavia, crispbread is not a diet bread – it just happens to be healthy and delicious. It has been a staple on our lunch tables since way back when Harald Bluetooth was a nipper.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">25 g/1 oz. fresh yeast or 13 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons dried/active dry yeast (note: you can also make this with a sourdough starter, but you’ll need to try with your own starter to see what quantity works for you)</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 ml/1 cup milk heated to 36–37°C (97–98°F)</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons runny honey OR bread syrup OR corn syrup</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/1 cup wholemeal/wholegrain rye flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">300–400 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>–3 cups light rye flour (type 997)</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">50–75 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>–<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup seeds, spices or toppings of your choice (I sometimes use pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds or sunflower seeds. For stronger flavours, I use cumin, caraway or fennel seeds. You can even add cinnamon for a festive feel)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2–4 large baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment or a large pizza stone</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 8 LARGE OR 16 SMALL</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the yeast and warm milk to a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved. If using dried/active dry yeast pour the warm milk into a bowl, sprinkle over the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to activate and become frothy and bubbly. Pour into the mixer with a dough hook attached.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the honey or syrup and stir again. Sift together the flours and salt and add to the mixture. Continue to mix with the dough hook for at least 5 minutes on medium speed. The dough needs to be firm but if it is too dry and crumbly then mix in a few tablespoons of water.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cover the bowl with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave the dough to rest for around an hour in a warm place. It will not rise much, but should puff up a little.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F) Gas 7. Add a pizza stone to the oven if you have one handy (this speeds up the cooking).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it through. Split into 8 large or 16 smaller pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, then roll out each onto a piece of baking parchment until really thin or around a millimetre in thickness. Arrange on the baking sheets. Add your chosen seeds or toppings, pushing them into the dough slightly. Brush with water and prick liberally with a fork all over. I like my cripsbread salty, so I usually also add a spinkle of salt flakes at this stage too. I also usually cut a hole in the middle of mine, but this is just for show. If preparing in batches, keep the dough covered with a kitchen cloth to prevent it from drying out.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 4–8 minutes or until slightly browned and firm. If you are not using a pizza stone, you may need to turn the cripsbread over midway through cooking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the trays. Once the oven has cooled to just warm, pop the crispbread back in to finish drying. Enjoy with sliced meats, pâtés, smoked fish or grated Västerbotten cheese mixed with crème fraîche and cream cheese, spiked with extra pepper and topped with cloudberry jam/jelly.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_168"/>Svenska scones</p>
<p class="head1">SWEDISH SCONES</p>
<p class="intro">Baking bread at home doesn’t have to take ages. I often make these Swedish scones if I don’t have bread in the house, they take just a few minutes to put together and not long to bake. Swedes refer to these as <i>Svenska</i> scones, but the basis for them is actually more akin to making soda bread, rather than the traditional English scone for afternoon tea. This recipe is quite forgiving – you can vary the flour you use to suit your taste (although if you use lots of rye or coarse wholemeal/wholegrain, you will need to add a bit of extra liquid or plain flour). I also sometimes add seeds or even grated carrots to the mixture. These scones are delicious served with plenty of butter and maybe a slice of mild Scandinavian cheese.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups wholemeal/wholegrain spelt flour</p>

<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 16</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a bowl, combine the flours, baking powder and salt. Mix in the cubed butter with your hands until the mixture is grainy and even.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the milk, yogurt and syrup and combine with the flour and butter. Mix lightly until you have an even, grainy dough. Don’t knead it.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cut the dough into 4 even pieces and roll each one into a ball. Flatten the balls to discs of around 15–16 cm/6–6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches in diameter. Cut a cross almost all the way through on each disc.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Arrange on the prepared baking sheets and brush with beaten egg or milk. Bake in the preheated oven for 15–18 minutes or until golden brown, well-risen and baked through. Leave to cool slightly before breaking each disc into 4 along the scored lines.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Slice open to serve. Best eaten on day of baking.</p>

<p class="head1">RYE FLAT ROLLS</p>
<p class="intro">These light rye flat rolls are so super-soft that my kids refer to them as ‘pillow bread’ - and always ask for them in their packed lunches (they freeze well too). Traditionally, these are made with <i>rågsikt</i> (<i>sigtemel</i>) – a flour blend of 40% sifted rye flour and 60% white bread flour. Don’t use dark rye for these rolls, it will not work – you need to get the lighter rye.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">50 g/3 tablespoons fresh yeast or 25 g/1 oz. dried/active dry yeast</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 ml/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups water heated to 36–37°C/97-98°F</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 ml/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups whole milk, heated to 36–37°C/97–98°F</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup golden/light corn syrup</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons butter, melted</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups light rye flour (type 997), sifted</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">550 g/4 cups white strong/bread flour (or more if needed)</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup oatmeal/rolled/old-fashioned oats (run larger oats through the food processor to make them finer)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2–4 large baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">3 cm/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches or 2 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch round pastry/cookie cutter</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 4 LARGE OR 8 SMALL</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the yeast, milk and water to a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved. If using dried/active dry yeast, pour the warm milk and warm water into a bowl. Sprinkle over the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for 15 minutes to activate and become frothy and bubbly. Pour into the mixer with a dough hook.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the golden/light corn syrup and melted butter and stir again. Add the rye flour, salt and half of the white flour and mix with the dough hook until fully incorporated. Add the oatmeal. Continue adding white flour and knead for around 4–5 minutes until you have a slightly sticky mixture that is coming together and letting go of the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place the dough in a clean lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap. Leave in warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead through, then split into 4 or 8 equal parts and shape into balls. If you are making 4 large rolls, roll out the balls into circles measuring about 20–25 cm/8–10 inches in diameter. If you are making 8 smaller rolls, roll into circles measuring about 10 x 12.5 cm/4 x 5 inches. The rolls should be thin, at around 1 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheets. Cut a hole in the middle of each with the appropriate size pastry/cookie cutter, cover and leave to rise for a further 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Prick the breads evenly all over with a fork, all the way to the base. Bake in the preheated oven for around 10–12 minutes or until lightly browned and risen. Cooking times may vary – if you are making large rolls they will take a little longer than the small ones.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and immediately cover with a damp kitchen cloth to prevent a crust from forming. Serve either sliced in half as sandwiches or as they are, with toppings.</p>
