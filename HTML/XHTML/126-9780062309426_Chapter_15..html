<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ike a lot of outsiders stunned by the richness of the food in Southwest France, I initially dismissed as apocryphal the claim that Gascons live considerably longer than their countrymen. But when I did the research, the numbers held up. According to the Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques—a.k.a. Insée, France’s all-seeing census bureau—the residents of Midi-Pyrénées, which encompasses most of Gascony, enjoy the longest lifespan of all of France’s regional populations, living a full ten years more, on average, than the natives of France’s choucroute-loving Northeast. If you drill down on the numbers a little further, the Gers in particular starts to look like an anomaly within that happy anomaly. According to Roger Corder, the British researcher and red wine enthusiast, when you control for regional migration men in the Gers have the highest relative longevity of any département in France.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156" title="156"/>It’s also worth noting that the Southwest is where the French scientist Serge Renaud decided to focus his field work for his 1992 study on French cardiovascular health. Renaud had become globally famous the year before, after appearing in the TV series <i>60 Minutes</i> to discuss his earlier research on what had come to be called the French Paradox. (The segment, which included a sociable interview by Morley Safer over what by all appearances was a magnificent French lunch, became a minor television event that sent thousands of Americans rushing out to buy cases of red wine and wheels of Brie.) What Renaud discovered in his follow-up study was, effectively, that the Southwest is the statistical epicenter of the French Paradox, with the lowest incidence of heart attacks in the country, and one of the lowest in the Western world—on the whole, residents of Midi-Pyrénées had four times fewer heart attacks than their counterparts in the United States and Britain, despite a diet rich in fats. Suddenly a lot of attention was being paid to the life habits of Gascons, particularly what they ate and drank. Was it the polyphenols in tannat wine grapes? Was it the lipid profile of duck fat, which is high in good HDL cholesterol? Was it the iron content of foie gras? The winegrowers favored one argument, the duck farmers another. Meanwhile, the Gascons kept on eating and drinking as they always had.</p>
<p class="indent">The hype about longevity and health in the Southwest has died down since then, though local newspapers still run an obligatory article on the subject when the Insée numbers come out every few years, confirming anew the Midi-Pyrénées’ hold on the longevity title.</p>
<p class="indent">I hadn’t come to Gascony to conduct a study, but I did have quite a bit of time to collect anecdotal evidence, and the more I got to know the Gascons, the more I came to believe that, as is the case with so many things in life, their secret lies not in any single choice <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157" title="157"/>or habit but in a whole bunch of converging factors. Certainly, inhabiting a rural place, with much fresh air and little urban stress, has something to do with Gascons’ well-being. As does, without a doubt, having lots of family and friends close by. And diet can’t be discounted—though, to my mind, what Gascons eat and drink counts for less than <i>how</i> they eat and drink. Gascons aren’t excessive imbibers, village fêtes notwithstanding, and they seldom drink or snack between meals. When they do sit down for lunch or supper, they tend to eat what they like, and as much as they like, and they don’t hurry things.</p>
<p class="indent">And yet, over time, I couldn’t help but think there was something intrinsically different about the Gascons, something in their physical and emotional makeup that set them apart from their compatriots. I could see it in their even-tempered demeanor, in their generosity, in their work ethic, in their attitude toward life—especially the equable way they dealt with its vexations and hardships, whether a broken sewer pump or the death of a spouse. As different as they were from one another, the Gascons I knew—Henri, Nadine, Patrick, Dubosc, Alphonse, and the rest—all seemed equally comfortable in their skin.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>ERIC FITAN, A VIGNERON INTRODUCED</small> to me by André Dubosc, did not at first glance appear to possess a Gascon’s robust constitution. He was quiet and self-effacing, verging on obsequious. At Dubosc’s suggestion, Eric had invited me to take part in the wine harvest, a rite of passage I’d somehow missed out on in my younger expat days. Dubosc had described Eric in heroic terms. “He is one of our best, a true <i>passioné</i>,” he told me. “The Gers needs more men like him.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I arrived at Eric’s vineyard, a few pickers, stirring amid the greenery, were already at work. I approached one of them, a <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158" title="158"/>heavyset Gascon in a stained T-shirt, and asked where I could find Eric Fitan. He pointed down a vine row to a tall, ungainly figure dumping a bucket of grapes into a steel hopper attached to a tractor.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc had mentioned that Eric had been a doctoral student in engineering at a prestigious university in Toulouse but had returned to the Gers to take over his family’s farm and vineyard. And indeed the young winegrower, who wore wire-rim glasses and had schoolboy bangs, looked the part of a nerd more than that of a paysan. When I introduced myself, he shook my hand in a gentle and seemingly un-Gascon way.</p>
<p class="indent">Handing me a pair of pruning shears and a bucket, Eric informed me, with a slightly pained expression, that by law he wasn’t allowed to pay me for my work but that I was cordially invited to have lunch with him and his parents at the family homestead. I considered this more than fair remuneration.</p>
<p class="indent">Eric led me into the vines and showed me how to snip the grape clusters at the base of the stem, where it joined the vine branch, explaining that I had to take care not to damage the fruit.</p>
<p class="indent">“Otherwise it will begin macerating too soon,” he said, and then laughed nervously. “And we don’t want that.”</p>
<p class="indent">Picking grapes, though it has inspired much romantic imagery in movies and wine-marketing campaigns, is devilishly hard work. To reach the fruit, one has the choice of either squatting or bending over. For a while I squatted, but my knees did not take well to that at all. So I switched to bending, which, after a vine row’s worth of toil, caused my lower back to twitch painfully. I observed the other pickers, most of whom, to my surprise, were a good deal older and, I dare say, less fit-looking than me. Some were squatting, others were bending. None of them looked remotely uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="indent">On the contrary, they were quite spry. Every minute or so, one of them would shout <i>seau!</i>—which means “bucket”—and Eric would <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159" title="159"/>jog over to replace the full receptacle with an empty one. The frequency with which that word was being shouted was astonishing. Each of the other pickers was filling three or four buckets for every one of mine. What’s more, in true Gascon fashion, they talked nonstop while they worked, tossing free-form <i>aperçus</i> across the vines in buoyant patois.</p>
<p class="indent">“Word is, the Chinese are making wine in Mongolia . . .”</p>
<p class="indent">“They say the wood pigeons are passing late this year . . .”</p>
<p class="indent">“Our grandkids can kiss social security good-bye . . .”</p>
<p class="indent">“Used to see more kinds of insects in the vines . . .”</p>
<p class="indent">“Global warming . . .”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yep.”</p>
<p class="indent">Before long, my neck and forehead were sticky with sweat, and my hands were black with dried grape juice—snipping the fruit without breaking the skins was harder than it looked, as the grapes were ripe to bursting.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Pas très beau ça</i>,” remarked one of the pickers on seeing the mushy mess in my bucket. Not a pretty sight.</p>
<p class="indent">At one point late in the morning, Eric came rushing over to me. “Ah <i>non</i>!” he said as I was about to snip off a cluster of grapes. “Not those, not those!”</p>
<p class="indent">He plucked a leaf from the vine in front of me and tried to show me how it was subtly different from the five-lobed leaves of the vine next to it, but I was having trouble seeing the distinction.</p>
<p class="indent">“You have to watch out for ones like this,” Eric said. “It’s not tannat.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Who knows. This plot was planted eighty-five years ago.”</p>
<p class="indent">Eric explained that old indigenous grape varietals were still insinuated amid the tannat vines, a harkening back to the bad old days when paysans got paid by the hectoliter, no matter what went into the press.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160" title="160"/>“Back then,” Eric said, “they just wanted to <i>faire pisser les vignes</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">That literally meant “make the vines piss,” which called to mind the expression Dubosc had used for bad wine: vin à faire pisser.</p>
<p class="indent">None of it sounded very thirst-quenching.</p>
<p class="indent">At twelve o’clock sharp, we broke for lunch. While the other workers unpacked picnics, Eric and I drove the mile or so to his parents’ house on his tractor, with me hanging off the side, feet planted on the running board.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>A PROPER VIGNERON LUNCH IS</small> a wonderful thing, especially during the <i>vendanges</i>, and especially in Gascony. The homemade confit comes out, the vin maison is opened, and the feasting is set to. The Fitan family’s meal was true to this tradition, and extra-special in my opinion because the confit in question wasn’t duck but goose: two enormous magrets—each nearly twice the size of a duck breast—sliced into thick slabs that looked like corned beef but tasted much better. At that moment it struck me as sad that the raising of geese, once the preeminent waterfowl in southwestern France, has been relegated to something of a niche pursuit, the realm of nostalgists and stubborn holdouts, since geese are harder to breed and require much more time and finesse to fatten than the modern moulard crossbreed.</p>
<p class="indent">In Gascony, at any given domestic meal, it is common to be in the presence of several generations of family, including, not infrequently, great-grandparents. The Fitans’ particular contribution to the Gers’s longevity ranking was Eric’s <i>papi</i>, a diminutive nonagenarian in bedroom slippers and a buttoned-to-the-top plaid shirt.</p>
<p class="indent">When Eric mentioned that I was American, his grandfather laid a hand on my forearm and squeezed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161" title="161"/>“We have much to thank you for,” he said, looking at me with an earnestness that set me back on my heels.</p>
<p class="indent">“Papi was in the Résistance,” Eric said.</p>
<p class="indent">“You Americans saved our hides,” said Papi. “Was your grandfather in the war?”</p>
<p class="indent">I said he wasn’t.</p>
<p class="indent">Papi gave a blasé chin-thrust and reached for his glass.</p>
<p class="indent">Eric’s father, a lean, cowboy-like fellow in jeans and work boots who looked not all that much older than Eric, had poured a ceremonial round of juice from the previous day’s harvest. After a morning in the sun-broiled vines, it tasted like the most sublime nectar.</p>
<p class="indent">Now a tureen of garbure was being passed around. This was followed by a piperade, then a sculptural salad worthy of a ’50s-era <i>Better Homes</i> cookbook, consisting of an elongated mound of tuna covered in homemade mayonnaise and garnished around the edges with crumbled hard-boiled eggs. It looked questionable but tasted very good. And, finally, the goose confit.</p>
<p class="indent">I ate and drank, then ate and drank some more, pausing occasionally to observe the customary, quietly awesome display of Gascon voracity, Eric’s granddad showing himself to be the most dedicated <i>gourmand</i> of the family.</p>
<p class="indent">Lunch concluded with rice pudding and glasses of cold Pacherenc, and straightaway I found myself in the familiar post–Gascon-lunch dilemma of wanting very badly to go to sleep just as everyone else was preparing to get back to work. I have yet to figure out what metabolic quirk allows Gascons to avoid this problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Making my pace look even more glacial than before, Eric and his field hands fell to their afternoon tasks with renewed verve, mowing through the vine rows even faster than they had in the morning, the effervescence of their banter undiminished.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162" title="162"/>Eric had mentioned that six o’clock was quitting time, and as the hour approached, the pickers’ pace—though I didn’t think this was possible—accelerated further. It seemed we were getting close to finishing the entire vineyard parcel, and esprit de corps dictated that we buckle down.</p>
<p class="indent">And so it was that we finished picking the last row of vines at the stroke of six. Afterward, the whole crew repaired to Eric’s parents’ house for a round of floc. I was crushingly tired. If any of the others were too, none showed it. Everyone was talking with great enthusiasm about what they were going to have for dinner.</p>
<p class="indent">Before I went home, Eric showed me around the half-finished house he was building for his family just a few hundred yards from the one he grew up in. We walked through empty rooms coated in plaster dust and smelling of caulk.</p>
<p class="indent">Eric showed me the kitchen cupboards he’d installed the night before, and then pointed to some Sheetrock he was going to hang tonight.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked if he’d be back in the vines tomorrow.</p>
<p class="indent">“As soon as it’s light.”</p>
<p class="indent">There were two more plots to be picked, he said, and the harvest had to be completed by week’s end, as rain was forecast for the weekend.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked, not the least bit sarcastically, when he found time to sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">Eric smiled, looking unsure of what to say, as if I’d posed a trick question.</p>
<p class="indent">As we walked back to my car, a couple of Eric’s dogs at our heels, Eric casually related to me how, in addition to working full-time as a vigneron, he raised corn and livestock, served as the president of a local growers’ association, and led a bandas orchestra called Les Dandys d’Armagnac.</p>
<p class="indent">Eric shook my hand and promised to send me a bottle of the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164" title="164"/><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163" title="163"/>year’s <i>milléssime</i> as soon as it was ready. (I have since had a chance to taste the wine made from the grapes we harvested on the Fitan property, and though there is a petty side of me that would rather not say so, given everything else Eric has clearly got going for him, it was excellent.)</p>
<p class="indent">That night, after putting Charlotte to bed, I recounted my experience to Michele, emphasizing, with only slight exaggeration, that Eric Fitan probably got more done in a day than I did in a week. I also confessed to her that Gascons, as much as I loved them, sometimes had a way of making me feel like a wimp and, on occasion, a less than fully actualized paterfamilias.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele, who didn’t typically indulge self-pity, generously offered that, grape-picking aside, she thought I’d been doing a pretty good impression of a Gascon overall.</p>
