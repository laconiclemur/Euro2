<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-127"/><span class="dotted">Ciambottini</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Full disclosure: I made this word up. Like cooking, my language skills are homegrown. I turned <em>ciambotta</em>, which means “big mix,” into a longer word with a smaller meaning: “<em>ciambottini</em>” is a little mix. For me, it’s a vinegary, salty, can’t-get-enough combination of artichokes, bite-size pieces of pecorino cheese, soppressata, and briny caperberries. Ciambottini is a strong cocktail’s best friend.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 small preserved artichokes, quartered lengthwise</p>

<p class="ingredient">3 ounces hard salami, cut into bite-size pieces</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons large caperberries</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup mixed green and black olives</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 or 2 dried red chilies or a large pinch of red chilies</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>

<p class="step"><strong>Bring a large</strong> pot of water to a boil and add the cauliflower. Cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain the cauliflower and let it cool to room temperature.</p>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-128"/><span class="dotted">Gougères with Gruyère, Mustard, and Rosemary</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Warm, salty, and irresistible, <em>gougères</em> elevate whatever moment they are served in. Mine are so densely packed with cheese that just after they heroically attempt to rise in the hot oven, all they can muster is deflating. In my eyes, this is a good thing. You can get a puffy, crispy gougère anywhere—but those are always empty inside. A gougère so flavorful that it falls flat on its face? That’s my kind of gougère.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 2 DOZEN GOUGÈRES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">9 tablespoons (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 shallots, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredient">1¼ cups water</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingredient">5 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups grated Gruyère cheese (about 5 ounces), plus a little extra for the tops</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch cayenne pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 425°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and rosemary to the pan and cook, stirring a bit, just until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set it aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining 8 tablespoons butter with the water and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the flour all at once, reduce the heat to medium, and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a dough that begins to pull away from the sides of the pot and doesn’t stick to the sides or bottom, a good 5 or 6 minutes. It should be quite shiny and smell buttery and wonderful.</p>
<p>Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat until the dough has cooled off a bit, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can do this with a handheld electric mixer or just a whisk and some serious forearm muscle.</p>
<p>Crack the eggs, one by one, into a small bowl and add them to the dough, waiting until each one is incorporated before adding the next. Keep mixing the dough until it comes together. (It will separate a bit each time you add an egg, but don’t despair, it will find its way back to itself.)</p>
<p><a id="page-129"/>Once the dough has formed, add the reserved shallot mixture, the Gruyère, black pepper, cayenne, and mustard and mix just to combine. Using two spoons, place golf ball–size dollops of the dough on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each. Sprinkle the top of each gougère with a pinch of extra grated Gruyère (you could also use Parmigiano-Reggiano for this).</p>
<p>Bake, rotating the baking sheets halfway through baking, so that the gougères cook evenly, until they’re a bit puffed and very nicely browned, about 20 minutes. Serve while hot.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">If you don’t bake these right away, portion them on a parchment paper–lined baking sheet and freeze them. When frozen, place them in an airtight container and store them in the freezer for up to 2 months. Bake them without thawing, allowing a few extra minutes in the oven.</span></p>
