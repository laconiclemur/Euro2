<p class="nonindent">Félix’s mom—and, therefore, Félix—makes the best fried eggs ever. Huevos con Puntilla means “eggs with lace” and that’s exactly how these eggs look. The beautiful golden brown crispy tendrils that form around the egg when it is fried in ripping-hot oil are as delicate and beautiful as lace. Since the eggs cook so quickly, the edges become potato chip crunchy, the whites moist, and the yolk runny and rich as hollandaise. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  Use a small nonstick pan to save yourself from sticking worries. A nonstick silicone spatula, too (the flat pancake-flipping kind, not the scraping-the-bowl one). A metal spatula might stick to the egg and scratch your pan. And a rubber spatula that can’t withstand really high heat might warp.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  Turn on the exhaust fan over your stove or open windows if you don’t have a hood.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  Fill the pan with a high-heat oil, like canola, sunflower, or peanut; a ½ inch is good here. This is a “fried” egg in that it’s really, truly fried, so don’t skimp on the oil.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  Get the oil really hot. Wisps of smoke should start to rise. The reason we’re doing it that hot is because the egg yolk has to be runny and the white has to be crispy. If the oil’s not hot enough, you’re going to overcook the egg yolk by the time the white sets. Eggs like to get cooked fast. It’s a lot of oil, but if it’s at the right temperature—yes, as in, really hot—the egg isn’t going to absorb much of it at all.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  Carefully and quickly crack an egg into the pan. Watch out! The egg will sizzle and possibly pop. Once the egg goes in the oil, sprinkle the yolk with kosher salt and start spooning the surrounding oil on top with the flat of the spatula. The white will bubble up and cover the yolk. The sides and bottom of the egg will turn golden brown around the sides and on the bottom. This whole process takes less than a minute. Lift the egg out with the spatula and let excess oil drip off. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  Keep making the eggs, one at a time. Be sure to heat the oil well before adding the next egg.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  When you’re all done, turn off the fire and eat your own egg right away.</p>
<p class="hang_bull">•  After the oil cools to room temperature, strain it and reuse it until it no longer has that clear golden color.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">MAKE THE PISTO MANCHEGO (<a href="sec48.xhtml#page154">here</a>) AND DIVVY</span> hot mounds among serving plates. Top each with a fried egg. Cut up the egg and let the yolk run into the vegetables. Alternatively, spread the Pisto Manchego in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet. Make 4 to 6 divots in the Pisto Manchego and fill each one with a raw egg. Broil until the eggs are cooked through.</p>
