<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This idea was inspired by the Italian Easter tradition of wrapping chocolate eggs in colorful paper with a surprise inside. I use a vintage wire egg basket for holding hard-boiled eggs that are wrapped in brown paper. To make hard-boiled eggs less ordinary, a pinch of seasoned salt goes into the center of a square of parchment paper, and the egg is placed on the parchment with the seasoned salt. When it’s all wrapped up, the egg and seasoned salt become a portable snack that can be put in your pocket and enjoyed anytime hunger strikes.</p></div>

<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the eggs</strong> in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Set the pot over high heat and bring the water to a boil. Cook the eggs for 2 minutes, turn off the heat, and cover the pot. Let the pot sit for 5 minutes, then drain off the water and let the eggs sit until they’re cool enough to handle. Wrap the eggs with a pinch of the seasoned salt in parchment paper as described above, if you’d like. When you’re ready to feel like you are out on a picnic, unwrap the parchment, spread it out like a little place mat, peel the egg, and dip it into the salt as you eat. When you’re finished, you can wrap up the shell in the paper and toss it in the trash—easy cleanup!</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">Knowing Good Eggs</span></h1>
<p class="noindent"><em>I use a lot of chicken eggs, especially during brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. At Buvette, we go through 150 dozen—that’s 1,800—every weekend. That said, I think we know good eggs. When shopping for eggs, look for purveyors at your local farmers’ market who are raising chickens sustainably. They might cost a bit more than the ones at the supermarket, but fresh, organic eggs are not only preferable for the environment, they taste significantly better too.</em></p>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-20"/><span class="blue">Fritatta with Zucchini and Squash Blossoms</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">A frittata can be served warm or at room temperature with or without a salad. Zucchini and squash blossoms are some of my favorites, but feel free to use whatever is in season, or even leftovers like ham or cheese you may have on hand. Leftover fritatta can be made into a panini—my favorite way to enjoy it, really.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 small zucchini, ends trimmed off and discarded</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 squash blossoms</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">8 large eggs, beaten together</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">Small handful grated pecorino Romano cheese</p>
<p class="ingredient">Grilled bread, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Using a mandoline or a sharp knife, thinly slice the zucchini into rounds and set it aside.</p>
<p>Using your hands, remove and discard the stems from the squash blossoms, tear the blossoms into big pieces, and set them aside.</p>
<p>Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and a tiny bit brown, 5 minutes. Season the zucchini with a pinch of salt. Turn off the heat, pour the eggs over the squash, then drizzle the eggs with an additional tablespoon or two of olive oil. Evenly lay the torn squash blossoms over the eggs and place the skillet into the oven.</p>
<p>Bake until the eggs are just set, about 10 minutes. Immediately remove the frittata from the oven and give it one final drizzle of olive oil, a grind of freshly cracked pepper, and a sprinkle of the grated cheese, and scatter over the torn basil. Cut the frittata into wedges and serve with grilled bread drizzled with olive oil.</p></div>
