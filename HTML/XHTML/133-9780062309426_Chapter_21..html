<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hampion of duck that I am, I don’t take great pleasure in saying this, but for much of history, the animal that played the most vital role in the day-to-day sustenance of the Gascon paysan was the pig. For corroboration I will turn to my three sages.</p>
<p class="indent">Weber: “If bread stood for plenty, bacon or lard was a symbol of wealth. The hog was the real patron saint of the countryside—Sent Pourquî in Gascony—a miraculous animal, every bit of which was good for something . . . and which almost everybody could afford to raise.”</p>
<p class="indent">Wolfert (echoing the bread comparison): “There is a mystical feeling about these beasts on the farms of the South-West, similar to the way bread is regarded in some other parts of France.”</p>
<p class="indent">Palay (cue the fanfare): “It is the pig, in our land, that constitutes the carnal portion of our diet. Every household feeds and fattens a <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224" title="224"/>pig or two that will, with few days excepted, provide the bacon, the ham, the sausages, the confit, the meat that appears regularly on our tables.”</p>
<p class="indent">For generations, pigs were slaughtered on the family farm, sometimes by the farmer, sometimes by an itinerant butcher. The season’s first tue-cochons, as the killings were called, awaited the arrival of cold weather, as the slaughtered animal was usually left to hang outdoors overnight before the <i>découpage</i>, the salting, and the sausage-making began.</p>
<p class="indent">Gascons’ love of charcuterie runs deep. At any worthy Gascon market, one will find a chorus line of air-cured and salted pleasures: hams, saucissons, chorizos, and more, alongside pâtés, coppas, terrines, and, most prominently, boudins, made with pig’s blood. I can remember Nadine, during one of her sentimental journeys into the past, going on at great length about the making of boudin when she was growing up. The day after the slaughter, she said—and sometimes the day of—women from several families gathered to make the wine-colored sausages, toiling over a mixture of blood, lard, and trimmings, adjusting the seasonings just so and then inviting the menfolk to taste the raw filling before it got stuffed into the casings. Gascons make incredibly good boudin.</p>
<p class="indent">While it’s not uncommon even among bourgeois Gascons to buy a whole pig from a farm—or go in on one with a neighbor—and have it brought to a <i>charcutier-traiteur</i> to be cut up and made into various delicacies, not many families in Gascony kill their own pig anymore.</p>
<p class="indent">That said, there are still a few butchers roving the Gascon countryside who will do the job.</p>
<p class="indent">I found this out when I ran into my historian friend, Alain Lagors, in town one day. He informed me excitedly that a hard freeze had been forecast.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_225" title="225"/>“What’s the bad news?” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">Lagors gave a puzzled laugh. “As you may know, the weather must be cold for a pig slaughter.”</p>
<p class="indent">In light of the weather, Lagors said, his neighbor, a traveling butcher named Jean-Pierre, had scheduled the season’s first tue-cochon for two days hence.</p>
<p class="indent">“Jean-Pierre is a piece of living history,” Lagors said. “<i>Hélas</i>, most people nowadays buy their chops and boudins from the Intermarché.”</p>
<p class="indent">The inaugural killing would take place at Jean-Pierre’s home, outside Plaisance. The pig had already been chosen. Her name was Mimi.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>JEAN-PIERRE’S HOUSE AND THOSE AROUND</small> it were of recent construction, located in one of several small tracts that had sprouted from the flat expanse of farmland between Plaisance and Préchac. The neighborhood had a vaguely suburban feel that seemed unsuited to the business of pig slaughtering, and I said so to Lagors as we pulled into Jean-Pierre’s driveway.</p>
<p class="indent">Lagors said that the neighbors complained only rarely. “Usually when it’s a squealer.”</p>
<p class="indent">Jean-Pierre hadn’t returned yet from collecting the condemned animal from a nearby farm, so Lagors and I loitered in the house’s small yard, which was enclosed by hedges. A cauldron of water had been set over a wood fire. On the grass next to that sat a crudely fashioned wood trough that reminded me of a pauper’s coffin. A folding table covered with a plastic sheet stood against one of the hedges.</p>
<p class="indent">Lagors, who’d never met a silence he couldn’t fill with a history lesson, began talking—prompted by what, I don’t know—about <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226" title="226"/>how officers of Lord Wellington were said to have begun the tradition of fox hunting outside Pau, the capital of the Béarn, after passing through the region during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p class="indent">Before Lagors could delve too deeply into the subject, a mud-spattered hatchback pulled into the driveway and came to a stop a few feet from us. It was hauling an open-topped, metal-sided trailer. In it sat an enormous pink sow, also mud-spattered. A bald, ruddy-faced man got out of the driver’s seat. He had the potbelly of a bon vivant. This was Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p class="indent">He bounded toward me and squeezed my hand hard. Like Basso, he had the permanent half-smile and deep crow’s-feet of an inveterate joke-cracker.</p>
<p class="indent">Jean-Pierre led me over to the trailer. “Meet Mimi!”</p>
<p class="indent">He leaned over and gave the pig a slap. “Sorry, girl! We couldn’t find a priest for the last rites!”</p>
<p class="indent">Two more men arrived in a second car. One was young and skinny and the other was old and round; the latter had a toothpick in the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p class="indent">On the way over, Lagors had explained that a traditional tue-cochon was at minimum a five-man operation: four men to hold each of the pig’s legs, and a fifth to wield the knife. Today’s killing, however, would be done the “modern” way, with four men and a tractor. Presently, said tractor rumbled up the drive. It was an old John Deere with a forklift attachment on the front and a buzz-cut Gascon named Olivier at the wheel.</p>
<p class="indent">Mimi’s executioners were now assembled.</p>
<p class="indent">The men got to work with barely a word. They had obviously performed this ritual together many times before. Jean-Pierre flipped down the gate of the trailer and tied a rope around each of the sow’s front hooves while the skinny fellow tied another around its snout. Mimi obstinately laid herself down. Jean-Pierre and his two help<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227" title="227"/>ers began pulling mightily on the ropes while Olivier shoved the animal from behind. There was much grunting from the men but not a sound from Mimi. She refused to budge.</p>
<p class="indent">At that moment, I noticed a man in city clothes walking up the driveway. I guessed it was a neighbor coming to complain preemptively. But the man strode up and shook Jean-Pierre’s hand—I recognized the newcomer as the village pharmacist. “I was afraid I’d missed it!” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">“You’re cutting it close!” said Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually, the men cajoled Mimi out of the trailer and with continued yanking and shoving moved her into the yard. The tractor’s front wheel had been positioned over a thick wood plank. The men situated the sow in front of the plank, and Jean-Pierre tied ropes around her hind legs and secured the other end of the ropes to the tines of the tractor’s forklift. He gave Olivier a thumbs-up, and, with the two other men holding her front legs steady, Mimi was slowly hoisted into the air, hind end first, until her head was a foot above the ground. Jean-Pierre took the rope attached to the animal’s snout, looped it through an eyelet screwed into the plank, and pulled it taut. Mimi was fixed in her death pose—a pig in mid–swan dive.</p>
<p class="indent">Something compelled me to study Mimi’s face. I suppose it’s the mark of a city dweller to seek signs of emotion in a farm animal’s countenance, but that being so, I could find none. Her eyes were unblinking and blank. I couldn’t tell if she was frozen in fear or merely indifferent.</p>
<p class="indent">Jean-Pierre noticed me gazing at the sow. “Don’t worry,” he said, “this one won’t squeal.”</p>
<p class="indent">He got down on one knee and placed a plastic bucket in front of the pig. “You’re a brave one, aren’t you, Mimi?”</p>
<p class="indent">In his right hand Jean-Pierre held a thin-bladed, wood-handled knife, the kind my mom uses for slicing cucumbers and carrots. <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228" title="228"/>Without further ado, he plunged the blade into the middle of the pig’s throat and made a swift upward cut. Blood thundered into the bucket with shocking force. Mimi jerked faintly and emitted a gurgling sound.</p>
<p class="indent">When the flow had slowed to a trickle, Jean-Pierre stuck his hand into the bucket, the contents of which looked for all the world like raspberry purée, and swished the froth around vigorously to prevent the blood from coagulating. When his hand emerged, it was painted crimson to the wrist.</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s going to make some fine boudin,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">Olivier maneuvered the deceased pig into the wood trough. Then the men poured buckets of scalding water, retrieved from the cauldron, over the carcass, filling the air with the scent of boiled pig. With impressive speed and vigor, they scraped off the animal’s hair using wallet-size squares of metal that, according to Lagors, had once belonged to the blade of a scythe. The hair came off in wet tufts.</p>
<p class="indent">Jean-Pierre had one rubber-booted foot inside the trough, the other on the ground. “The Basques use old sardine cans,” he said, smiling at me and Lagors over his shoulder, his hands flying back and forth across the carcass. “But we Gascons are more high-tech.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now Olivier raised the pig again, and Jean-Pierre removed the hard-to-reach pockets of hair using a propane torch, adding an acrid edge to the air’s perfume.</p>
<p class="indent">The gutting began. With the pig hanging upside down in front of him, Jean-Pierre made an incision down the center of the belly from tail to head. The abdomen opened like a curtain, the sow’s bulging, pinkish-gray entrails flopping out and releasing tendrils of steam into the cold air. Jean-Pierre removed the intestines to a bucket. Then out came the stomach, the liver, the heart, and the lungs. Each went into its own bucket. The older man, toothpick <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229" title="229"/>still in his teeth, carried the entrails and stomach over to the plastic-covered table and began cleaning them—a fragrant task I preferred to witness from afar.</p>
<p class="indent">The innards removed, Jean-Pierre used a bow saw to halve the pig lengthwise right down the spinal column, finishing the job by splitting the skull and hard palate with three tremendous whacks from an enormous cleaver. Now the two sides of the animal hung from the forklift tines, rib cage exposed to the air, each half a picture of the pork cuts to be.</p>
<p class="indent">After inserting an iron hook between the bones of each hind leg, right above the hoof, Jean-Pierre wrapped his arms around one of the carcass halves and shouted at Olivier to unloop the rope from the forklift tine. Then Jean-Pierre performed a two-part maneuver that could only be described as balletic: As the 130-pound side of pig was released from the forklift, the brawny butcher did a plié while gripping the bottom third of the carcass, and then pirouetted deftly so that it flopped, skin side down and perfectly centered, onto his shoulder.</p>
<p class="indent">Lagors shouted “Bravo!” and clapped loudly. The pharmacist and I clapped, too. It was an unexpectedly delicate culmination to the day’s bloody work—though, in fact, there’d been just as much grace and precision to everything Jean-Pierre had done.</p>
<p class="indent">Now the carcass halves were hanging from the ceiling of the garage, where they’d rest for a spell before Jean-Pierre began breaking down the animal and making his chops and charcuterie. The boudin would get done straightaway, as would the andouille, that most fragrant of French encased meats, made from the animal’s stomach and intestines. The tender, little-worked muscles of the loin would be frozen and, later, sectioned into chops. The tougher but tastier shoulder and butt would be transformed into roasts that would eventually be larded with strips of the pig’s back fat and then <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_230" title="230"/>smartly tied in the prim French manner. More fat, from the cheeks and neck, would go into various pâtés, terrines, and rillettes. The feet would probably get cooked, pickled, and, possibly, encased in aspic. The immense upper part of the hind legs—future hams—would be salted and then hung for many months to cure. The legs’ knobby <i>jarrets</i>, or hocks, would almost surely find their way into the family’s garbures, where they would in all likelihood keep good company with pieces of the pig’s fatty belly.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, his work done, Jean-Pierre washed his hands and opened a bottle of rosé. His cheeks were red and his eyes glimmered. He poured us all a round and raised his glass.</p>
<p class="indent">“To Mimi,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">“To Mimi!” we shouted.</p>
