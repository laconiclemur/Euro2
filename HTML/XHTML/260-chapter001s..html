<p class="noindent">Walking down the street in Paris, eating a huge crêpe with lemon, butter, and sugar, is a fond food memory evocative of what the French call <em>sur le pouce</em>, “on the thumb,” the feeling of having something good in hand. In addition to being so wonderfully nostalgic, the really astounding thing about a crêpe is its versatility (see variations below). Note that the batter must rest for a few hours, so plan ahead.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES A GENEROUS PINT OF BATTER; ABOUT A DOZEN 8-INCH CRÊPES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">¾ cup unbleached all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for cooking the crêpes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1¼ cups whole milk</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In a large</strong> mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and eggs to make a paste. Whisk in the butter. Slowly whisk in the milk, being sure to take your time so that you avoid lumps. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, or transfer the batter to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days before cooking (see Recipe Note, <a href="chapter001u.xhtml#page-30">here</a>).</p>
<p>Once the batter has rested, heat up a slick of butter in a small skillet, preferably nonstick (if not, just use more butter!) over medium heat. Pour in just a little less than ¼ cup of batter. Tilt the pan in a circular motion so that the batter finds itself in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Cook the crêpe until the bottom is just golden brown, about 1½ minutes, loosen the edges with a spatula, and turn the crêpe. Cook until it’s nicely browned on the opposite side, about 1 minute more. Transfer the crêpe to a warm plate and fill it or garnish it however you’d like (some of my favorites are listed on <a href="chapter001u.xhtml#page-30">here</a>). Repeat the process until you’ve used up all of the batter.</p></div>
