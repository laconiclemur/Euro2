<p class="C3608">As you read this, eggs are being cracked all over Spain. Most of them will be whipped and flipped into tortilla Española, the iconic potato omelet that fuels the nation. Some will be fried and served over piles of potatoes and smoky chorizo. They will be deviled and poached and baked and added whole to rustic stews of every kind.</p>
<p class="C3609">In Spain, eggs are a staple at the midday meal and at dinner. Most Spanish markets still source their eggs locally, and the quality can be seen and tasted. The fresh eggs have firm whites and deeply colored yolks, and pack enough flavor to make them the star of any dish.</p>
<p class="C3609">Our favorite egg dishes here all rely on sourcing the best eggs we can find, the fresher the better. Luckily, excellent organic eggs are available at farmers’ markets everywhere, and most supermarkets now carry high-quality free-range farm eggs.</p>

<p class="C3628"><strong><span id="page_96">TORTILLA</span> ESPAÑOLA</strong></p>
<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_80">Potato</span> and Onion Omelet</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">What should a Spanish tortilla be? Chefs and cooks throughout Spain have been debating this question for centuries. Some argue it should be nothing more than oil-cooked potatoes in a thick egg omelet. Others demand onions. Some keep the center runny, others cook it hard.</p>
<p class="C3609">At Boqueria, we fall in the onion camp with almost-runny eggs. We’re also in the camp of flipping the tortilla often as it cooks to give it a better shape and color, and a more even texture throughout. The technique may seem intimidating, but it’s easy once you get the hang of it. In Spain, it’s the first dish most kids learn to make at home. If they can do it, you can do it. Once it’s done, you have a great main course. All you need to round out the meal is <a class="RED" href="05_The_Classics.xhtml#page_47">Pan con Tomate</a>, olives, bread, and a salad if you’d like. It’s great on its own, but even better with a dollop of <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#page_273">Allioli</a>.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">8</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes plus 15 minutes to cool</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong><span id="page_97">2</span>½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 8 medium), peeled and cut into</strong> ⅓<strong/><strong>-inch-thick half-moons</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>8 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 cups extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ jumbo sweet Spanish onion, peeled and cut lengthwise in half, then in half again, so you have 4 sections, then half each again so you have ½-inch-wide julienne slices</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Rinse the potato slices in cold water to remove excess starch and prevent the slices from sticking when cooking. Drain, then spread on paper towels to dry completely.</p>
<p class="C3636">Whisk the eggs in a very large bowl with a generous pinch of salt until well blended. Let stand until ready to use, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking, about 4 minutes. If you touch a potato to the oil, it should sizzle immediately. Remove the skillet from the heat and carefully add all of the potatoes. The pan will be very full.</p>
<p class="C3636">Put the pan back on the heat. Turn the heat to high, salt the potatoes very generously, and gently and carefully stir them a little to make sure they’re all submerged in the oil. When the oil comes to a boil, about 2 minutes, very carefully add the onion, gently pushing it all into the oil. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, very carefully, gently stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and a paring knife easily pierces a potato, about 15 minutes. The potatoes should be tender, but not soft and mushy. It’s okay if they brown a little, but if they start to brown too much, lower the heat to medium or medium-low.</p>
<p class="C3636">Set a large strainer over a bowl and pour the potato mixture into it. Reserve the oil for another use. Immediately transfer the hot potato mixture to the beaten eggs and gently fold until well mixed. Season with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="C3636">Wipe the skillet clean and set it over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the bottom and sides. When the oil starts to smoke, after about 30 seconds, add the egg mixture all at once. Immediately stir vigorously for about 10 seconds, then spread the egg mixture in an even layer. The edges should bubble and set immediately. When they do, reduce the heat to low. Use a silicone spatula to fold the cooked edges over the wet top around the edge of the pan, creating a ½-inch rim of cooked egg all around and setting the tortilla into a perfect round. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and center a plate larger than the diameter of the skillet over the top. Protecting your hand with a towel, grasp the handle close to the pan and place your thumb on the edge of the plate to help keep it steady; with your other hand, hold the plate tightly against the skillet, and carefully flip the plate and skillet over together. Lift off the skillet, set it back on the stove, and slide the tortilla, cooked side up, into the skillet.</p>
<p class="C3636">Set over low heat and cook for 1 minute. Repeat the flipping and cooking until the outside of the tortilla is set and the center is soft when you press it, about 3 more flips with a minute of cooking between each. The repeated flipping gives the tortilla a nicer shape and color.</p>
<p class="C3636">When the tortilla is done, flip it out onto a cutting board or serving dish. The tortilla will continue cooking in the residual heat of the eggs. Let it cool for about 15 minutes until it is at room temperature. Cut into 8 wedges and serve.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_81">Eggs</span> Baked in Sautéed Summer Vegetables</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Pisto is a ratatouille-style stew of summer vegetables from Aragon in northwest Spain. Raw eggs are often thrown right into the pot and scrambled into the vegetables, cooking instantly in the bubbling stew.</p>
<p class="C3609">Here, to preserve the freshness of the vegetables, we roast, rather than stew, the zucchini and swap out tomato sauce for chopped tomatoes. To showcase the eggs, we avoid scrambling them in and opt for letting them poach intact to runny perfection right within the saucy mixture. A dollop of spicy pimentón yogurt adds a cooling creaminess.</p>
<p class="C3637">This easy yet impressive one-pan-wonder is a crowd pleaser for dinner or brunch. Make sure to have plenty of good, crusty bread on hand to soak it up.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>

<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">35 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil, 4 tablespoons plus 4 teaspoons</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 onion, cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cubanelle pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 sprigs of thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 zucchini, trimmed and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>24 pieces roasted tomato quarters in oil, preferably Divinia, drained and coarsely chopped (¾ cup)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>8 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup labneh</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ teaspoon lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 teaspoon hot pimentón</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>chervil leaves, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Place a large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 450ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the garlic and 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep ovenproof skillet. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, just until the garlic gets a bit of color, about 2 minutes. Add the onion, peppers, and thyme. Season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, caramelized, and getting just a little color, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile, toss the zucchini with 2 tablespoons oil and a pinch of salt. Spread in a single layer on the hot pan in the oven. Roast until the bottoms are browned and the zucchini are crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to the skillet and stir well.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the tomatoes to the skillet and stir well, then remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="C3636">Make 8 wells in the vegetable mixture. Crack an egg into each and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast until the egg whites are just set and the yolks still runny, about 9 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">While the eggs cook, mix the labneh with the remaining 4 teaspoons oil and the lemon juice and pimentón. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3636">Divide the vegetables, eggs, and labneh mixture among serving dishes. Garnish with chervil and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_82">Open-</span>Faced Omelet</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">“Tortilla vaga” means “lazy tortilla.” This set-it-and-forget-it substitute for the Spanish classic swaps fresh, quick cooking ingredients for the potatoes and requires no flipping. Just spread softly scrambled eggs in a skillet and top with anything tasty, from classic bacalao or chorizo to luxurious sea urchin or truffles. This springtime version uses juicy wild mushrooms, charred green onions, and silken slivers of jamón, served with a fresh tomato salad on toasts. Letting the salted beaten eggs sit for 10–15 minutes before cooking results in creamier scrambled eggs.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>

<p class="C3632">20 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">35 minutes</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>3 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 scallions</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling and pan-frying</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 small garlic clove, very thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1½ ounces hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 sprig of thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ teaspoon lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ ounce very thinly sliced Jamón Ibérico, torn into slivers</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>Cherry Tomato Salad on Toast (recipe follows), to serve</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Crack the eggs into a bowl, generously season with salt, and beat with a fork until well-blended and foamy, about 30 seconds. Let sit for 10–15 minutes while you prepare the remaining ingredients.</p>
<p class="C3636">Trim the scallions, removing the root and about ¼ inch from the top. Cut off and reserve the white parts. Turn a gas burner to high. Set the green parts of the scallions on the grate over the open flame and cook, turning occasionally, until well-charred, about 1–2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, drizzle lightly with olive oil, and season with salt. Cut each piece into 1½-inch lengths.</p>
<p class="C3636">Coat an 8-inch nonstick skillet with oil, add the garlic, and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms in a single layer, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the thyme and cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are soft and golden, about 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat, drizzle with the lemon juice, and transfer to a plate. Discard the thyme.</p>
<p class="C3636">Lightly coat the same skillet with oil and set over low heat. (The pan should still be hot.) Add the eggs and cook, stirring lightly, until scrambled but still very wet, about 1 minute. Spread the eggs in an even layer. Quickly press the mushroom mixture and charred scallions into the eggs. Scatter the jamón on top. Cook just until the eggs are barely set, about 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="C3636">Drizzle the mixture with oil, grind black pepper on top, and sprinkle the reserved white parts of the scallions all over. Serve hot, straight out of the pan with cherry tomato salad on toasts.</p>
<p class="C3633"><strong>Cherry Tomato Salad on Toasts</strong></p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>4 cherry and Sungold tomatoes, quartered</strong></p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_83">Crisp</span> Fried Eggs with Potato Chips and Iberian Ham</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">This dish may sound simple but the finished product is transcendent. When Marc was interviewing for the Executive Chef position at Boqueria, he prepared several of his favorite dishes at a tasting. When Yann tried this dish, he knew he had found the right person for the job. It was that good, and it still is.</p>
<p class="C3609">This dish only has a few ingredients, but Marc coaxes a wide variety of temperatures, textures, and flavors from them. A piping hot just-fried farm egg sits on top of crisp housemade potato chips nestled in a rich truffled potato cream. We drape translucent slices of Jamón Ibérico over the egg to finish off the dish. Once on the table, a quick stab at the yolk sends it oozing through the chips and adds the final touch.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">35 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3638"><strong><span id="page_103">2</span> medium Yukon Gold potatoes (1 pound 2 ounces), peeled and cut into</strong> ⅛<strong/><strong>-inch-thick slices on a mandoline</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>5 cups canola oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 ounces Jamón Ibérico, sliced paper-thin and torn</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>Potato Purée (recipe follows)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Put the potato slices in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Swish the slices to lose all their starch. Removing the starch will prevent the potatoes from sticking to one another while frying. Lift the slices out of the water and into a colander. Repeat until the water is clear after swishing. Transfer the potato slices to paper towels and press until very, very dry.</p>
<p class="C3636">Fill a large, very deep skillet with the oil. It should be about 1 inch deep; if not, add more. Heat over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking, about 350–375ºF. The oil is ready when it sizzles if a potato slice is held in it. Add the potato slices one at a time until they’re all submerged in the oil. Lower the heat to medium-low. Carefully swirl the pan to move the potatoes around so they fry evenly. Don’t stir; this will cause the potatoes to break. Once the slices start to color, carefully turn them over. Once they’re evenly dark golden brown, after about 8 minutes, transfer them to paper towels to drain and salt them generously. Reserve the oil in the pan.</p>
<p class="C3636">Raise the heat under the oil to medium-high. Crack an egg into a small bowl, salt it, and slide it into the hot oil. Repeat with the remaining eggs, spacing them far apart in the skillet. Immediately spoon hot oil over the eggs as they cook. They should bubble and brown in 30 seconds. Transfer to serving dishes with a slotted spoon.</p>
<p class="C3636">Divide the potato purée among the dishes, spooning it over the eggs. Top with the jamón and potato chips and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="C3633"><strong>Potato Purée</strong></p>
<p class="C3632"><strong>Makes</strong> about 1 cup</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 medium Yukon Gold potato (7 ounces), peeled, quartered, and cut into ½-inch-thick slices</strong></p>
<p class="C3638">⅓<strong/> <strong>cup heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="C3638">⅓<strong/> <strong>cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 small sprig of rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ garlic clove, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the potatoes, cream, milk, rosemary, garlic, and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the potatoes are soft enough for a knife to pierce easily, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Discard the rosemary. Transfer everything remaining in the saucepan to a blender and process until smooth. Keep warm until serving.</p>
