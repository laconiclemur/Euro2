			<p class="Normal-noind" id="pagexvi"><span class="lead-in">richard olney</span> is a many-faceted artist—a painter of no mean ability, a writer of rather stylish prose, a cook of incredible facility gifted with one of the most sensitive palates I know. Almost greater than his sensual delight in fine food is his lusty enjoyment of wines. He is acutely critical of what he eats and drinks and sometimes intolerant, but he can defend his point of view knowledgeably and articulately.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Richard’s first book, <em class="ital">The French Menu Cookbook,</em> published four years ago, expressed his feelings about menus and French food in a highly personal manner. Those who love experimenting with good food achieved remarkable results with it. It is filled with offbeat and, to some, quite surprising dishes, and it combines balanced, imaginative menus with very individual commentary. <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> is again a markedly personal exploration of food—certainly French, but it may at first glance appear to be anything but simple.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Richard is a renowned teacher of cooking, and he has written very detailed recipes. If you’ll read them through carefully, however, you will find that very few of them are really difficult to execute, even the intricate boned oxtail, done with a delicious stuffing and braised. There are innumerable recipes for rabbit, an animal that has been greatly neglected on American tables and that makes some of the most delectable <em class="ital">ragoûts</em> and sautés imaginable. There is also a wealth of lamb in the book, using practically everything from the head to the tail.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Throughout there are suggestions about what to eat and drink with certain dishes, and brilliant introductions precede each cookery method and each chapter.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> is a greatly varied book that covers what is known as cuisine bourgeoise or cuisine simple. The dishes are not those found in posh restaurants but those one enjoys in comfortable little country restaurants, less prevalent since the Second World War, and in well-run homes where the traditions of good eating have been maintained. These are hearty, mouth-watering, beautifully seasoned dishes that inspire one to rush to the kitchen—braised dishes, smothered dishes, roasts, and grilled dishes. The meat, fish and vegetable recipes are legion and are offered in lovely combinations. The dessert chapter is almost nil, however, which attests to Richard’s honesty. He doesn’t like desserts. Why pretend?</p>
			<p class="Normal">Here, then, is a wonderful cross-section of French cookery, much of which has not appeared in published form in this country, and it thus makes a valuable supplement to the fine books produced on French cuisine in the last few years.</p>
