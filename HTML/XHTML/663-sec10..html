<p class="nonindent">Yes, it’s called Russian potato salad, but it’s distinctly Spanish. Some say it was invented by the Russians in the late nineteenth century, but you can find it in every tapas bar throughout Spain now. In fact, this salad is often used as a measure of how good a place is. If you go into a bar and try it and like it, you should order more food. If not, finish your drink, pay, and move on to the next spot. This version is one that will definitely have everyone at the table staying on for more. It’s great on its own as an appetizer or a side dish, but also delicious on toasts.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE MAYONNAISE, PROCESS THE EGG</span>, lemon juice, and salt in a food processor until smooth. With the machine running, slowly pour in the oils in a steady stream until emulsified and creamy. Refrigerate in an airtight container while you prepare the salad. The mayonnaise can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the salad, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the shell-on eggs, cook for 12 minutes, and then drain immediately. Rinse the eggs under cold water until completely chilled. Peel and cut into ½-inch chunks.</p>
<p class="indent">Put the potatoes, 3 cups water, and 1 tablespoon salt in a large saucepan. There should be enough cold water to cover the potatoes. If not, add more. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the carrots, return to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer until the potato chunks are soft and the carrots are crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes more. Drain very well, then spread out on a half-sheet pan to cool quickly.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, place the frozen peas in a small bowl and cover with hot water. (You can use a ladle of water from the saucepan.) Let stand for 5 minutes, then drain well and add to the pan with the potatoes and carrots.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When the vegetables have cooled, transfer to a large bowl, along with the piquillos, tuna, eggs, and mayonnaise. Using a silicone spatula, carefully fold until everything is well combined. Taste and add more salt if you’d like. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days. When ready to serve, let stand at room temperature for half an hour before serving to take the chill off, then fold gently again and season to taste with salt again.</p>
