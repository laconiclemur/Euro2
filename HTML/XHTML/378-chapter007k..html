<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">There’s an Italian saying, “<em>a tavola non si invecchia</em>,” which translates to “at the table you never get old.” For those planned gatherings or impromptu moments, here are five of my favorite ways to capture time and enjoy life bite by bite.</p></div>
<p class="noindent1">1. Include a silver tray with digestifs like Calvados and Fernet-Branca and cordial glasses. Let it sit on the table, tempting your guests to consider just one more. Encourage them to help themselves (after all, they will know just how much to pour).</p>
<p class="noindent1">2. Can anyone pass up just a spoonful of something sweet? Even after dessert, a tray of spoons filled with chocolate mousse (<a href="chapter007.xhtml#page-234">here</a>) or even Nutella is a lovely gesture as a thank-you.</p>
<p class="noindent1">3. All my favorite meals finish with seasonal fresh fruit. It could be cherries on ice, a basket of grapes, or slices of watermelon for your family or guests to share. When preparing a bowl of ice for fruit, place a clean cloth napkin folded under the ice. This way as the ice melts the napkin absorbs the water. Consider things like cherry pits and grape stems, and always provide plates for discarding them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">4. Ordinary things can be made elegant, like a bowl of fresh raspberries spiked with Moscato or Pineau served on special china or even in demitasse cups.</p>
<p class="noindent1">5. In the evenings at Buvette we set out leather baskets of walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts for the guests to help themselves. On special occasions I bring out vintage nutcrackers. We may add roasted chestnuts, blocks of <em>torrone</em>, and dried fruit dipped in chocolate (<a href="chapter007b.xhtml#page-238">here</a>) to end the meal too.</p>
