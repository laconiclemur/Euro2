<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Please do use butter here instead of margarine if the latter screams 1980s credit crunch to you too much. In Soviet Ukraine there was a perpetual credit crunch, so we got used to using margarine. Besides, the cheese here adds enough richness, so butter may be a slight overkill. Be careful though &#8211; whatever type of fat you use, you may not be able to stop eating these.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 20&#8211;22</strong></p>
<p class="hang">80g (3oz) margarine</p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) <a href="part0007.xhtml#pg109"><em>Syr</em></a> or Polish <em>twar&#243;g</em></p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="hang1">50g (2oz) granulated sugar</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Mix the margarine and cheese together in a bowl until well combined. Sift the flour and baking powder together and then mix it into the cheese mixture.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Knead the dough briefly, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes if you have the time.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4. Line a large baking sheet with silicone paper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Flour the work surface well and then roll the dough out into a sheet a bit less than 2mm (about &#8539; inch) thick. Stamp out 10cm (4 inch) circles with a glass or a cookie cutter, then re-roll the offcuts to make more.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Pour the sugar into a shallow plate. Now dip one side of a dough circle into the sugar, then fold the circle in half, sugar side in. Dip one side of the semicircle in sugar and again fold in half, sugar side in. Finally, dip one side of the folded semicircle in sugar and place on the lined baking sheet sugar side up. Repeat with the rest of the dough circles.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> If your kitchen is warm and the dough feels soft, chill the biscuits in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, then pop them in the oven and bake for about 30&#8211;40 minutes or until they are deep golden all over.</p>

<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Brush a frying pan lightly with the oil over a medium heat, then drop separate large tablespoonfuls of batter into the pan and cook for 2 minutes on each side.

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">These dry biscuits are beyond moreish &#8211; there is nothing better than one (or ten) of these with some coffee. Some of the ground nuts are mixed into the dough, making for a great texture and flavour. My mum normally uses walnuts, but for me there isn&#8217;t a nut to beat a pecan. You can also use pistachios &#8211; they will add an incredible colour.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes about 40</strong></p>
<p class="hang">150g (5oz) pecan nuts or walnut halves</p>
<p class="hang">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="hang">60g (2&#188;oz) caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">75g (3oz) butter, softened</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon rum (optional)</p>
<p class="hang">pinch of fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) sultanas or ready-to-eat dried apricots, chopped</p>
<p class="hang">150g (5oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang1">&#189; tablespoon milk, to glaze</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Line a baking sheet with silicone paper and set aside. Blitz half the nuts in a food processor until finely ground. Cut the rest of the nuts in half lengthways and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix the egg yolk, sugar, butter, rum (if using), blitzed nuts and salt together in a bowl, then mix in the dried fruit and flour. Knead the mixture in the bowl briefly &#8211; you should end up with a soft dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Flour your work surface lightly, divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll each piece into sausage shapes, 2.5cm (1 inch) in diameter. Flatten them slightly, then brush the tops with the milk. Arrange the reserved nuts vertically, side by side (like little soldiers), along the tops of each sausage. Push the nuts down ever so slightly to make sure they don&#8217;t fall off. Carefully transfer the sausages to the prepared baking sheet, then chill in the refrigerator for 30&#8211;60 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4. Bake the sausage shapes for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and carefully (don&#8217;t burn your fingers) slice each sausage into 10&#8211;12 pieces. Lower the oven temperature to 150&#176;C/300&#176;F/Gas Mark 2 and bake the biscotti for a further 30 minutes, then switch the oven off and leave the biscotti inside to dry and cool. They will become crispy as they cool (but not hard), buttery and nutty &#8211; an ace addition to a morning coffee.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch08sec04"><a id="page_188"></a>Napoleon cake</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is a Russian version of the French millefeuille. Some say Russians ate this to celebrate Napoleon&#8217;s demise, cutting the cake into sinister triangular pieces. Either way, it is definitely a celebratory dish &#8211; there isn&#8217;t a New Year or a birthday without this cake, and given the size of my extended family, we make two at a time. Some folk put nuts in it, but to me it&#8217;s perfect the way it is. My mum prefers it as soon as the cream has been spread over the pastry so that it&#8217;s still crispy, but I leave it in the refrigerator overnight, letting the pastry absorb all of the cr&#232;me p&#226;t. For me, the pastry is ideal scaffolding material for a giant custard tower.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 10</strong></p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Pastry</strong></p>
<p class="hang">250g (8oz) margarine, chilled in the freezer</p>
<p class="hang">550g (1lb 2oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">125ml (4fl oz) cold water</p>
<p class="hang1">1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Cr&#232;me p&#226;tissi&#232;re</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1 litre (1&#190; pints) milk</p>
<p class="hang">2 vanilla pods, slit lengthways and the seeds scraped out, pods reserved</p>
<p class="hang">7 egg yolks</p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">75g (3oz) plain flour</p>
<p class="hang1">50g (2oz) butter, cubed</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the frozen margarine in the flour in a bowl and cut it into the flour with a knife or rub in with your fingertips to make &#8216;breadcrumbs&#8217;.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix the water with the vinegar and add to the flour. Knead into a firm dough, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, but preferably overnight.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C/400&#176;F/Gas Mark 6. Flour the work surface and roll the pastry into a sausage shape. Cut into 12 pieces and roll each piece out, one by one, as thinly as you can into a 22cm (8&#189; inch) diameter disc. Pop each sheet (in turn) on to a dry baking sheet and bake for 4&#8211;5 minutes or until pale golden and puffed up in places. Watch it, as the pastry will quickly burn! When all the pastry discs are done, set them aside on a wire rack to cool. The first pastry sheet will have coloured more than the others, so once cool, crumble it and keep for decoration.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> To make the cr&#232;me p&#226;tissi&#232;re, heat the milk and the scraped vanilla seeds and pods in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and the flour in a bowl. When the milk is near boiling point, quickly tip some of it into the egg mixture, stirring it vigorously so that the eggs don&#8217;t scramble. Tip the egg mixture into the rest of the milk and cook over a medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for about 10&#8211;15 minutes or until the cream thickens to a custard-like consistency. Add the butter, a piece at a time, and stir until combined. Let it cool a little, then cover with a piece of clingfilm to stop a skin from forming and let it cool completely.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Spread the cr&#232;me p&#226;t over each pastry sheet, layering them up and popping the pastry bubbles as you go. This way, the pastry cream will fill the craters where the bubbles have popped and won&#8217;t leak out.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Sprinkle the crumbled pastry on top and place the cake in the refrigerator for the pastry to absorb the cream, or eat straight away if you are strange like my mum. The next day, I trim away the dry edges that managed to escape the cr&#232;me p&#226;tissi&#232;re&#8217;s engulfment.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">We normally boil these where I come from, but I much prefer this steamed recipe from Poltava (central Ukraine), which I started using a few years ago. These are also superb with fresh sour cherries, blackberries or apricots.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 25 dumplings</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="hang">pinch of fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">10g (&#8531;oz) fresh yeast</p>
<p class="hang">125ml (4fl oz) warm water</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; teaspoon sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling</p>
<p class="hang">225g (7&#189;oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</p>
<p class="hang">250g (8oz) small strawberries, hulled and cut into quarters</p>
<p class="hang1">maple syrup or clear honey, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Work the sugar and salt into the yeast with a fork in a bowl, helping it to dissolve, then add the warm (but not too warm) measurement water and the sunflower oil and leave for 15 minutes to let the yeast activate.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Sift the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and add it to the yeast mixture gradually, mixing with a spoon.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Dust your work surface generously and work the dough as you would pasta dough to bring it together. It should be firm and elastic.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll out each piece as thinly as you can (a bit less than 2mm/about &#8539; inch thick is perfect). Stamp out circles about 8cm (3&#188; inches) in diameter with a glass or a cookie cutter. You can re-roll the offcuts if they are not too dry and cut out more circles.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Place 2 or 3 strawberry quarters inside each dough circle. Bring both sides of the circle up and pinch them firmly together, making sure no air is left inside the dumpling.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Oil a steamer (or colander set over a saucepan of boiling water) and pop the <em>varenyky</em> inside. Cover and steam for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Drizzle with maple syrup or honey and serve immediately. Be careful though, as the strawberries inside will be piping hot.</p>

Also, these buns looked very much like the stuff we&#8217;d see in foreign films. Were there Swedish cinnamon rolls in Ingmar Bergman films? Maybe not. Were they in the incredibly popular Astred Lindgren Karlsson-on-the-Roof cartoon adaptations? The Moomins?!

<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Add the milk (make sure it&#8217;s only slightly warm, otherwise the yeast will die), sift in the flour and mix it into a soft dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Generously flour the work surface and knead the dough briefly. Make sure the surface is well floured and then roll the dough out as thinly as you can.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Brush the dough with the softened butter (I just use my hand), then evenly sprinkle over the granulated sugar, followed by the crushed nuts.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Roll up the sheet to create a long sausage, then cut it across into 15&#8211;20 pieces. Don&#8217;t worry if you have some baby ones, they&#8217;ll add to the charm.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Arrange them pretty side up in a haphazard manner in the greased cake tin. Bake for about 30&#8211;40 minutes, making sure you don&#8217;t open the oven door prematurely. The buns should be plump and golden and dangerously inviting.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">We just call this &#8216;the ice cream cake&#8217;. I think my mum found this recipe in a Soviet newspaper in the mid-1980s and she&#8217;s made it for my birthday every year without fail. Ice cream choices in the USSR were stark, but there was <em>plombir</em> (the Russians&#8217; copy of the French <strong><em>plombi&#232;re</em></strong>). It was so, so deliciously milky &#8211; in my memory it was like the best <strong><em>fior di latte</em></strong> that I have since tried in Italy, but better. They still make it, but it&#8217;s not the same. Or we are not the same. Either way, blisteringly hot meringue, cold ice cream and fragrant strawberries from our garden with a lovely eggy sponge absorbing it all is one of my brightest childhood memories.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4. Grease a 22cm (8&#189; inch) round cake tin with a removable base, or line it with baking parchment if you can be bothered.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> To make the sponge, beat the eggs and sugar together in a bowl with an electric whisk for at least 5 minutes until very thick, pale and foamy. There is no raising agent in this cake, so the amount of air you beat into it is essential. Gently fold in the flour.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pour the cake batter into the prepped tin and bake for 30&#8211;35 minutes. Let it cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely on a wire rack. Carefully slice in half horizontally.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Take the ice cream for the filling out of the freezer to soften slightly. Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites with the sugar in a large, clean bowl until stiff. Preheat your grill to high.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Now you have to move quickly. Cover the bottom layer of sponge with half the ice cream and half the strawberries, then cover with the other sponge layer and top with the remaining ice cream, followed by the remaining strawberries. Spread the meringue over and pop it under the grill. Don&#8217;t leave it unattended for a moment &#8211; it should only take 30 seconds&#8211;1 minute to turn golden brown. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Whisk the egg whites and both sugars in a large, grease-free bowl until stiff, then gently mix in the noodles and chopped nuts. Don&#8217;t be alarmed if it doesn&#8217;t look like there is enough meringue &#8211; the meringue acts as a binding agent here, so it should mostly be noodles and nuts.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Place 8 separate spoonfuls of the noodle meringue on the lined baking sheet and bake for 1 hour until golden and crisp.</p>

<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 10</strong></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place a medium metal bowl in the freezer, for making the filling later on.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4, and prep a 23cm (9 inch) round springform cake tin with a removable base by buttering it or lining it with baking parchment.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> For the sponge, beat the eggs and sugar together in a bowl with an electric whisk for at least 5 minutes until very thick, pale and foamy. Trickle in the melted butter. Sift the flour and cocoa together and then gently fold into the batter with a spatula. Try not to knock any air out of the sponge &#8211; there is no raising agent, so air is all you&#8217;ve got to help it rise.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Pour the cake batter gently into the prepared tin and bake for 25 minutes. Test it by gently touching the top with your finger &#8211; it should spring right back. Switch the oven off and leave the cake in the oven but with the door open.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Once the cake is cool, open the tin but not completely. To cut the cake into 3 equal discs, do the following: place the base of the tin on something stable and tall (like a large jar) and push the cake out by two-thirds, then slice it in half horizontally with a bread knife. Push the cake up out of the tin a little more and cut across the cake again, making sure that the next disc is the same thickness as the first. You should end up with 3 discs of the same thickness.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> To make the drizzle, heat the sugar, Cognac and measurement water in a small saucepan and boil briefly, then let it cool and drizzle over the sponges.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Next, make the filling by heating the egg yolks and measurement water in a glass bowl set over a pan of simmering water, whisking constantly until the mixture turns thick and foamy. Stir in the cocoa powder and take off the heat.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>8</strong> Take the metal bowl out of the freezer and place the softened butter in it, then beat it with an electric whisk. When it&#8217;s starting to foam, trickle in the condensed milk, then gently fold in the cooled yolk mixture.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>9</strong> To make the ganache, pop the chocolate and butter into a glass bowl and set it over a pan of simmering water. Let it melt slowly, then give it a gentle stir once it looks almost melted &#8211; don&#8217;t disturb it too much or it will go grainy.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>10</strong> Meanwhile, use the filling to sandwich the 3 sponge layers together, then spread the chocolate ganache on the top and down the sides of the cake. I like to decorate my Prague cake with a light sprinkling of edible flowers before serving &#8211; just for kicks.</p>

<p class="hang">200g (7oz) fresh sour cherries or regular cherries</p>
<p class="hang">3 tablespoons pomegranate molasses or lemon juice, if using regular cherries</p>
<p class="hang">butter, for greasing</p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) apricots, halved, stoned</p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) granulated sugar</p>
<p class="hang">1 recipe quantity of <a href="part0011.xhtml#ch08sec14">Floater Dough</a></p>
<p class="hang">1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hang1">100g (3&#189;oz) ground almonds</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Halve the cherries and remove the stones. If using regular cherries, macerate them in the pomegranate molasses or lemon juice for a couple of hours.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4, and lightly butter a 24cm (9&#189; inch) round cake tin or pie dish.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Drain the the sour cherries or the regular cherries and mix with the apricot halves and sugar.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Pinch one-fifth of the Floater Dough off and set aside. Roll the rest out into a circle 10cm (4 inches) larger than the diameter of your cake tin or dish. Place the circle inside the greased tin or dish, making sure that the dough goes up the sides as well. Cut the reserved dough into long strips for making a lattice for the top of the pie.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Brush the base of the pastry case with some of the beaten egg and sprinkle with ground almonds &#8211; this should prevent the pie going soggy when it cools. Add the fruit filling and arrange the lattice bits over the top. Brush the lattice with the remaining beaten egg and bake for 55 minutes or until it turns deep dark golden.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch08sec18"><a id="page_216"></a>Ukrainian fried pastries with black cardamom</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">These are Ukrainian &#8216;angel wing&#8217; pastry crisps. Originally, they used to be fried in lard (think of Portuguese <em>pastel de nata</em> lard pastry). I add some ground black cardamom seeds to the sugar, but feel free to use vanilla sugar instead.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 40 pastries</strong></p>
<p class="hang">250g (8oz) plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="hang">pinch of bicarbonate of soda</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) butter, cubed and chilled</p>
<p class="hang">1 egg</p>
<p class="hang">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="hang">25g (1oz) caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) soured cream</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon vodka</p>
<p class="hang">pinch of salt</p>
<p class="hang">250ml (8fl oz) sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) icing sugar, sifted</p>
<p class="hang">5 black cardamom pods, crushed and seeds extracted, then ground into a powder</p>
<p class="hang1">dulce de leche or chocolate sauce, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> To make the dough, mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together, then rub in the butter with your fingertips until well combined.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in the egg, egg yolk, sugar, vinegar, soured cream, vodka and salt, then mix well into a firm pastry dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Flour your work surface really well and divide the dough into 2 pieces. Roll one piece of dough out as thinly as you can. Slice the dough into 4cm (1&#189; inch) strips and then diagonally across so that you end up with 20 diamonds. Make a 3cm (1&#188; inch) slash in the centre of each diamond and pull one of the ends through the slash. Repeat with the second piece of dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan until very hot &#8211; be very careful with hot oil, placing it at the back of the hob if you have kids or crazy pets. Line a large plate with some kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Drop the diamonds in carefully and fry them briefly until they float to the surface. Lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain them on the kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Mix the icing sugar with the cardamom and sprinkle over the pastries. I also like to treat these as nicely as I treat churros, dipping them into dulce de leche or chocolate sauce before devouring.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch08sec19"><a id="page_219"></a>Ukrainian Easter bread</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Sometimes called <em>kulich</em> but we call it <em>paska</em> in the south, this is a slightly bonkers cousin of the Italian panettone. Don&#8217;t be put off by the mashed potato starter &#8211; it adds a beautiful texture to the bread. When my friend Emma tested the original recipe, I received an alarmed email from her that simply enquired, &#8216;Is your Aunt a professional baker?&#8217; There was so much dough and it was so alive that it exploded in her huge Magimix bowl and all over the refrigerator. Moral of the story &#8211; we make A LOT of these during Easter, which is our biggest religious holiday.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 3 x 800g (1lb 10oz) breads</strong></p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Starter</strong></p>
<p class="hang">3 potatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="hang">1 litre (1&#190; pints) cold water</p>
<p class="hang1">3 tablespoons organic plain flour</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Dough</strong></p>
<p class="hang">250ml (8fl oz) warm milk</p>
<p class="hang">15g (&#190;oz) fresh yeast or 7g (&#188;oz) dried active yeast</p>
<p class="hang">4 egg yolks, at room temperature</p>
<p class="hang">150g (5oz) caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang">1kg (2lb) plain flour</p>
<p class="hang">sunflower oil, for oiling</p>
<p class="hang1">100g (3&#189;oz) sultanas</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Glaze</strong></p>
<p class="hang">175g (6oz) icing sugar</p>
<p class="hang">2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="hang1">hundreds and thousands, to decorate (optional)</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> For the starter, place the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with the water and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 minutes or until quite soft.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Pour away all but 200ml (7fl oz) of the cooking water and mash the potatoes with the remaining liquid.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Add the flour and mix well, then cover and leave in a warm place for 12 hours.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> To make the dough, add the milk (make sure it&#8217;s warm but not hot) and the yeast to the starter and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Beat the egg yolks with the sugar in a large bowl with an electric whisk until foamy.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Fold the milk and yeast mixture into the egg mixture. Gradually sift in and mix in the flour &#8211; the dough should be firm but bouncy. Cover the dough with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for about an hour.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Moisten your hands with some sunflower oil and knead the dough for about 15 minutes. Scatter the sultanas on your work surface and knead them into the dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>8</strong> Now divide the dough into 4 pieces. Oil 3 x 800g (1lb 10oz) cleaned tomato cans and half-fill them with the dough. Leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>9</strong> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>10</strong> Place the cans on a baking sheet and bake for 40&#8211;45 minutes on the lowest shelf of the oven. Let the breads cool completely in the tins, then run a palette knife around the edges to help remove from the tins.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>11</strong> To make the glaze, whisk the icing sugar, vanilla extract and water together in a bowl, then brush over the top of the breads, letting it drip along the sides. Decorate with hundreds and thousands, if you like.</p>
