<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This salad has everything going for it: the cool greens against the warm chicken, the softness of the potatoes against the crisp chicken skin and the crunchy green beans, the richness of the chicken fat against the bite of mustard and vinegar. The perfect lunch, it is a dish I could happily eat every single day—it somehow feels light enough for the summer and substantial enough for the winter.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">8 small waxy potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ pound haricots verts (about 2 large handfuls), stem ends trimmed</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 large handfuls lovely salad greens (a mix of butter lettuce, endive, and watercress is nice)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup Vinaigrette (<a href="chapter008.xhtml#page-258v">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small Roast Chicken (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-202">here</a>), still warm</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 radishes, thinly sliced</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the potatoes</strong> in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and add a spoonful of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the potatoes from the cooking water and set them aside to cool; keep the cooking water at a boil. When cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes, break them in half, and set them aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, add the haricots verts to the cooking water and cook until they are just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the haricots verts and transfer to a plate or bowl to cool.</p>
<p>Arrange the greens on a large platter and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Whisk together the vinaigrette and the mustards and drizzle the greens with one-third of the dressing. Toss the potatoes and the green beans with another third of the dressing and lay them on top of the dressed greens. Tear all of the meat and skin from the chicken in large-ish pieces and scatter over the vegetables. Drizzle the whole thing with the remaining dressing, scatter the radishes over the top, and serve immediately.</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><em>I like to leave a stack of plates and a pile of folded napkins and a handful of silverware in the middle of the table and let everyone help themselves and one another. It’s fun and informal, it lets your guests feel helpful, and it allows you to steal a few extra minutes in the kitchen.</em></p>
