			<p class="QuotePara">“As you may know, nothing gets me more excited than perfectly cooked meat. The magical smells of a fatty rib eye hitting the grill, or the hours of magical aromas produced by the slow smoking of a pork shoulder are what I live for, not only as a chef but what I crave as an eater. I mean, don’t get me wrong, vegetables are great, and who could pass up perfectly cooked seafood, but nothing cures a man’s primal cravings much like meat!”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 2  </span>I created this dish for my uncle George, who came in for dinner one night back when I was a chef at BLT Prime. I served it to him as a midcourse, and didn’t think to tell him that the salt bricks weren’t supposed to be eaten—something Uncle George realized after one unsuccessful attempt to cut into the bricks. We serve our Wagyu beef with a béarnaise vinaigrette, and if you happen to have any of it left over, it is just amazing drizzled over grilled asparagus. Just be sure to not eat the salt bricks.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Figs and prosciutto are a natural pairing, playing off of each other’s contrasting flavors. Here, we decided to stuff the figs with this amazing pecorino from Bob Marcelli’s family farm in Abruzzo, Italy. When most people think about pecorino, they think of pecorino Romano, which is a drier sheep’s-milk cheese with a high salt content. Pecorino, however, is just an indication that the cheese is made with sheep’s milk and can be either hard, soft, or in between. Marcelli’s pecorino is a unique cheese: soft, runny, and unabashedly stinky. It’s one of the best cheeses I’ve ever had and I recommend that everyone try to find it. However, if you can’t find Marcelli’s cheeses, particularly this one, find another sheep’s-milk cheese that is soft enough to be scooped with a spoon.</p>

Refrigerate the skewers, covered, for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Brush the figs with olive oil and grill on medium heat for 3 minutes on each side or until the prosciutto is crispy.

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Thoroughly pat the ribs dry and season them liberally with salt. Refrigerate the ribs, uncovered, overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Let the ribs sit at room temperature for 40 minutes before cooking. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Make a bouquet garni: place 8 sprigs of the thyme, the rosemary, celery, and 2 fresh or 1 dried bay leaf on the overlapping pieces of bacon and wrap the bacon around. Using a piece of kitchen twine, tie the bouquet garni tightly and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Add enough oil to a large ovenproof heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven to cover the bottom of the pot and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the ribs, and reduce the heat to medium-high. Brown the ribs on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add the butter and halved garlic heads and cook until the butter browns. Transfer the ribs to a platter and set aside. Remove half of the butter from the pot and discard. Return the pot to the stovetop and add the bouquet garni. Cook for 1 minute, until the bacon begins to brown. Add the garlic cloves, shallots, carrots, onions, and peppercorns to the pot and cook until the vegetables brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine, and 3 cups of port. Cook until the mixture has reduced by one-third. Return the ribs to the pot, add the veal and chicken stocks, and bring to a simmer. Place a piece of parchment paper over the pot, and cover tightly with a lid. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for about 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page230"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>While the ribs cook, make the port reduction. In a medium pot set over medium heat, combine the remaining 3 cups of port, sugar, a pinch of black pepper (4 to 5 turns on your pepper mill), and salt to taste. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until it reduces by half, and the reduction thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Remove the ribs from the Dutch oven to a plate. Strain the remaining sauce using a fine-mesh strainer into a pot. Bring to a boil and turn down to a simmer, skimming off any fat. Add the port reduction. Return the ribs to the Dutch oven and pour the sauce over the ribs (if you have the time, let them sit overnight if not, they can be served immediately with the bay leaves on top of the meat).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>If cooling the ribs overnight, about 1 hour and 15 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the ribs and their sauce in an ovenproof dish, place the bay leaves on top, and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Cover to dish and warm the ribs in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Uncover and cook for 30 minutes more or until the meat is soft and warmed through.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Brussels Sprouts</h2>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Berries aren’t exactly the first things that come to mind when you think of steak, but that is exactly what happened here. A little while back, I got some wild huckleberries from our mushroom purveyor, Mushrooms &amp; More, and when I tasted them, they reminded me of bordelaise, which is my favorite sauce for a steak. So, I wanted to do something that would incorporate the berries with the steak, but still retain their natural sweetness and texture. And from there, the dish just kind of shaped itself and grew organically as I kept tasting, and tasting, and building around it.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">At the restaurant, we halve the steak lengthwise and sprinkle a little <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#Activa">Activa</a> over one of the halves, like a confectioners’ sugar dusting. We place the other steak half on top and the Activa essentially binds the two slices of steak together, making for a dramatic restaurant presentation. If you want to keep things simple at home, just follow the recipe below, but if you want to re-create the restaurant presentation, try our method with Activa and simply adjust the cooking time.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a saucepot set over medium heat, warm the olive oil and garlic until the oil reaches 275ºF. Cook until the garlic is soft and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the garlic, reserving the oil. (The reserved oil will be great when you are making garlic bread, so be sure to save it. It will keep for 2 weeks.) Transfer the garlic to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the butter, parsley, and salt, and mix on medium speed until the garlic is well incorporated. Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Port-Wine Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Add enough oil to a large nonreactive stockpot to cover the bottom of the pot and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the shallots, mushrooms, and pepper, and reduce the heat to medium. Sweat the vegetables until brown bits (a <span class="ital">fond</span>) form on the bottom of the pan, and add the sugar. Add the wine and port, and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Simmer the liquid until it has reduced to about 3 cups. Add the stock and cook until the liquid has reduced to 3 cups. Be sure to skim any impurities that float to the surface. Transfer the liquid to a bain marie or a nonreactive container. Add the thyme and bay leaves, and wrap the top tightly in plastic wrap. Let the reduction infuse for 1 hour. The accumulated moisture that will gather on the inside of the plastic wrap will look like it is raining. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan and set aside. When ready to serve, warm the Port-Wine Reduction until simmering. Right before serving, stir in the huckleberries and cook them in the reduction for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Potato Mille-Feuille</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Preheat the oven to 425ºF; position the rack in the middle. Generously butter a half-size hotel pan (12¾ x 10½ x 4 inches) or a 2-quart ovenproof dish with the butter.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan, add the garlic, and set it over high heat. Once the garlic starts to turn brown, reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the savory, parsley, and rosemary, and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the stocks, raise the heat to high, and bring the liquid to a boil. Remove the garlic-herb stock from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Layer the potato slices in the greased hotel pan in a single layer, overlapping slightly. Sprinkle them with some blue cheese and ladle some of the garlic-herb stock over. Make sure that when you ladle the stock, you get the garlic and herbs, not just the liquid. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat until you run out of potatoes or reach the top of the pan. Place the thyme and bay leaves on top and finish with some more of the garlic-herb stock. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350ºF and remove the foil from the pan. Bake for 1 hour or until the potatoes feel tender when pierced with a paring knife. Transfer the pan onto a baking pan or a heatproof tray. Place a piece of parchment paper on top and place another hotel pan over the potatoes. Place a weight in the top hotel pan (a can of beans will do). Refrigerate overnight. To release the mille-feuille, run a knife around the perimeter of the potatoes. Place the hotel pan over low heat to loosen the juices. Invert the potatoes onto a carving board with a blood groove, reserving the cooking liquid. Cut the potatoes into pieces of the desired size.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Place a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before the pan begins to smoke, add the pieces of <span class="ital">mille-feuille </span>cut side down and sear for 30 to 45 seconds, until lightly browned. Repeat on all cut sides.</p>

			<p class="method-single" id="page236"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Thoroughly pat the meat dry. Season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add half of the steaks to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook the meat, without moving it, for about 4 minutes. Check the bottom to see if the steaks are charred to your liking, and if they are, transfer the steaks to a plate or a cutting board, and let them rest while you repeat the same process with the remaining steaks. Let the second batch of steaks rest 5 minutes before placing all 4 steaks onto a shallow roasting sheet, charred side up, and placing everything in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the steaks back to the cutting board and return the pan to the stovetop. Working in 2 batches, flip the steaks back onto the seared side. Add half of: the butter, thyme, and garlic and raise the heat to high. Baste the steaks with the butter for 1 to 2 minutes. If the butter starts to burn, reduce the heat and add a splash of oil to the pan to lower the overall temperature. Transfer the steaks to a carving board. Repeat with the remaining steaks, butter, thyme, and garlic. Let the steaks rest for at least 7 minutes before serving. While the steaks rest, warm up the Potato Mille-Feuille. Reserve the butter from the pan in which you cooked the steaks—you will need it when you assemble the dish.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Sautéed Greens</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>While the potatoes are reheating, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic and set over high heat. Turn the heat down to medium. When the garlic begins to brown, immediately add the spinach. Very important: Watch the pan here and rely on your sense of smell to tell you when the garlic is ready to come off the heat. Garlic goes from perfectly cooked to burnt in a matter of seconds, so be ready with the spinach in your hand. Cook, stirring, until the spinach is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with the nutmeg and salt to taste. Remove from the heat.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Cooking <span class="smallcap">with </span>Fat</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Fat is not the devil everyone makes it out to be. Fat is one of the key taste components—it makes food taste good, and I enjoy cooking with it. The key is moderation. At the restaurant we save all our fat. After a couple of days, if we have enough fat, instead of making confit pork shoulder with duck fat, which is what a lot of people do, we can confit the pork in pork fat.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The meat station at the restaurant has three containers: duck fat, beef fat, and pork fat, and we cook and baste the respective meats in their own fat. Beef fat tastes good on beef, pork fat tastes good on pork, and so on.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Fat doesn’t just enhance the taste of meat, but also adds depth and flavor to eggs or potatoes, just to name a few. See <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#potatobrown">Potato Brown Butter</a> for a perfect example.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Not only do we cook with fat, but we encourage others to do the same. Which brings me to this recommendation: Save your fat, and use it in place of butter or oil to cook with whenever the mood strikes you. Not only will it make a difference in how your food tastes, but also you’ll be using every scrap of the animal without wasting a thing.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>It’s funny how sometimes a dish comes together starting with a side and then everything else—the protein, vegetable, sauce—will get built around it. This is such a case. Vichyssoise, which is a French potato-leek soup, is one of my favorite things to eat. Normally, it is served cold, but I actually enjoy it hot, which is a bit untraditional. So instead of making it as expected, I turned it into croquettes. Once I had the croquettes down, I started to think about what would go well with them, and built the rest of the dish around this side. This is one of the dishes in the book that relies pretty heavily on a digital scale and precision is very important, especially when making the croquettes. If you don’t own a digital kitchen scale already, I very much recommend one—it is a very useful and inexpensive gadget to have in the kitchen.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page238">Make the Bordelaise</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a 3-quart saucepot, warm the canola oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic, and cook until the shallots are translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the peppercorns and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the sugar and cook for 1 minute more. Add the vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until the vinegar has been absorbed. Add the wine, port, thyme, and bay leaf. Raise the heat to medium-high, and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the stocks and strain through a fine-mesh strainer.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Return the liquid to the stove over medium heat. As the liquid cooks, it will start to separate. When it does, skim off any excess fat, tilting the pot slightly to make it easier to skim. Season to taste with salt, and add more vinegar if you like.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Strain the sauce again and set it aside; you should have about 3 cups of the finished sauce, but you will only need 1 cup for this recipe. Freeze the rest for the next time you make a steak.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chestnuts</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a large skillet to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the bacon, reduce the heat to medium-low, and render the lardons until crispy, about 8 minutes. Once the bacon is crispy, add the garlic and cook until crispy. Watch it very closely—the garlic cooks very fast and goes from cooked to burnt in mere seconds. As soon as the garlic is crispy, add the chestnuts and toss to coat in the oil. Add the honey and cook until the chestnuts are caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the stock and cook until the stock has almost all cooked off. Stir in the parsley and sage. Taste and season with salt. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Vichyssoise Croquettes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Bake the potatoes for 1½ hours or until fork-tender. While the potatoes are still warm, split the potatoes and scoop out their centers. Measure out 2 pounds 3 ounces (1000 grams) of potato and push it through a food mill into a large bowl.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with leeks over medium heat and add to the potatoes. Whisk in the beaten egg and set the potato mixture aside in a warm place.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Make the pâte à choux: In a 4-quart pot, melt the remaining butter with 2 teaspoons of water over medium-high heat. Stir in the flour, and reduce the heat to medium. Keep stirring vigorously. The batter will eventually come together in a ball, but that doesn’t mean it is done. You must cook out the flour by stirring every 10 seconds for about 3 minutes. You want to cook out the flour from the pâte so your batter isn’t grainy. If the edges start to brown, lower the heat a bit and continue to stir. Once done, transfer the batter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium speed, add the 5 eggs, one at a time, waiting until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next, and, finally, add the salt.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Weigh the potato mixture and weigh the pâte à choux. Measure it out so you have a 2-to-1 ratio of potato to pâte. It is more precise if you work in grams. Transfer both to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed for 15 seconds or until just combined—do not overwork the mixture. Lightly flour your hands and roll the mixture into golf ball–size croquettes. You should wind up with 15 to 20 croquettes. Transfer the croquettes to a floured tray and refrigerate until needed.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>When ready to serve, add the oil to a 4-quart saucepot, and heat over medium-high heat until the oil registers 300ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Gently add 12 croquettes to the hot oil, and fry until crispy and golden on the outside, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the croquettes to a paper towel–lined tray and season with salt.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Rib Eye</h2>
			
			<p class="method" id="page239"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Thoroughly pat the meat dry. Season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add half of the steaks to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook the meat, without moving it, for about 4 minutes. Check the bottom to see if the steaks are charred to your liking, and if they are, transfer the steaks to a plate or a cutting board, and let them rest while you repeat the same process with the remaining steaks. Be sure to let the second batch of steaks rest 5 minutes before placing all 4 steaks onto a shallow roasting sheet, charred side up, and placing everything in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the steaks back to the cutting board and return the pan to the stovetop. Working in 2 batches, return the steaks to the pan, seared side up. Add half of each: the butter, thyme, and garlic, and raise the heat to high. Baste the steaks with the butter for about 2 minutes. If the butter starts to burn, reduce the heat and add a splash of oil to the pan to lower the overall temperature. Transfer the steaks to a carving board. Repeat with the remaining steaks, butter, thyme, and garlic. Let steaks rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of the Chestnuts mixture with the reserved Bordelaise Sauce and warm over medium heat until heated through.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Divide the remaining chestnut mixture among 4 warmed plates, placing it in the center of each plate. Remove the strings from the steaks and place the steaks on top of the chestnuts. Spoon the warmed bordelaise around and top the steaks with Maître d’ Butter. Sprinkle some flaky sea salt over the steaks, divide the croquettes among the plates, and finish with Tahoon cress or watercress chiffonade.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitle">Making it Rain</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Take a bunch of basil and smell it—that’s one smell. Now, take a bunch of basil and boil it in water for half an hour. Smell it. Now take a bunch of basil, put it into a warm sauce, cover it with plastic, and leave it in there for 15 minutes. Unwrap it and smell it. You’ll notice that the smell of the basil cooked by the last process is not the same as the others. The last process doesn’t kill the flavor—instead, it enhances it.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Herbs are only fragrant for so long. There are stronger herbs like thyme and rosemary that might hold up better, but the reason we “make it rain” is to better extract the flavor. And you can do it with spices, cumin, coriander, basil, mint, oregano, lemon verbena—their flavors peak at a certain point, so we extract as much as we can and then get rid of the spent herbs.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 2  </span>One night, in the spring of 2011, I decided to rent a party bus for the whole staff to go check out the Pat LaFrieda meat facilities. As we were walking around, I noticed this gorgeous bone, and when I asked Pat what it was, he told me it was a Tomahawk Chop. I ordered a couple of pieces the next day, and fell in love with the cut. It’s got a perfect fat-to-meat ratio and the bones give the steak so much flavor. While the menu will change weekly and with the seasons, one of the things that always remains is the Tomahawk Chop.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chimichurri Sauce</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium bowl mix together the olive oil, parsley, cilantro, shallots, red pepper flakes, garlic, and salt. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. Right before serving, add the sherry vinegar.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Potato Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Start making the Basic Potato Puree. You will need the butter from the steak to finish it, so keep the puree warm until you cook the steak.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>While the steak is resting, whisk just enough of the reserved steak butter into the Potato Puree until the mixture is emulsified. Cover the puree and keep warm until ready to serve. Reserve the remaining steak butter for when you assemble the dish.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tomahawk</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Pat the steak dry and season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Let the steak come to room temperature before cooking.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page243"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Add enough oil to a large, ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the steak and sear for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook the steak, without moving it, for about 4 minutes. Check the bottom of the steak to see if it is charred to your liking; if it is, flip it over and cook the other side for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the steak to a baking sheet and cook in the oven for about 10 minutes for medium-rare. Return the steak to the pan over medium heat and add the butter, garlic, and thyme. Raise the heat to high and baste the steak in the butter for about 2 minutes. (If the butter starts to burn, reduce the heat, and add bit of oil to the pan to lower the overall temperature of the butter.) Transfer the steak to a plate and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. Reserve the browned steak butter in the pan. When ready to serve, slice the steak across the grain.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Grilled Vidalia Onions</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>While the steak is resting, toss the onions rings with some olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the Chimichurri Sauce, salt, and pepper. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the onions over high heat, turning occasionally, until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Alternatively, place the onions on a baking sheet and cook under a broiler set on high for 1 to 2 minutes or until the desired char is achieved. Set aside until ready to assemble the dish.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Divide the sliced steak between 2 warmed plates and sprinkle with some flaky sea salt. Spoon some of the Chimichurri Sauce on top of the steak, drizzle with the reserved steak butter, and sprinkle with smoked salt and black pepper. Serve with the Potato Puree, Grilled Vidalia Onions, and more Chimichurri Sauce on the side.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>This is a dish that actually comes together pretty quickly, and the Chimichurri Sauce is easy to throw together and can be made ahead of time; just remember to wait until serving to add the sherry vinegar. You can always follow your preferred potato puree recipe if the one here seems a bit too involved.</p>
			
			
			
			<div class="notebackground">
			<div class="notepadding">
			<p class="RecipeNotePara-plus"><span class="RecipeNoteHead-plus">+  </span>The reason you add vinegar to the chimichurri at the last minute is because the vinegar, if allowed to rest too long, will ruin the bright green color of the sauce.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tomato Conserve</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small skillet, toast the coriander seeds over low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer the toasted coriander to a mortar and pestle and crack the seeds. In a nonreactive medium saucepot, combine the toasted coriander, tomatoes, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the mixture has a syrupy consistency, about 20 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a medium nonreactive container, and fold in the Chios and mint. Cover and allow the conserve to cool to room temperature.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page248">Make the Asparagus</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Drizzle the asparagus with olive oil and toss to lightly coat. Season with salt and pepper. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the asparagus over medium-high heat for 2 minutes, turning once. Alternatively, preheat a broiler, and place the asparagus on a baking sheet. Broil the asparagus for 1 minute or until lightly charred.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Potato and Spring Onion Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Because the potatoes will finish cooking at different times, you will need to use two pots. Place the Idaho potatoes in one pot and the Yukon Golds in another. Place a garlic half in each pot. Cover the potatoes with cold water and generously salt the water—it should taste like seawater. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender. Start checking on the potatoes after 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>While the potatoes are cooking, julienne the spring onions. In a medium saucepot, combine the onions with the cream and a pinch of salt. Tie the thyme sprigs into a bundle and add to the onion-cream mixture. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the onions are soft, about 15 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the thyme. Discard the cream or reserve it to use in place of the milk for the puree. Transfer the onions to a blender, puree until smooth, and set them aside. In a small pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, remove from the heat, and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Drain the cooked potatoes, and while they are still hot, peel them, either wearing latex gloves or using two forks. If peeling with forks, hold one potato securely with a fork while pulling the skin off with the other. While the potatoes are hot, push them through a food mill into a large bowl or mash them finely with a potato masher or a fork. Using a hand (or a stand) mixer fitted with a whisk, whip the potatoes until fluffy. Work quickly: The potatoes must not get cold. Add the pureed spring onions and whisk to incorporate. Piece by piece, whisk in the butter. If the mixture starts to get stiff, add a splash of the warm milk or the reserved onion-infused cream, and continue whisking and adding in the butter until no more butter remains. You may need more warm milk than what you have on hand, depending on the size and starch content of the potatoes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into a pot. Season to taste with salt, and place a piece of buttered parchment paper over the potatoes. Keep warm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Salt-Crusted Lamb</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>While the potatoes cook, preheat the oven to 375ºF; position a rack in the middle. In a medium bowl, mix together the salts, chopped rosemary, garlic, Preserved Lemons, and egg whites. Add enough water so that the mixture resembles wet sand. Spread some of the salt crust over a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined baking sheet in a layer wide enough for the lamb to rest on, and place the rosemary and mint sprigs over the salt crust layer. Place the lamb on top, top with the thyme and bay leaves, and bury the rest of the lamb in the salt mixture, leaving the bones sticking out at the top. Wrap the bones in foil (to prevent them from burning) and transfer the lamb to the oven. Bake the lamb for 25 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 115ºF when inserted into the center of the lamb. Transfer the lamb to a cooling rack and let rest for at least 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>When ready to serve, bring the lamb tableside and use a spoon or the back of a knife to crack the salt crust and dust any excess salt off the meat. Reserve any juices that pool.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">assemble the dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Divide the lamb chops and asparagus among 4 warmed plates. Add the Lamb Jus, and drizzle the chive oil over the lamb and asparagus. Spoon some Potato and Spring Onion Puree on the side and sprinkle sorrel leaves, if using, around the plate.</p>
			<p class="RecipeFootnote" id="note2"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>The puree here is a restaurant-style potato puree. To make this faster and a bit easier at home, peel and roughly chop the potatoes, cook them in salted boiling water, and after draining them, mash them with pieces of butter and warm milk. Broil the asparagus and make the lamb. Skip the chive oil and use your best extra-virgin olive oil to finish the plate. It will still taste absolutely delicious and is a perfect weeknight dinner option.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitle">Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Pat LaFrieda</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">For me, working with Pat LaFrieda goes beyond a mere business relationship. He and his company proved to be a lifeline when my restaurant was struggling financially and we owed some purveyors—including him—a lot of money. But instead of pulling his business, Pat stuck with us and patiently waited for us to pay our debts. I don’t think I can ever properly express my gratitude to Pat for going beyond the “it’s not personal—it’s business” practice and treating me and my staff with so much consideration. I’ll always, always be grateful.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">On any given day, Pat’s company deals with hundreds of restaurants and makes more than eight hundred deliveries. LaFrieda works with hundreds of farms across the country, selecting only those farms that have the highest standards in raising and slaughtering animals. Most of their beef and pork is harvested out of one facility using the Temple Grandin method, which has shown to cause animals the least amount of distress before slaughter.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The original LaFrieda meat business got its start in Italy in the late 1800s with Pat LaFrieda’s great-grandfather. As a kid, he learned the trade in Naples, and then in 1906 brought his wife and children to the United States and opened up retail butcher shops in Queens and Brooklyn. In the 1920s, one of his sons started a restaurant supply company, which became LaFrieda Meats, which, eventually, was passed on to his younger brother, Pat, who was Pat LaFrieda Jr.’s grandfather, then to Pat’s father, and then to Pat himself, making Pat the third generation of Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The meat industry is not glamorous: the hours, the temperature in the meat lockers—it’s a tough environment, and Pat’s father was hoping his son would finally get to leave the meat business and pursue an easier lifestyle. Starting at the age of ten and all through high school, Pat helped his father at work on weekends. His father would take him to a slaughterhouse, which was his way of trying to scare Pat out of the business. And it worked to a point, but at the same time, it appealed to Pat. “My family was in the business of supplying good meat to restaurants—there’s no downside to our trade.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Pat went on to prep schools and then to college, and then on to Wall Street where he was a stockbroker. He thought he’d love it, but instead he found himself hating every single minute. He missed being cold in the meat lockers and he hated the corporate culture of banking. So Pat left the job he hated and returned to the family trade. He was well prepared for what awaited him. In college, he had joined the Army Reserves, where he learned a strong work ethic. He knew he could handle the late hours, how to beat sleep deprivation and work all night. At first, Pat’s father resisted it, but eventually gave in and allowed Pat to come on board full-time. And since Pat has been growing the company business at a steady 15 percent per year, his father is far from complaining. In fact, he’s probably glad things worked out the way they did.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lamb Belly</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Rub The Cure all over the lamb belly. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 3 hours. Rinse the belly under cold water and pat dry. Gently pound the belly and sprinkle the flesh side with the Activa. In a small bowl, combine the parsley, rosemary, garlic, and peppercorns, and rub the mixture all over the flesh side of the belly. Make a roll with the belly so that the flesh side is on the inside and, using kitchen twine, tie firmly to secure. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours so that the Activa sets.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page252"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Cooking Instructions</span> (see <a href="#step3">step 3</a> for Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions): Fill an immersion circulator with water and preheat to 180ºF. Place the lamb belly in a vacuum-seal bag, seal the bag, and poach the belly for 8 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="step3"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions</span>: Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the lamb belly in a Dutch oven, add the rosemary, and cover completely with olive oil. Cook the lamb belly for 3 hours or until the meat is tender.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>When the lamb belly is cooked, remove from either the immersion circulator or the oven, and let cool until the meat is warm to the touch. Slice the lamb belly into ¾-inch-thick slices.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>When ready to serve, set up a breading station. Place the flour in a tray and season with salt and pepper. In another tray, lightly beat the milk and eggs together until combined. Place the bread crumbs in a third tray and season to taste with salt. Dredge the lamb belly slices in the seasoned flour, then in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, and, finally, in the bread crumbs.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Add enough canola oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set over medium heat. Warm the oil until it shimmers. Add the breaded belly slices and fry until lightly toasted on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the slices to a parchment paper–lined tray.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Black Olive Salt</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>While the Activa sets the lamb belly, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Lay the olives out on a shallow, parchment paper–lined baking pan, transfer to the oven, turn the oven off, and leave overnight. In the morning, your olives should be toasted and dried out.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Transfer the olives to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse until the olives resemble the texture of coarse sea salt. Transfer the ground olives back to the baking pan and let sit, in a dry place, for 2 hours. Set aside until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Merguez</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>While the Activa sets the lamb belly, in a large nonreactive bowl, combine the diced lamb belly, harissa, olive oil, and garlic. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, using the small die on the meat grinder, grind the mixture. Season the meat with the kosher and pink salts and form a small patty. (If you don’t have a meat grinder, ask your butcher to grind the meat. Combine the ground meat with the harissa, olive oil, and minced garlic clove, and cover and refrigerate overnight. Season with the salts the following day.)</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Add enough canola oil to a small sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the patty and cook until it is well browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste the patty and adjust the seasonings, if necessary, in the remaining merguez mixture. If necessary, repeat the test-patty cooking process. When your seasonings are where you want them, refrigerate the meat until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Feta Balls</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a medium bowl, bloom the gelatin in ice water for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, place the feta cheese and feta liquid in a blender and blend on high until smooth. Add the methylcellulose to the blender and blend until combined.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum" id="page253">12.	</span>Remove the gelatin sheets from the ice water and wring out all of the excess moisture. Place the gelatin in a bowl set on top of a pot of simmering water until the gelatin is completely melted, about 2 minutes. Add the melted gelatin to the blender and blend on high until combined.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl and freeze for 1 hour.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span>Using your hands, form the mixture into small, golf ball–size balls (about 45 grams each), and wrap each feta ball tightly in plastic wrap; keep frozen until needed. When ready to serve, bring a pot of water to a boil and gently slide the feta balls into the boiling water, still in the plastic wrap, and cook for about 2 minutes.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Orzo Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">15.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. In a large bowl, toss the orzo with just enough olive oil to coat and spread it out in an even layer on a shallow baking tray. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted. This is a very important step: The orzo needs to be toasted.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">16.	</span>While the orzo is toasting, in a 4-quart pot, bring the stock and bay leaf to a boil and season with salt. Add the toasted orzo to the stock, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until orzo is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the orzo, toss with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil to prevent sticking, and lay it out in a flat layer on parchment paper. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">17.	</span>When ready to serve, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the Merguez mixture in one large “patty” and cook until the edges begin to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Be vigilant: The spices in harissa will burn if you do not pay attention. Once the merguez has slightly browned on the bottom, break the sausage up into smaller pieces. Once all of the meat is browned, add the toasted orzo and toss the mixture together. Add the sherry vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the Oven-Dried Tomatoes and Lemon Confit peel. Just before serving, transfer the salad to a large bowl and fold in the olives, dandelion greens, and parsley.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lamb loin</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">18.	</span>About 30 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the lamb loin and sear for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the bottom is browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the butter, thyme, and garlic to the pan and baste for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">19. </span>Transfer the lamb to a roasting pan with a rack and pour about two-thirds of the rendered lamb fat over the meat (reserve the remaining fat). Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into the center of the lamb registers 115ºF. Transfer the lamb to a carving board and let the meat rest for 15 minutes before slicing.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">20.	</span>Slice and arrange the lamb loin on 4 warm plates. Divide the Orzo Salad among the plates. Unwrap the Feta Balls, place them on top of the Orzo Salad, and drizzle with olive oil. Finish with the Lamb Belly and Black Olive Salt.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>When we first opened the restaurant, we didn’t have an immersion circulator for the first five months. We simply couldn’t afford anything extra. The absence of the immersion circulator would suggest that sous-vide cooking was out of our reach, but we didn’t let it derail us. We simply made our own, makeshift immersion circulator by poaching the meat in a reliable bag in softly simmering water and keeping a constant eye on the thermometer, adding cubes of ice to the water whenever the temperature would start to climb. And it worked out fine. The tenderloin in this recipe needs to be cooked sous-vide to set, so if, like most people, you don’t own an immersion circulator, the makeshift sous-vide method will work very well for you here. This is our signature meat course for the tasting menu. It started off with the sausage being stuffed inside the tenderloin, which is a pretty classic move. But I wanted to try something different: We were making our own breakfast sausage—and it had no casing. The first time we did it, in the winter of 2011, we used water instead of blood, but like the version with the blood better, so this is the version we offer here. While this isn’t traditional boudin noir, we liked our creation so much, we decided to keep it.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Mustard Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>While the Tenderloins cook, in a 3-quart saucepot, warm the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the veal scraps and cook until nicely browned, 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic, and cook until the shallots are translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the peppercorns and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the sugar and cook 1 more minute. Add the vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Cook until the pan is dry, and add the wine, port, thyme, and bay leaf. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook until the liquid has reduced by about half, about 20 minutes. Add the stocks and cook until the liquid has reduced to about 2 cups and has the consistency of syrup. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, return the reduction to the stove over medium heat, and skim off any excess fat, tilting the pot slightly to make it easier to skim. Season to taste with salt, and taste for balance—you may want to add a bit more vinegar depending on your preferences. Strain the sauce again and set aside. You will have about 3 cups of sauce; you need 1 cup of sauce for this recipe. The rest can be frozen and used another time you make the dish, or served with another meat dish.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>When ready to serve, warm the reduction over medium heat, and whisk in the 2 tablespoons of butter until emulsified. Stir in the mustard until fully incorporated. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pearl Onions</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>While the Mustard Reduction is cooking, add the onions to a nonreactive bowl.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a nonreactive saucepot, combine the vinegar, pepper, salt, sugar, and bay leaf with ¼ cup of water, and bring to a boil. Pour the marinade over the onions, and let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Fingerling Potatoes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes, 4 sprigs of the thyme, and 2 fresh or 1 dried bay leaves, and cook at an active simmer over medium heat until the potatoes are fork-tender. Strain, and while the potatoes are hot, peel the potatoes using a paring knife (you may need to wear latex gloves).</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page257"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Transfer the potatoes to a large skillet, add the butter, garlic, and Blended Oil, and raise the heat to medium-high. Once the butter begins to brown, lower the heat to medium so it does not burn, add the remaining 4 sprigs thyme, and roll the potatoes in the butter, so that they are browned all the way around. Season with salt and pepper and once the potatoes are crispy all the way around, remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tenderloins</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Using a meat grinder or a meat grinding attachment to your stand mixer, grind the pork belly and 2 peeled garlic cloves to medium grind. (Alternatively, you can ask your butcher to grind your pork and combine it with finely minced garlic at home.)</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, whip the ground pork and slowly add the blood to emulsify. Add the salt, curry, Chios, cinnamon, parsley, and Activa, if using, and mix for another 5 seconds or so, just to combine.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Trim the tails and tops off the tenderloins so that they are about the size of a cigar (you should have about 3 per tenderloin. Reserve the scraps for the Mustard Reduction; see recipe below). Place a large piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Make a 7 x 3-inch rectangle out of the blood sausage meat on the plastic wrap. Place the tenderloin pieces, with ½ inch in between, in the center, and sprinkle enough Activa, if using, to cover the meat. Roll the meat into a tight cylinder, wrap with the plastic wrap, and tie the ends tightly. Repeat with more blood sausage and the other tenderloin pieces.</p>
			<p class="method" id="page258"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Cooking Instructions</span> (see <a href="#step11">step 11</a> for Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions): Fill an immersion circulator with water and preheat to 140ºF. Place the tenderloins in 2 vacuum-seal bags, seal the bags, and poach the veal for 2 hours. Transfer the tenderloins to an ice bath and allow the meat to cool, in the bag, for at least 10 minutes or until ready to assemble the dish.</p>
			<p class="method" id="step11"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions:</span> Place the wrapped tenderloins into a resealable plastic bag and squeeze out as much air as possible. Fill a pot halfway with water and over medium heat, bring the water to 140ºF. Reduce the heat to its lowest setting, place the resealable bag in the water, and carefully watch the thermometer so that the temperature of the water remains around 140ºF. Have a bowl of ice cubes ready so that you can add them to the water when the temperature starts to go above 140ºF. Cook for about 2 hours; then transfer the bag to an ice bath and allow the meat to cool, in the bag, for at least 10 minutes or until ready to assemble the dish.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>When ready to serve, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, remove the tenderloins from the sealed bags, pat them dry, and add them to the pan, seam side down. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, 3 unpeeled garlic cloves, thyme, and rosemary. Baste the tenderloins for 2 minutes and remove from the pan. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Pour some of the pan drippings over the meat and discard the remainder.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Meat Marinade</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>While the tenderloins cook and the Mustard Reduction reduces, in a small bowl, combine the parsley, shallots, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and peppercorns. Add enough extra-virgin olive oil to cover the mixture and create a slurry. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Grilled Green Garlic</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span>Trim the garlic stalks, removing any dirt and tough outer layers. Cut the stalks into 5-inch pieces. Rinse the garlic under cold, running water and transfer to a container or a resealable plastic bag. Add the Meat Marinade and let the garlic sit at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">15.	</span>Remove the garlic from the marinade and season with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the garlic over high heat, turning occasionally, until slightly charred and cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Alternatively, place the garlic under a broiler for 1 minute or until slightly charred. Remove from the heat, cut on the bias into 1-inch pieces, and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Porcini Mushrooms</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">16.	</span>Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the mushrooms and reduce the heat to medium. Once the mushrooms begin to sear, add the butter, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf, and toss together to combine. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the butter begins to brown. Add the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Cook until the pan is dry, 5 to 8 minutes; add the stock and cook until the stock reduces and the pan is dry, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a parchment paper–lined tray and set aside in a warm place until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">17.	</span>When ready to serve, while the Tenderloins rest, return the sauté pan to the stovetop, add the butter, and over medium heat, add the Porcini Mushrooms and Fingerling Potatoes, and stir gently from time to time until warmed through. Add the Grilled Green Garlic and Pearl Onions and cook, stirring gently, until warmed through.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">18.	</span>Slice the tenderloins into 12 pieces and divide evenly among 4 warmed plates. Add the Fingerling Potatoes, Grilled Green Garlic, Pearl Onions, and Porcini Mushrooms. Stir the parsley into the Mustard Reduction and drizzle the reduction and tenderloin pan drippings around, garnish with the celery leaves, and sprinkle some flaky sea salt to finish.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">The gnocchi here are done in the Roman style, with semolina flour. Since most people don’t keep pork scraps at home, ask your butcher if he has any scraps lying around, or ask for the cheapest cut of pork—which is usually the belly or the shoulder. To slightly expedite this at home, ask your butcher to dice the meat for you.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 400ºF; position the rack in the middle. In a roasting pan set over two burners on high heat, warm enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before it starts to smoke, add the pork and wings, and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast the meat for about 20 minutes or until nicely caramelized.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page260"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Return the roasting pan to the stovetop, and over medium heat, add the carrot, celery, onion, apple, peppercorns, and salt, and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Stir in the tomato paste, and transfer the contents to a large stockpot. Add the stocks and 2 cups of water, and simmer over medium-high heat, skimming off the initial foam that forms at the surface.

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Remove the pot from the heat and add the thyme, rosemary, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Wrap the top of the pot tightly with plastic wrap and let the jus infuse for 1 hour. The moisture that will gather inside will make it look like it is raining. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer and return it to the stockpot. Return the pot to the stovetop over medium heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Skim off any excess fat that rises to the surface, remove from the heat, and set aside until ready to use.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Just before serving, warm the Pork Jus over medium heat until almost simmering.</p>

Reduce the heat to low so that the milk is gently simmering, and discard the rosemary. Whisk in the polenta and a generous pinch of salt. Cook the polenta, whisking constantly, until it is no longer grainy (instant polenta will be immediately smooth). Remove from the heat, and whisk in the Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Spray 2 Silpats or pieces of parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray and place one in a baking pan. Pour the polenta over, and smooth out the top with an offset spatula. Place the second Silpat or piece of parchment paper over the polenta, sprayed side down, and place another baking pan on top, gently pressing down to smooth out the top of the polenta. Transfer the pans to the refrigerator for about 4 hours or until set. Remove the trays from the refrigerator and invert the bottom tray onto a kitchen counter to release the polenta.</p>

Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. In a large bowl, mix together the milk and eggs. In a separate medium bowl, season the flour with 1 teaspoon of salt and some pepper. Set up a breading station. Place the seasoned flour in one tray, the milk-egg mixture in another, and the Bacon Bread Crumbs in a third tray. Dredge the chops in the flour, then the egg wash (letting the excess drip off), and finally, in the bread crumbs.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a large, ovenproof sauté pan, warm 1 inch of oil over medium-high heat until it registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Fry the pork chops until the coating is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, add enough oil to a sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the pork chops and cook until the coating is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Transfer the pork chops to the oven and bake for 8 minutes or until the internal temperature of the meat registers between 125ºF and 130ºF on a meat thermometer. Set aside to cool.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Smoked Potato Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Because the potatoes will be done cooking at different times, you will need to cook them separately. Place the Idaho potatoes in one pot and the Yukon Golds in another. Divide the garlic halves and thyme sprigs between the pots. Cover the potatoes with cold water and add a pinch of salt to each pot. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender. Start checking on the potatoes after about 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>While the potatoes are cooking, place the Smoked Onion and cream in a medium pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the onion is soft, about 7 minutes, stirring from time to time to prevent the cream from burning on the bottom. Strain the mixture; discard the cream or reserve it for another use. Transfer the onion to a blender, puree it until smooth, and set aside. Place the milk in a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Drain the potatoes, and while hot, carefully peel them using either latex gloves or two forks. If using forks, hold a potato with one fork while pulling the skin off with the other. While the potatoes are hot, push them through a food mill into a large bowl. Add the pureed Smoked Onion to the potatoes and whisk everything together until thoroughly combined. Piece by piece, whisk in the butter. If the mixture starts to get stiff, add a splash of the warm milk, and continue whisking and adding in the butter until no more butter remains. You may need more warm milk than what you have on hand, depending on the size and the starch content of the potatoes.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into a pot. Season to taste with salt. Place a piece of buttered parchment paper on top of the puree, and keep warm. (You may want to finish cooking the pork chops at this point.) Right before serving, whisk in the Chlorophyll.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a medium sauté pan set over medium heat, add the butter and cook until the solids are brown and the butter smells nutty. Remove the brown butter from the heat and whisk in 1 cup of the pepquino pickling liquid, stirring until the mixture is emulsified. Return the pan to the stovetop, and over low heat, whisk in the parsley and red pepper flakes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Divide the Smoked Potato Puree among 4 warmed plates. Place a Pork Chop on top of the puree; spoon some pepquino pickles and pickling liquid on top. Scatter micro greens over (if using), and season with some smoked salt. Serve with the brown butter–pickling liquid emulsion on the side.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you’re in a bind, or want to make this for a weeknight dinner, make the pork chop by brining it for a few hours in the morning before you leave for work, and then at night, make your favorite mashed potatoes and serve with whatever pickles you have on hand.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This was one of the dishes I made for the <span class="ital">Next Iron Chef</span> season finale. When I found out that we were cooking a Thanksgiving meal, I immediately knew I was going to be doing something to honor the Native Americans who were present at the original Thanksgiving feast.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">I looked back on the previous year: a tough twelve months, both mentally and emotionally. Upon an invitation from a friend, I had started attending Native American ceremonies and they helped me to answer a lot of questions I was asking at the time. These rituals, in so many ways, put things in perspective and kept me grounded. The decision to honor Native Americans was a split-second one: I immediately remembered the advice my mom gave me when I was getting ready to leave to tape the show—“Always go with your gut.” Not only did it feel right: It felt like the only choice I had. Not only did Native Americans help the Pilgrims through the first years of life on American shores, but they also helped <span class="ital">me</span> through a difficult time in my life. In a manner, this was <span class="ital">my</span> way of showing thanks.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">So I cooked a Thanksgiving meal using the ingredients present at the very first Thanksgiving in 1621. Unlike the traditional Thanksgiving meal of today, the Pilgrims didn’t serve turkey, cranberry sauce, or mashed potatoes. Instead, they ate venison, duck, oysters, and the like.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">It was a risky move, making a truly traditional Thanksgiving meal, but I listened to my gut, and it clearly worked out for me in the end.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Stuffing</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Soak the raisins in the gin in a small bowl. Set aside while you prepare the rest of the stuffing.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Add enough olive oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set over medium-high heat. Add the bread cubes and cook until browned on all sides. Transfer the bread cubes to a large bowl and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Add 2 tablespoons of oil and the butter to the skillet. Add the mushrooms, onions, and celery root, and cook until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley, sage, and cinnamon. Transfer the mushroom-vegetable mixture to the bowl with the bread cubes and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Warm 3 tablespoons of oil in the skillet. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic is crispy, 30 seconds to 1 minute; watch the garlic carefully, as it can go from cooked to burnt very quickly. Transfer the garlic chips to a paper towel–lined tray and let cool. Combine the garlic chips with the bread cube mixture.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a small pot, bring the stock to a boil over high heat, and add it to the bread mixture as needed until the consistency is that of Thanksgiving stuffing. Drain the raisins and fold them into the stuffing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Prepare the Venison</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Pat the meat dry and butterfly the venison pieces so that each piece looks like an open book. Gently pound out each piece to ½-inch thickness. Cut the caul fat into 4 equal pieces. Lay out a piece of plastic wrap over the counter and place a piece of caul fat on top of the plastic wrap. Place a piece of the venison meat on top of the caul fat so that it looks like an open book. Spoon some of the stuffing on top of the meat, sprinkle a little Activa all over, if using, and roll each venison half into a tight sausagelike cylinder. Wrap this cylinder tightly in the plastic wrap, and twist each end to make a tight and compact roll. Repeat this with the remaining venison, caul fat, and stuffing to make a total of 4 cylinders. You should have a little bit of the stuffing left over—set it aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Place each of the rolled-up venison cylinders in a vacuum-seal bag and seal the bags. Refrigerate the meat for at least 6 hours or up to overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Cooking Instructions</span> (see <a href="#step9">step 9</a> for Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions): About 1½ hours before serving, fill an immersion circulator with water and preheat to 133ºF. Place the bags in the water and poach for 1 hour. Allow the venison to rest for about 7 minutes, remove from the bags, pat dry, and season with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add one loin and sear until well-browned on all sides, about 1 minute per side. Reduce the heat to medium, and add 2 tablespoons of butter, a sprig of rosemary, a sprig of thyme, and ½ teaspoon of the juniper berries. Baste with the infused butter for 1 minute. Transfer to a carving board and allow the meat to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Repeat with the remaining loin rolls.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="step9"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions: </span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Pat the meat dry and season with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add one venison roll, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until browned on all sides. Repeat with the remaining loins. Transfer the loins to a roasting pan, place in the oven and cook for 10 to 12 minutes. Return one loin to the sauté pan over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of butter, a sprig of rosemary, a sprig of thyme, and ½ teaspoon of the juniper berries. Baste with the infused butter for 1 minute. Transfer to a carving board and allow the meat to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Repeat with the remaining loin rolls.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page267">Make the Sage Chips</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Warm ½ inch of oil in a medium skillet to 300ºF. Add the sage leaves and fry until crispy. You will see a lot of bubbles around the leaves as they cook—when the bubbles begin to subside, the sage leaves are done. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and set aside in a dry place.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Kabocha Squash Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method" id="step111"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a large pot, combine the squash, cream, cinnamon stick, and a pinch of salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until the squash is soft and can be mashed with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and transfer the squash to a blender with ¼ cup of the cooking liquid. Add the lemon peel and puree until smooth. Pass the puree through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and keep warm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Warm the Venison Jus. Slice the venison. Divide the Kabocha Squash Puree among 4 warmed plates. Place the Venison Loins on top of the puree. Drizzle the Venison Jus around. Dot the plates with the remaining stuffing, scatter the Sage Chips around, sprinkle with flaky sea salt, and garnish with celery leaves. </p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>To make this into a more manageable, less restaurant-style meal, just cook the venison as-is (without stuffing it) and serve it with the stuffing on the side and the puree (if you like). It will taste equally delicious.</p>
