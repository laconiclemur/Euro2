<h2 class="serve"><span class="small"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Throughout Spain, shops dedicated to rotisserie chickens have the birds spinning all day, dripping their juices onto trays of roasted potatoes below. I’ve tried to re-create the effect in the oven, baking the chicken breast side down at a low temperature, then turning it right side up to brown the skin without overcooking the meat. Because the chicken roasts on a rack, its skin crisps all around and its drippings soak into the potatoes and apples—my autumnal add-in.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 whole (4-pound) chicken</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 lemon, halved, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large sweet-tart apples (12 ounces), such as Honeycrisp</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large Yukon gold potatoes (1 pound)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>10 rosemary sprigs</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 300°F.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Pat the chicken dry and place it in a bowl. Sprinkle it inside and out with 1 tablespoon salt, then season the skin with pepper. Rub just enough oil to coat the skin. Squeeze 2 tablespoons juice from a lemon half and sprinkle all over the chicken. Let stand while you prepare the apples and potatoes.</p>
<p class="indent">Cut the apples into eighths to create 1-inch-thick wedges; discard the core. Scrub the potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Toss the apples and potatoes with 2 teaspoons oil and 1½ teaspoons salt on a half-sheet pan. Spread in a single layer, leaving a space in the center for the chicken, and top with 4 rosemary sprigs. Place a rack over the mixture.</p>
<p class="indent">Stuff the chicken with the remaining lemon half and 6 rosemary sprigs. Truss tightly, then place on the rack breast side down over the empty space reserved for it. Pour the juices from the bowl all over the chicken.</p>
<p class="indent">Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 125°F, about 35 minutes. If your oven doesn’t heat evenly, be sure to rotate the pan halfway through. Remove the pan from the oven and raise the oven temperature to 450°F.</p>
<p class="indent">When the oven reaches 450°F, carefully turn the chicken breast side up. Roast until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the breast registers 150°F, about 25 minutes. If the chicken isn’t as browned as you’d like, you can change the oven setting to broil, turning the pan to evenly color.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Transfer the potatoes and apples to a serving platter. Carve the chicken and serve.</p>
