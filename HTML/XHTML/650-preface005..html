<p class="noindent"><span class="special1"><span class="gold">Whenever a guest at Buvette, my</span></span> <em>gastrothèque</em> on a tree-lined street in the West Village, asks me where I learned to cook, I almost always reply jokingly… “I haven’t.” It isn’t entirely true, of course. As a self-taught chef I have learned many things, but as a peripatetic traveler with a great sense of curiosity and adventure I know I am still a student. I will always continue learning how to cook.</p>
<p>The cooking that I love doesn’t come from any romanticized view of my upbringing (it was decidedly suburban), or from a rigorous curriculum at a culinary school (I never went), or from formal training anywhere. Rather, it comes from the relationships I have formed with others equally passionate about eating. I have listened to them and have pulled many lessons and recipes from these passing conversations. I remember Alice Waters speaking in awe of a plate of duck confit. The crispness of the skin sounded like a magic trick that I might never be able to perform in my own kitchen. I have been equally inspired by people and places that I have hungrily pursued, fork in hand, throughout my life.</p>
<p>At Buvette, the food and atmosphere have a decidedly Gallic twist. There are fresh eggs and good coffee and warm croissants served with spoonfuls of butter and sweet jam in the morning. Lunch can be a croque-monsieur just out of the oven or a salad of shredded carrots in a bright lemon dressing punctuated with pistachios and coriander. A glass of old-fashioned lemonade with bitters, or a steaming pot of tea with a plate of sugar-dusted madeleines makes for an afternoon respite. In the colder months, a large pot of cassoulet bubbles in the kitchen all night long, and a tarte Tatin waits at the end of the bar. There’s always good wine or a smart martini, stirred not shaken. Buvette is about a style of cooking and entertaining that is free from the expected, a comfortable and simple way to enjoy food and drink from sunlight to candlelight.</p>
<p>I love Buvette for its informality and diminutive style. Essentially a bar with thoughtful food, Buvette is free from all the impositions and expectations of a restaurant. It’s a neighborhood place, open all day; a place to frequent alone for a quick coffee or a long, lingering supper with friends. Buvette is about reading a newspaper in the morning or having a sparkling rosé on ice late in the afternoon. It is a place where you walk in and seat yourself or add your name in chalk to the waiting list on <a id="page-xii"/>the edge of the doorframe. At times you may sit so close to your fellow diners that you feel like you’re at one table eating together. Everything is visible and anything you might need is within arm’s reach. It’s about good music and the aroma of warm spiced wine in the winter and crates of blood oranges that are turned into glasses of juice only when you order. It’s about orderly stacks of plates and silverware folded into napkins. It’s about a convivial staff and blurred boundaries between cook, bartender, and waiter. It’s about not doing things in a new way; in fact, it’s about very old things, especially things like tradition and comfort. A customer said something to me recently that resonated: Buvette is a lot of a little.</p>
<p>Buvette is a gastrothèque, with a menu full of food that is made simply and served casually (producing superb recipes for home cooks, I might add). As they say, necessity is the mother of invention, and when you’re faced with limited space and time, you become inventive. Take oxtails, for example. I adore them, especially in a big bowl served alongside plenty of bread and wine. For something new, I take the braised oxtails off the bone and finish them with bitter chocolate, orange peel, and juniper, a touch of sherry vinegar and honey so the flavor really sings, and then serve them on a thick piece of toast. A big, bold entrée reduced to a single bite, it’s bar food that feeds my soul as a chef.</p>
<p>The road to Buvette really began when I was twenty-seven and set out from New York City to learn to cook the old-fashioned way, by knocking on kitchen doors, offering my time and attention in exchange for the chance to learn from other cooks. I did not know it back then, but I would learn to embrace a romantic version of cooking that is steeped in European tradition and culture, where understanding languages and histories is as essential to executing a recipe as knowing how to butcher and bake.</p>
<p>In November 1989, I packed a bag with only a change of clothing, a pair of clogs, a chef’s knife, a sharpening steel, an English-Italian dictionary, and a copy of <em>The Joy of Cooking</em> (see page 467, How to Skin a Rabbit… need I say more?). I spent the next six years in Italy as a cook. On my working documents I was officially listed as an <em>aiuto-cuoca</em> level IV, the lowest level of kitchen help there was. Incidentally, I spoke no Italian or French at the time.</p>
<p>I was an apprentice at Caffé Arti e Mestieri in Reggio Emilia, a quaint village divided by the ancient Roman Via Emilia. At Caffé Arti, we tied old tablecloths around our waists for aprons. Like the other cooks, I worked both lunch and dinner with a long break in between. That afternoon break I spent learning to make pasta by hand, or cleaning vegetables that the locals dropped off daily. Before the first guests arrived we would sit down at the table for a family meal. We poured wine into our water and called it <em>bevanda</em>. We had meals of broken tortelli or a pumpkin risotto and finished with fresh fruit that we ate with a knife and fork. On Sundays, we gathered at the chef’s home for an early supper. He would fry rabbit with rosemary and garlic and serve it on brown paper, accompanied by a salad of sliced fennel and olives—and, of course, many bottles of <em>vino sfuso</em>, homemade wine.</p>
<p>Every morning we gathered in the kitchen to make the bread. The pungent yeast filled the air and added to the already aromatic mix of simmering stocks and dried rosemary. This daily baking bestowed tranquility on the kitchen until a shrieking bell announced the arrival of the day’s deliveries. In the winter, they delivered wooden crates of local squash, artichokes, radicchio, and oranges that I stacked in the cellar. During the holidays, sacks of chestnuts and baskets of white truffles arrived at the kitchen door. In summer, crates of tomatoes, still warm from the sun, along with fava beans, melons, and strawberries were procured, and early in the morning we foraged for nettles and arugula. All this food grew within a few miles, close enough for a bicycle ride or a long walk. Cooking and eating locally and seasonally was a way of life. It had a profound impact on how I lived and worked, and still does to this day.</p>

<p>We had no walk-in refrigerators or food processors or industrial mixers at Caffé Arti. I learned how extremely gratifying and sensual it is to cook everything by hand. When you’re guided by all your senses, rather than the hum of machines, the food you make maintains more integrity and flavor. Perhaps the most vital lesson I learned at Caffé Arti is that a nurturing environment makes for an excellent cook.</p>
<p>After three years in Reggio I had learned Italian. I moved on to Rome, where I stayed for three more years. I worked all over the Eternal City, including a stint at the famous Hotel Hassler at the top of the Piazza di Spagna, and at Harry’s Bar on the Via Veneto, but my favorite job was at a little restaurant with a Michelin star called Da Patrizia e Roberto del Pianeta Terra at Campo de’ Fiori.</p>
<p>I knocked on the door and asked, in my American-accented Italian, if they needed a cook, and Chef Roberto Minetti invited me into the kitchen. My culinary education has always benefited from my being within earshot of someone great. Chef Minetti was a grouch, but had wonderful habits like keeping an old wine bottle filled with olive oil and trimmings from truffles and herbs, the stuff that most people throw away. Whenever he poured out some of the oil to dress a salad, he would simply add more to the bottle and give it a shake. His ricotta cake, a recipe from the 1600s, was so dense with spices it looked like pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>Campo de’ Fiori is the oldest market in Rome and was literally at our doorstep. All our vegetables and fish came from the market—squash blossoms, scampi, swordfish, <em>misticanza</em>, puntarella, <em>ovuli</em>, and porcini mushrooms. The <em>guanciale</em>, cured pork jowls, for our bucatini came from the acclaimed Antica Norcineria Viola. Believe me, I knew how lucky I was.</p>
<p>After six years in Italy, I had a chance to work in Japan for a few months. Even in a place where I can’t speak or read the language, I’ve always been able to follow along in the kitchen since so much of what there is to learn is purely visual. At times, communication can be very silent, and I’m quite comfortable with silence. As it happens, the Japanese love French food and especially French wine. I picked up so much knowledge in Japan: specifically, attention to detail, the importance of presentation, and even how to fry properly.</p>
<p>Returning to New York, I brought back everything I had soaked up in my years of living abroad. Cooking in restaurants in New York City in the late 1980s and early ’90s was like working in the Wild West. Cooking was accessible work that attracted all sorts of characters, and restaurants were places where not only could you start at the bottom and move your way up, you <em>had</em> to start at the bottom. Now, the industry is more regulated, accountable, and well behaved, but it still offers great opportunities to learn, as long as you have an appetite for the work.</p>
<p>At a certain point, I had the courage and support to go out on my own; I felt ready to use all my experiences, all the objects and recipes I had collected. In 2010, I opened Buvette.</p>
<p>Assembling this book has been an opportunity to reflect on the inspirations I’ve had in so many different kitchens around the world with so many people. Turning this all into food that can easily be made and served at home was a refreshingly easy translation as all of my cooking is simple, handmade, and straightforward. Buvette is more than a place; it’s also a feeling and an idea. It’s a way to cook, entertain, and live. It’s a recipe for living more meaningfully.</p>
