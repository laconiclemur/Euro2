<p class="C3625"><strong><span id="page_72">SALADS</span></strong></p>
<p class="C3608">When Marc first arrived in New York, it was late summer and markets were at their peak, stocked with vine-ripened tomatoes, crisp cucumbers and summer squash, carrots every color of the rainbow, multiple varieties of every fresh herb on earth, and an endless selection of greens and lettuces. The bounty was inspiring. Even more inspiring was the appetite that New Yorkers had for these ingredients.</p>
<p class="C3609">In Spain salads are often made up of just two or three ingredients, usually lettuce, tomato, and onion. They are sometimes studded with plump green olives and always dressed in oil and vinegar. But in New York, light eaters want bolder flavors. They expect salads with contrasting textures and surprising combinations of ingredients. This was new territory for Marc, and he relished the opportunity to get to know different ingredients and to create salads that satisfied this demand with a Spanish touch.</p>

<p class="C3637">On the night we premiered this dish at Boqueria SoHo it caught one regular guest’s attention, and he ordered it. Before he was through, he ordered another. The very next night he was back on his stool at the counter. He had been thinking about the dish all day and had to return for more! We hope you and your guests will feel the same way.</p>

<p class="C3632">15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 ripe cantaloupe (about 14 ounces) cut in 8 wedges and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 ounces very thinly sliced Jamón Ibérico</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ lemon</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup packed torn frisée</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves, torn</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, torn</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil: a generous drizzle</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>fleur de sel</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Peel the rind off the melon wedges, then slice each wedge lengthwise in half. Arrange 4 slices on each of the serving plates and drape the jamón all over the melon.</p>
<p class="C3636">Remove the zest from the half lemon and reserve it, then squeeze out the juice. Toss the frisée, mint, and basil with the lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Mound this on top of the jamón and melon. Drizzle with plenty of oil, grind lots of pepper on top, and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Sprinkle the reserved lemon zest on top. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>Never put a melon in the fridge. Its sweetness and complexity diminish in the cold. If you bought it ripe, use it right away. Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature until you can smell its honeyed scent.</em></p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_74">Tuna</span> and Little Gem Lettuce with Piquillo Anchovy Vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">It’s no wonder, given how delicious savory jarred tuna and anchovies taste with lettuce hearts known as “cogollos,” that this salad is a staple all over Spain. At Boqueria, we add piquillos to provide a mild sweetness that pairs nicely with the salty fish. To ensure that every bite has some of the tender red peppers and succulent anchovies, we swirl diced bits into the dressing. The vinaigrette runs between the leaves of the quartered lettuces and all over generous chunks of tuna, infusing them with a fresh taste of Spain.</p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 Little Gem lettuces or small romaine hearts</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>7 ounces canned bonito tuna in olive oil, preferably ventresca, flaked into large chunks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 shallot, sliced paper-thin on a mandoline, rings separated</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons torn fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Mix the piquillos, anchovies, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl until well mixed. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="C3636">Trim off the very ends of the lettuce stems, leaving most of the stem intact so the leaves stay in place. Cut each head in quarters lengthwise and put the quarters in a large bowl. (If you prefer your lettuce to be crunchier you can also trim off the soft green tops of the leaves.) Cover with cold water and swish to remove all the grit. Lift out and dry well in a salad spinner or with paper towels. Divide among serving plates.</p>
<p class="C3636">Scatter the tuna, shallot, and parsley over the lettuces and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spoon the vinaigrette all over and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_75">Arugula</span> with Fried Artichokes and Spicy Mayonnaise Dressing</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">The town of El Prat on the outskirts of Barcelona is home to the city’s airport, but what most travelers don’t realize is that the scrappy fields they see stretching out from the runways to the Mediterranean coast grow Spain’s best artichokes. Prized throughout Catalonia, the artichokes of El Prat find their way into many typical dishes. In Barcelona’s tapas bars, they are most often served fried. The wedges of artichoke heart, browned crisp around the edges and tender inside, come with lemon wedges and a rainfall of salt. Here, this classic preparation finds a refreshing compliment in peppery arugula, nutty Mahón cheese, and a garlicky allioli dressing. A final scattering of mint leaves and lemon zest bring a bright pop to each bite.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">1 hour</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 small bunch of parsley, stems only</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 artichokes</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>6 cups baby arugula</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ cup <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#id_5">Spiced Allioli Dressing</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 ounces aged Mahón cheese, shaved with a vegetable peeler</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ lemon, zest removed and retained</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Place the parsley stems in a bowl of cold water; this will be used to prevent the artichokes from discoloring.</p>
<p class="C3636">Trim the leaves and stem of each artichoke in turn. First place the artichoke on its side on the work surface and, using a bread knife, trim the stem to about 1 inch. Now turn the artichoke so that the stem is pointing away from you and, still using the bread knife and a sawing action, cut away the tough outer leaves around the widest part, rotating the artichoke as you go with your free hand and taking care not to cut too deeply; you want to save all of the white heart for the salad. Next, make a straight cut across the top, 1–2 inches down, to remove the upper leaves. Use your hands to pull off any remaining leaves around the bottom. Finally, use a paring knife to cut off the dark green outer layer of the stem and base, stopping at the white part. Dip the artichokes in the parsley water.</p>
<p class="C3636">Use the paring knife to cut the artichoke in half from top to bottom. Cut each half in quarters, forming 8 wedges in total, each with a portion of the stem intact. Cut out the fuzzy choke from each piece and discard it. Immerse the artichoke in the parsley water and leave it there while you trim the remaining artichokes. When all the artichokes have been cut, drain the wedges well and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="C3636">Fill a large skillet with oil to a depth of ¼ inch. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Generously salt the artichoke sections and add to the hot oil in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the arugula, allioli dressing, and half of the cheese in a large bowl. Squeeze a little lemon juice on top and season with salt. Toss until well-coated. Divide the arugula among 4 serving plates and top each with 6 artichoke wedges and the remaining cheese. Sprinkle the lemon zest over and tear the mint leaves on top. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3675">Our take on a Spanish white bean salad balances the creamy beans with crunchy celery, pleasantly bitter radicchio, parsley, and tangy Mahón cheese. We start with a foolproof technique for simmering dried beans so they end up evenly tender throughout. You can cook the beans a day or two ahead of time so you can throw the salad together in under 15 minutes.

<p class="C3636">Reduce the heat to low to maintain a steady, gentle simmer. Leave to simmer, adding more cold water if the liquid drops below the solids, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour. If using immediately, drain well. Otherwise, transfer the beans with the cooking liquid to airtight containers and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Drain well when ready to use, discarding the vegetables and spices.</p>
