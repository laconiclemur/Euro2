<p class="center">If Buvette were a sports car, our espresso machine would be the engine. Our bar is built around it and we put it to use constantly, whether for cappuccinos and caffè lattes in the morning, or for short shots of espresso after lunch or dinner. Similarly, our samovar (a beautiful Russian water heater similar to an electric tea kettle) is always on duty. In the winter, it’s often filled with warm wine packed with spices for Vin Brûlé (<a href="chapter005p.xhtml#page-154">here</a>), but otherwise it’s our constant supply of hot water, so we’re ready to brew a cup of tea or a tisane (<a href="chapter002-4.xhtml#page-63">here</a>) whenever a guest might want one.</p>
<p class="center1">The heartbeat of Buvette, coffee and tea fuel us—and not just literally. What I love most about coffee and tea are the rituals and objects that come with them: the silver teapots, the intense focus of the baristas, the smell of ground coffee beans, the milk and steam combining to make foam and, even more, seeing the milk swirl its way through a clear glass filled with ice and cold-brewed coffee.</p>
<p class="center1">I adore walking to McNulty’s, the coffee and tea store on Christopher Street just around the corner, where I fill brown paper bags with dried chamomile flowers and golden Assam leaves. The names of all of the teas are intoxicating and the stamps they have to label your bags are so aged and beautiful. The dialogue I have with the shopkeepers is always inspiring. It feels good to have access to a place where history is so apparent; a place where the same scales have been weighing orders for generations. I count myself lucky that it’s just at my doorstep.</p>
<p class="center1">Not unlike the salty snacks that come with cocktails in the evening, the food that accompanies coffee and tea adds to the pleasure of drinking them. In France, coffee is served with a little plate of sweets called <em>le café gourmand</em>. A wonderful tradition, I covet the whole assortment of small delights, which are referred to as <em>mignardises</em> (see <a href="chapter007b.xhtml#page-236">here</a> for some of my favorites). I especially love that the mignardises come automatically; there’s no menu to choose from or decision to make. It’s just understood that taking a moment to have a coffee is made better with a little something to eat—as is most everything, come to think of it.</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Espresso beans are no different from regular coffee beans (though they’re usually very rich on the coffee bean flavor scale). The difference lies in the brewing method. While coffee is made by dripping boiling water through ground beans, espresso is made by packing the ground beans under pressure and forcing boiling water through them. A concentrated, powerful dose of coffee in compact form, espresso is the <em>buvette</em> of the coffee world, as I like to think of it.</p></div>

<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">CORTADO</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">From the Spanish word <em>cortar,</em> meaning “to cut,” a cortado is an espresso cut with a small amount of steamed milk. I like to think of it as halfway between a macchiato and a cappuccino.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">CAPPUCCINO</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">An espresso topped with a small amount of steamed milk and also topped with foam from the steamed milk. When I was a teenager, my dad and I would sometimes take a walk to Mario’s Cigar Shop for cappuccinos after dinner. We’d argue about how to drink them—whether to stir the sugar in or let it sit and settle and become another thing altogether at the bottom of your cup. Little did I know we were both <em>wrong</em> because real Italians only drink cappuccinos in the morning—never in the evening, and especially not after dinner!</p></div>

<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">SHAKERATO</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Sweeten a hot espresso with as much sugar as you’d like, pour it into a cocktail shaker filled with tons of ice, and shake vigorously as you would a martini. Strain into a glass and drink immediately. It will have a handsome layer of <em>espuma,</em> or foam, on top, like the head on a beer. This is a good thing. For a “New Yorker,” shake it with milk and pour it, ice and all, into a glass.</p></div>

<h1 class="procedure-title"><a id="page-59"/><span class="dotted">BICERIN</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">This drink is originally from Torino. Shave or grate 1 ounce of bittersweet chocolate and place it into the bottom of a small coffee cup. Pour over a fresh, hot shot of espresso, let it sit for a moment to allow the chocolate to melt, then stir the two together. Serve topped with a slick of cream that you’ve lightly sweetened and beaten so it’s just starting to thicken, and a bit of extra shaved chocolate on top too. Serve with Almond Toffee (<a href="chapter007b.xhtml#page-237">here</a>).</p></div>
