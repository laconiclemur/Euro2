			<p class="Normal-noind"><span class="lead-in">It is impossible</span>, in the context of this book, to list the soup possibilities whose preparations require approximately the same amount of effort as that demanded to open one of the famous and redoubtable tins, whose inimitable flavor remains always that of some metal which is not tin and which must, surely, be noxious, as well: Plunge, for instance, a handful or two of fresh and finely shredded spinach into salted, boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes and pour it over dried bread crusts that have been rubbed with garlic cloves and dribbled with olive oil; boil a lot of crushed garlic cloves with a leaf of sage and one of bay and strain the water over olive oil-soaked crusts; boil together practically any combination of vegetables, cut up, sliced, or diced, add a piece of butter, and it will be delicious.</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Note: Soups peppered during the cooking process acquire an acrid taste; peppercorns of fine quality, ground in at the table, will perfume them agreeably.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page280">Panades and Onion Soup</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Rational habits permit of discarding nothing left over, and the use to which leftovers (and their economic allies, the wild things of nature) are put is often at the heart of a cooking’s character. Half-dried bread—that which is not reduced to crumbs or croutons or used in stuffings—is sliced (completely dried out, an attempt at slicing would break it into pieces) and put aside for soups. Many French peasants still begin every meal with a great tureen half filled with dried crusts of bread over which is poured a boiling broth. And a <em class="ital">pot-au-feu,</em> a <em class="ital">garbure,</em> a <em class="ital">bouillabaisse,</em> or an onion soup without crusts of dried bread is unthinkable. But the mere presence of bread in a soup does not constitute a genuine <em class="ital">panade,</em> which for most of the French, is but a memory and, for many a detested one, recalling the boiled bread and water on which, as children, they were nourished of an evening.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Soup <em class="ital">panades</em> have mostly disappeared from today’s cookbooks. One, however (a curiosity published in 1907, entitled <em class="ital">Menus Propos sur la Cuisine Comtoise</em> and signed <em class="ital">“Une Vieille Maîtresse de Maison”</em> with no further attempt at identity), after attributing the extreme longevity of the author’s grandfather to the daily consumption of <em class="ital">panade</em> and the local wine, contains a detailed exposé of the art of making a perfect <em class="ital">panade.</em> It is described as “the best, the cheapest, and the most digestible of all soups.” Its preparation consists of pouring boiling water into an earthenware vessel filled with slices of dried-out bread, simmering for at least an hour and a half and, shortly before serving, stirring in a piece of butter. The secret to its success lies in not stirring it until that point. This, the primordial version, I have tried and I cannot claim to have been ravished by the result. Others, but slightly more elaborated, are sound and succulent fare. The Périgord peasants replace the water by a stout and richly saffron-flavored chicken broth—only enough to be completely absorbed by the swelling bread—and leave it undisturbed, but for an occasional and slight addition of boiling broth, in a gentle oven for an hour or so. It is delicious and they call it <em class="ital">mourtairol.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page281">An onion <em class="ital">panade</em> is surely the ancestor and still the best of all the onion soups. The French onion soup, to which a less sophisticated America once vowed a passionate loyalty—the same that has soothed generations of night-reveling kitchen-crashers on the French ships and has astonished others by its unfailing presence on the French Line’s breakfast menus—is a good and comforting dish: onions browned in butter, cooked in stock, topped with bread and grated cheese, and rapidly gratinéed. In Lyons, the same preparation is enriched by an addition of beaten egg yolks and Port wine (a surprising variation, Gaston Dery’s cinnamon-flavored fantasy in which the Gruyère is replaced by Camembert and the onions are moistened with Champagne, Port, and Armagnac, is more often assured a place in literature than in the kitchen). One sloppy version (hastily fried onions drowned in boiling water and crowned with a slice of <em class="ital">baguette</em> and a puddle of bubbling rubbery glue, the acrid taste of burned onions strangely wed to the flat sweetness of French Emmental) has attained mythic stature. For Parisians and world travelers it will be forever a symbol recalling a fantastic and beautiful surrealist world in the heart of Paris through whose glorious mountainous landscape of vegetables and fruits wandered the most extraordinary collection of night denizens, each in search of a last drink and the obligatory bowl of onion soup in one of the bistros animated by Les Halles’ blood-smeared butchers.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page281a" style="page-break-before:always;">Onion Panade</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Panade à l’Oignon au Gratin</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Your dried-out bread should correspond, as nearly as possible, to the <a href="f_3-48.xhtml#page37">coarse, vulgar, compact, heavy loaf of sourdough peasant bread</a>.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The onions should be of tender-fleshed sweet variety, softening readily and uniformly in cooking—the large white summer onions or violet Bermudas. Some of the yellow-skins are sweet, other varieties tough and strong (if only the latter are available, don’t renounce).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page282">The cheese must be freshly grated and only two—either singly or together—are ideal; Swiss Gruyère and Italian Parmesan. The Swiss cheese should never be soft and elastic—these are the qualities that transform the eating of onion soup into a taffy-pulling contest. A good Gruyère, less than half the size of the 200-pound wheels of Emmental, is aged for about 6 months. It is always firm and relatively dry without being hard—crumbly under firm pressure. It contains only a few, tiny holes, or none, and its color is darker and duller than the pale yellows of Emmentals and American Swisses. It is dry and nutty in flavor—sometimes lightly sharp but never biting.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Parmesans pose less of a problem. Cylinders of 50 to 80 pounds are aged for from 2 to 3 years, and even the freshest (which are also good table cheeses) are sufficiently ripened to cook properly without forming rubber ribbons.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A wide-mouthed earthenware vehicle, broader than it is high (leaving the largest possible surface for the gratin to form) is perfect and may be used, as well, for coloring the onions (protected by an asbestos mat from the direct flame). If enameled ironware is to be used, the onions should be colored in another heavy vessel—copper, earthenware, cast-iron, since an enameled surface does not color them correctly.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The mind rarely registers weights and measures in terms of visual bulk. The precision of the measures given here could not be of less importance; the thing to remember is that there should be lots of onion, lots of bread, and lots of cheese in relation to the (undetermined) amount of water. Just before putting the casserole into the oven, the surface may, if one wishes, be sprinkled with Cognac.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">4 large onions, thinly sliced  (about 1½ pounds or 6 cups)</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">4 tablespoons (¼ cup) butter</li>
				<li class="IL">8 ounces dried bread, thinly sliced (about ⅓ inch)</li>
				<li class="IL">6 ounces (3 cups) freshly grated Parmesan and Gruyère</li>
				<li class="IL">Lightly salted boiling water</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal" id="page283">	Cook the onions, lightly salted, in the butter over a very low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour, keeping them covered for the first 40 minutes. If the heat is low enough and the saucepan of a heavy material, there will be no problem of coloration—they should begin to caramelize lightly toward the end of an hour’s time, at which point the flame may be turned up slightly and they should be stirred regularly until the entire mass is of a uniformly rich caramel color. Should there be signs of coloration too soon, the flame should be lowered even more, or the heat may be dispersed by separating the pan from the flame with an asbestos pad.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Spread slices of bread thickly with the onions, arrange a layer in the bottom of the casserole, sprinkle over a thick layer of cheese, and repeat the process, packing each layer gently and arranging the bread slices as well as possible to avoid empty spaces. The onions should be used up on the next to last layer of bread, the last layer being sprinkled only with cheese, and the casserole should not be more than two thirds full at this point.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour in the boiling, salted water, slowly and very carefully, at one single point against the side of the casserole, permitting the bread to swell and the mass to rise about 1 inch, or until obviously just floating, but no more (if you fear an unsteady hand, carefully ease the tip of a funnel down the side of the casserole to the bottom and pour the boiling water into the funnel).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cook on top of the stove, uncovered, over a very low heat, the surface maintaining a light, slow bubble for ½ hour. Add, as before, just enough boiling water to be certain that the body of the bread is submerged, sprinkle a bit more cheese over the surface (sprinkle over Cognac now, if you like), shave paper-thin sheets from a firm, cold block of butter, distributing them over the surface, and transfer the casserole to a medium oven (325° to 350°) for 1 hour, raising or lowering the temperature, if necessary, after about 40 minutes’ time, depending on how the gratin is developing. The soup should be covered with a richly colored crust of gratin and should be served out with a large spoon onto preheated plates.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page284" style="page-break-before:always;">Grape Harvesters’ Soup</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Tourain à la Bordelaise</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">The various <em class="ital">tourains</em> of southwestern France are also onion soups. The onions are colored in goose fat, lard, or drippings and the simplest is moistened with water, simmered for from 45 minutes to 1 hour and served over crusts of bread. Garlic is sometimes added, often a spoonful of flour is stirred into the onions after they have been browned and before they are moistened, a handful of French thread-thin vermicelli may be added a few minutes before serving, and terminal egg-yolk bindings are not uncommon. The bread crusts may be rubbed with garlic, and certain households add a bit of vinegar at the last minute.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The following is a typical Bordelais <em class="ital">tourain</em> and is traditional at the season of the wine-grape harvest. A native may first eat his sopped bread crust, empty out his (red) wine glass into the soup, and drink the rest from the soup plate, a performance known as <em class="ital">faire chabrol</em> (or <em class="ital">faire chabrot</em>)—to act like a little goat—and which belongs more to the realm of folklore than to that of contemporary habit.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1½ pounds onions, thinly sliced	</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>

				<li class="IL">½ cup dry white wine</li>
				<li class="IL">6 cups boiling water</li>
				<li class="IL">Slices of stale bread</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Using a large, heavy saucepan, cook the onions gently in the oil, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon, until they are uniformly light golden and very soft. Add the salt, the garlic, the tomatoes, and the sugar and continue to cook gently, stirring from time to time, for another 10 minutes. Add the white wine, turn the flame up, reduce by half, stirring, and add the boiling water. Simmer, covered, for from 45 minutes to 1 hour before serving out the soup over crusts of bread placed in the individual soup plates.</p>

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The <em class="ital">potage bonne-jemme</em> of the cookbooks (finely sliced leeks and potatoes stewed in butter, moistened with consommé, usually but not always puréed, and finished with milk and either butter or cream—or with both)—that soup which, chilled and richly creamed, has become the American vichysoisse—would come as a surprise to the bearers of the tradition from which it is borrowed. The potato and leek soup that is prepared night after night in the kitchens of nearly every Parisian <em class="ital">concierge</em> and in the kitchens of nearly every Île de France working family is nothing more than potatoes and leeks more or less finely sliced or cut up, depending on the <em class="ital">bonne femme,</em> boiled in salted water, and served, a piece of butter being either added then to the soup or being put to join the inevitable crust of bread in the soup plate before the boiled vegetables are poured over. It carries within it always the message of well-being and, were my vice and my curiosity more restrained, I, too, would adore to eat it every evening of my life.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">2 quarts boiling water	</li>

				<li class="IL">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Add the vegetables to the salted, boiling water and cook, covered, at a light boil until the potatoes begin to cook apart—or, until, when one is pressed against the side of the saucepan with a wooden spoon, it offers no resistance to crushing—about ½ hour to 40 minutes, depending on the potatoes. Add the butter at the moment of serving, after removal from the heat.</p>

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">A clean, invigorating flavor, exciting and subtle—perfect for a winter evening and a far cry from the banal Lyonnaise version, which is pumpkin boiled in water, finished with milk, and served with crusts and grated cheese apart (Bocuse has launched a rich and picturesque variation that involves cutting out a lid, seeding the pumpkin, filling it with alternate layers of grilled bread slices and grated Gruyère, salt, and pepper, pouring heavy cream to the brim and baking in the oven for 2 hours).</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">2 pounds pumpkin or other winter  squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into small pieces</li>
				<li class="IL">8 to 10 cloves garlic, peeled</li>

				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Add the squash and the garlic to the salted, boiling water and cook, covered, at a light boil, for 25 or 30 minutes or until the squash is purée-soft. Throw in the bread, leave to simmer for a couple of minutes longer, put the contents of the pan through a sieve or vegetable mill, taste for salt, grind in some pepper, reheat, and stir in the olive oil at the moment of serving. The soup may be garnished with finely chopped parsley or, in season, fresh basil leaves, torn into tiny pieces.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Somewhat reduced, with an additional garnish of sautéed mushrooms and little butter-cooked onions, this soup becomes the basic Burgundy sauce in which beef is cooked for a <em class="ital">Bourguignon,</em> chicken for a <em class="ital">coq-au-vin,</em> eel for a <em class="ital">matelotte;</em> poached eggs, brains, veal, lungs, or a variety of river fish, thus sauced, are said to be <em class="ital">en meurette.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">The dried crusts and chopped herbs may be replaced by crisp little croutons cooked in butter and rapidly sautéed in a <em class="ital">persillade</em> at the last minute. Their charm, unlike the soaked crusts, resides in their crispness and their nutty, brown-butter separateness of flavor, so they should be added only as the soup is being served.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">3 ounces lean salt pork (unsmoked  bacon), cut into small (¼-inch) lardons, parboiled 2 minutes and drained</li>

			<p class="Normal">Cook the lardons gently in ½ tablespoon butter, tossing, until lightly colored. Add the onions and cook over a very low heat, covered, stirring occasionally (add a bit more butter, if necessary) for about ½ hour, without permitting the onions to brown. Sprinkle over the flour, stir regularly for a couple of minutes, and add the water, slowly at first and in small quantities at a time, stirring the while and bringing to a boil before adding more, salt lightly, add the bouquet garni, and simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes. Add the red wine, return to a boil, and cook, covered, at a bare simmer, for about 1 hour, skimming two or three times during the last 5 minutes to remove any skin or traces of fat visible at the surface. Stir in the remaining butter at the moment of serving, pour the soup over the crusts, and sprinkle with the chopped herbs.</p>

			<h1 class="RT" id="page289" style="page-break-before:always;">Vegetable Soup with Basil and Garlic</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Soupe au Pistou</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: approximately <span class="oldstyle">4</span> to <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The French have imposed their own pronunciation on the Italian <em class="ital">minestrone</em> to describe a hearty soup of boiled vegetables and pasta. The Provençal <em class="ital">pistou</em> is a garlic, fresh basil, grated cheese, and olive oil pomade, descendant of the Genovese <em class="ital">pesto,</em> which contains pounded pinenuts and most often sauces pasta. A <em class="ital">soupe au pistou</em> is a <em class="ital">minestrone</em> into which, at the moment of serving, a <em class="ital">pistou</em> is incorporated. Beyond that point of definition, no two are alike and, despite Italian antecedents, all are jealously Provençal.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Some people prefer to cut all the vegetables into tiny cubes and boil them rapidly for about 20 minutes; others cut them into chunks, adding certain at different times and cooking until the potatoes begin to disintegrate and the squash has melted to near dissolution. Some add chopped tomato to the soup and none to the <em class="ital">pistou.</em> The Varois consider white beans and squash essential to a smooth body (fresh basil and large squash, from which slices are cut, are stocked in all the local shops for 6 months of the year, both destined only for use in <em class="ital">soupe au pistou</em>); in the Alpes-maritimes, white beans are rarely added and the use of squash is either unknown or thought to be heretical.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Soupe au pistou</em> has been fairly widely popularized in American kitchens—and American friends never fail to be astonished at the goodness of a <em class="ital">pistou</em> that has been patiently pounded in a mortar rather than violently emulsified in a blender . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page290">The thing, in itself, is like some unleashed earth force, sowing exhilaration in its wake—but, in that wake, nothing else may be savored, for it has a distinctly paralyzing effect on the palate; one may as well make it in quantity and plan to make a meal of it . . . And it is a sure wine-killer, so one may as well settle for a well-chilled, light-bodied, dry rosé.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The <em class="ital">pistou</em> is most often mixed into the soup before its arrival at the table, but, not only is it kinder to those guests who are shy of garlic to serve the fearful paste apart, but also the ritualistic aspect of each person’s serving himself from the mortar deepens the joy and the group involvement; <em class="ital">soupe au pistou</em> creates an atmosphere that deserves to be pampered.</p>

Work in some cheese until you have a very stiff paste, then add about one third of the tomato, pounding and grinding to a paste, more cheese, a bit of olive oil, more tomato, and so forth, the final addition of cheese bringing the consistency to that of a barely fluid paste.

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The fabled and much fêted, saffron-robed Marseillaise legend and presence—arrogant, flamboyant, and insolent, with its crown of horny <em class="ital">rascasse,</em> its exotic suite of tropical-colored Mediterranean denizens, and its fiery red <em class="ital">rouille</em>—shares its special titles of nobility with only one other preparation, the Provençal fish soup <em class="ital">(soupe de poissons),</em> which holds in its clear and essential broth the soul of <em class="ital">bouillabaisse.</em> The same sensuous warmth, the same sapid density, and the same limpid reflections of red-gold are only thrown into sharper relief by the absence—but for a few floating fresh egg noodles—of solid garnish. Outside of Marseilles, many a Provençal native will insist that <em class="ital">soupe de poissons</em> is a much finer dish than <em class="ital">bouillabaisse,</em> whose “broth is underflavored and the fish overcooked” (an accurate description, in fact, of nearly all restaurant <em class="ital">bouillabaisses</em>): “The bore of dealing with the bones and the overcooked flesh is eliminated and, since <em class="ital">soupe de poissons</em> is only a first course, one can follow it with a correctly cooked fish” (meaning a grilled sea bass). However unflagging one’s loyalty to a good <em class="ital">bouillabaisse,</em> there can be no doubt that a <em class="ital">soupe de poissons</em> numbers among the very pure and the very exciting things of the table. It is prepared like the following recipe (potatoes and eggs eliminated), an abundance of small fish, fish pieces, and fish heads (avoid oily, strong-flavored varieties, such as sardines, tuna, smelts, herring, mackerel) being added after the tomatoes have cooked awhile and before the water is added. They are stirred, crushed, and generally messed around for 15 minutes or so, until everything is cooked and supremely unsightly; then the boiling water is added, kept at a boil for ½ hour, and the liquid is put through a fine sieve, the solid material being pressed thoroughly to extract all juices, but not entering as a purée into the broth. The soup is reheated and fresh egg noodles, first parboiled for a minute and drained, finish cooking in it. It is, in Provence, traditionally made with several pounds of the minnows of <em class="ital">bouillabaisse</em> varieties—but that detail must, elsewhere, be ignored. Since the broth is strained, the contents of the bouquet garni may be added loosely (and, except for the orange peel, abundantly) and the refinements of peeling the tomatoes and chopping the garlic no longer have any meaning (the garlic should, nonetheless, be crushed—and several supplementary cloves may be added).</p>
			<p class="Normal">There are a number of poor cousins on which the name has been imposed—any soup, in fact, with the exception of <em class="ital">soupe de poissons,</em> that has been caressed by tomato, saffron, fennel, and garlic. Those of small interest (<em class="ital">bouillabaisse de sardines,</em> or the salt-cod version, <em class="ital">bouillabaisse de morue</em>) gratefully assume the splendid title. A <em class="ital">bouillabaisse d’épinards</em> is a pleasant thing and the Marseillais render it homage by calling it <em class="ital">épinards à la Marseillaise. La bouillabaisse borgne</em> (“one-eyed” <em class="ital">bouillabaisse</em>) is exquisite, and its very real qualities suffer from the imposition of the noble title. It can—in its own way—be bettered only by a <em class="ital">bouillabaisse de petits-pois</em> (identical preparation with a few potatoes less and a couple of handsful of tender, freshly shelled peas tossed in at the halfway point).</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Most of the regions of central and northern France claim their own <em class="ital">potées,</em> but they are all pretty much alike and a Bourguignon being served a <em class="ital">potée</em> in Auvergne, Lorraine, or Savoie might well mistake it for his very own. In addition to the usual <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> vegetables, white beans and cabbage often find their place in a <em class="ital">potée,</em> and the meats are usually chosen from a variety of pork products—sausages, salt or smoked slab bacon, ham, ears, heads, tails, feet . . . Cabbage should, for the sake of digestion, be first parboiled and drained and, to get rid of excessive salt, it is best to first soak salt pork and then parboil it and drain it. Otherwise, it is essentially a question of throwing everything together and cooking until done.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A <em class="ital">garbure</em> is a <em class="ital">potée</em> with a special personality and, although not made with pork, <em class="ital">pots-au-feu</em> and <em class="ital">poules-au-pot</em> are, generically, <em class="ital">potées.</em></p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Garbure du Béarn</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">In cookbooks of the ninteenth century, <em class="ital">garbures</em> are <em class="ital">panades;</em> thick soups, the body of which is often but not necessarily that of cabbage, baked with alternating layers of dried bread, producing something akin to a moist pudding containing no remainder of loose liquid. The only <em class="ital">garbures</em> retained in today’s kitchens are those of the southwest; thick cabbage soups (to underline the importance of their consistency, it is said that a wooden spoon or a ladle thrust into the soup should stand erectly), which, although served over dried bread crusts, are not genuine <em class="ital">panades.</em> <em class="ital">Garbures</em> may contain little else than a piece of salt pork and some potatoes, but that baptized <em class="ital">béarnaise,</em> containing preserved goose and made, preferably, in the spring of the year, when a selection of tender young vegetables abounds, has a rich suavity unknown to the others. Preserved goose finds its two most celebrated roles in this <em class="ital">garbure</em> and a <em class="ital">cassoulet.</em> A variety of small, green-leafed cabbage, the heads of which are elongated, loosely formed, and picked before maturity, is shredded and added directly to the soup. This cabbage is not found on the American market and it is best to first parboil other cabbages. Replacing the white beans in the following recipe, tender but fully developed broad <em class="ital">(fave)</em> beans, shelled and individually peeled (each bean measuring a short inch at the widest part, the flesh still clear green and easily pierced beneath a somewhat leathery skin) lend a particularly sumptuous quality that is enhanced by the presence of savory in the bouquet. A couple of handsful of freshly shelled tender peas, added at the same time as the goose, are always welcome. A finely chopped mixture of fresh pork fat, garlic, and parsley is often stirred in at this time also; its value, I think, is more real in the absence of preserved goose.</p>

				<li class="IL">1 pound (unshelled) fresh white beans (or 1 cup dried “Great Northern” beans: If the beans are fresh, add them directly, freshly shelled; dried beans should be washed, immersed largely in cold water, brought slowly to a boil, drained, covered again in cold water, brought again to a boil, and simmered, unsalted, covered, with carrot, onion, thyme, and bay leaf until tender, but intact—1½ to 2 hours)</li>

			<p class="Normal" id="page296">	Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage, split it, vertically, into quarters, cut out the core, remove as many of the ribs as you can easily get at, shred it coarsely, and parboil it in a large container of salted, boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain well, pressing gently.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If possible, use a 5- or 6-quart earthenware vessel (protected from the direct flame by an asbestos pad)—a deep <em class="ital">marmite,</em> Boston bean pot, etc. Lacking that, a large, enameled ironware casserole will do. Gently stew the carrots, turnips, onion, and leek in the goose fat, stirring regularly, for about 15 minutes, add the drained cabbage, continue cooking and stirring for another 10 minutes, add the bouquet and the seasonings (salt lightly—the preserved goose will add to the saltiness), pour over the boiling water, add the beans (without their cooking liquid, if dried and precooked), the potatoes, and the squash and cook, uncovered, at a light boil for about 40 minutes, adding a bit of boiling water if necessary, scraping the bottom from time to time with a wooden spoon to be certain that nothing is sticking. Push the pieces of goose (with only a bit of the goose fat clinging) into the soup, seeing to it that they are completely submerged, and continue to cook for another ½ hour. Lift off any fat from the surface and serve from the cooking vessel, over dried slices of bread (rye bread is good in this instance), either serving, first, only a bit of broth or, immediately after soaking up the bread with a ladle of broth, placing a quarter of goose on top, surrounded by a couple of ladles of vegetables.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Poule-au-pot</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span> to <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">But for cooking times, a <em class="ital">poule-au-pot</em> is prepared like a <em class="ital">pot-au-feu,</em> the hen or chicken being added an hour or so after the beef. The chicken is sometimes stuffed, but the stuffing (<em class="ital">farce</em>—or, in the southwest, <em class="ital">farci</em>), delicious in itself, adds neither to the quality of the chicken nor to that of the bouillon. If a stuffing is to be part of the garnish, it seems best to <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page193">stuff a cabbage and braise it apart</a> in a few ladles of fatty broth skimmed from the pot, preserving the chicken bouillon both from the cabbage onslaught and the confusing flavors of the stuffing. Furthermore, a platter with a hen surrounded by <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> cuts of beef, another crowned with a whole stuffed cabbage escorted by the vegetables from the pot, is an impressive sight and a heartening experience.</p>
			<p class="Normal">An unstuffed chicken is often accompanied by a pilaf cooked in part of the chicken broth and a sauce <em class="ital">suprême</em> (chicken <em class="ital">velouté</em> reduced with more of the broth, cream added, and finished with cream and butter—an egg-yolk binding will transform it into an <em class="ital">allemande</em> or a <em class="ital">parisienne</em>), but one can, then, no longer take the same pleasure in the broth and the boiled vegetables.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sometimes the bird is simply covered with water, brought to a boil, vegetables and bouquet added, and simmered until done. That is good agrestic fare, but the soup tends to be a bit lightweight. An old hen, sacrificed because of a diminished egg output, may take up to 3 hours to cook and will lend a fine flavor to the bouillon but one should not expect total satisfaction from the flesh. A young chicken (American fryers and French <em class="ital">poulets à rôtir</em> are killed at from 6 to 8 weeks) and, in particular, a commercially raised young chicken will lend little beyond a bit of gelatin to the bouillon and will, itself, have no taste—it will be cooked in ½ hour. A hen about 1 year old is ideal and should require no more than 1½ hours.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page298">It is a Sunday meal and, traditionally, the bouillon serves throughout the week as a base for the evening soup or as stock.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Stock, meat jelly or aspic, bouillon, and consommé differ only in that: (1) Especially gelatinous cuts and bones are usually avoided in the preparation of bouillon or consommé, the quantity of gelatin essential to the structure of a stock’s derivative silken sauces and to the physical integrity of an aspic troubling the clear definition of bouillon’s flavor; (2) consommé is clarified (cooked for an hour with a paste of egg white and finely chopped lean beef, the albumen draining all solids in suspension from the liquid, to mark it with discrete sparkling transparency).</p>
			<p class="Normal">The slightest trace of fat on the surface of a consommé would constitute an offense to the world of hierarchical formal service and high social precepts that it so neatly symbolizes, whereas, a few glistening and anodyne pearls of fat on a bouillon’s surface, supported by fragrant effluence, dispel tensions, transforming social contact into human communion. But the crystalline consommé’s world now belongs increasingly to the realm of Proustian recall, the tiny <em class="ital">quenelles</em> and <em class="ital">royales,</em> the cocks’ combs, truffle juliènne, and plovers’ eggs that have garnished it, permitting it to assume a thousand denominations, having been relegated to gastronomic literature; and clarification is considered archaic in most professional kitchens (if cooking methods are respected, the bouillon will be sufficiently clear and of a warmer and deeper cast than a clarified consommé). It has never been current practice in home kitchens where leftover <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> or <em class="ital">poule-au-pot</em> broth, with or without the sliced leftover vegetables, may, when not accompanied by the recurrent dried crusts, be garnished with any of a variety of pastas, rice, tapioca, stuffed braised cabbage leaves, rolled and slivered <em class="ital">crêpes,</em> beaten egg threaded through a sieve into the simmering broth. Freshly cooked vegetables, diced or in juliènne, may also be added, or a handful of fresh peas, or one of shredded sorrel . . .</p>

			<p class="Normal">Unless the chicken has already been badly mauled and slashed by the butcher, remove the neck by slitting the neck skin on the back side, carefully peeling it loose from the neck, cutting halfway through the neck at the point where it joins the backbone, and twisting it off, thus leaving an intact flap of skin which may be folded across the neck cavity and secured against the back, preventing the loss of valuable juices (and permitting a handsomer presentation). Remove all fat from body cavity. Loosen the skin from the upper part of the breast and remove the wishbone (this should be done with any poultry, poached, braised, or roasted, that is destined to be served whole and carved at table; the breast cannot, otherwise, be carved neatly and rationally): Slit the flesh the length of the two sections of the wishbone with the tip of a small sharp knife, work it loose with tips of thumb and forefinger, cut through the cartilaginous attachments to the breastbone, and gently pull the two branch bones backwards, tearing the summit loose from its attachment.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page300">Truss the chicken (this, too, is not only a question of presentation; trussed compactly, a chicken cooks more evenly): If the feet have not already been removed, pass all parts of them over a flame at the same time that the chicken is singed, blistering the skin. Remove the skin, holding a towel or paper towel in your hand; cut off the “toes” except for the longest, central digit, which should be sectioned at the first joint, removing the claw tip. Cut off the wing tips (the second joint from the tip, leaving only the shoulder section attached to the bird). Fold the neck skin over the back, spreading it, and place the chicken on its back. Use two lengths of kitchen string and an approximately 6-inch trussing needle. Thread the first string, run it through the wing section just below the shoulder joint, the needle brushing the underside of the bone, bring it out through the back and the near edge of the neck flap, return it through the far edge of the neck flap, the back and, identically, through the far wing. Run the string back through the body of the bird, this time through the drumstick, just beneath its connection with the thigh, and tie the two string ends, pulling the strings gently, but tightly, before tying. Repeat the process with the other length of string, piercing this time the lower ends of the wing sections and the drumsticks. At this point, the chicken may be rubbed with lemon juice, if one likes—it is a question of discouraging discoloration during the poaching. If the feet are attached, fold them over the breast and tie a length of string loosely around the girth of the bird to hold them in place.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page301">Place the bird in its pot, pour over warmed stock and water to cover, bring slowly to a boil, skim as for a stock, add the vegetables, the bouquet, the head of garlic, salt (if necessary) and maintain the liquid, lid slightly ajar, at the slightest suggestion of a simmer until the chicken is cooked, tender, 1½ to 3 hours. Skim off the bulk of the fat.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage, quarter it, arrange the quarters in a large saucepan, pour over boiling water to cover, and parboil for 10 minutes. Drain, keeping the quarters intact and pressing them gently to rid them of the maximum of liquid, return them to the saucepan, and ladle over enough fatty bouillon from the surface of the pot to barely cover them, pressed well into place. Simmer, covered, until serving (in this case, a bare 1½ hours).</p>
			<p class="Normal">If the potatoes are young, they may, depending on taste, be cooked in their skins, first well washed and scrubbed. Cook them apart in salted water, putting them to cook ½ hour before serving the dish.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Serve first a tureen of the bouillon, crusts on the bottom of each soup plate. Those who wish may sprinkle the bread and broth with Parmesan. Discard garlic and bouquet. Clip and remove strings from chicken and leeks. Serve the chicken and the vegetables on separate platters (the latter interfere with carving). Keep the bouillon at table, pouring a ladle over each serving of meat and vegetables. Some people like to have Dijon mustard and horseradish handy as well as the coarse salt.</p>
