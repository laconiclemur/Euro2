<h2 class="serve"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A SMALL PLATE</strong></h2>
<p class="indent">Migas, which means “bread crumbs,” originated as a dish cooked by shepherds out in the fields. They crumbled stale bread and cooked it in animal fat. That two-ingredient recipe evolved into bread cooked with chorizo, ham, or pork and seasoned with herbs and spices. I’m now keeping the bread, but taking the meat out altogether. Inspiration hit me when my chef de cuisine, Frank Muller, tested out a cauliflower dish. When I saw how his fried florets looked like classic migas, I began experimenting. Roasting the cauliflower, along with Brussels sprouts, helped caramelize the vegetables, while finely diced baguette delivered even more crunch than crumbs. At the restaurant, we serve this over Celery Root Puree (<a href="sec52.xhtml#page164">here</a>), as a small plate, but a larger portion could also work as a vegetarian main course.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup raisins</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ large (3-pound) cauliflower</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup plus 5 teaspoons blended oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in halves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>One 5-inch piece baguette, crusts removed, cut into ¼-inch dice (1 cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 lemon</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">POSITION RACKS IN THE UPPER AND LOWER</span> thirds of the oven and preheat to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indent">Put the raisins in a small microwave-safe bowl and add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Microwave for 1 minute, then let stand in the hot water until very plumped and tender. Drain well.</p>
<p class="indent">Cut the cauliflower florets off the stalks; discard the stalks. Cut the florets into ¼- to ½-inch pieces. You want to use all of the florets, even the crumbs. You should end up with 2 cups.</p>
<p class="indent">Line 2 half-sheet pans with foil. Toss the cauliflower with 3 teaspoons oil and ¼ teaspoon salt on one pan. Spread in a single layer. Repeat with the Brussels sprouts on the other pan with 2 teaspoons oil and ¼ teaspoon salt. Turn all the sprouts cut-sides down. Place the Brussels sprouts on the lower oven rack and the cauliflower on the upper rack. Roast until tender and dark golden brown, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place a paper towel-lined plate and slotted spoon next to the stovetop. Heat the remaining ¼ cup oil in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over high heat until hot. When you drop a bread cube in, it should sizzle immediately. Add the bread cubes and spread in an even layer. Toss in the oil to evenly coat, then sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, tossing frequently, until golden brown on most sides and crispy, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the paper towel-lined plate with the slotted spoon to drain.</p>
<p class="indent">Return the skillet to medium-high heat. There should still be a thin film of oil in the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant and just starting to turn golden brown, about 1 minute. Don’t let the garlic burn.</p>
<p class="indent">Lift the foil with the sprouts and cauliflower to dump them into the skillet. Add the raisins and bread cubes. Cook, stirring, until well-mixed, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and zest half of the lemon on top. Toss once more and season with ¼ teaspoon salt. Taste and add more salt if you’d like.</p>
