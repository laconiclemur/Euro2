			<p class="Normal-noind" id="pagexiii"><span class="lead-in">with an approach</span> that is pure and uncompromising, Richard Olney teaches us that good cooking is no accident. Good food, great food, depends upon an unwavering respect for the freshness and quality of ingredients, whether they be a simple red potato, a golden knob of butter, a fragrant sprig of thyme, a plump clove of garlic.</p>
			<p class="Normal">More than almost anyone I know, Richard Olney understands—and most elegantly expresses—the role that food and wine can play in filling one’s day with joy, happiness, and contentment.</p>
			<p class="Normal">As the title of <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> suggests, food need not be extravagant, complicated, or mysterious to be good. Quite the contrary. Olney takes us by the hand, and in an articulate voice that’s at once chatty, quarrelsome, determined, and often eccentric, he scrambles us an egg, grills us a whole sea bass, orchestrates a fragrant vegetable soup known as pistou, and creates an incomparable potato daube consisting solely of potatoes, garlic, water, salt, olive oil, and bay leaves.</p>
			<p class="Normal">From novice cook to experienced chef, there are timeless lessons to be learned from <em class="ital">Simple French Food:</em> how to make your own vinegar; when to season meats for cooking; why one allows meats to rest after cooking; which eggs to use for poaching, which for hard boiling.</p>
			<p class="Normal">I share with Olney a passion for Provence and its cooking, a cuisine that’s direct, earthy, seasonal, and of the soil. Likewise, I agree with him that a commitment to fresh herbs differentiates a good cook from an indifferent one.</p>
			<p class="Normal">While Olney is an uncompromising cook, he is far from inflexible in his choice of ingredients. Take a look at any recipe, and you will see innumerable variations, considered modifications. It’s the spirit of it all that’s important, an ability to remain faithful to basic culinary concepts while you let your imagination, creativity, and temperament take charge. After all, what good would it be if everyone in the world made Olney’s coffee custard, and every custard tasted exactly the same?</p>
			<p class="Normal">Richard Olney makes you comfortable about cooking, for he answers your questions before you can ask them. He talks you through the trimming of an artichoke, the cleaning of a leek, and advises you to make friends with your oven, so that you control the situation, not a thermometer.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Olney shares with us the tactile, aromatic, visual joys of food, and in a voice that only a painter could create, he treats us to saffron-stained rice, dribbling dry vermouth, and turns his nose up at a holocaust of brandy and fennel branches.</p>
			<p class="Normal">You cannot express yourself as a cook until you understand the most basic of rules: roasting, braising, marinating, grilling. Olney slyly, almost magically, teaches us all of these procedures with a series of cogently written recipes expressly designed to minimize intimidation in the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="Normal">As Olney says, rules vary depending upon the lawmakers, and the gospel according to Richard Olney offers considerable food for thought:</p>
			<p class="Normal">“Olive oil is the best sauce.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">“If you have no taste for coriander, leave it out.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">“The line dividing a soup from a stew is often infirm.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">While on the one hand, Olney’s larder is seemingly endless—filled with frog’s legs and octopus, rare wild mushrooms, and lambs’ brains—the heart of <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> is homey and basic, a book filled with vegetable gratins, uncomplicated roasts and grills, and soups based on whatever fresh and worthy ingredients you have at hand.</p>
			<p class="Normal">But best of all, Olney gets you excited about food, about tossing a handful of rosemary on the fire the next time you grill a steak; about adding garlic, onions, and a bouquet garni to the water in which you boil scrubbed new potatoes; about sharing with friends a fragrant Provençal chicken pilaf and a bottle of hearty red wine.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Richard Olney has delivered a book uncluttered by fads, fashions, or trends. And while the recipes may be French in origin, the appeal is forever international. Quite happily, <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> is a book for all peoples and all times.</p>
