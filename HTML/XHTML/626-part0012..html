<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Mum&#8217;s rhubarb glut inspired me to cook some up with strawberries and then turn it into a pur&#233;e. I love this as a cordial, topped with some sparkling water and ice &#8211; when you add the carbonated water to it, it creates an insane-looking foam. It&#8217;s also good drizzled over vanilla ice cream.</span></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Don&#8217;t strain the syrup as it is the pulp that will make the drink foam up nicely. Pour it into a sterilized bottle or jar and seal until ready to use.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Buckthorn is becoming fashionable at places like Michelin-starred restaurant Noma in Copenhagen, where they serve it as a drink. We grew up with these berries, which you can find growing wild everywhere. The flavour is hard to describe &#8211; the berries are slightly bitter and sour, but they become refreshing when mixed with a little bit of orange rind and juice.</span></p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is a lot easier to do than fermenting your own fruit wine and a great way to use up a glut of fruit if you grow your own. The results are beautiful and it keeps for a long time. Again, your options are endless: you can use any flavoursome berry or apricots (halved and stoned), although I love fishing the blackcurrants out of my glass. My father distills his own vodka, but if you don&#8217;t have enterprising parents, then any good-quality vodka will do.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 2 litres (3&#189; pints)</strong></p>

<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Seal and leave to infuse for a month or so. It will keep for a year, if you don&#8217;t drink it earlier.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch09sec06"><a id="page_230"></a>Blackcurrant micronutrients</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">A shot or two of this after a late lunch has always been excused by my Aunt Zhenia, who joked that this drink by nature contains a lot of micronutrients. It takes a month or so for the fruit to produce alcohol, when the fermentation will slow down. Berries with a lot of fibre (like blackcurrants) will take almost twice as long to ferment as berries with little fibre (raspberries), the latter will also produce more yield. You can make <a href="part0012.xhtml#fig230">raspberry</a>, sour cherry, blackberry, blackcurrant or blueberry wine, too. Simply swap the berries in the recipe &#8211; the proportion of sugar stays roughly the same. <a href="part0012.xhtml#page_231">Blackcurrant</a> is my favourite though.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes about 500ml (17fl oz)</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1kg (2lb) fresh blackcurrants or raspberries</p>
<p class="hang1">400g (13oz) granulated sugar</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Make sure you discard any damaged blackcurrants or raspberries, and then crush the good ones with a potato masher or a fork.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix the crushed berries with the sugar in a container and leave in a warm place in the kitchen, covered by a muslin cloth until the fruit sinks to the bottom and you can see alcohol bubbles, stirring from time to time with a clean wooden spoon. This could take up to 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Place a fine sieve lined with a muslin cloth over a large container and strain the fruit out, pressing it with a wooden spoon or squeezing with clean hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Fill a sterilized glass jar with the strained liquid right to the top so that there is no air in the jar. Cover with a lid in which you have made a hole. Place some water in another smaller sterilized jar and connect it to the larger jar with a length of plastic tubing, fitting it through the hole in the lid. This is called a water stopper and is used to make sure the wine does not oxidize.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Leave the wine to ferment at 20&#8211;25&#176;C (68&#8211;77&#176;F) for 6 weeks (or 3 weeks if using raspberries), during which time the natural yeast will sink to the bottom. When you see this forming, pour off the liquid and discard the residue, then return the liquid to the jar. Repeat this process once or twice until the residue stops from forming and the liquid is no longer cloudy.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Decant the wine into a sterilized carafe or bottle, seal it and store in a cool, dark place &#8211; it should keep unopened for up to a year. Serve as a digestif in a shot glass after lunch or dinner.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch09sec07"><a id="page_233"></a>Russian fermented rye drink</h1>
<p class="paral1"><strong><em>Kvas</em></strong> is a non-alcoholic Russian fermented rye bread drink. When cold it can be as refreshing as cider or, indeed, blonde beer with a slice of lemon in it. It also has affinity with one of the most ancient drinks known to man &#8211; mead. The best <em>kvas</em> is made with natural yeast. The babushka I met at Kakhovka&#8217;s market made it by mixing hop flowers with flour and hot water, which was then rolled into pellets and left to dry in the sun. Of course, you can use commercial, fresh yeast instead.</p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 3 litres (5&#188; pints)</strong></p>
<p class="hang">200g (7oz) dried rye bread crusts (darker bread will produce a more complex flavour)</p>
<p class="hang">3 litres (5&#188; pints) hot water</p>
<p class="hang">2 teaspoons caraway seeds, toasted and ground</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground</p>
<p class="hang">4 tablespoons raw honey or other good-quality honey</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) raisins</p>
<p class="hang">30g (1oz) natural yeast or 10g (&#8531;oz) fresh yeast or 5g (&#188;oz) dried active yeast</p>
<p class="hang1">fresh mint or lemon verbena, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C/400&#176;F/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Place the rye bread crusts on a baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes or until they turn dark and are completely dry.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Pop the baked crusts into a 3 litre (5&#188; pint) sterilized jar and pour over the hot water. Add the ground caraway seeds and coriander seeds, cover with muslin and leave in a warm place for 2 days.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Strain the mixture through a clean muslin cloth, discard the bread and spices, then pour this bready water (called <em>suslo</em>) back into the jar. Add the honey, raisins and yeast, cover with clean muslin and leave to ferment for a day in a warm, dark place.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Pour the <em>kvas</em> into sterilized bottles, seal and leave to ferment for a further 6 hours in a warm, dark place. Place in the refrigerator to stop the fermentation. Serve cold with fresh mint leaves or lemon verbena.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> If you enjoyed the drink, keep the sediment from the bottom of the bottles &#8211; you can add it to your next batch and the flavour will gradually become more and more complex.</p>
