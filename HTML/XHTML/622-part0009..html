<h1 class="heading" id="ch06sec01"><a id="page_148"></a>Sour cabbage</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">By sour I mean fermented. We have a wonderful word that describes this kind of brine fermentation &#8211; <em>solinnya</em>. A little bit of salt, a little bit of warmth and your life is now richer as you have produced the best &#8216;pickles&#8217; in the world. We start making this in late autumn (to be eaten in winter), when the right (firmer) types of cabbage become available. Once the cabbage has finished fermenting, it&#8217;s normally served mixed with thinly sliced red onions and a slick of unrefined sunflower oil. Place some whole cabbage leaves to ferment underneath the sliced cabbage to make <a href="part0006.xhtml#pg84"><em>Holubtsi</em></a>.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 500ml (17fl oz) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) white cabbage, plus 250g (8oz) whole leaves (optional)</p>
<p class="hang">150g (5oz) carrots, peeled and roughly grated</p>
<p class="hang">40g (1&#189;oz) caster sugar</p>
<p class="hang1">25g (1oz) fine sea salt</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Remove the core from the cabbage and shred it into long thin strands. Massage it with your hands to soften and then mix with the carrots.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Add the sugar and salt and massage again. If using, place the whole leaves of cabbage at the bottom of a plastic container (or a fermentation barrel if you have one) and pack the sliced cabbage and carrot down tightly.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Cover the cabbage with a clean piece of muslin, followed by a plate or a chopping board, then place something really heavy over it to weight it down. Leave in a warm part of your kitchen (25&#176;C/77&#176;F) for about 3 days. Check the cabbage and rinse the muslin cloth every day. When ready, the cabbage will become pleasantly sour.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> You can then transfer it to a sterilized 500ml (17fl oz) preserving jar and seal. Keep it in the refrigerator, or in a cool cellar like we used to, for a couple of months. The longer you keep it, the sourer it will get &#8211; though I think it&#8217;s nicer when it isn&#8217;t overly sour.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch06sec02"><a id="page_151"></a>Sour aubergines</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Whereas the north-west of Ukraine is covered in woodland with beautiful plump ceps and morels, the south of the country is famous for its giant pink tomatoes and aubergines. We used to ferment the last of aubergines to keep us supplied all winter. Ukraine&#8217;s markets always have a lovely babushka selling these along with a mountain of gherkins and sour cabbage.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makesa 1 litre (1&#190;pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">4 aubergines, about 1kg (2lb) in total</p>
<p class="hang">125ml (4fl oz) sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">400g (13oz) carrots, peeled and roughly grated</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">6 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="hang1">8 leaf (or Italian) celery sticks or 4 young celery sticks</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the whole aubergines (stalks and all) in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Cook for 20 minutes or until they can be easily pierced with a skewer. Drain them, place on a tray, cover with a chopping board weighted down with a heavy object on top and leave overnight to extract as much water as possible.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan and sweat the carrots, stirring often, for about 15 minutes until soft but not browned. Let the carrots cool in the oil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Slice off the aubergine stalks, then slice each aubergine in half, starting from the fatter end and almost all the way through but leaving the stalk end whole. Sprinkle &#188; teaspoon of the salt inside each aubergine.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Mix the cooled cooked carrots (and their oil) with the crushed garlic, divide it into 4 parts and stuff each aubergine with one part of the mixture. Tie each aubergine with 2 leaf celery &#8216;strings&#8217; or a young celery stick and place the stuffed aubergines back on the tray. If you have trouble using the celery &#8216;string&#8217; to tie them up, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; just tuck the celery underneath the aubergines for flavour.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Cover with clean muslin, weight them down again and leave in a warm place in your kitchen (25&#176;C/77&#176;F) for 2&#8211;3 days, making sure to wash or change the muslin each day. The aubergines should acquire a pleasant, mild sourness.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Transfer the aubergines to a sterilized 1 litre (1&#190; pint) preserving jar and seal. They should then keep unopened in the refrigerator or a cellar all winter.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Picking warm cucumbers from my mum&#8217;s vegetable patch after a hot summer day is a true pleasure. Sweet and prickly, they are incredible eaten right there and then. When the season comes to its end though, we collect the last few buckets and brine them in our summer kitchen. The flavourings I am giving here are very Ukrainian &#8211; not everybody will be able to find sour cherry and horseradish leaves. Simply add whatever you enjoy the taste of: mustard seeds, allspice berries, celery sticks and leaves, red chillies. Sour cherry leaves don&#8217;t add any flavour, but they are supposed to keep the pickles crisp. Dill is, in my view, essential.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 2 x 2 litre (3&#189; pint) jars</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 litres (3&#189; pints) water</p>

<p class="hang">1 long green chilli (optional)</p>
<p class="hang">10 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="hang1">1.5kg (3lb) fresh small cucumbers</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the water and salt in a saucepan and bring to the boil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Layer all of the flavourings and gherkins or cucumbers in a clean 4 litre (7 pint) container and pour over the hot brine. Place a plate on top and weight it down with something heavy. Leave in a warm place in your kitchen (25&#176;C/77&#176;F) for 3 days.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Decant into 2 sterilized 2 litre (3&#189; pint) preserving jars, seal and keep in the refrigerator. The gherkins should be good to eat after a week or so. They can also be sealed and kept in the refrigerator or a cellar throughout the winter.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">When I was a student, my best friend Gabriella and I got really addicted to pickled garlic. Not the worst addiction possible when you are 19, but it was absolute madness, as we ate so much of it that we eventually couldn&#8217;t bear looking at it for a few years to come. I am ready for a backslide now, since Aunt Nina has given me her Armenian recipe. Beetroot adds a beautiful colour and slight earthiness. This definitely beats the supermarket pickled garlic of my youth.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes 2 x 1 litre (1&#190; pint) jars</strong></p>
<p class="hang">15 heads of wet (new) garlic</p>
<p class="hang">1 litre (1&#190; pints) water, plus 400ml (14fl oz) water</p>
<p class="hang">3 tablespoons fine sea salt</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) beetroot, peeled and sliced</p>
<p class="hang1">200ml (7fl oz) white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Soak the unpeeled garlic heads in unsalted water for 3 days, changing the water every day.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Drain the garlic and discard the water. Peel off the outer layer of the skin, then place the garlic heads in a plastic container and cover with a plate or chopping board and something heavy to weight it down.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Mix the 1 litre (1&#190; pints) water and salt together, then pour this brine over the weighted-down garlic. Leave it in your kitchen for 1 week.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Drain the garlic. Divide the beetroot slices between 2 sterilized 1 litre (1&#190; pint) preserving jars and pop the garlic on top. Mix the vinegar with the 400ml (14fl oz) water and pour this over the garlic. Seal and keep in the refrigerator. It should keep unopened for several months.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch06sec05"><a id="page_154"></a>Armenian pickles</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My Aunt Nina&#8217;s grandmother, Liza from Karabakh, used to make this using mountain spring water, and the taste of those pickles was incomparable. Beetroot is often added to Armenian pickles for colour, which is similar to how it is made in the Middle East. These pickles are delicious and we eat them in the summer and in winter. You can buy horseradish leaves and dill stalks in bunches from Polish delis specially for pickling, but if you can&#8217;t find them or the blackcurrant and cherry leaves, just substitute with some spices or aromatics that you like (celery would be great) or simply leave them out.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes a 3 litre (5&#188; pint) jar</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 beetroots, peeled and sliced into discs</p>

<p class="hang">4 spring onions</p>
<p class="hang">1 head of wet (new) garlic, left whole, outer layer peeled</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) dill heads or stalks</p>
<p class="hang">2 horseradish leaves, or 50g (2oz) fresh horseradish, chopped</p>
<p class="hang">2 blackcurrant leaves</p>
<p class="hang">2 sour cherry leaves</p>
<p class="hang">1 litre (1&#190; pints) water</p>
<p class="hang">3 tablespoons sea salt flakes</p>
<p class="hang1">10 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the beetroot at the bottom of a warm, sterilized 2 litre (3&#189; pint) preserving jar, then top with the cabbage wedges, beans, spring onions, garlic and all the aromatics, apart from the peppercorns.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Bring the water, salt and peppercorns to the boil in a saucepan, then pour over the vegetables. Make sure everything is submerged, then seal and leave in a warm part of your kitchen (25&#176;C/77&#176;F) for about 3 days to pickle, then store in the refrigerator. The beetroot will gradually turn everything a deep pink. It should keep unopened for several months.</p>
