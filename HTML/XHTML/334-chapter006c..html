<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">These glazed carrots are said to have originally been made with the famous water from the springs at Vichy in France. While they are usually cooked with just water, butter, and sugar, I like to add sherry vinegar, honey, aromatic shallots, and thyme. If you can find pale yellow carrots and purple ones too, be sure to use those for a striking presentation (see Recipe Note).</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 pound carrots (preferably baby ones, but you can cut regular carrots into lengths roughly ½ inch wide by 2 inches long), peeled and trimmed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 shallot, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Put the carrots,</strong> a healthy pinch of salt, and a tablespoon of the vinegar into a skillet. Add enough cold water to cover them by half. Set the skillet over high heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are just cooked through, about 15 minutes. If the pan threatens to dry out while they’re cooking, simply add an extra splash of water. To test for doneness, insert a paring knife into one of the carrots; it should be able to go through with barely any resistance.</p>
<p>Once the carrots are just cooked through, the water should be nearly evaporated; if it’s not, simply pour it off. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar to the pot along with the honey, olive oil, shallot, and thyme and cook for just a minute or two more to get a nice glaze on the carrots. Season the carrots to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, at room temperature, or refrigerate them and serve cold. They’re good all ways!</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Braising tough, bitter radicchio in a simple combination of olive oil and water turns its leaves soft and supple. Serve it with toasted pine nuts, fruity currants, and sweet-and-sour balsamic vinegar as a nod to Sicily, the Italian island that happens to be the largest in the Mediterranean, and where the combination is used frequently in all kinds of dishes.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 small heads radicchio</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup water</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons currants</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon good-quality aged balsamic vinegar</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 450°F.</p>
<p>Quarter each radicchio lengthwise. Be sure to leave the cores intact so that you end up with wedges that are held together at the base.</p>
<p>Place the radicchio wedges in a roasting dish or a skillet, anything that will hold them in an even layer and that can go into the oven. Drizzle with the olive oil and pour in the water. Tightly cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil and roast in the oven until tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Transfer the radicchio to a serving dish and sprinkle with a large pinch of salt. Scatter the pine nuts and currants over the radicchio, and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p>Serve warm or at room temperature.</p></div>

<p class="noindenth1"><em>To really enjoy cooking, and have it come very easily to you, make it your habit. Once you learn to cook, it becomes intuitive, an extension of your instincts and emotions. But you need good habits to begin with. And trust me, it’s much better to learn good ones than break bad ones.</em></p>
