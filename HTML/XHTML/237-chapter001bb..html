<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-47"/><span class="blue">Yogurt Parfaits</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This breakfast could not be simpler. Requiring no cooking whatsoever, it’s a reminder that simple food can be really special when presented beautifully. Keep in mind that the nuts and honey can be placed into a jar, covered, and kept in a dark, cool spot for up to a few months. Use not only for layering with yogurt but also as a topping for ice cream or plain cake, or serve with cheese.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 cup nuts (I like a mixture of pine nuts, hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds, and walnuts, but use whatever you prefer), lightly toasted</p>
<p class="ingredient"><span class="font1">⅓</span> cup honey</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups (16 ounces) plain Greek yogurt</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Stir together the</strong> nuts, honey, and salt. In four clear serving vessels (juice glasses and empty jam jars both work well), evenly layer the nut-honey mixture with the yogurt in multiple layers, using about 1 inch of yogurt to ½ inch of the nut-honey mixture, depending on the size of your vessels. If you do use jam jars, you can put a lid on each parfait and store them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to serve. Or take them with you in a cooler for a wonderful breakfast picnic.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-48"/><span class="blue">Poached Winter Fruits</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Use whatever combinations of dried fruits you’d like for this, including apricots, cherries, plums, apples, prunes, ginger, or golden raisins. There’s no wrong decision here. Serve the fruits warm for breakfast or brunch, as an accompaniment for cheese, or even as dessert. A spoonful of yogurt, crème fraîche, or even ice cream would be wonderful adornments, though the fruit does stand well on its own.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 Bosc pears</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 cups dry white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">Zest of 1 orange, removed in large strips with a vegetable peeler</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 cups water</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups mixed dried fruit</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Peel the pears</strong> and cut them in half. Using a paring knife or a teaspoon, remove and discard the seeds and stem from each pear half and set the pears aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the white wine, sugar, orange zest, and bay leaf in a large saucepan along with the water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat to low so the liquid is just at a gentle simmer.</p>
<p>Add the pears to the poaching liquid and cook until they’re tender, about 15 minutes. To test for doneness, insert a paring knife into one of the pear halves—it should be able to go through with barely any resistance.</p>
<p>Add the dried fruit to the pot and cook until they’re warm and slightly plump, just another 5 minutes. Serve the pears and fruit warm in shallow bowls with some of their cooking liquid.</p></div>
