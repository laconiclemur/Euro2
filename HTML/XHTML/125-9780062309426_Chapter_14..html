<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>weets in Gascony tend to be of two varieties: the kind the average home cook might make on a whim on a Tuesday night, and the kind the average home cook would never attempt in a million years.</p>
<p class="indent">In the former camp dwell a multitude of simple, rustic cakes, tarts, and sweets. Take the <i>gâteau millasson</i>, for example: A flan of humble origins, it’s made with nothing more than corn flour, sugar, eggs, milk, and, sometimes, orange-flower water. Or consider the <i>gâteau de noix</i>, a similarly round, low-slung confection, this one made with ground walnuts. Then there’s the gâteau Basque, only slightly more complex, made with almond flour and containing a middle layer of pastry cream.</p>
<p class="indent">Even the gâteau Basque is so easy, in fact, that when I complimented the version Henri had served at his dinner, he insisted on <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144" title="144"/>coming to our house a few days later to show us how to make one. He arrived carrying all the ingredients in one of his many wicker baskets. After fifteen minutes of sifting and stirring, he popped the cake into the oven, told us to take it out in twenty-five minutes, gathered his belongings, and bid us au revoir.</p>
<p class="indent">Some time after that, Henri gave us another lesson, appearing at our door, again with his wicker basket, to demonstrate the making of an even simpler treat: <i>sucettes au caramel</i>. His basket contained the following items: an apple, some wood skewers, a box of sugar cubes, and a roll of aluminum foil. While Charlotte looked on, transfixed, Henri liquefied twenty-five sugar cubes in a saucepan until the syrup turned golden. Next he spread out a length of aluminum foil, halved the apple he’d brought, and placed each half, cut side down, on opposite ends of the foil to hold it in place. He dipped the ends of the wood skewers into the syrup, then laid each skewer onto the foil to let the caramel harden a bit. When he’d dipped ten skewers, he started over again with the first one, dipping it back into the caramel so that the deposit would build. After repeating this routine four or five times, he had ten half-dollar-size lollipops of translucent, sparkling amber. He stuck the suckers into the two apple halves, making a smart little candy-shop display.</p>
<p class="indent">Gascons have a deep fondness for easy-to-make sweets like Henri’s sucettes, and so it is all the more baffling to outsiders that the most beloved of all Gascon desserts—the strudel-pastry-topped tart known as a croustade—is not remotely easy to make. In fact, during our time in Gascony I was unable to find a single home cook who was willing to show me how to prepare one. When I asked Nadine, she said, “<i>Ouf</i>, I’ve only made two in my life, and that’s enough.”</p>
<p class="indent">The croustade—sometimes, confusingly, called a <i>pastis</i>—was once the bailiwick of grandmothers, but even in a land that resists change as fiercely as Gascony, times have done just that. Today the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145" title="145"/>making of croustades is mostly left to <i>pâtisseries</i> or, often, small-time artisans. The best croustades where we lived, it was widely agreed, came from a lady in the nearby village of Goux; she worked out of her home and, with the help of her daughter, produced six croustades per day. She occasionally did croustade-making demos at village fêtes, and, having seen one such exhibition, I can say that six croustades per day is a heroic output.</p>
<p class="indent">The vexing challenges of making a proper croustade lie, in roughly equal measure, in the correct fabrication of the building material—that is, the strudel-pastry dough—and in the construction of the tart itself. The most famously tricky part is the rolling out of the dough: A grapefruit-size ball of it must be transformed into a translucently thin sheet that’s large enough to cover a large card table—a process that demands constant but gentle tugging around the edges until the dough sheet is hanging slightly off all four sides of the table, upon which it is carefully trimmed. For the dough to withstand such extreme stretching, it has to be made with a special kind of unbleached flour, and it must be worked over like a punching bag. All the while, accommodations must be made for fluctuations in humidity, temperature, and, when working in certain environments, breezes.</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming one succeeds in stretching the dough, having taken care to avoid creating holes or other irregularities, the building of the tart itself can begin. This task requires of the baker an origami artist’s precision. The dough sheet must be cut into strips and very quickly—time being of the essence, on account of how quickly a see-through dough sheet dries out—brushed with clarified butter and laid into the bottom of a greased tart pan in an overlapping radial pattern. This done, the tart can be filled, usually with a mixture of cooked apples, sugar, and sometimes Armagnac-prune syrup (which must be made no fewer than two weeks in advance, to allow <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146" title="146"/>the prunes and sugar to properly meld). Now the baker may begin pulling the overhanging ends of the dough strips up over the filling, twisting each strip’s end in such a way as to create a shape reminiscent of a rose. Once this step has been repeated with all the dough strips, the croustade gets dusted with confectioners’ sugar (and, if desired, spritzed with Armagnac) and baked until its coiffure of strudel flower petals is crisp and golden.</p>
<p class="indent">If it all comes off, the result, it has to be said, is sublime. A true Gascon croustade is a textural masterpiece: The crackly outer layers of the petals shatter at the touch of the fork, which then travels through the strudel’s slightly softer, more caramelized precincts, into the just-barely-firm filling, and finally through the crunchy-chewy crust. An optional dollop of sweetened crème fraîche or a scoop of ice cream will introduce an unctuous medium in which the sugar-crusted pastry shards can swim and mingle. That is a beautiful sight indeed.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, as far as I know, only one country-style dessert known to the denizens of Southwest France that requires more patience in the making—if slightly less fine-motor dexterity—than the croustade. The tall, conical, hearth-baked confection known as <i>gâteau à la broche</i>, “cake on a spit,” resided at one time, like the croustade, in the culinary repertoire of many a Gascon grandmother. Believed by most locals to have originated somewhere deep in the Pyrenees—though versions of the cake show up in other parts of Europe where there are mountains—the gâteau à la broche is a relic of the open-hearth-cooking epoch. But these days, owing to a decline in old women willing to spend an entire afternoon drizzling cake batter onto a hand-turned spit in front of a very hot fire, the fabrication of this dessert has fallen almost entirely to professional bakers, who generally rely on electric or gas rotisserie ovens to do the job. Even so, store-bought cakes are very expensive, as each one requires un<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147" title="147"/>interrupted tending over several hours and, thus, a generous allocation of paid labor.</p>
<p class="indent">All that being said, a few tradition-bound holdouts making gâteau à la broche in front of <i>la</i> <i>cheminée</i> can still be found.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>HERE ARE THE INGREDIENTS FOR</small> Marinette Lagors’s gâteau à la broche: thirty-six eggs, three pounds of butter, three pounds of flour, three pounds of sugar, ten packets of vanilla-sugar, one cup of dark rum, one handful of pulverized roasted hazelnuts (preferably from your own hazelnut tree), a generous pinch of salt (preferably from an ancient tin salt cellar nailed to the kitchen wall), and six egg whites for the icing. All these supplies had been laid out on Madame Lagors’s kitchen table, suggesting a baking project of industrial proportions.</p>
<p class="indent">Marinette Lagors—no relation to Alain, the local historian—was the stepmother of Alphonse, my pal from the Esbouhats. She was ninety-four years old and lived with Alphonse’s stepbrother in Vic-en-Bigorre, a town on the main route between Plaisance and the mountains. Alphonse referred to her simply as Mamie. At one of the Esbouhats dinners, Alphonse had shown me cell-phone photos of Mamie’s homemade gâteau and had promised that he would take me to see her one day so that we could make one. What I didn’t realize until that day came was that Mamie no longer did the baking. Too frail to crack an egg, she had passed the torch to her son and stepson.</p>
<p class="indent">This gâteau à la broche—in a departure from centuries of tradition—would be an all-male undertaking.</p>
<p class="indent">When Alphonse and I arrived at Mamie’s house, his stepbrother, whose name was Michel, was out back splitting wood. He sunk the ax into a stump and came over to shake my hand. Bald and stocky, with two-day stubble and hands like catcher’s mitts, Michel was Alphonse’s coarser alter ego.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148" title="148"/>Alphonse looked at the pile of split logs and told Michel that we’d need a lot more. The two men argued about this for several minutes. Then Alphonse took me inside to meet Mamie.</p>
<p class="indent">He led me into a chintz-wallpapered living room. Mamie was asleep in an enormous recliner in front of the fireplace, her lap covered by an afghan, her toes by crocheted foot-warmers. She looked elfin and tiny.</p>
<p class="indent">Before waking her, Alphonse warned me that her hearing was poor, as was her eyesight, and that one had to shout to be heard.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse squeezed Mamie’s arm and shook it gently. A pair of bright, bead-like eyes blinked open. He leaned in close and announced that she had a guest.</p>
<p class="indent">Mamie smiled at me and reached for my hand.</p>
<p class="indent">“What a handsome young man,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="indent">I took the compliment for what it was worth.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse’s wife, Lorette, had just arrived and was in the kitchen, unpacking an enormous picnic basket containing the makings of lunch. The amount of food she was taking out augured well for the meal.</p>
<p class="indent">Michel came in, and we got started on the cake batter. It was a relatively simple one, notable mainly for how much of it there was.</p>
<p class="indent">Michel and I started cracking the eggs into an immense earthenware bowl. This took quite some time. Alphonse melted the bricks of butter in a pan and then set the pan in a cold-water bath to cool. Alphonse and Michel bickered ceaselessly—about just how cool the butter had to be before being added to the bowl, about how much sugar they had or hadn’t already used, about whether to pour in the rum before or after the hazelnuts, and, most histrionically, about how fast to add the flour. The flour-sifting, I surmised, was a long-standing source of friction between the stepbrothers. Michel, who was stirring the batter with a long wooden spoon in the same way <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149" title="149"/>one might tend to a bubbling cauldron, was urging Alphonse to dispense with the sifting altogether and just pour in the flour.</p>
<p class="indent">“Hurry up<i>, bordel</i>!” he snapped.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse ignored him and continued his sifting, the flour swirling into the thickening mixture in a cyclone pattern.</p>
<p class="indent">Bad enough to see two grown men argue over cake batter, but when it came time to prepare the cake mold—a conical length of blackened pear wood with an iron handle inserted in the blunt end—they literally came to blows, whacking each other’s hands away as they secured parchment paper around the mold with kitchen twine.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Putain</i>,” I heard Alphonse say, “you have to tie it like a roast, not a Christmas present!”</p>
<p class="indent">Now Michel started hauling in firewood. I have to say, it was some of the most expertly split wood I’d ever seen: dozens and dozens of near-identical pieces, each no wider than a baseball bat. Meanwhile, I helped Alphonse set up the spit assembly—two iron posts with cradles like upside-down coat hooks, for resting the cake mold in—over by the fireplace.</p>
<p class="indent">Lorette announced it was time to eat. The spread she had put out—in the same room where Mamie was sleeping—was a fine one indeed: sausage-and-puff-pastry canapés (which, I explained, to everyone’s amusement, were known in America as pigs in a blanket), slices of ham that Alphonse had cured himself, blinis topped with crème fraîche and smoked salmon, steamed potatoes, and <i>rouleaux</i> of beef tripe in tomato sauce.</p>
<p class="indent">The prospect of lunch seemed to cool the internecine flames. Michel and Alphonse went over to Mamie and gently woke her up. Alphonse pressed a button at the base of the recliner, and its back rose with an electric whir. Then he and Michel slid Mamie to the head of the table. Dwarfed by her enormous chair, she took on a strangely imperial air.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150" title="150"/>Alphonse served apéros: a finger of Long John whiskey for the men, a glass of white wine for Lorette, and, for Mamie, a healthy dose of Suze with crème de cassis, served in a cordial glass. Then some wine was opened, and we started in on lunch.</p>
<p class="indent">At the risk of overstating the matter, I would like to pause for a moment to marvel, once again, at the Gascon appetite. It is one thing to witness thick-necked rugby men devour great amounts of food in a short amount of time. It is quite another to see a ninety-four-year-old woman do so. The quick work Mamie made of her lunch—two helpings of everything, each portion as big as my own, though consumed in smaller pieces—constituted one of the most amazing food-vanishing acts I’d ever seen. This feat, though, was merely an example of a broader phenomenon, which is this: When it comes to eating, Gascon women are no less valiant than the men. In my experience, they do not ever order appetizers as a main course or consider a salad—even a salade Gersoise—a full dinner. They eat with the same delight and stealthy alacrity as their husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons.</p>
<p class="indent">We spent a good hour and a half at the table that afternoon, though Mamie had to have a catnap before dessert and coffee. During the meal, I learned that Alphonse and Lorette had run a funeral parlor near Paris for many years before coming back to their native Gascony to retire. This revelation was unexpected for two reasons. First, Alphonse and Lorette were the least undertaker-like people I’d ever met. Second, it is unusual to hear a Gascon mention his work. What one does for a living is, at best, a fifth- or sixth-rung conversation topic, something to fall back on after the subjects of food, wine, rugby, bullfighting, and weather have been exhausted, and usually in that order. I was flattered that Alphonse had decided to share.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151" title="151"/><small>ALPHONSE DESCRIBED THE MAKING OF</small> gâteau à la broche as a three-person job: one to turn the spit, one to drizzle the batter, one to feed the fire. Michel, he said, was going to be on fire detail. Alphonse would drizzle. I’d be the spit-turner.</p>
<p class="indent">Foretelling the nature of the toil that lay ahead, Alphonse had stripped to his undershirt. I did the same. Michel was adding more wood to the fire, banking the freshly split pieces against the back of the hearth to create a wall of heat. Mamie was snoring away, having been returned to her usual spot. A nap sounded extremely appealing.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse told me to set the parchment-covered mold into its cradle to let it heat up. After a minute or two, greasy splotches spread across the paper. Alphonse explained that this was melted butterfat from gâteaux of yore, seeping out from deep within the wood’s grain. The mold, he said, was more than one hundred years old.</p>
<p class="indent">Michel set two chairs in front of the fireplace, one for me and one for Alphonse. The hearth was small, maybe two feet wide at its opening, but Michel had turned it into a furnace. Within seconds of sitting down, I felt as if my face and kneecaps were being scorched.</p>
<p class="indent">Lorette brought Alphonse and me each a bottle of water and urged me to keep drinking while we worked.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked Alphonse how long the process would take, but he didn’t seem to hear me. He was already in the zone, carefully placing a metal drip tray underneath the mold and then situating the bowl of batter between his feet. The batter was the color and consistency of puréed bananas.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse turned to me now. In his right hand, scepterlike, was a spoon affixed to a long wooden dowel. “Do an eighth of a turn at a time,” he said. “And very slowly. Once we start, we have to keep going. If we stop, the batter will burn or fall off the mold.”</p>
<p class="indent">And so our work began.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152" title="152"/>Alphonse dipped the spoon into the batter and started depositing a thick layer of it across the top of the mold. I gave the spit an eighth of a turn. Alphonse added more batter. By the time the spit had made a full rotation, the first layer had turned golden, a little like a waffle, and the points where the batter had started to drip off the mold had become firm, like stalactites. Alphonse referred to these drippy protrusions as <i>pics</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">“Beautiful pics,” he said, “are the sign of a real gâteau à la broche.”</p>
<p class="indent">We worked without a break, pausing only long enough for Michel to lay more wood on the fire. Slowly, as more layers of batter were applied, the cake got thicker. I finished my water in short order. Lorette brought me and Alphonse small bottles of beer. I don’t recall what kind it was, but it was the most refreshing beer I’ve ever had.</p>
<p class="indent">After a while, I asked Alphonse if we could switch roles. Turning the spit was getting boring, and Mamie’s snoring had me on the verge of dozing off. I’d been studying Alphonse’s technique and had determined that the proper application of the batter required jiggling the spoon almost imperceptibly while tilting it toward the vertical in the tiniest increments as it moved from left to right along the length of the mold.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse handed me the spoon. “<i>Vas-y</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">I dipped the spoon in the batter and tipped it ever so gently over the top of the mold. The entire gooey mass fell off in an ugly glop. The batter was like liquid concrete.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse motioned for me to hand back the spoon. “It takes practice,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">This cake was too far along to risk letting an amateur screw it up.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse grew reflective after a while. “In Mamie’s day,” he said, tipping the spoon over the cake for the umpteenth time, “the women would spend a whole Sunday afternoon working like this in front of the fire while the men played cards. I can still remember that.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153" title="153"/>I suggested that the men had it pretty good.</p>
<p class="indent">“Not even grandmas have time to make gâteau à la broche anymore,” he said. Then he gave a mirthless laugh. “Just retirees.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was nearly five o’clock by the time the batter was gone. We’d been working in front of the fireplace for two and a half hours. I touched my eyebrows to make sure they were still there. The cake had grown to the size of a small Christmas tree. Alphonse wrapped his hands in dish towels and lifted the mold off its supports. He removed the handle from the base, and set the mold upright in the middle of the dining table. It was a thing to see: a three-foot-tall vertical cake, bristling with pics that had turned deep golden at the tip.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse and I stood there for a few moments, admiring our creation, then he yelled into the kitchen for Lorette to bring out the egg whites, which she’d whipped until they were very fluffy.</p>
<p class="indent">While Michel held up a bed sheet to protect Mamie, who hadn’t stirred since lunchtime, Alphonse and I whipped handfuls of the egg whites at the cake. They landed with a splat and, as the cake was still hot, cooked on contact, creating lacy patterns that looked like hoarfrost, enhancing the Christmas-tree effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Getting the gâteau home was a delicate operation. The cake couldn’t be covered or wrapped, as the airy pics broke off very easily. We carried the confection, naked to the elements, to Alphonse’s car, and I held it carefully between my knees in the passenger seat, the base of the mold planted on the floor, the tip gripped in my hands. It was the most nervous car ride I’d had since driving Charlotte home from the hospital after she was born.</p>
<p class="indent">A proper gâteau à la broche has to set for at least a couple of days before being removed from the mold. So Alphonse and I decided to unveil our dessert two days later, at the Esbouhats’ Friday night dinner. At the end of the meal, I helped him lift the cake gently from the mold and peel the parchment paper from the cavity. We <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" title="154"/>sliced the cake crosswise into rings, which we doled out on paper plates. Every cross-section of cake revealed a fine pattern of concentric inner rings, each one representing a single full turn of the spit. The pieces looked a little like a finely marbled pound cake.</p>
<p class="indent">How did it taste? Improvidently rich, which is an attribute one might reasonably expect in a dessert made with thirty-six eggs and three pounds of butter. But the cake had a surprisingly light, melt-away quality, too, and it was only mildly sweet. In fact, it could have used a dusting of confectioners’ sugar or a drizzle of honey. But I didn’t mention it.</p>
<p class="indent">The gâteau was a crowd-pleaser. Alphonse and I got quite a few compliments. At one point Basso, crumbs in his mustache, shouted to me across the table, “Eh oh! You and your boyfriend should open a bakery!”</p>
