<h2 class="rec_ttl_nosp">La Garbure de Nadine</h2>
<p class="rec_sub_ttl">Nadine’s Cabbage and White Bean Soup</p>
<p class="rec_yld">Serves 6 as a first course or light meal</p>
<p class="rec_pf">There are meatier garbures to be found—the extravagant stew in Paula Wolfert’s <i>The Cooking of South-West France</i>, for one—but this simple version from Nadine Cauzette is closer to the everyday garbures served in most Gascon homes. Dried Great Northern beans are a fine substitute for haricots Tarbais, the kind of beans used for garbure in Gascony. This soup tastes even better if made a day ahead and allowed to rest in the fridge overnight.</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>4 confit duck legs</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 cured or smoked ham hock</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>10 medium waxy potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>4 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_262" title="262"/>2 small turnips, cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 large leek, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 medium onion, quartered</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>8 ounces dried haricots Tarbais or Great Northern beans, picked through, soaked overnight, and drained</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>1 head Savoy cabbage, cored and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rec_ul"><span class="hide1">                      </span>6 garlic cloves, minced</p>
<p class="rec_ul_blsp"><span class="hide1">                      </span>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Remove the skin from the confit duck legs and set it aside for making cracklings. Warm the duck legs in a 350°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes until heated through. Let cool; pull the meat off the bones and tear it into chunks. Set the duck meat aside.</p>
<p class="rec_pf">Add 5 quarts of cold water to a large pot along with the ham hock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the ham hock, skimming frequently, until the water starts to turn cloudy, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the potatoes, carrots, turnips, leek, onion, and beans and simmer over medium-low heat for 1<span class="frnum">1</span><span class="frslash">/</span><span class="frnden">2</span> hours, skimming occasionally as necessary. Add the reserved duck confit and the cabbage and simmer for another 20 to 30 minutes, skimming occasionally. Add the garlic and simmer for 15 minutes more. Remove the ham hock, strip off the skin, pull the meat off the bone in chunks, and return the meat to the pot. Discard the bone and skin. Season the garbure with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
