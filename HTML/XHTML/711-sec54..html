<p class="nonindent">Originally from the Canary Islands, this recipe calls for cooking potatoes in the seawater that surrounds the islands. As the water evaporates, the residual salt dries into a crust around the spuds. Here, you’re mimicking the ocean with a very well-salted pot of water. The herb sauce usually only has cilantro, garlic, and oil, but I like the depth of flavor you get by mixing in parsley and a little oregano and cumin.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="head1"><strong>MOJO VERDE</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="head1"><strong>POTATOES</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 pounds mixed baby potatoes (1-inch round), scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup kosher salt</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE MOJO VERDE, PROCESS ALL OF THE</span> ingredients in a food processor until smooth, scraping the bowl occasionally. The herbs will be finely chopped and the sauce may look a bit broken.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the potatoes, cover them with 6 cups water in a large saucepan and add the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to dissolve the salt. Reduce the heat to steadily boil until extremely tender, about 30 minutes. Drain all but ¼ cup of the cooking liquid. Cook over medium-high heat, shaking the pan every few seconds, until the liquid evaporates. In the process, the potatoes will become coated in a crystal white shell of salt. Keep cooking until the saucepan is bone dry and the potatoes are covered evenly with salt. Transfer to a large bowl and shake and toss the potatoes to remove any excess salt. The crystals will flake off.</p>
<p class="indent">Serve immediately with the mojo verde.</p>
