<p class="tni">There is nothing like an Italian who loves to cook, and here is an Italian priest who loves his God, his Church, his family, and the meals he cooks. No kidding, he’s the real deal, and incidentally, he loves to eat, too. Maybe it’s the blessing he gives the food, maybe it’s the collection of great recipes he has saved through the years, or maybe it’s because he really loves to cook, but I’ve been to his table and I can tell you it’s an extraordinary dining experience.</p>
<p class="tx">But then Father Joe is the kind of guy you love to be with anyway. Such good conversation. Stories you can’t make up. Always with a smile. Always up. Always uplifting. I love him.</p>
<p class="tx">He has written many cookbooks. This one includes many rice dishes. Who knew rice had such versatility? For me over the years it was white rice or brown rice in Chinese restaurants and I drove the waiter crazy while making up my mind. Father Joe has a million little tips to offer. For example, cauliflower was never my favorite. I never ordered it. Never wanted it. It’s lower than Brussels sprouts on my vegetable taste list, but Father Joe gives us a secret about cauliflower. He agrees it’s bland, but if you combine it with the right ingredients, it has the ability to absorb other flavors. He has a rice recipe that actually turns the lowly cauliflower into a tempting, tantalizing, taste-pleasing vegetable. Now, if he can do that to a cauliflower, imagine what else he has for you. It’s another great book from a great man, a great priest, and a great cook: Father Joe Orsini.</p>
