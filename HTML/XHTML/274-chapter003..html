<p class="center">Sometimes I have a sixth sense that tells me not to leave home without a bit of nourishment. This is especially true on sunny afternoons when I don’t know where the day might take me. Once when I was working for a brief time in Australia, some friends and I planned to go horseback riding in the rainforest outside of Sydney. Getting to the horses required a few hours of travel, and before we left the house, I realized no one had mentioned anything about lunch. The only food we had in our sparsely populated refrigerator was a lonely zucchini and some eggs. I quickly made a frittata, cut it into pieces, and put them between slices of bread. I wrapped the sandwiches in waxed paper and put them in my bag. The horseback riding was a wild adventure and completely exhilarating until we all realized we were dehydrated from the hot sun and were starving. Never in my life has anything tasted better than that sandwich.</p>
<p class="center1">Anytime you leave the house you have the opportunity for a picnic, whether it’s planned or spontaneous. Even if you’re not eating outside, lunchtime is a wonderful chance to pause from a busy day. The following pages include the drinks, salads, vegetables (including a whole section on artichokes), pizzas, and soups that are best for daytime eating. It also includes my version of a <em>croque-monsieur,</em> arguably the second best sandwich in the world.</p>
