		<p class="bmpf"><span class="dropcaps2line_alt"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“T</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">his roof will last for a hundred years!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">That’s what Monsieur Ladra told us when he sold us the house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">As work on the house turned out to be more than expected (far more, to be exact), I always took great comfort in his words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">All new work was justified by </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">well, at least we won’t have to change the roof.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> We needed every-thing from new electricity to new shutters, but that’s nothing compared with changing a roof.</span></p>
		<p class="bmp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">One day the roof will have to be changed—in ninety-seven years, according to Monsieur Ladra, but probably closer to sixty or seventy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Either way, I won’t be the one doing it or living through it, and for that I am thankful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">I do think about it from time to time, though, imagining the start of work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">A team of artisans will arrive at the gates of No 1 rue de Loudenne and walk past a magnificent magnolia tree, a few little white dogs, and so many olive trees that they will wonder who on earth decided to plant so many in such little space. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">Someone will show them to the roof to assess the slate tiles and, because this is a Saturday (yes, I know, an odd day to start work on a roof, but please bear with me), they will notice crowds gathering with increasing frequency at the side of the house and disappearing into the garage next to No 1 rue de Loudenne. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6">They will hear music and laughter and will smell food. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.7">Delicious food. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.8">They will resist—but not for long, and soon they’ll find themselves inside the garage, or the No 1 Saturday Market as it will be called. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.9">They’ll walk past stalls packed with glorious vegetables, cheeses, and fruit; oyster stands bustling with talk and wine; old men selling eggs and onions; rows of breads—and finally arrive at a simply but beautifully decorated stall selling tempting but reasonably priced seasonal snacks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.10">Before they have time to order, a young man will present himself and tell them that arrangements have already been made for their lunch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.11">He will lead them through the garage, into the (by then) restored wine cellar, between rows of the finest Médoc wines, through a pantry filled with flowers and jars of jam and pork, through a little door into a large kitchen with red and white tiles and a grand fireplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.12">There will be duck breasts slowly grilling on dried grapevine branches, and a young woman will be giving a group of people from Bordeaux a wine-tasting class at the old kitchen table, the one that has always been in this house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.13">“That’s my cousin,” the young man will say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.14">“She’s a character.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.15">He will lead the artisans through the second kitchen, through the green dining room, the one with the painting of the sly fox. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.16">Then they will arrive in the harvest room where a huge table will be beautifully laid out for twenty people, filled with flowers and candles and stacks of seasonal fruits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.17">Everybody will have Champagne and radishes, with salt and thick yellow butter.</span></p>
		<p class="bmp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Puppies will be playing under the table and little children will be running around it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Soon a handsome man in his fifties will appear from the “</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">boucherie</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">” holding a big bowl of gazpacho. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">“That’s my father,” the young man will say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">“He is a fabulous cook; he grew up in the kitchen and knows my great-grandmother’s recipes better than anyone.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">Then they will have grilled meat and garlic potatoes and drink great wine served by the young woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.5">The lunch will last for hours, and at the end of it, the young man will tell the artisans to take the day off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.6">“But don’t tell my great-aunt Louise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.7">She’s not here today, but she’s kind of strict.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.8">Then the artisans will head home, well fed and happy, ready to commence the work in earnest on Monday.</span></p>
		<p class="bmp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Some weeks later, a group of people, many of them family, will be gazing up at the newly tiled roof from amongst the olive trees in the garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">They will admire the work silently until one of them says, “I bet this will last for a hundred years.”</span></p>
