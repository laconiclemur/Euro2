<p class="nonindent">In Madrid, torrijas are traditionally reserved for Easter as a post-Lenten dessert and traditionally made with leftover baguettes. I like to use brioche or other egg breads, such as challah, for an even richer dessert. The custard-soaked egg bread develops a delicate lushness that resembles bread pudding. I like to take it even one step further by bruléeing sugar on top for a crunchy crust. It actually tempers the cinnamon custard’s sweetness because the burnt sugar takes on a bittersweet edge. This dessert-for-brunch dish beats any typical French toast.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">BRING THE CREAM, HALF-AND-HALF, LEMON</span> zest, orange zest, and cinnamon to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. While the mixture heats, whisk the eggs and ¼ cup sugar in a large bowl. Slowly add the hot liquid to the egg mixture in a steady stream, whisking constantly.</p>
<p class="indent">Lay the brioche slices in a single layer in glass or ceramic baking dishes. Slowly and evenly pour the egg-cream mixture over the bread, scattering the zest and cinnamon evenly over the bread. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Uncover the soaked brioche and discard the zest and cinnamon. Heat a thin sheen of clarified butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add a single layer of soaked brioche slices and cook, turning once, until evenly browned on both sides and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a half-sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining brioche slices, coating the skillet with clarified butter between batches. If the brioche browns before the center is heated through, reduce the heat.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar evenly on top of each cooked slice. Using a kitchen blowtorch, caramelize the sugar on each piece of brioche as you would crème brulée. Serve immediately.</p>
