<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">SPAIN’S A HOT COUNTRY, SO EVERYONE’S ALWAYS</span> looking for something cool to drink. Beer’s an obvious choice, but you can’t very well drink beer all day. That’s why the panaché is so popular. It’s more or less 50/50 beer and lemon soda. At Cúrate, we combine a lager with Fever Tree’s Bitter Lemon Soda. If we’re serving panaché to a big party, we recommend trying the porrón. It’s like a watering can to quench your thirst. It’s usually used for wine, but because it takes some skill to pour that arc of alcohol into your mouth from a distance, we swapped clothes-staining red wine for light-colored panaché. Our guests love passing the porrón around the table and taking shots at drinking. It’s a fun party game you can try at home. You can buy a nice porrón online or in specialty stores.</p>
<p class="indent">For straight-up beer, we don’t head across the Atlantic for our bar selection. In Spain, you get whatever regional lager is on draft. (There’s usually only one.) In that spirit, we get our beer from Asheville, which produces so many different varieties of craft brews. From downtown extending out to West Asheville, breweries seem to pop up overnight. There are often two or more on a single block, converted from old manufacturing warehouses or built in new developments. The variety is as impressive as the quality. A lot of Spain’s big flavors, particularly the savory ones, taste even better with a cold glass of beer.</p>
