			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page63a">Meat and Poultry Terrines and Pâtés</h2>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The only rational translation of <em class="ital">pâté</em> into English is “pie”: A <em class="ital">pâté de foie gras</em> is not liver paste. It is a whole, fat goose liver enclosed in pastry. A <em class="ital">terrine de foie gras</em> is whole liver prepared in a terrine without pastry. In serious restaurants, <em class="ital">pâté</em> on a menu still means “enclosed in pastry.” Outside of that rarefied atmosphere, the confusion is so total—<em class="ital">pâté</em> can mean meatloaf, liver paste, or dog-food, and <em class="ital">pâté en croûte</em> means <em class="ital">pâté</em>—that it is not worthwhile even to attempt to respect the terminology.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To me, a true <em class="ital">pâté</em> represents an excessive amount of work to produce something that is no better than—and rarely as good as—a terrine. French puff paste (<em class="ital">pâte feuilletée,</em> not <em class="ital">pâte à choux</em>), in fact, does not rank among the foods I most worship—but, in fairness to the thing, it should be noted that it is rarely made with pure butter, often with none, and almost never with an unpasteurized, absolutely fresh, delicately perfumed, sweet butter of irreproachable quality. It is not only cheaper, but also much easier to work with margarine or other laboratory fat products and the visual result is handsomer. The taste is horrid. Furthermore, in the instance of <em class="ital">pâtés,</em> the essential spread of firmly bound forcemeat—<em class="ital">mousseline</em> or other—that rapidly forms a seal, preventing the meat juices from penetrating to the pastry and transforming it into a soggy mess, is often forgotten. A <em class="ital">pâté,</em> correctly prepared, belongs strictly to the realm of professional <em class="ital">grande cuisine</em> (interested visitors to Paris should visit the young chef Claude Peyrot in his restaurant, Le Vivarois. He is a great <em class="ital">saucier</em> and a great pastry chef—a practically unheard-of combination—and, unlike a number of world travelers, never leaves his kitchens).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page64">The complexly organized <em class="ital">pâtés</em> and terrines of <em class="ital">la grande cuisine</em> (and largely of the past) are composed of a variety of different meats, each of which is often marinated or precooked in a different way to underline differences in character and then layered in a variety of interrelationships, alternating with two or more forcemeats, also of markedly separate characters. These <em class="ital">pâtés</em> depend, for their particular refinement, on the fine balance of intermingling and separation of flavors and textures. Typical and, perhaps, the most celebrated of its type—Dumaine revived it—is Lucien Tendret’s <em class="ital">L’Oreiller de la Belle Aurore,</em> or Lovely Aurora’s Pillow (Claudine-Aurore Récamier was Brillat-Savarin’s mother). This dish takes its name from the pillow-like form of the <em class="ital">pâté,</em> but, in passing, may be thought to harbor a mute reference to the lady’s disinclination to leave her bed where, but for the hours of sleep, she spent most of her time eating. Upon a rectangular base of puff paste, the basic dough of which has been flavored with Cognac and strengthened by the addition of egg white, two forcemeats (one identical to that of the following rabbit terrine recipe; the second, but for the addition of finely chopped mushrooms sautéed in butter, finely chopped truffles, and the stronger-flavored partridge livers, similar to the following chicken-liver terrine recipe), beginning and finishing with the first, are alternated with layers in varying combinations of strips of partridge, hare, duck, chicken, veal, and pork fillets and parboiled sweetbreads (truffle pieces, pistachios, and slivers of raw, cured ham being packed into each of these layers). The pillow covering is formed by another sheet of the same pastry (in which small, circular air vents have been cut) sealed to the borders of the basic rectangle. The “pie” is baked for two hours, and a firm meat aspic, enriched with the partridge, hare, and poultry carcasses, is poured in through the air vents while the <em class="ital">pâté</em> is still hot. It is served chilled.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page65">A simple terrine, based on a single forcemeat and a single meat garnish, is never so good as when prepared in the easiest possible way, all of the ingredients of the composition mixed, pell-mell but intimately, together.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page65a">Chopping</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Meats that are ground or chopped mechanically are always crushed. The fibrous structure of the flesh is broken, the succulent juices originally imprisoned within this structure escape, and therefore the forcemeat is always pastier in texture and drier than when composed of meats chopped by hand. The forcemeat, moreover, gains in character when the different meats in its composition are chopped more or less finely, lending a varied texture to the whole.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To chop meat by hand, scrape it free from all fragments of tendon, nervous tissue, or skin, cut it first into thin strips, cut the strips crosswise into tiny cubes, then chop, carefully and slowly at first, keeping the point of the knife in fulcrum-contact with the chopping block. When the meat is reduced to small enough pieces to form a cohesive mass, fragments of which will not fly in all directions, begin chopping more rapidly, using, preferably, two large “chef’s” knives of the same size and weight, one in each hand, held somewhat above the board, chopping firmly, but not violently, with alternate knives in a rhythmic, loose-wristed motion. As the chopped mass is flattened out, regularly fold it over on itself with the blade of a knife, turn it over on the board, and begin again, continuing to fold, turn over, and chop until the desired degree of fineness is achieved. If you do not have knives of the same size and weight, chop with one hand only—the rhythm is lost with unequal weights.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page66">I have tried a number of alternatives to hand-chopping, but I can only say this: Mechanical chopping will produce good results (all restaurant terrines are, after all, made in this way) and, I confess, some of my guests have been unable to discern the difference; the difference is, nonetheless, very marked. It is a question of whether you, the reader, will be satisfied with a decent product or whether you prefer something sublime . . . The poorest results are those of meat-grinders—a massacre—and, in my experience, the best are those of the electrical, whirring-bladed robot-cutters, although the violence of the latter tends to reduce a part of the meat to purée before the whole is sufficiently chopped—the work is done in the space of a few seconds.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page66a">General Composition</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Meat and poultry terrines are all made in pretty much the same way: The tender pieces of meat are left whole or cut into relatively large pieces to lend variety to the texture and are usually marinated (very often in Cognac, which lends a false, slightly rotten, gamey taste and renders the terrine indigestible—a good <em class="ital">eau de vie</em> is a valuable flavoring agent but should be incorporated only just before cooking); tougher flesh containing tendons or nervous tissue is chopped and usually combined with a certain amount of blandly flavored meat—veal or pork or both—to form the base of the forcemeat; liver lends smoothness to the texture and support to the egg binding; chopped or cubed pork fat (often about three times as much as the proportions given in any of the following recipes) is incorporated to nourish the forcemeat and prevent its drying out; breadcrumbs are too often not added but, if measured discreetly—about one ounce of crumbs per pound of flesh—so that its presence is imperceptible, it will always lend a gratifying lightness to the body of the terrine; in addition to salt, spices, and herbs, garlic, onion, pistachios, truffles, and the currently fashionable green peppercorns may lend aromatic support. The tender, unripened peppercorns are available tinned, but they are much more interesting in their highly perfumed fresh state; in Paris, M. Paul Corcellet, whose exotic foods shop at 46 rue des Petits-Champs is probably the most fantastic of its kind in the world, flies them in fresh from Madagascar, vacuum packs them in plastic envelopes, and deep freezes them. If this has not yet occurred to an American packager, it will soon.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page67">A terrine mixture should contain only that liquid rigorously essential to its flavor; soaking breadcrumb in milk, for instance, only adds to the liquid content and the milk adds nothing to the quality, whereas a highly reduced, gelatinous stock not only heightens the flavor, but also, when the terrine is cooled, lends binding support to the forcemeat. And when a marinade is called for, its quantity should be limited to just that necessary to moisten the surfaces of the meat pieces, well turned around in it.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The terrine is always lined and the contents covered with thin sheets of fresh fat pork, which, serving the same function as the chopped or cubed fat in the mixture, forms a wrapping that facilitates serving. The four-sided envelope of fat, however, should be removed from each slice at the time of serving. English and American cookbooks often recommend substituting slices of bacon for the sheets of fat pork, but, in fact, the quarrelsome, smoky presence will slur the clean definition of most flavors. I think of two exceptions: (1) <em class="ital">Guinea jowl</em> unites happily with bacon to the advantage of both (a terrine of guinea fowl may be prepared exactly like that of rabbit, the skinned breast being cut up like the rabbit fillets, the remainder of the flesh as well as a couple of supplementary chicken livers being passed into the forcemeat, the terrine lined with bacon strips); and (2) <em class="ital">Veal,</em> whose bland and impersonal, submissive character assumes and flatters that of many a more aggressive ally. (A number of years ago, M. René Viaux introduced at the Relais Paris-Est a veal and American-sliced bacon terrine baptized <em class="ital">terrine de body</em>—“body” being Berry dialect for veal—that has since become something of a classic. It consists in filling a bacon-lined terrine with alternate layers of very thin veal cutlets, rindless bacon slices laid lengthwise, and a mixture of finely chopped onions, chopped parsley, freshly ground pepper, and crumbled, dried herbs, finishing with a layer of bacon, dribbling a bit of white wine over the surface, and baking in a slow oven—about 1¾ hours at 325° for 1½ pounds each of veal and bacon. It is cooled under weight and, inasmuch as there is no forcemeat binding, it must be served well chilled to ensure the slices’ remaining intact.)</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page68">With the exception of the so-called <em class="ital">pâtés de campagne,</em> which are usually baked, mounded up, like American meatloaves, often wrapped in pig’s caul rather than sheets of fat (for a typical <em class="ital">pâté de campagne,</em> double the pork-fat content, limit the meats to two parts of cheap cuts of pork to one of veal plus a piece of pork liver, grind everything up together, season and bind as for the rabbit terrine—bake for two hours), these terrines are always cooked in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> and should be cooled under weight, the better to ensure a compact, non-crumbly body, easy to slice and to serve. No one has yet bothered to invent a terrine with a reversible lid that could serve as well to weight the contents; boards should be cut to the inside dimensions of each terrine for this purpose. For small terrines, a heavy piece of cardboard may be cut to the inside dimensions and wrapped in aluminum foil. Place unopened tin cans on top for weights.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page68a" style="page-break-before:always;">Rabbit Terrine</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Terrine de Lapin</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Any small game, furred or feathered, may replace the rabbit in this recipe—with glorious results. The ham, although still welcomed by wild rabbit, pheasant, partridge, or wild duck, no longer plays an essential supporting role in relation to those flavors, all more distinctive than that of domesticated rabbit, and it could be replaced by a supplement of pork, veal, or the primary element. Rabbits have large livers; terrines made of game birds or duck need the addition of a couple of chicken livers.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Of domesticated breeds of ducks, the barbary duck or one of the sterile hybrids is the most interesting. Our dependence on freezers has all but wiped out, on the American market, any competition to the depressingly fat, deep-frozen Long Island ducks. They are, happily, serviceable in the fabrication of a terrine: All of the fat is contained in the skin itself or, loose, in the abdomen; the flesh is lean, but, once the skin has been peeled off and discarded, there is not much of it. Two ducks should be used to replace the rabbit in this recipe, the breasts being cut up, the legs and flesh scrapings chopped for the forcemeat, and the carcasses converted into a stock. The livers of deep-frozen Long Island ducks have an inexplicably strong and acrid taste and should be discarded, only chicken livers being used in the forcemeat.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page69">The marination of game or duck is a question of personal taste; the bland flavor of domesticated rabbit can ill do without it, but I, personally, prefer not to marinate meats of more pronounced character. Any of these terrines will gain in depth by the addition of cut-up truffles or chopped truffle peelings. They should either be marinated with the meats or mixed with the basic forcemeat (eggs and Cognac added later) and refrigerated overnight, covered by plastic, to permit the maximum penetration of their perfume before cooking. If they are conserved, add their liquid to the stock while reducing it.</p>
			<p class="Normal">This recipe will fill 2 quart-sized terrines and will provide about 20 servings—or, perhaps, a great deal less if the guests are left to their own devices.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Make an incision the length of the rabbit’s back to each side of the spinal ridge and carefully remove the filets (the elongated muscles stretching from the beginning of the rib cage to the tail), loosening them with a sharp paring knife, following closely the contours of the vertebrae. Remove the filets mignons (much smaller corresponding muscles clinging to the inside of the spinal column). Detach the tender, fleshy white meat from the bones of the hind legs. Cut the filets crosswise into slices of from ⅓ to ½ inch thick and cut the meat from the legs into similar-sized pieces. Mix well with the elements of the marinade and leave, covered, in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove the remaining flesh (except for the neck and the head) from the bones, scraping with a knife, and put it aside, along with the heart, liver, and lungs, to be chopped. Break or cut up the carcass and add it, along with the head, the neck, and the rinds, to the water, bring slowly to a boil, skim off the foam, add all the other ingredients, and cook, the lid slightly ajar, at a bare simmer, for from 2½ to 3 hours. Strain the liquid, leave it to settle, carefully skim off the fat, bring back to a boil, and, keeping the saucepan a bit to the side of the flame so that a light boil continues only at one side of the surface, remove the fatty skin that forms, drawing it to the far side with a tablespoon; repeat this action several times over a period of 20 minutes or so. Turn the flame high and reduce rapidly, stirring, and, at a halfway point, transfer to your smallest saucepan. Reduce until the stock has passed the foamy boil and begins to make slurry sounds, the body noticeably thick and sticky. A scant half cup should remain.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page71">Pound the garlic to a purée in the mortar, mix with the breadcrumbs, pour over the boiling stock and work to a thick sticky paste with the pestle.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Parboil the pistachios for a couple of minutes, rub them vigorously in a towel to loosen the skins, peel and chop them coarsely.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Combine all of the elements of the forcemeat and mix thoroughly with your hands, squeezing the mixture through your fingers. Then add the pieces of rabbit meat and continue to mix and squeeze . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">Line the sides and bottoms of the terrines with the sheets of fat pork, pressing them firmly, fill with the mixture and tap the bottom of each terrine, smartly, two or three times against a wooden table top (or other surface softened by a couple of layers of towel) to be certain that the contents are well settled. Place one or two bay leaves on the surface of each, gently press a sheet of fat pork over all, cover, and cook in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> (the terrine placed in a larger receptacle—a cake tin, for instance—which is filled with boiling water so as to immerse the terrines by about two thirds) in a 325° to 350° oven, counting 1½ to 1¾ hours. The terrines are done when the center is firm to the touch and when, if pierced by a trussing needle, the juice that appears is completely transparent.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove the lids, place boards cut to the inside dimensions on each surface with approximately 1½ pounds of weight on each. Juices may run over the sides, so it is best to place the terrines in a shallow container while cooling. Allow to cool completely—several hours or overnight—before removing the weights and, unless the terrines are to be consumed within two or three days, pour a layer of melted lard over the surface of each, return the lids, and refrigerate. The flavor will improve if they are left for at least three or four days and, protected by the layer of lard, one may be kept, uncut, for a couple of weeks.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page72" style="page-break-before:always;">Terrine of Veal Sweetbreads</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Terrine de Ris de Veau</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">The mode is now on the decline (chicken in vinegar, bass in pastry, and duck with green peppercorns having risen to stardom) but, during the 1960’s, sweetbread terrines proliferated on the menus of France’s fashionable restaurants. They were all poor, vapid things, underseasoned (except for one master who leant heavily on the cayenne) but, otherwise, mysteriously defying analysis: white, parboiled sweetbreads trapped in a white and remarkably insipid sort of <em class="ital">panade</em>—wrapped in their white cloaks of pork fat; the only relief for the eye was the caramel color of the chopped commercial jelly garnish and, for the palate, there was none.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Finally, I think that sweetbreads lend themselves best to hot preparations, but the idea of a sweetbread terrine has always appealed to me—it still does—and I am convinced that a respectable result depends on their being first braised in a richly flavored stock. The fragility of sweetbreads cannot permit their being mixed roughly into the general composition as one does with the rabbit. For variation, add to the forcemeat a handful of chopped spinach (first parboiled for a couple of minutes, refreshed under cold running water, and squeezed repeatedly to rid the mass of all possible liquid) or a half cup of stiff <em class="ital">duxelles,</em> a chicken breast, skinned and cut into pieces, or, as in the preceding recipe, skinned and coarsely chopped pistachios. A sweetbread terrine is accompanied to perfection by a sorrel mousse.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Tinned truffles, the container of which is filled to the brim with a brownish liquid, have been boiled in water before being sterilized and rarely retain much perfume. The best conserves contain very little liquid—the fresh truffles are sterilized directly with only a small addition of fortified wine, usually Madeira.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The following proportions will give two 1-quart terrines.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Soak the sweetbreads in cold water for 2 or 3 hours, changing it a couple of times. Cover them well with cold water in a large saucepan, bring to a boil over a medium flame, simmer for 5 or 6 minutes, drain, and plunge them into a basin of cold water. Peel off the loosened surface membrane, all fat, and the tubelike cartilaginous material, but leave the connecting membranes that hold the sections together. Arrange the sweetbreads flat, side by side, between two towels placed on a board. Place another board on top, weight it (3 or 4 pounds), and leave for several hours.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page74">Mix together all of the elements of the forcemeat except for the breadcrumbs, the eggs, and the wine, and leave, covered, for several hours (or refrigerate overnight), permitting the truffles’ perfume to permeate the mixture.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Choose a heavy pot, preferably copper or earthenware, just large enough to contain the sweetbreads arranged side by side on the bottom. Cook all the elements of the <em class="ital">mirepoix</em> in butter over low heat, stirring from time to time, for about ½ hour; they should not brown. Arrange the sweetbreads on the bed of vegetables, pour over the stock (which has been melted with the truffle juice), bring to the boiling point, and cook, covered, at a bare murmur for about 45 minutes. Remove the sweetbreads to a plate and pass the sauce through a strainer, pressing well to extract all cooking juices, but without passing the vegetables into the sauce. Lift off any fat on the surface, return to a boil and, over a period of from 10 to 15 minutes, keep at a light boil to one side of the saucepan, pulling the fatty skin that forms on the surface to the other side with a tablespoon and removing it. Reduce over a high flame, stirring constantly, to bring the liquid to the consistency of a heavy <em class="ital">demi-glace</em>—about ½ cup or slightly more should remain; then add the breadcrumbs and work into a firm, sticky paste.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Add the crumb-stock paste, the eggs, and the Madeira to the forcemeat mixture and mix thoroughly, using your hands. Spread half the forcemeat into the bottom of the fat-lined terrine (or terrines). Press the sweetbreads regularly into place. Fill the terrines with the remaining forcemeat, tap to settle the contents, place a bay leaf on the surface, press a sheet of fat over the surface, and cook in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> as for the rabbit terrine, but counting only about 1¼ hours, the sweetbread core being already cooked. Cool under weight and, if to be kept for more than 4 or 5 days, pour melted lard over the surface.</p>

If you have veal stock on hand, use it—or a leftover <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> or <em class="ital">poule-au-pot</em> broth. Otherwise, make up a solid, vulgar stock out of pork and veal bones, beef, pork, and veal parings, chicken backs and necks, etc. A veal knuckle will lend sufficient gelatinous content or, lacking that, add a pig’s foot. Prepare it as usual, the meats and bones covered with cold water, brought slowly to a boil, skimmed several times. Add a pound of carrots, an onion stuck with a couple of cloves, a head of garlic, and a big bouquet garni packed with leek greens, celery, thyme, bay leaf, any other herbs that meet your fancy, and, by all means, if available, a branch of lovage, and coarse salt.

Work gently and unhurriedly so as not to damage or tear the liver. Marinate, covered and refrigerated, overnight or for up to 24 hours, turning the liver around in the marinade two or three times during this period.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Wrap the liver firmly in a square of cloth and tie it tightly. Place it in an oval <em class="ital">cocotte,</em> pour over the marinade, including the solid elements, the Cognac, and the melted stock—the liver should be largely submerged. Bring to the boiling point, skim, and cook, the lid slightly ajar, at the slightest suggestion of a simmer, for about 1¾ hours (2 hours or slightly over for a larger bulk of liver). Leave to cool until tepid, then remove and unwrap the liver and place it in a terrine just large enough to contain it. Pour the liquid through a strainer lined with a tightly woven cloth; it will take its time and should not be forced, but, as the weave becomes clogged with sediment, rearrange the cloth slightly so the liquid contacts new areas. Skim off any fat that may have settled on the surface. The jelly will probably have to be reduced a bit—taste for seasoning and put a tea-spoonful in a small container in the coldest part of the refrigerator to check its firmness in gelatin. If, after reduction, the stock seems still somewhat troubled, pass it a second time through a cloth—the jelly should be limpid but, for a preparation of this kind, it need not be crystalline. When you are satisfied with the stock, pour it over the liver. Chill for a day before serving. If traces of fat appear on the surface, they may be wiped off with a cloth dampened in hot water. Serve sliced, the cross-sectional view studded with the squares of fat.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">It was the beauty of a terrine Chez-Barrier in Tours that launched me on the series of experiments that have resulted in this recipe—totally different, however, from M. Barrier’s. His, which he calls a mousse, contains, I suspect, proportionately more cream and egg and certainly no marrow (another fatty substance—probably grated pork fat—is surely present). It also contains dried currants, soaked, I think, in port wine. Chez-Barrier, the raisins seemed to me to lend an exciting note, but, on the two occasions that I attempted to introduce them into my own experiments, I found the result distinctly disagreeable.</p>

In fact, Tendret’s only indication is that it should be composed of chicken livers, marrow, <em class="ital">panade,</em> and egg. The present mixture, uncooked, is completely liquid, which, when prepared as a terrine, presents no problem, but if it were to be a workable element in the mounting layers of a <em class="ital">pâté,</em> it would have to be much firmer.

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Terrines de Poisson</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Fish terrines are deservedly fashionable in France today. The formulas, but for the garnish, vary little, the basic forcemeat being nearly always a <em class="ital">mousseline</em> of pike or whiting, sometimes of salmon (raw flesh pounded in a mortar or reduced to a purée in an electrical robot-cutter, egg whites and seasonings worked in, passed through a fine sieve, chilled on cracked ice, heavy cream worked into it vigorously and in small quantities at a time, the last part of the cream being lightly whipped before being beaten in—for cold terrines, about 12 ounces flesh, 2 egg whites, and 1½ cups heavy cream are good proportions, and a pinch of cayenne will give it a lift); chopped truffles, chopped pistachios, poached cubed or cut-up scallops, lobster, or shrimps, or skinned and rapidly sautéed eel filets are common internal garnishes; sorrel or tomato mousses are good accompaniments. The Haeberlin brothers (the Auberge de 1’Ill in Illhaeusern, Alsace) serve a terrine of sole filets enveloping a pike <em class="ital">mousseline</em> studded with truffles and lobster that is of great delicacy; Michel Guérard accompanies an eel <em class="ital">pâté</em> with a watercress mousse that forms an original, and happy, alliance; a terrine of mine I particularly like consists of adding a healthy cupful of puréed raw sea-urchin coral to a basic whiting forcemeat before sieving it and incorporating a handful of chopped pistachios at the same time as the cream. The terrine is lined with sole filets as in the following recipe, and the clean but fragile note of urchin sweetness proscribes any accompaniment other than a trembling fish jelly.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page83">None of these preparations is complicated in execution, but the reader may feel that the following recipe is still less demanding; it involves neither sieving nor working over cracked ice, and the slight coarseness of moist texture, the directness of taste, and the separateness of flavors have a charm that may please those who weary at times of ultimate refinements.</p>
			<p class="Normal">This terrine need not necessarily be masked in jelly, in which case the preparation of a fish <em class="ital">fumet</em> may be eliminated (the breadcrumbs being merely soaked in hot water and squeezed thoroughly dry).</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Cover the fish carcasses well with cold water, bring slowly to a boil, skim off all the gray scum that rises to the surface, add the remaining ingredients, except for the white wine, and simmer, the lid slightly ajar, for about 15 minutes. Add the white wine, return to a boil, and continue to cook, lid ajar, at a simmer for another 20 minutes. Pour the contents into a large sieve, straining thoroughly, but without pressure, and reduce the liquid over a medium-high flame by about one third. Set aside the cup necessary for the <em class="ital">panade</em> and refrigerate the remaining <em class="ital">fumet</em> until the following day.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc">The Forcemeat</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Stew the chopped onion in butter, over very low heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 or 25 minutes, until soft and slightly yellowed. Then add the mushrooms (which have been chopped or put through the Mouli-juliènne only the moment before) and seasonings, turn the flame up, and toss regularly until the mushrooms have lost all their water and the mixture has returned to a dry, firm consistency, stir in the chopped parsley, cook for another minute or so over a low flame, remove from the heat, and stir in a few drops of lemon juice.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Boil the cupful of <em class="ital">fumet</em> with the breadcrumbs, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon, until reduced to a consistent, fairly stiff paste.</p>

			<h3 class="Misc" id="page86">Assembly</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Soak the sole filets for a few minutes in ice-cold water, spread them out on paper toweling, sponge them gently dry and press each firmly, but without violence, with the side of a large knife blade to slightly flatten it out. Make several shallow incisions diagonally on the skin side of each filet with a sharp knife. Line a generously buttered, rectangular, 2-quart terrine (the bottom and sides, but not the ends) with the filets, slightly overlapping, the flesh side pressed into place against the buttered sides of the terrine, the skin side visible, the tips of the filets hanging over the edges of the terrine sides, and spoon in the forcemeat, spreading it evenly and mounding the surface. Rap the bottom of the terrine smartly several times against a towel-muffled tabletop to settle the contents and fold the filet tips, one by one, over the surface of the forcemeat (depending on the proportions of the terrine, they may or may not completely enclose the forcemeat; if not, several filets should be halved at a sharp bias and pressed into place to complete the enclosure, their tips tucked down inside those of the other filets, against the body of the forcemeat, before the other tips are folded into place).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Press a sheet of buttered parchment paper or aluminum foil over the surface, cover with the lid, and cook in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> (using a fairly deep container, which should contain enough hot, but not boiling, water to immerse the terrine by three quarters) in a medium oven (about 350° to 375°) for approximately 45 minutes, or until the surface of the terrine is firm and springy to the touch. Leave to cool until only tepid and unmold, first placing a pastry grill over the surface and turning it and the terrine upside down as if to unmold the contents (this is in order to drain off loose liquid) and turning it right side up again after draining, before unmolding onto the serving platter. Press plastic wrap over the entire surface to protect it from contact with air and refrigerate until the following day.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc" id="page87">The Jelly</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The fish <em class="ital">fumet,</em> depending on the varieties of fish used in its confection, will be more or less lightly jelled and the sediment will have settled to the bottom of the bowl. Carefully remove all traces of fat from the surface of the <em class="ital">fumet</em> and from the sides of the bowl and spoon the lightly jelled <em class="ital">fumet</em>—only that part which is limpid (about two thirds) into a saucepan. (It may be clarified by whisking it with beaten egg whites until a boil is reached and simmering it for a quarter of an hour before straining it through a tightly woven towel but (1) clarification tends to somewhat emasculate the jelly; (2) there should be enough limpid <em class="ital">fumet</em> without having recourse to clarification; and (3) the troubled <em class="ital">fumet</em> remaining in the bottom of the bowl is perfectly good for the confection of a fish sauce for another preparation.) Dissolve the gelatin in a small amount of warmed <em class="ital">fumet</em> in a small saucepan, heat it, stirring, until a boil is reached, and incorporate it into the remainder, also first warmed. Test it for firmness by placing a spoonful in a small container (metal will take faster) in the coldest part of the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so (or on cracked ice in the refrigerator); it should be fairly firm in view of the fact that sherry will be added to it. Taste the jelly for salt and, when it is only barely tepid, stir in the sherry, adding it in two or three doses and tasting before adding more—its presence should not be aggressive.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour about ¼ cup of the liquid jelly into a small bowl, preferably metallic, embedded in cracked ice, stir with a tablespoon until it begins to turn syrupy, and spoon it rapidly over the fish loaf, returning it then to the coldest part of the refrigerator for from 5 to 10 minutes, or until the film of jelly has well set. Begin again and, when a well-set film covers the entire surface, mix a table–spoonful of liquid jelly with the chopped parsley, form a ribbon of parsley the length of the loaf, return until the jellied parsley is set, and continue coating with jelly and returning to the refrigerator until all of the jelly has been used. Keep well chilled until serving. The loaf will not only be masked in jelly but also surrounded by a mirror of jelly over which may be scattered a <em class="ital">chiffonade</em> of tender lettuce leaves for the sake of presentation. Serve the tomato cream in a sauceboat apart, placing a spoonful to the side of each slice of terrine when served out.</p>
			<h3 class="Misc">The Whipped Tomato Cream</h3>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Stew the tomatoes, salted, and herbs over a low flame, stirring to prevent sticking, until all superfluous liquid is evaporated. Pass through a fine sieve, leave to cool, stir in the pepper and lemon juice and mix thoroughly with the cream, which has been first whipped until nearly stiff. Taste for seasoning.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page89">Roast the chicken, seasoned and basted with butter, for about 45 minutes or until the legs are only just done (the point at which, if the thigh, at the thickest part, is pierced with a trussing needle, exudes a transparent juice) and leave to cool until only warm. Remove the skin from the legs and breast and scrape the bones free of the flesh (this should leave a good pound of flesh—the remainder of the carcass and the cooking juices may enrich a pilaf). Pound the flesh in a mortar (or purée it in an electrical robot cutter), adding in small quantities at a time about half of the meat jelly (melted, but not hot). Season (only a suggestion of nutmeg, freshly ground) and put through a food mill (the cooked flesh offers too much resistance to be passed by hand through a sieve), work in the remaining jelly, beating the purée vigorously, and, finally, incorporate the cream, half whipped (if whipped until stiff, the mousse will have a dry, cottony quality). Spread into the bottom of a glass or crystal bowl designed to throw into relief the bands of rose, pale green, and white of the tiered mousses and refrigerate.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Spread the sorrel mousse over the surface of the firm chicken mousse and refrigerate again until it, in turn, is firm.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cook the chopped onion gently in butter for 15 to 20 minutes, until soft and lightly yellowed, add the white wine, reduce over a high flame until nearly dry, add the tomatoes, sugar, and seasonings, and cook at a simmer for about ½ hour, stirring occasionally. Then add half of the meat jelly, reduce the mixture by half at a rapid boil, stirring, pass it through a fine sieve with a wooden pestle, and stir in the remaining jelly. Place the bowl over cracked ice and stir the contents until they begin to turn syrupy; then, just before the jelling point, fold in the cream, half whipped. Pour over the surface of the sorrel mousse and return to the refrigerator to set completely before gently pouring over a layer of liquid, room-temperature meat jelly. Leave to set for several hours or overnight before serving.</p>
