When done right, an artful bite can tell a more vivid story than an entire plate. As a chef, that’s a tantalizing challenge.”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes about 22 rolls  </span>The bread at the restaurant was something we put a lot of thought into. I feel that the bread “course” at a good restaurant really sets the stage for your meal. It can’t be an afterthought—it has to be at the same level as the rest of your food. The final three ideas for the bread were: soft pretzel rods with three mustards, black pepper brioche muffins with caramelized onion butter, and potato rolls with sea salt and butter. We found that the combination of the potato rolls with the caramelized onion butter was the best.  So thank you, Jenny McCoy, for the amazing recipe.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Caramelized Onion Butter</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Place just enough oil in a 3-quart saucepot to cover the bottom of the pan and set the skillet over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the onion to the pot. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the natural sugars in the onion have caramelized (add a little water from time to time if the onion begins to stick). Transfer the onion to a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer the onion puree to a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl and set a light weight, such as a can, on top of the onion to press out any excess liquid. Let the puree cool.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Place the puree in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add the butter, chives, and parsley. Mix on high speed until completely combined. Transfer the Caramelized Onion Butter to a pastry bag or a resealable bag with one corner snipped off, and pipe the butter into small butter dishes. Top with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt. Cover and refrigerate until needed. The butter can be made up to 1 week ahead of time.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Place the potatoes in a large pot and add enough water to generously cover them. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and cook the potatoes until fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and while they are still warm, peel them and pass them through a ricer. Allow the potatoes to cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page38"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cooled potatoes, egg, yeast, and milk. Mix on medium-low speed until well combined.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and kosher salt, and add the dry ingredients to the potato mixture. Replace the paddle attachment on the mixer with the dough hook, and knead on medium-low speed for 5 to 7 minutes or until the dough is pliable and elastic (when you try to rip a piece off, it will stretch before it tears). Add the butter, and continue to mix with the dough hook until the butter is fully incorporated. If the dough is still sticky, add additional flour as needed, a little bit at a time, just until the dough is smooth. </p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350°F; position the rack in the middle. Line 2 baking sheets with a Silpat or parchment paper.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>One day my sous-chef, Chris, came in with some Parmesan spheres he had made from a low-grade cheese. Given that he used a poor-quality cheese, they were pretty gross. But I saw the potential in Parmesan spherification, and after some thought, we came up with the idea of serving all the flavors of a Caesar salad in one bite on a spoon. It’s a really cool amuse-bouche and has stuck it out here at the restaurant. It uses a sodium alginate spherification technique, and though it might sound complicated and intimidating, it’s really fun, especially if you want to get in touch with your inner chemist, or want to show your kids a fun trick. Sodium alginate sounds like something produced in a lab, but it’s actually extracted from seaweed and can be used as a thickener due to its absorptive properties. This technique became popular after Ferran Adrià used it to turn olive juice into an olive. We get our <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#SodiumAlginate">sodium alginate</a> from a company called Willpowder.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Parmigiano-Reggiano Spheres</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a nonreactive bowl, make a sodium alginate solution by combining the sodium alginate with 1,500 grams water. Set the solution over an ice bath while you prepare the Parmigiano-Reggiano cream.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a medium saucepot, combine the cheese, pepper, and salt to taste with 240 grams water. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes or until the mixture begins to thicken. Using an immersion blender, blend the Parmigiano-Reggiano cream until smooth. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Pass the mixture through a chinois into a container, cover, and refrigerate until cold.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Combine the cold Parmigiano-Reggiano cream with the calcium lactate gluconate and xanthan gum. Using an immersion blender, puree the mixture until smooth and uniform; it should be thick. Do not over-add the xanthan gum, as it will make your mixture gummy and uncooperative.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page43"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Pour the sodium alginate solution into a shallow pan; the solution should be at least 1½ inches deep for the spherification to work. You don’t need to use all of the solution, so long as the depth is at least 1½ inches. Discard the extra solution if there is any left over. Using a ½ teaspoon measure, scoop spoonfuls of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cream and let them gently slide into the sodium alginate solution, as if you were poaching a tiny egg. The Parmigiano-Reggiano cream will almost immediately form a small sphere that resembles a tiny “yolk.” Allow the sphere to soak for approximately 2 minutes. The longer the sphere is in the solution, the thicker its shell will be. Using a slotted spoon, gently transfer the sphere to a bowl of clean water to rinse off the soaking solution. Using the slotted spoon, transfer the sphere to a clean shallow container and gently slide it off the spoon. Drizzle the sphere with some extra-virgin olive oil, just enough to coat the outer skin. Repeat with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano Cream; you will need to make a total of 12 spheres. As you complete them, slide the spheres near the ones you’ve already made; make sure you do not stack them on top of one another and allow for a bit of space between them.</p>

Divide the Parmigiano-Reggiano Spheres among the spoons; you should have 3 spheres per spoon. Divide the anchovy pieces, walnut-olive mixture, and powdered toast equally among the spoons. Top with a drizzle of the olive oil, some flaky sea salt, a sprinkle of the Pierre Poivre, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Garnish with the cress and serve.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is our version of the classic combination of fried chicken and honey. I believe my good friend Ben Burakoff, a former line cook, came up with the idea.</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">20 duck tongues (about ½ pound), rinsed in cold water</li>
			<li class="il">2 cups <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Veal">Veal Stock</a> or store-bought</li>
			<li class="il">2 cups <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Chicken">Chicken Stock</a> or store-bought</li>
			<li class="il">½ Vidalia onion</li>
			<li class="il">1 <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Bouquet">Bouquet Garni</a></li>
			<li class="il">2 quarts buttermilk, divided</li>
			<li class="il">Canola oil</li>
			<li class="il">2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li class="il">1 tablespoon <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#Ararat">Ararat spice mix</a></li>
			<li class="il">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
			<li class="il">1 recipe <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Duck">Duck Glaze</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium pot, bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the duck tongues, reduce the heat to low, and gently simmer the tongues for about 10 minutes, periodically skimming any impurities that rise to the surface. Drain the tongues and transfer them to a medium Dutch oven.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. In a saucepan, combine the veal and chicken stocks, onion, bouquet garni, and 1 quart of the buttermilk, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Pour the hot buttermilk mixture over the duck tongues in the Dutch oven, cover, and braise for 1 hour in the oven.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Remove the tongues from the liquid and let cool for 15 minutes. Using your fingertips or a pair of tweezers, pull out the cartilage in one piece from the fatter end of each tongue. Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, return the tongues to the liquid, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Remove the tongues from the braising liquid and place them in a container with the remaining 1 quart buttermilk. Let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Add 1 inch of oil to a large skillet and warm the oil over medium-high heat until the temperature registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the flour, Ararat, and salt. Remove the tongues from the buttermilk and dredge them in the seasoned flour. Gently add the tongues to the skillet (be careful, as the oil may spatter) and fry for 2 minutes or until the tongues are crispy. Transfer the tongues to a paper towel–lined tray. Season with salt and serve with warmed Duck Glaze on the side.</p>
