<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">AT CÚRATE, FÉLIX PUT TOGETHER A WINE LIST THAT</span> features only Spanish vineyards. We don’t source from any other country because there’s such a diversity of styles from different regions, much like the cuisine. Plus, Spanish wines are a relative bargain. The quality you get for the price you pay is pretty fantastic. And as you move up in quality and price you get an even better value.</p>
<p class="indent">Spanish wines are produced in different regions all over the country, from the popular Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Galicia, and Catalonia to lesser-known wine producers like the Canary Islands, Madrid, and Jerez. At Cúrate, we strive to showcase the best of all the different regions. In fact, in Spain it would be difficult to find the variety we offer. Most restaurants and bars serve only the wines of their own regions. It makes sense because their dishes match best with their wines. They come from the same soil, after all. Since I like to cook foods from all over the country, I like to serve them with wines that match. But the truth is that there isn’t one right wine for each dish.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout the book, you will see recommended pairings for certain dishes, but they’re meant to be suggestions, not rules. Because Spanish wineries are getting better and better at selling what’s ready to drink (not just bottles to hold), you can try a bunch of different Spanish wines and see what you like … and then keep trying more and more. You won’t have to spend a lot in the process and you’ll discover a whole new world of wine.</p>
