<p class="txc1"><b>As with pizzas or sushi, people often wrongly believe that a good quiche is judged on the quality of its filling. For me, it’s the buttery flavour, the golden colour and crispy-crumbly texture of the crust that makes this iconic tart such a masterpiece.

<p class="hang"><b>salt and pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150–200g [5½–7oz] best-quality smoked bacon rashers [slices]</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Put a frying pan [skillet] over a high heat, add the spices and roast them for 30–60 seconds. Grind all the spices together to a fine powder and, if not using immediately, store in an airtight container.</p>
<p class="tx2">For the pastry, in a mixing bowl, rub the flour, butter, salt and the ground spices together with your fingertips until the mixture is like fine breadcrumbs. Beat the egg with the milk and gradually work into the mixture, kneading lightly to make a smooth dough.</p>
<p class="tx2">Preheat the oven to 200ºC/180ºC fan/400ºF/Gas 6. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured board until 5mm [¼in] thick and lift into a 25-cm [10-in] loose-bottomed tart tin [tart pan] that you’ve greased with butter and lightly floured. To stop the pastry puffing up in the centre (funny, but not practical), line it with baking parchment and weigh it down with baking beans or dried chickpeas. This technique is called ‘baking blind’. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven but leave the oven on.</p>
<p class="tx2">For the ‘custard’ filling, whisk the milk, cream and eggs together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cut the bacon into lardons and fry them in a dry frying pan until golden.</p>
<p class="tx2">When the pastry case comes out of the oven, remove the beans and parchment and scatter the lardons in the case. Carefully pour in the ‘custard’ and bake for about 45 minutes or until the filling is golden but still slightly wobbly in the centre.</p>

<p class="txc2"><b>NOT A BENE</b></p>
<p class="txc"><b>It is important to knead the dough as little as possible. People often think that it’s necessary to do this for a long time so it becomes smooth and elastic. This is absolutely right but <span>only</span> if you’re making bread or pizza dough. With pastry, it’s the complete opposite as you want it to be soft and crumbly...</b></p>

<p class="ttl0"><a href="chapter_Split3.xhtml#toc_11"><b>A crash course in making Neapolitan pizza</b></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc"><b>Except on very, very rare occasions, I don’t follow recipes to the letter. I believe in free interpretation and that adding a little bit more of this or that isn’t going to change the world. Except, that is, when it comes to a Neapolitan pizza. I then switch from being a relaxed and easy-going hippy to an obsessive and meticulous chemist, ready to commit murder to produce THE perfect pizza!</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tx2"><b>The dough</b> For me, getting the pizza dough right is the key. The ingredients used are very basic – water, flour, salt and yeast – but making it is still sufficiently complex to need to learn to master it completely.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>The flour</b> Choose a wheat flour with a high protein content [&lt;10%] and labelled ‘TIPO 00’, if possible. As it is ground more finely, it absorbs water better. Bread/strong flour will also do.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>The yeast</b> It doesn’t matter whether it’s dried or fresh; what is important is that only a very little is used [0.2% of the weight of the flour] and that rising times for the dough are sufficiently long.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Hydration</b> Neapolitan pizza dough is well hydrated [65–70% of the weight of the flour], which makes it much more elastic and above</p>
<p class="tx2">all ensures the dough is airy and bubbly in the oven during baking.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Proving</b> As with bread, pizza dough needs two risings: the first for 2 hours at room temperature [25ºC/77ºF] and then a second much longer one that I like to do in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Shaping</b> A ball of dough that is well rested can be shaped quickly and without too much effort into a pizza base. Lay your hand flat on the dough and, flexing your fingers, push the air out of it towards the edges in order to form a disc, 5mm [¼in] thick in the centre and 1–2cm [<img alt="images" src="images/three-eight.jpg"/>–¾in] thick at the outside.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Tomato sauce</b> This is easier to make than you might think. It consists of good-quality canned San Marzano tomatoes that you simply crush with oil, salt and oregano until smooth.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Cheese</b> Use mozzarella or <i>Fior di Latte</i>, plus Parmesan. From experience, I find a slightly dryer mozzarella releases less water and that prevents the centre from being undercooked. Avoid using too much Parmesan – it’s just there to add substance.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Baking</b> Oven cooking is essential for making a successful pizza. It must bake very quickly and at a high temperature – preheat the oven to its highest setting.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Pizza stone/steel</b> In a traditional pizza oven, the pizza is baked from below. To replicate this at home, use a preheated pizza stone, an upturned, preheated griddle pan, or a ‘baking steel’, which is a stainless steel slab.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>The pizza grand finale</b> It must have a crust that’s puffed and well speckled like the coat of a leopard. It must also be round and regular in shape and nicely charred on the base, with a soft centre and melted but not burnt cheese.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>A confession and a transgression</b> Basil leaves scattered on top are supposed to be baked with the pizza. That’s the rule. But… I never do it. By cooking the fresh leaves you destroy their character, so I add them at the end.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>350ml [1½ cups] warm (not hot) water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>525g [4 cups] flour type 00</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a pinch of instant yeast</b></p>
<p class="tx2">For the super-legit pizza dough, pour the water into a large bowl. Add the salt and leave until dissolved.</p>
<p class="tx2">Whisk in 50g [scant ½ cup] of the flour, mixing well. Add the yeast and gradually mix in the rest of the flour to make a dough.</p>
<p class="tx2">Knead the dough for about 20 minutes or until it is smooth. Cover with clingfilm [plastic wrap] and leave to rise at room temperature for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="tx2">Portion the dough into 3 equal pieces and roll into balls. Put them in an airtight container – the container must be very wide so the dough balls don’t stick together as they expand. Leave to rise at room temperature for 6 hours or, better still, for 12–36 hours in the refrigerator, as this will give the dough a better texture and flavour. Bravo! You’ve just made my super legit pizza dough. (If you are not using all 3 balls of dough straightaway, put the unused balls in a lightly greased bowl, cover with cling film and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Or put in sealed bags and freeze for up to 3 months; thaw in the refrigerator overnight and allow to come to room temperature before using.)</p>
<p class="tx2">Now start your topping. Remove any tough scales from the asparagus spears, chop the ham and halve the mushrooms, leaving very tiny mushrooms whole.</p>
<p class="tx2">Mix together the goat cheese and olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="tx2">Preheat the oven to its highest setting and, if you don’t have a pizza stone, preheat an upturned griddle pan in the oven. Roll out one ball of pizza dough with a rolling pin until about 25cm [10in] in diameter. Place the pizza base on a sheet of baking parchment and spread with the goat cheese mixture. Top with the asparagus, ham and mushrooms. Drizzle with a little extra olive oil.</p>
<p class="tx2">Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone or preheated griddle pan and bake for 5–10 minutes or until the edges of the dough are lightly charred and puffed up. Serve at once sprinkled with chopped tarragon.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>200ml [scant 1 cup] dry white wine or, if you don’t want to use alcohol, substitute with 175ml [¾ cup] vegetable stock with a few drops of cider vinegar added</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp plain [all-purpose] flour</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>1 ball of uncooked <a href="chapter_Split9.xhtml#ref-33">pizza</a> dough, ready to roll out</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Clean the mussels thoroughly by rinsing under cold running water. Using a small knife, pull away the ‘beards’ and scrape off any barnacles. Discard any mussels with broken shells or that are already open and do not close immediately when firmly tapped.</p>
<p class="tx2">Separate the parsley stalks and leaves. Finely chop 2 shallots and the parsley stalks. Heat the butter in a large pan with a lid over a medium heat, add the chopped shallots, thyme, garlic and chopped parsley stalks and fry uncovered until softened. Increase the heat under the pan to high, add the mussels, season with pepper and pour in the wine or stock. Cover the pan immediately and cook for 3 minutes. Take the lid off the pan, stir the mussels, put the lid back on and cook for a further 3 minutes. All the shells should have opened – discard any that remain tightly closed.</p>
<p class="tx2">Drain the mussels from their cooking liquid and pour the liquid into a saucepan. Place the pan over a high heat and whisk in the flour until smooth. Boil until reduced by half and then add the cream. (As we’re making a pizza, the sauce has to be thick.)</p>
<p class="tx2">Preheat the oven to its highest setting and, if you don’t have a pizza stone, preheat an upturned griddle pan in the oven. Roll out the ball of pizza dough with a rolling pin until about 25cm [10in] in diameter.

Personally, I like to leave the mussels in their shells – it’s a style thing.</p>
