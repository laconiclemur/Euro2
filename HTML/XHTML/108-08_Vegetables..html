<p class="C3608">The diverse climate and terrain of Spain give cooks a staggering variety of domestic produce. Cool-weather-loving potatoes thrive in Galicia. Apple trees follow the rolling hills of Asturias and the Basque country down to the Ebro River basin, yielding first to stone fruit orchards, then to La Rioja’s vineyards and Navarra’s sunny fields of piquillos, artichokes, beans, and asparagus. Rice paddies and citrus. Almonds and olives. Spain grows everything—even bananas and pineapples, grown in the subtropical Canary Islands.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_84">Roasted</span> Acorn Squash with Crumbled Pork Sausage</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Come fall, the markets in New York fill with a wide variety of squash. Marc loves to roast them in the oven until tender and pair them with something salty or spicy to complement their natural sweetness.</p>
<p class="C3609">A couple of years after arriving in the States, Marc adopted the American tradition of Thanksgiving dinner. Each year on the holiday, his house fills with friends, many of them also Spanish expats, and they can’t help but add some Iberian touches to the American classics on the table. Stuffing gets butifarra sausage and potatoes are whipped to a fluff with fragrant extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p class="C3609">Marc created this dish for one of those Thanksgiving feasts a few years back and it ended up stealing the turkey’s spotlight. A few days later, he added it to the market menu at Boqueria.</p>
<p class="C3637">The recipe pairs sweet acorn squash with toasted hazelnuts and sobrasada, a soft, spreadable cured pork sausage from Mallorca. When cooked, the rich, fatty sausage releases the intense aroma of the smoked paprika that gives it its bright crimson color. We slather the cooked sobrasada over rounds of the squash, drizzle it with local honey, and shower it in toasted hazelnuts and sharp Mahón cheese. Serve it at any meal. It will steal the show, just as it did at Marc’s Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>

<p class="C3632">25 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">55 minutes</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 acorn squash, trimmed, cut into ½-inch rounds, and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil, about 2½–3 tablespoons</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ ounce coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 ounces sobrasada sausage, skin removed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ ounce aged Mahón cheese</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 teaspoons honey</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 400ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Place the squash on a half sheet pan; generously drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt. Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer on the pan. Roast until the squash is browned and tender, about 20–25 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile, toss the hazelnuts with a little salt and reserve.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat a small cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sobrasada and cook, stirring and breaking the sausage into small bits, until the fat renders and the sausage sizzles and browns a bit, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Arrange the squash on a serving plate. Top with the hot sobrasada and any pan juices. Scatter the hazelnuts on top. Shave the cheese directly on top using a cheese plane or vegetable peeler, then drizzle with honey. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_85">Spinach</span> with Garbanzos, Raisins, and Pine Nuts</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">“A la Catalana” means “Catalan-style” and reflects a regional culinary tradition of mixing sweet and savory by adding dried fruits and nuts to everything from vegetables to meat. This simple spinach sauté combines raisins and pine nuts, the ideal duo for the delicate greens. We toss in a handful of chickpeas too, turning this into a satiating side dish.</p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_112">AJO</span> BLANCO</p>
<p class="C3601">In Córdoba, our chefs had dinner at Casa Pepe de la Judería, a local establishment that originally opened in the 1920s. Wrought-iron-clad windows and whitewashed walls frame the dining room. Sherry barrels rest behind the bar, and a beautiful patio provides a view straight up to the stars. This is Andalucía, the Spain of storybooks—flamenco, bullfighting, and Moorish palaces.</p>
<p class="C3677">The restaurant sits just beyond the palm-filled courtyard of La Mezquita, an ornate and immense medieval mosque-turned-cathedral that dominates the old city center. Maybe it was the setting, but every dish our chefs tried that night tasted of history. Flavors unfurled to reveal a timeline of techniques and spices inherited from the conquering Moors, ingredients brought back by the conquistadors, and ingenuity driven by sporadic wars and famine.</p>
<p class="C3677">The simplest dish served made the strongest impression. “Mazamorra,” the waiter announced as he placed a unique regional specialty in front of us. They looked at the soup—white as the chilled bowl that held it and studded with sliced green grapes. Marc took a spoonful and was surprised at the thickness. He expected something like gazpacho, but this was thick, like a strained yogurt. He tasted the silky purée. Almonds. Bread. Garlic. Olive Oil. A tease of sherry vinegar. Incredibly creamy without a drop of cream.</p>
<p class="C3677">The chefs looked at each other after that first mouthful, realizing in unison that they had tasted it before, that Marc had unwittingly created this dish at Boqueria only a month earlier. It happened when he was looking for a dip to accompany raw and pickled vegetables for a crudités platter. He had used ajo blanco, another chilled white soup from Andalucía, as an inspiration, but he made it thick enough to scoop up with vegetables. It was a sort of inspiration in reverse. Discovering that a dish he’d fashioned from culinary instincts already existed in Córdoba blew his mind and made him love the dip even more.</p>
<p class="C3628"><strong><span id="page_114">CRUDITÉS</span> CON AJO BLANCO</strong></p>
<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_86">Crudités</span> with Marcona Almond Dip</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Ajo blanco is a refreshing, chilled “white gazpacho” thickened with almonds and loaded with garlic. Here, Marc makes an extra-thick version to use as a dip. It is as rich and creamy as hummus, but with the unmistakable luscious richness of Marcona almonds and olive oil. A generous shot of sherry vinegar and lemon juice brings a welcome acidity, making this the ideal start to any meal.</p>
<p class="C3637">While it can be served with anything, Marc created this dip to accompany a crudité of spring vegetables. Choose whichever vegetables look best at the market. We especially love radicchio wedges, romaine leaves, baby carrots, radishes, celery sticks, and zucchini batons. Sometimes, we tuck the vegetables into a dish of crushed ice to keep them extra crunchy.</p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>crudités, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Purée the almonds, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice, and water in a blender until very smooth, scraping the bowl occasionally. With the machine running, add the oil in a steady stream. Continue blending until the mixture thickens and emulsifies to the texture of hummus. Season to taste with salt. The dip can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.</p>
<p class="C3636">Serve with cold crudités—plated with ice, if you like.</p>

<p class="C3675">Roasted broccoli florets are the perfect sponge to soak up ajillo, our favorite piping hot garlic and chili-laden olive oil.

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_118">Olive</span> Oil</p>
<p class="C3601">A hallmark of Spanish cuisine is the generous use of olive oil, the go-to fat used for everything from frying to preserving. It’s no wonder—Spain, after all, is the world’s largest producer. The arid, temperate climate of the southern and eastern Iberian Peninsula is ideal for growing olive trees. More than 250 types of olive grow in Spain, many of which produce oil with surprising varietal character. For dressings we prefer extra-virgin Arbequina. The small olives are barely larger than a pea, but they produce a fruity and fragrant oil with hints of almond and apple.</p>
<p class="C3677">We use blended, more heat-resistant olive oils for frying or searing, but we like to finish the food with a drizzle of extra-virgin. Peppery, herbaceous Picual is our staple for finishing savory dishes.</p>
<p class="C3628"><strong><span id="page_119">PATATAS</span> CHAFADAS</strong></p>
<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_88">Olive-</span>Oil Mashed Potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">We created these potatoes to accompany grilled octopus in our <a class="RED" href="10_Seafood.xhtml#page_166">Pulpo a la Plancha</a> and they quickly became a go-to favorite. These loosely smashed potatoes showcase the fruity deliciousness of Spanish olive oil, the real star in this recipe. The oil adds a velvety lusciousness to each bite of comforting creamy potatoes. As versatile as regular mashed potatoes, it can be paired with any protein and is just as delicious on its own by the spoonful.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_89">Charred</span> Eggplant, Peppers, and Onion with Labneh</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">The creation of this dish was a bit serendipitous. At a weekly chefs’ meeting, Marc and crew were working on a new version of escalivada. They tried several ideas before Marc saw a tub of labneh on the counter. It was being used for a different recipe but the thought of another possibility intrigued him. He smeared the thick-as-cheese Middle Eastern yogurt on a plate and topped it with the charred vegetables and coarsley chopped herbs. It completely transformed the already delicious dish. The creamy tang of the yogurt highlights the natural sweetness of the smoky vegetables perfectly, while offering a cooling contrast to their burnished char. It was a home run and has been a top-selling dish ever since.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4 to 6</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">1½ hours</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 white Spanish onion</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 red bell peppers</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 Japanese eggplants, or small ordinary eggplants</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup labneh or full-fat thick Greek yogurt</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh basil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons mint</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons dill</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>Maldon sea salt flakes</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 450ºF. Heat a grill to high. If you haven’t got a grill, set a wire rack over a gas burner and turn the flame to high.</p>
<p class="C3636">Place the onion on a foil-lined shallow baking pan and roast until burnt outside and collapsed, 40–45 minutes. Leave to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile turn the peppers and eggplants on the grill—or on the wire rack—until completely charred and smoky, 6–8 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until cool enough to handle, 10–15 minutes. Letting the peppers steam in the bowl will make them easier to peel. Transfer the eggplants to a plate and let stand until just cool enough to handle. They will be easier to peel when warm.</p>
<p class="C3636">Discard the outer burnt layers of the onion, then cut into ½-inch pieces. Pull the peppers in half, discard the stem, seeds, and ribs, then rub off as much of the burnt skin as possible. Cut into ½-inch pieces. Discard the eggplant stems, then gently peel off the burnt skin. Cut into 1-inch chunks. Put all the vegetables in a bowl, drizzle generously with oil and lightly with vinegar, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Gently toss, then adjust the seasonings to taste.</p>
<p class="C3636">Spread the labneh, or yogurt, on serving plates. Top with the escalivada and herbs. Sprinkle with Maldon salt flakes and drizzle with oil. Serve with warm pitas or naan bread.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tips:</em></strong> <em>Because Japanese eggplants are long and slender, they take on smoky flavors much more readily than large, squat eggplants. They’re also less likely to be bitter, which makes them especially suitable for this dish.</em></p>
<p class="C3691"><em>When peeling the charred skins off the red peppers and eggplants, avoid rinsing them. The water would dilute the flavor you’ve just concentrated over the fire. It’s okay if there are some blackened bits left after peeling.</em></p>
<p class="C3691"><em>Labneh is available at Middle Eastern and specialty markets and many supermarkets. If you can’t find it, refrigerate plain Greek yogurt in a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl until it’s almost as thick as cream cheese, about a day.</em></p>
<p class="C3607"><span id="page_121">Escalivada</span></p>
<p class="C3601">The word “escalivar” means to “char” or “grill” in Catalan, and that process, of scorching fresh vegetables on hot coals or an open flame, is what gives the iconic Catalan salad its distinctive smoky flavor and sweetness. Eggplant, peppers, and onions all grow in abundance in Catalonia. It’s no wonder that they found their way into this delicious salad, which can be found in every home and restaurant. Next time you barbecue, take advantage of the hot grill to prepare a big batch of it. If you can, throw the veggies right into the hot coals. This results in outrageously delicious roasted veggies, which keep for 4 days in the fridge and can be added to salads, sauces, stews, and scrambled eggs.</p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Heat the oil in a large, deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the carrot, celery, onion, leek, garlic, and bay leaf. Cook, stirring often, until just soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in the lentils.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are almost tender, about 25 minutes. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3636">Remove from the heat. Most of the liquid should have evaporated or been absorbed. If there’s a lot of liquid remaining, carefully drain the excess, but it’s okay if the lentil mixture resembles a stew.</p>
<p class="C3636">Stir in the vinaigrette until well mixed. Serve hot.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_91">Chilled</span> Tomato Soup</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">This iconic chilled soup comes from Andalucía where the relentless summer sun pushes temperatures to one hundred degrees Fahrenheit and above. It was the perfect lunch for field workers who would carry the soup in thick clay jugs, natural thermoses that would keep the soup cool for a refreshing mid-day meal. It is still the perfect summer dish.</p>
<p class="C3637">Our version is blended extra smooth, emulsifying the bread and olive oil to give the mixture a creamy taste and silky texture. Cucumber cools while ripe tomatoes and peppers add a subtle sweetness balanced by the slight tang of garlic and onion and the bright pop of sherry vinegar. You can top the gazpacho with small croutons or diced watermelon, cucumber, onion, or pepper to give it a little crunch.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_92">Sautéed</span> Corn with Hot Paprika Oil and Manchego Cheese</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Our line cooks are the backbone of our kitchens—and a great source of inspiration. Since corn, while not commonly eaten in Spain, is so plentiful and delicious in North America in the summer, we wanted to find a way to feature it on the menu. We couldn’t look to Spain for inspiration, so we looked to some of our line cooks and drew inspiration from their Mexican heritage.</p>
<p class="C3637">We give the classic Mexican combination of corn with ground chilies, queso fresco, and lime a Spanish spin by swapping Manchego for the queso fresco and adding hot pimentón instead of ground chilies. Smoky and spicy, creamy and bright, this is an irresistible dish that flies off our market menu all summer.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">2 to 4</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">25 minutes</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 lime</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 ears of corn, husks and silk removed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 teaspoon hot pimentón (smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 ounce aged Manchego cheese</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>Maldon sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Heat a grill to high. (As an alternative, you could use a rack set over a gas burner.)</p>
<p class="C3636">Trim the top and bottom off the lime. Remove and reserve the zest. Slice between the membranes to release the lime segments. Reserve in a large bowl.</p>
<p class="C3636">Grill the corn, turning to char evenly, until dark brown all over and tender, about 5 minutes. When cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cobs. Transfer to the bowl containing the lime segments and toss until well mixed. Divide among serving dishes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Mix the pimentón and oil in a small bowl and drizzle all over the corn. Shave the cheese directly over the corn mixture with a microplane, then sprinkle the lime zest on top. Sprinkle with Maldon salt and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>If you don’t want to grill the corn, you can turn it over the open flames of a gas burner until blackened and charred.</em></p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_130">Jamón</span> Ibérico</p>
<p class="C3601">Jamón Ibérico is, hands-down, the best ham in the world. Its translucent fat-streaked slices melt in your mouth with a nutty sweetness. The contrast of the fat with the deep umami of the tender meat—heaven.</p>
<p class="C3677">On a visit to a Jamón Ibérico cooperative in Córdoba’s Valle de los Pedroches, our chefs met Rafa, a “maestro jamonero,” or authority on all things ham, from production to slicing. He walked the chefs through the rolling hills of oak groves where pure-bred black Iberian pigs roam freely, eating grass and roots and scavenging for fallen acorns. For the final months of the pigs’ lives, their diet will be restricted exclusively to acorns. That is what gives Jamón Ibérico its distinct nutty flavor and marbling.</p>
<p class="C3677">The ham legs are salted for 40–60 days, 1 day for every kilo of weight, then hung from two-story-high rafters for at least another six months. Afterwards, they are moved to dry, dark cellars, where they will hang for between two and four years. The curing process slowly dries the meat, concentrating flavor, and the aging coaxes a deep nutty richness from the revered Ibérico hams.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_93">Green</span> Beans with Iberian Ham and Peaches</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">The classic Spanish duo of string beans and jamón takes on a fresh late-summer feel with the additional combination of peaches and tarragon. To keep the slender beans snappy and bright, we first dunk them in boiling water and then give them a quick turn in a skillet before adding in the sweet peaches and salty ham. Fragrant tarragon and a citrus vinaigrette tie it all together.</p>

<p class="C3632">10 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">20 minutes</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>½ pound string beans, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 ounce Jamón Ibérico or serrano, very thinly sliced and torn</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 garlic clove, very finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 small ripe peach, cut into thin wedges</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh tarragon leaves</strong></p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Generously salt the cooking water, then add the beans. Cook until just past al dente, about 3 minutes. Immediately transfer the beans to the bowl of ice and water. Once they are cold, drain well.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat a large sauté pan over high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. When it’s smoking, add the green beans and season with more salt to taste. Cook, stirring often, until tender and browned in spots, about 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the jamón and garlic. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Season with pepper, then transfer to a large bowl.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the peach wedges, tarragon, and vinaigrette. Toss until well coated and season to taste. Serve immediately.</p>
