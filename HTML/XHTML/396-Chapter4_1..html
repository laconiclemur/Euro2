<p class="intro">Sometimes you just need to be able to whip up a big tray of something – for the school bake sale, the cake day at the office or if you, like me, happen to always be running short of time and wondering where the day went. In this chapter are recipes for when you need to bake something that isn’t too much of a fuss, but still delivers in taste and comfort.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_42"/>Brunsviger</p>
<p class="head1">BRUNSWICK BUN</p>
<p class="intro">Fyn is an island in the middle of Denmark. A place of beautiful scenery, rich culture (the home of Hans Christian Andersen) and – the <i>Brunsviger</i> – a bread-like cake topped with lashings of brown sugar and butter. Think of a decadent cinnamon bun, baked open and sliced.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">25 g/1 oz. fresh yeast or 13 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons dried/active dry yeast</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 ml/1 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk heated to 36°–37°C/97°–98°F</p>
<p class="ingrd">40 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> tablespoons caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/7 tablespoons very soft butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon fine salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">350 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups white strong/bread flour (approx.)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">TOPPING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">175 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> sticks butter, softened</p>
<p class="ingrd">225 g/1 cup plus 25 g/2 tablespoons dark brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">4 generous tablespoons golden/light corn syrup</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd">a dash of vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 35 x 25-cm/14 x 9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch baking pan (with sides), greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES ABOUT 12 GENEROUS SLICES</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using fresh yeast, add the yeast and milk to a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved. If using dried/active dry yeast, pour the milk into a bowl. Sprinkle over the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes until frothy and bubbly. Pour into the stand mixer with a dough hook attached.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the caster/granulated sugar and ground cardamom and continue to whisk. Next add the very soft butter and egg yolk. Combine the salt with the flour and add to the mixture bit by bit, continuing to mix with the dough hook for 5–6 minutes until you have a smooth (but still sticky) dough. Hold back on the flour if the dough gets too firm – you can always add more later. Cover the bowl with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to rise for about 20–30 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the topping, whisk the softened butter with 200 g/1 cup of the dark brown soft sugar, the golden/light corn syrup, cinnamon and vanilla extract until you have a very soft, spreadable mixture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Tip out the dough onto a floured surface and knead it through (add more flour if needed, as you now need a mouldable dough). Roll the dough out to roughly the size of the baking pan. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and gently stretch it towards the sides of the pan. Prod shallow holes all over the dough with your fingers. The better the holes, the more hiding places for the topping – the best bit.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spread over the topping with a spatula (blast quickly in the microwave if it needs loosening up) so that every bit of dough is covered. Scatter over the remaining 25 g/2 tablespoons dark brown soft sugar. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to rise for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove the clingfilm/plastic wrap from the cake and bake in the preheated oven for around 20–25 minutes or until cooked through. The topping should be sticky and shiny. Baking times may vary a little, so do keep an eye on it. Remove from oven and leave to cool. Cut into squares and serve. This cake is best enjoyed the same day it is made.</p>

<p class="head1">NORWEGIAN APPLE CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">This is a Norwegian apple cake – although to be fair, in my house, it is known more as ‘I have too many apples, and this is a great way to use lots in one go and be nice to my neighbours’ cake. It is a cake of generous size that is super-easy to throw together, and just perfect for sharing. You can easily halve the recipe if you don’t have a small army to feed. Enjoy a generous piece with a dollop of vanilla crème fraîche or pouring cream on the side.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">4–5 medium Granny Smith or similar tart apples (depending on the size of the apples)</p>
<p class="ingrd">a small squeeze of lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 vanilla pod/bean, seeds scraped</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">6 eggs</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour or cake flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup minus</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoon double/heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd">25 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons light brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup flaked/slivered almonds or other chopped nuts, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 35 x 25-cm/14 x 9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch rectangular baking pan, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 12–14</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Peel and core the apples, then cut into thin slices. If the slices are too thick they won’t cook properly, so aim for around 0.5–0.75 cm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> –<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick. Toss the slices in a little lemon juice to prevent discolouration and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the vanilla seeds, butter and caster/granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl. Cream together until fluffy using the paddle attachment on the stand mixer or a hand-held electric whisk. Add the eggs, one by one, and mix until fully incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift in the dry ingredients and fold until smooth. Add the double/heavy cream and fold again to incorporate. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and level the top.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put the cinnamon, light brown soft sugar and apples into a plastic bag and shake to coat the apples evenly. Arrange the apples in a pretty pattern on top of the cake batter (I do three strips lengthways), then scatter over the flaked/slivered almonds.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the middle of the preheated oven for around 30–35 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Note that if you change portion size or tin size, baking times will vary.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Slice into portions and enjoy warm or cold. This cake keeps well for at least 2–3 days stored in an airtight container.</p>

<p class="head1">RYE AND BLUEBERRY FLAPJACK</p>
<p class="intro">Who doesn’t love a gooey, oaty flapjack bar? This one has the nice little twist of rye flakes added to the mixture. The consistency is a little different from your normal flapjack – the rye gives a more wholesome feel to the end result. Rye also has a deep almost nutty flavour to it, which I love. Add whatever dried berries tickle your fancy if you want to vary it a bit: try cranberries, lingonberries or goji berries. You can also add nuts and seeds if you wish.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">175 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons golden/light corn syrup</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon maple syrup</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup dark brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup light brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/1 cup jumbo oats</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/2 cups rye flakes</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup dried blueberries</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 20 x 30-cm/8 x 11<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch rectangular baking pan, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 12</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F) Gas 3.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put the butter, golden/light corn syrup, maple syrup and dark and light brown sugars into a saucepan. Heat together gently until just melted. Mix in the ground cinnamon and vanilla. Add the jumbo oats and rye flakes and stir well. Add the blueberries and stir again to evenly combine.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan. Pack the mixture down quite firmly using the back of a wooden spoon and press into all the corners (this will ensure you get a flapjack bar, not crumbs).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 20 minutes or until golden. The longer you bake, the crispier the result, so if you like your flapjack extra-chewy, take it out a little earlier.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mark where the slices will be on the hot flapjack using a knife, then leave to cool completely in the pan before turning out and cutting properly into slices.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The flapjacks will keep well for a week stored in an airtight container.</p>

<p class="head2">Feeling hygge</p>
<p class="intro">I come from the land of <i>hygge</i>. Growing up, every aspect of living was governed around this wonderful word: a feeling of inner warmth, of mentally existing in a space where time is not a factor, but the state of just being, appreciating and feeling is all-encompassing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">First of all, let’s sort out the pronunciation: <i>hygge</i> doesn’t rhyme with <i>jiggy</i>. The ‘<i>y’</i> is soft and in Danish, it’s a vowel. The actual sound of ‘hy’ doesn’t really exist in English, so the closest way to explain how to pronounce it is ‘who’. Add this to a hard ‘g’ sound (‘g’ like in gas) followed by a soft ‘uh’, and you have who-guh: <i>hygge</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The concept of <i>hygge</i> isn’t a new one. The word as we know it today has been in use since the late 19th century. It dates back to the Norse word <i>hyggja</i>, which meant something along the lines of feeling satisfied. In Sweden they use the word <i>mys,</i> and in Norway <i>kos</i> emphasises a similar meaning. We also like adding the word <i>hygge</i> to different seasons and situations. Every food magazine in Denmark will have a section of <i>julehygge</i> at Christmas and then another for <i>Påskehygge</i> at Easter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whenever I try to explain <i>hygge</i> to people, I always start with the word ‘hug’. When you hug someone, you have to relax and just let yourself go. The feeling of a genuinely good hug is close to <i>hygge</i> (just shorter), and it’s possible that the two words are related.</p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_49"/><img alt="img" src="images/C4-F6.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">I’m not going to lecture you on how to <i>hygge</i> like a Scandinavian as if it’s a new thing, because you already know how to do it. Remember that lovely evening, surrounded by friends at home, maybe with a glass of wine or cup of tea and baked goods on the table. There were candles, the rain was beating on the window outside. There was laughter, conversation and a feeling of comfort. You remember it so fondly because you were present in the moment together. There was no before or after that mattered. That was <i>hygge</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Scandinavians have become great at creating spaces around us that cultivate this feeling of inner warmth and togetherness. This is why you often see <i>hygge</i> described alongside candlelight, log fires or people sporting questionable woolly socks. But it is not exactly the same as cosiness: you can have a cosy house, a cosy chair, a cosy blanket, but these are physical objects. These things help to create <i>hygge</i>, but <i>hygge</i> itself is more a state of mind and being. Often, people describe <i>hygge</i> as something that can only take place when it is dark outside. Perhaps this is because, as Nordics, we are in darkness for half the year and <i>hygge</i> is what helps to carry us through. But you can just as easily find <i>hygge</i> on a summer’s day in the garden.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While <i>hygge</i> is usually a social experience, you can of course <i>hygge</i> alone<i>.</i> It is, however, wonderful to appreciate the simple things with people you love. Whether sharing a cup of tea with an old friend in the garden, baking a batch of cookies with your children, or eating waffles after a long day of being outside in the snow.</p>

<p class="head"><a id="page_51"/>Lokis chokoladekage</p>
<p class="head1">LOKI’S BROWNIE</p>
<p class="intro">A good chocolate brownie rarely fails to satisfy. At the café, we have lots of different bits and pieces left over that work with chocolate, so our Kitchen Angels often make this easy brownie base and add whatever good stuff they feel like – from chocolate bars to sweets and fruit or nuts. The name, Loki, comes from Norse mythology. Loki was a trickster god and also a shape-shifter. This brownie often shape-shifts at the café: it may not be quite what it was the last time you had it, hence the name. Experiment with adding your own treats to the mix.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/7 oz. good-quality 70% dark/bittersweet chocolate</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">275 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups minus 2 tablespoons caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">3 eggs</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/2 oz. good-quality cocoa powder (we use Fazer cacao)</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/5 oz. filling of your choice – see end of method for suggestions</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 20 x 20-cm/8 x 8-inch square baking pan, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 9–12</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 170°C (340°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in the microwave, but take care to just melt, don’t cook it. Set aside to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat together the caster/granulated sugar and eggs by hand using a balloon whisk in a large mixing bowl. There is no need to beat in loads of air as you don’t want the brownie to rise too much. Ensure the melted chocolate-butter has cooled sufficiently, then stir into the sugar-egg mixture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift the plain/all-purpose flour, cocoa powder and salt into the bowl. Add the vanilla and fold with a spatula until smooth. Take care not to overwork the mixture. Fold in 100 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. of your chosen filling. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and sprinkle the remaining filling on top.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 25–30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the side comes out clean – the middle can still be gooey but it should not wobble when you shake the pan. Leave to cool, then cut into squares to serve.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Filling suggestions</b>: 150 g/5 oz. nuts such as walnut, pecan, macadamia or Brazil nuts. Your favourite sweets/candy: marshmallows, chopped Daim bars, toffees, liquorice, soft nougat praline chunks, mint chocolates or chocolate buttons. Dried fruit such as raisins or cherries.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Note</b>: Baking times will vary. Brownies are quite forgiving if you cook them on lower heat for a longer time – so keep checking the edges and just make sure you don’t overbake. It’s better to slightly underbake a brownie, if anything, so take it out a bit earlier rather than give it that extra few minutes.</p>

<p class="head1">BLONDIE WITH LAVENDER AND LEMON</p>
<p class="intro">This is a super-simple yet amazing version of a blondie – quick to stir together and bake. It’s fair to say that a lot of traditional Nordic recipes use the same spices and flavours again and again, because these are our baking heritage. Sometimes, well, a little change is needed. I love using lavender in baking – but I do it with care. Nobody wants their cake to taste of grandma’s cupboards. The lemon in this blondie pairs well with the lavender, ensuring it’s not overpowering but, as with everything, you can vary the amounts to suit your taste.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">150 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">225 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons lavender sugar (see note)</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1 cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 eggs plus 1 yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd">grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/7 oz. white chocolate, chopped</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup macadamia nuts, roughly chopped (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd">icing/confectioners’ sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 20 x 20-cm/8 x 8-inch square baking pan, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 9–12</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Melt the butter and set aside to cool a little.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift the plain/all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Stir in the lavender sugar.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a separate large mixing bowl, stir together the caster/granulated sugar and melted butter. Next add the eggs and lemon zest and stir again until smooth. Fold in the flour, then the chopped white chocolate and macadamia nuts, if using. The mixture should be quite thick.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan and level the surface. Bake in the preheated oven for around 20 minutes or until cooked but still slightly squidgy in the middle. Take care not to overbake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from oven and turn out almost immediately to cool on a wire rack. Dust with icing/confectioners’ sugar and garnish with additional lavender or chopped nuts if desired. Cut into squares to serve.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Note</b>: For the lavender sugar, I use equal parts food-grade lavender to sugar and pulse it until fine in a spice grinder or food processor, sifting out any large pieces that remain.</p>

<p class="head1">SILVIA CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">I have tried my best to find origins and meanings for the cakes in this book. Sometimes it is not easy, as things get a little lost in history. This cake is known as Silvia cake in Sweden, presumably after the Queen. My friend Hannah got her Swedish grandmother on the case, who found out the base is an old version of sponge cake (<i>sockerkaka</i>) with added water known as <i>fattigmanskaka</i> – or poor man’s cake. The topping was later added. Why water is added other than to thin the batter I’m not sure, but it doesn’t work well without it. Be careful when you make this – it is quite easy to just have a nibble and then everything goes downhill from there and you won’t have enough for your <i>fredagshygge</i> (Friday cosy time).</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or using a hand-held electric whisk), beat the eggs with the caster/granulated sugar, light brown soft sugar and vanilla seeds until thick, light and fluffy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, then fold into the beaten sugar and egg mixture. Slowly add 100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup cold water and fold until incorporated.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the grill/broiler. Spread the icing/frosting over the cake, then place it under a hot grill/broiler for a minute or so until lightly caramelized. Remove from grill/broiler and sprinkle over enough coconut to cover the top. Allow to cool before cutting into squares to serve.</p>

<p class="head"><a id="page_56"/>Romkugler</p>
<p class="head1">RUM TREATS</p>
<p class="intro">A true ‘waste not want not’ treat. Every Danish bakery has loads of cakes that are, like these <i>romkugler</i> or rum balls, basically made from leftover pastries. It makes a lot of sense for bakers to find ways to use their leftovers in really delicious ways. It is best to avoid using leftovers containing raisins or strong flavours, as these will come through in the end result. I usually use a cinnamon swirl or two, some sponge cake and maybe some chocolate cake or a muffin. I do have the advantage of always having plenty of leftover pastries around, but you can freeze bits and just defrost and make this when you have enough.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">500 g/1lb. leftover Danish pastries and/or cake – ideally mixture of both</p>
<p class="ingrd">2–3 tablespoons good quality raspberry jam/jelly</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup icing/confectioners’ sugar (add less if your cakes are a really sweet variety)</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/7 tablespoons softened butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons cocoa powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">vanilla essence</p>
<p class="ingrd">2–3 teaspoons rum extract or essence (I use quite a concentrated one – you may need to add a bit more, as you want it to have a good punchy flavour)</p>
<p class="ingrd">a handful of oats (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd">dark/bittersweet or milk/semisweet chocolate vermicelli strands, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 10–15</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roughly tear any Danish pastries into bite-sized pieces and crumble up any cakes you are using. In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment or in a food processor, blend the shredded and crumbled pastries and cakes with the rest of the ingredients (apart from the oats and the chocolate vermicelli) until evenly mixed. Alternatively, you can do this by hand with a wooden spoon in a mixing bowl, but it will take longer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Taste the mixture – it may need more cocoa powder, rum extract or even icing/confectioners’ sugar. Because this is made with leftovers, the taste will vary a bit. If you feel it needs more texture you can add a handful of oats.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for about an hour to firm up.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll into balls a bit larger than the size of a golf ball and roll in the chocolate vermicelli strands to evenly coat. Chill again in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rum treats will keep well for 2–3 days wrapped in clingfilm/plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator.</p>
