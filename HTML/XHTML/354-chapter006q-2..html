<p class="noindent"><em>Coq au vin</em>, chicken in wine, is a very traditional, casual dish from the countryside of Burgundy. After soaking in wine for at least one night (plan ahead!), the chicken fills with flavor. A traditional <em>beurre manié</em> (“kneaded butter”), a mixture of softened butter and flour, thickens the coq au vin and gives it a glossy richness. You can also make a lighter version of this dish using white wine from Burgundy, such as chablis or Pouilly-Fuissé.</p>
<p>A great source for heritage poultry is heritagefoodsusa.com. Using heritage poultry supports the conservation of endangered breeds. These breeds are often a more flavorful and healthy choice for your diet. They also make an exceptional coq au vin due to the fact that they usually live a vigorous and active free-range life.</p>

<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Remove and discard</strong> the skin from the chicken. Grasping the skin with paper towels and pulling it off the meat is the easiest way to do this.</p>
<p>Place the chicken, garlic, red wine, and rosemary in a nonreactive container or pot, or sealable plastic bag that can hold it all comfortably. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or for up to 3 days.</p>
<p>Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and pat the pieces dry with paper towels. Set the chicken aside. Remove the rosemary and the garlic from the marinade. Discard the rosemary and finely chop the garlic cloves and set them aside. Reserve the wine.</p>
<p>Place the olive oil and the bacon in a large, heavy pot set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon begins to crisp, about 5 minutes. <a id="page-207"/>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a plate and set it aside. Add the chicken to the pot, working in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on all sides, about 15 minutes total. Return the bacon to the pot, along with the herbes de Provence, mushrooms, reserved garlic, reserved wine, and water. Stir to combine everything. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and partially cover with a lid (leave it a bit ajar so that steam can escape). Simmer until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover the pot, add the onions, partially cover the pot once again, and cook until the onions are just tender, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blend the butter and flour together in a small bowl, using your fingers. While whisking, add 1 cup of the cooking liquid to the butter and flour mixture and transfer it to the pot, stirring to combine. Let the mixture cook until the butter and flour mixture has thickened the sauce and given it a slightly glossy, rich-looking appearance, just 5 minutes. Season the coq au vin to taste with salt. Serve alongside your favorite potato recipe, such as Pommes Vigneron (<a href="chapter006m.xhtml#page-186">here</a>).</p>
