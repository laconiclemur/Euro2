<p class="intro">Scandinavians love to celebrate. It is a great excuse for family and friends to get together and to share a bit of something sweet. Here you will find a selection of larger cakes perfect for sharing with loved ones on those days that are extra special: birthdays, anniversaries, national days and even weddings.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_118"/>Kransekage</p>
<p class="head1">ALMOND RING CELEBRATION CAKE</p>
<p class="noindent1">This is the ultimate celebration cake in both Norway and Denmark, served at weddings, christenings, big birthdays, national days and more. It is not very often attempted at home as it can be fiddly to get perfect, presentation-wise. When done right it is, however, a total showstopper in all senses of the word. You can now buy the <i>kransekage</i> rings online from specialist and some high-street shops, but it is possible to make the cake freehand, too. <i>Kransekage</i> is only ever decorated with simple white icing/frosting, flags and maybe a few streamers for New Year. At weddings, the figurines of the couple are placed on top of the cake.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">2–3 egg whites (no more than 100 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz (do weigh them)</p>
<p class="ingrd">500 g/1 lb. 60% almond content store-bought marzipan (or see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a> for basic recipe), grated</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/1 cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/1 cup icing/confectioners’ sugar, plus extra for rolling</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/superfine sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon almond extract</p>
<p class="ingrd1">ICING/FROSTING:</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>–1 small egg white</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup sifted icing/confectioners’ sugar (add more as needed)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">1 x set of kransekage cake pans, liberally greased with cake-release spray (or baking sheets if making freehand)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag with a small nozzle/tip (size 2)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a large serving plate</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES A 10-RING CAKE TO SERVE 15</p>
<p class="noindent1">Make sure that your <i>kransekage</i> pans (if using) are greased with plenty of cake-release spray, as these cakes are notorious for sticking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a bowl, lightly beat the egg whites to a foam using a hand-held electric whisk or the whisk attachment in a stand mixer. Add the ground almonds, icing/confectioners’ sugar and caster/superfine sugar and whisk again until you have a smooth paste. Mix in the grated marzipan. Your final mixture will be sticky but you should be able to handle it. Place the paste in a plastic bag and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before using.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cut a piece of the paste and work it with as much icing/confectioners’ sugar as needed to make it rollable and roll out the first piece into a long roll with a diameter of 1–1.25 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>–<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch. Shape the roll to fit inside the first ring in the pan and smooth over where the ends join together neatly. Repeat the process and aim to form 10 perfect sized rings to fit inside the pans. The rolls should be the same width and height exactly, so use a ruler if you want to be sure, and don’t rush. The rolls have to be smooth, so keep a glass of water next to you and use damp fingers to help smooth out any bumps. There should be a little bit of paste left over to make a freehand top for your tower. Place on a piece of baking parchment on a baking sheet.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If making the freehand version, your first smallest roll should be 8 cm/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches long and 1–1.25 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>–<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch diameter. The next 10.5 cm/4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches long and so on – increasing the length by 2.5 cm/1 inch each time. Connect the rings freehand on top of baking parchment on a baking sheet. If possible double up on baking sheets to give more heat protection to the rings. Again, smooth the connections and bumps out using damp hands and make sure your pieces are all as even and smooth as possible. Don’t forget to again make the freehand top for your tower.</p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_119"/><img alt="img" src="images/C7-F2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_120"/><img alt="img" src="images/C7-F3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_121"/>Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake one pan at a time in the middle of the preheated oven, putting the pans on a baking sheet (not directly on the oven rack). They will need around 10–15 minutes each, until they have a light golden sheen.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and (if using pans) allow the cake to cool completely in the pan before removing. If the cakes are sticking, loosen around the edges with a knife; they are very delicate, so do this carefully. If you have used the freehand method, remove the baking parchment and rings from the baking tray and place onto a colder surface to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the icing/frosting, mix together the egg white with the icing/confectioners’ sugar, adding more as needed until you achieve an icing that is thick enough to firmly hold its shape, but still light enough to comfortably pipe through a small nozzle/tip (size 2).</p>
<p class="noindent1">To assemble, place the largest bottom cake layer on a serving plate and fill the piping/pastry bag with icing/frosting. Pipe a small circle of icing/frosting on the ring, slightly towards the inside edge, and place the second largest ring on top. Repeat the process with all the rings, until you have a finished tower. Take care after adding each ring to ensure your tower is straight and even from all sides. Finally, fix the top onto the cake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To decorate, start the flow of the icing/frosting from the inside edge and then immediately pull the nozzle back onto the outside edge in one continuous movement. Continue back and forth, if you need to stop at any point to adjust your nozzle, do so when piping the inside of the ring, as a messy end there will be less visible than the outside. Make sure the lines of icing/frosting are reasonably close together and not in a zig zag.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Alternatively, you can decorate all layers separately then assemble. This allows more control for mistakes, but you will have to handle the cake after icing, which may damage your work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Decorate with a few cocktail flags or other tasteful Scandi decorations suitable for the occasion. This cake is extremely rich and should be served in small pieces. Therefore, a 10-ring cake is enough for a party of 15, as it is not really a dessert, but more of a petit four- style treat. For a wedding cake, double the ingredients to make the 18-ring cake and it should be enough for at least 30 guests.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Tip</b>: You can freeze the kransekage cake rings for up to 3 months. Take care to place in a container so that they will not get bumped in your freezer. The cake keeps for quite a long time even without freezing, so it’s a great one to make in advance, ahead of your celebration.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_122"/>Prinsesstårta</p>
<p class="head1">PRINCESS CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">One of the most famous cakes to come out of Sweden, this traditional celebration cake first appeared in 1948 in <i>The Princesses Cookbook</i>, authored by Jenny Åkerström, a teacher of Princesses Margaretha, Märtha and Astrid, daughters of Prince Carl. Originally called Green Cake, the name evolved due to the Princesses apparent fondness for it.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">1 portion of Layer Cake Bases (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_12">page 12</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 portion of Pastry Cream (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">600 ml/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup good-quality raspberry jam/jelly</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/7 oz. green marzipan (store-bought or see recipe on <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a> and add a drop of green food colouring paste, not liquid)</p>
<p class="ingrd">pink and green royal icing or marzipan, for the rose and leaves</p>
<p class="ingrd">icing/confectioners’ sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8–10</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whip the cream with the icing/confectioners’ sugar until stiff. Spoon two thirds into a separate bowl. Mix the remaining one third of the whipped cream with the prepared pastry cream.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Make sure your prepared layer cake bases are completely even in size. If not, trim to fit. Place the bottom layer on your chosen serving plate; you won’t be able to move the cake once assembled.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spread the raspberry jam/jelly evenly onto the base layer of the cake, then add half of the pastry cream mixture. Top with the second cake layer. Repeat with the remaining jam/jelly and second helping of the pastry cream mixture. Add the top cake layer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a cake spatula, spread three quarters of the remaining stiffly whipped cream in a thick layer on the top and the sides of the cake. Make sure the cake is covered evenly all over to prevent jam/jelly from seeping out. Some people prefer to shape the cream into a dome; I quite like more of a level top on my princess cake, but it is up to you.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Next, roll out the green marzipan on a surface lightly dusted with icing/confectioners’ sugar or over the top of baking parchment (to prevent sticking). Roll out into a large, even circle, big enough to cover the top and sides of the cake (around 35 cm/14 inches + in diameter).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Carefully drape the marzipan on top of the cake and peel back the baking parchment, if using. Pull gently around the edges to bring the marzipan down to cover the cake, taking care not to overstretch. Once the marzipan is smoothed over and touching the base all the way around, trim away the excess. Press the edges gently in at the base.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the rose decorations, mould the pink royal icing or marzipan into 2 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch tall teardrop shapes for the inside buds. Then roll out small round petal-shaped pieces of icing around 2 x 2 cm /<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> x <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch and wrap each one around the bud in layers. Cut the base off and fix the roses on top of the cake. Lastly, roll out the green royal icing or marzipan and cut out leaf shapes to fix by the sides of the rose. Dust with icing/confectioners’ sugar before serving.</p>

<p class="head1">CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH LIQUORICE GANACHE</p>
<p class="intro">Did we tell you that Scandinavians love salty liquorice? This rich chocolate cake is topped with a whipped white chocolate ganache that is flavoured with salty liquorice syrup and powder.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup cocoa powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">400 g/2 cups caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">3 eggs</p>

<p class="ingrd2">4 x 15–16-cm/6-inch round cake pans, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag with a star tip/nozzle (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 10</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="img" src="images/C7-F6.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">Make the liquorice ganache first. Bring the double/heavy cream to boiling point in a saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the white chocolate, liquorice syrup and powder. Stir to melt. Leave to cool then chill in the refrigerator for a few hours.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 170°C (325°F) Gas 3.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mix together the cocoa powder with 150 ml/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup boiling water and stir until smooth. Add the milk to the mixture and stir again. Cool and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cream together the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy in a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk. Add the eggs one by one, beating with each addition to fully incorporate. In a separate bowl, sift together the plain/all-purpose or cake flour, vanilla, bicarbonate of/baking soda and salt. Add the flour mixture and the cocoa mixture to the egg mixture alternately while beating continuously on a slow speed just until well incorporated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions (of around 300 g/10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. each). Spoon into the prepared baking pans and spread out evenly. Bake in the middle of the preheated oven for around 15 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out just clean. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whisk the chilled ganache on high speed until the colour becomes a few shades lighter and the texture becomes light and fluffy. Spread over 3 chocolate cake layers and stack the sponges one on top of the other. Finish with a generous layer of ganache on the top layer (piped if you wish) and drizzle with extra liquorice syrup to decorate.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_126"/>Kringle</p>
<p class="head1">DANISH PASTRY KRINGLE</p>
<p class="intro">The name <i>Kringle</i> refers to the pretzel shape of this Danish pastry. Actually, the word originates from the Old Norse <i>kringla</i>, meaning ring or circle, so it wasn’t originally pretzel-shaped at all. We eat kringle for birthdays, parties and at other festive times – I think it’s super-festive to have one on the table to share rather than lots of smaller pastries.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">1 portion of Danish Pastry (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_13">page 13</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 portion of Remonce Almond Paste (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg mixed with a few tablespoons double/heavy cream, for brushing</p>
<p class="ingrd">50–100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>–<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup raisins (to taste)</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup toasted, roughly chopped hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingrd">caster/granulated sugar, to dust</p>
<p class="ingrd">icing/confectioners’ sugar (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a large baking sheet (big enough to accommodate 40 cm x 40 cm/16 x 16 inches of dough) greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 12–15</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the Danish pastry lengthways on a lightly floured surface. Push the sides back in, turn over and roll again. Because the pastry has lots of layers, you have to do it this way or you will ruin the flakiness. When you have a long rectangle of around 50 cm/20 inches, cut it straight down the middle. The kringle is so big that it is easier to make in two pieces. Keep rolling each piece so it becomes longer and thinner, taking care not to disturb the layers. Each piece should end up around 50–55 cm/20–22 inches long and no more than 10 cm/4 inches wide.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the remonce in a line down the middle of both pieces and then add the raisins, too. Fold each side onto the remonce to make a long package with the remonce secured in the middle, leaving about 1 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch exposed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Trim off the untidy end bits of both pieces of pastry. Carefully curve both pieces of pastry into thick horseshoe shapes and transfer onto the prepared baking sheet so that the ends face each other. Join the ends of each horseshoe together on one side. For the other side, fold one end of pastry up diagonally beneath the other and join. You should end up with a pretzel-like shape. Make the final adjustments to the kringle with your hands. It will rise quite a bit, so make sure the holes are big enough that they won’t disapear. Cover with a kitchen cloth and leave to rest for around 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brush with the egg-cream wash all over, then dust lightly with caster/granulated sugar and sprinkle over the toasted chopped hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4. Note: you may want to place an extra tray at the bottom of your oven to catch any drips of butter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 20–30 minutes. The sugar will melt and make the pastry go brown, so do check if it’s cooked through inside. It may need a little longer depending on the thickness of the pastry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from oven and allow to cool. You can add frosting if you wish, but I think it’s nice just dusted with a little icing/confectioners’ sugar.</p>

<p class="head1">RYE BREAD LAYER CAKE WITH CHERRIES</p>
<p class="intro">This type of Danish layer cake comes from Sønderjylland in southern Denmark. Here, this cake is known as <i>brødtort</i> (bread cake), because the bases are made from finely ground rye bread. The <i>brødtort</i> is usually one of the star attractions on the famous elaborate Jutland cake tables (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#page_30">pages 30</a>–<a href="Chapter3.xhtml#page_31">31</a>). I’m always amazed that this recipe hasn’t travelled further – even in Denmark, many people have not heard of it. It’s truly delicious in an almost wholesome way, although, considering the amount of cream, one is not fooled for long.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">5 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons cornflour/cornstarch</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons cocoa powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/1 cup freshly ground almonds (pulsed in a food processer, not as finely as the pre-packaged ones)</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/5 oz. stale dark rye bread, finely ground in a food processor</p>
<p class="ingrd1">TOPPING AND FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">500 ml/2 cups whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">a few drops of amaretto, (or almond extract) plus extra, for brushing</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup cherry jam/jelly</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups fresh cherries, pitted</p>
<p class="ingrd">chocolate shavings, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd2">3 x 20-cm/8-inch round cake pans, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8–10</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer (or using a hand-held electric whisk), beat the egg yolks with the caster/granulated sugar until pale and thick.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the cornflour/cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt together in a separate bowl then sift into the yolk and sugar mixture. Add the vanilla and fold in gently. Lastly, fold in the freshly ground almonds and the rye breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whisk the egg whites until stiff (so you can hold the bowl upside down and nothing falls), then fold into the rye bread mixture until combined.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Split the mixture evenly between the three prepared pans and bake in the preheated oven for around 20–25 minutes, or until the cakes are slightly springy to the touch and pull away slightly from the sides of the pans. The cakes will not rise much during baking and this is fine.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leave to cool for a while in the pans, then carefully turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the topping and filling, whip the cream with the icing/confectioners’ sugar and a few drops of amaretto or almond extract until stiff.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Arrange the first cake layer on your serving plate, brush with a thin layer of amaretto (if using) and add a thin layer of cherry jam/jelly. Add a quarter of the whipped cream, then arrange half of the cherries on top. Add the second cake layer. Repeat the process with this layer and add the final cake layer on top. Top with the remaining cream and sprinkle liberally with chocolate shavings to decorate.</p>

<p class="head2">Winter celebrations</p>
<p class="intro">The further north you live in the Nordic countries, the scarcer daylight hours become in winter. When the days close in and the leaves fall off the trees, we prepare for darkness and cold to arrive, but also for the biggest celebration of our year: <i>jul</i> (Christmas).</p>
<p class="noindent1">We have many ways of coping with the cold and darkness during the winter months. Our homes are warm and cosy, full of candlelight flickering in every room to encourage the feelings of <i>hygge</i> when the snow is falling outside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have lived in many different countries and I am yet find people who love Christmas as much Scandinavians. We really celebrate the whole season – especially when it comes to baking. At this time of the year my café becomes a focal point for homesick ex-pat Scandinavians seeking out fellow Scandis to feel Christmas joy with.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Four Sundays of Advent (the last four Sundays before Christmas) are celebrated with <i>glögg</i> (mulled wine) parties, where there is always an abundance of ginger cookies, usually home-baked. These cookies vary regionally – Norwegian <i>brunkaker</i> are different to Danish <i>pebernødder</i> and Swedish <i>pepparkakor</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The 13th December is important across the Nordic countries, and is better known as the day of <i>Sankta Lucia</i>. In pagan times, folk thought that the enchantress Lussi would ride through the night and cause chaos and destruction – and even come down the chimney to take away children! People would stay awake all night to ensure she couldn’t harm them. With the coming of Christianity, the occasion changed to commemorate Saint Lucia of Syracuse, and incorporated elements of the winter solstice to mark the bringing of light into the darkness. Today, we get up very early in the morning to watch processions of teenagers wearing white robes carrying candles. And one lucky person plays Lucia – wearing a crown of candlelight. In Sweden and Norway, we eat saffron buns called <i>lussekatter</i>, while Danes enjoy <i>æbleskiver</i> (see <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#page_157">page 157</a>).</p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_131"/><img alt="img" src="images/C7-F10.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">Christmas Eve is the main day for celebration, so we don’t have to wait until 25th December for presents. While the rest of the Western world has Santa, we have <i>nisse</i>r or <i>tomter</i> – the Christmas gnomes. These resemble the modern Santa with beards and red hats, but they are much smaller and you have to treat them well all year round if you want to avoid them playing mischief on you.</p>
<p class="noindent1">New Year brings hopes for the year ahead – and with it, several more months of darkness and snow: a perfect excuse for more <i>hygge</i> and candlelight. We Scandinavians have a peaceful relationship with snow and cold – it is just part of our year, so we dress for it, accept it and live with it, almost in harmony. (‘No such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes,’ say all Scandinavian mothers.)</p>
<p class="noindent1">In February, bakeries start to make <i>semla</i> (Lent) buns. In Denmark and Norway, we call them <i>fastelavnsboller</i>. All the way up to Shrove Tuesday, we eat these buns and on Shrove Tuesday we’ll probably have two. Then comes Lent, <i>semlor</i> buns disappear and we begin to focus on Easter, the return of light, getting in the last bit of skiing before the snow disappears, and we start to dream of lighter, warmer days.</p>

<p class="intro">This is my partner Jonas’s favourite cake. He doesn’t normally have much of a sweet tooth, but this is the one he requests for his birthday. The name Budapest has nothing to do with Hungary – this version of the cake was actually invented in Sweden. I have to admit, this cake is nostalgic for me: as a child of the eighties, there wasn’t a party without a meringue roll full of canned fruit.

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a very clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a teeny pinch of salt in a stand mixer (or using a hand-held electric whisk) until lightly stiff. Start adding the caster/granulated sugar, bit by bit. Keep whisking until you reach stiff peak stage, this may take a few minutes. Add the cornflour/cornstarch and white wine vinegar and beat again to incorporate.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Fold in the roughly ground hazelnuts. Fill the piping/pastry bag with the meringue mixture. Pipe into the prepared pan in an even layer. Alternatively, spoon the mixture into the pan and spread evenly.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake for around 25–30 minutes until the meringue is firm, slightly cracked on top and lightly browned. Leave to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cut a large piece of baking parchment slightly larger than the pan and place on the worktop. Carefully turn the meringue out onto the baking parchment and let cool completely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Meanwhile, whip the cream for the filling with the icing/confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until stiff. Peel the mandarins and remove the pips and as much membrane as possible. Chop the flesh into small pieces.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Peel away the parchment paper from the cold meringue. If it is difficult to remove, brush the paper with a little water. Spread an even layer of whipped cream on top of the meringue and then add the mandarin pieces. Very carefully roll up the meringue lengthways, as tightly and neatly as possible, using the baking parchment to help you.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Transfer to a serving plate, making sure the seam is underneath. Tidy up any spills of cream. Drizzle the dark/bittersweet melted chocolate across the top in a messy pattern, then sprinkle with the toasted chopped hazelnuts. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve and slice into portions at the table.</p>

<p class="intro">Named after Shakespeare’s Othello, this luxurious layer cake is one of the most popular at Danish bakeries. Indulgent and fancy, it is perfect for serving up at special occasions.</p>

<p class="ingrd1">ALMOND LAYER:</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup ground almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup plus 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>

<p class="ingrd">400 ml/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">75–100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>–<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup good-quality raspberry jam/jelly</p>
<p class="ingrd1">ICING/FROSTING:</p>

<p class="ingrd">50 g/2 oz. good-quality 70% dark/bittersweet chocolate, melted and still warm</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/5 oz. store-bought good-quality marzipan (or see basic recipe <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>), to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a large baking sheet, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag fitted with a plain nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8–10</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the almond layer, whisk the egg whites until stiff, add the other ingredients and mix until smooth. Spread the almond mixture into a circle the same size as the cake bases (20 cm/8 inches diameter) on the baking parchment on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for around 15 minutes until golden brown. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whip the cream until stiff with the icing/confectioners’ sugar. Reserve 1 heaped cup of the whipped cream for decoration. Fold the remaining whipped cream into the pastry cream until smooth, then refrigerate.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Make sure your prepared layer cake bases are completely even in size. If not, trim to fit. To assemble, place the almond layer on a serving plate and spread a thin layer of raspberry jam/jelly on top. Add a third of the pastry cream mixture, and spread evenly. Repeat the cream and jam/jelly addition again with the first and second sponge cake layers.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the third and final sponge cake layer over and add a thin, even layer of jam/jelly. Place it, jam side down, onto the pastry cream on the layer below. Ensure the whole cake is even and stable. Use a little of the leftover whipped cream and a spatula to even the filling around the edges so the sides are straight.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the icing/frosting, add the icing/confectioners’ sugar to a bowl along with 1–2 tablespoons of hot water and mix until smooth. Add the warm, melted chocolate. If it is too thick, add a bit more water. Too thin, a bit more sugar. You want a smooth, thick yet spreadable consistency. Spread a generous layer on top of the cake to the edge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Work the marzipan with a little icing/confectioners’ sugar, then roll it out to a piece long enough to fit around the sides of the cake and the same height as the cake exactly. Do it in two lots if you find this easier.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cut the edges of the marzipan so they are sharp, then wrap around the cake and secure with a dab of water. Put the reserved whipped cream in a piping/pastry bag and pipe dots of cream all around the top edge, hiding where the chocolate ends. Refrigerate before serving.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_136"/>Verdens beste kake</p>
<p class="head1">WORLD’S BEST CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">Calling something the ‘world’s best cake’ is quite a statement, but not something taken lightly by the Norwegians. This cake contains the most delicious whipped cream, sponge, pastry cream and meringue – it’s everything you could ever want wrapped up together in one bite. This cake is so seriously good that it is often labelled the national cake of Norway. It is also known as <i>Kvæfjord</i> cake. Kvæfjord is a municipality in Tromsø in northern Norway, an absolutely stunning place with picture-perfect rolling green hills, rocky fells and deep blue <i>fjords</i>. To eat this cake in that setting: it doesn’t get better than that, at least not in my mind.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">150 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">130 g/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">5 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/1 cup plus 2 tablespoons plain/all-purpose flour or cake flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup plus</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon whole milk</p>
<p class="ingrd1">FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 ml/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> portion of Pastry Cream (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MERINGUE TOPPING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">5 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of cream of tartar</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup flaked/slivered almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 35 x 25-cm/14 x 9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch rectangular cake pan, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8–10</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F) Gas 3.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer (or using a hand-held electric whisk) cream together the butter and sugar until pale and light. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating to ensure everything is well incorporated. Sift in the plain/all-purpose or cake flour, baking powder and vanilla and fold in. Lastly, add the whole milk and fold again until fully combined. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and spread out evenly and set aside aside for a moment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Next make the meringue topping. Using a completely clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the sugar very slowly, bit by bit, beating on high speed until stiff peaks form (about 5 minutes). Spread the meringue mixture on top of the cake mixture. Scatter the flaked/slivered almonds on top.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for 35–40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean and the meringue is firm. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the pan then turn out carefully, so the meringue is still on top. Leave to cool completely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whip the cream until stiff and fold together with the pastry cream.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To assemble, cut the cake into two halves. On one half, spread the pastry cream mixture, then carefully layer the other half on top. Leave to set in the refrigerator for an hour before serving. The meringue will stay mallowy and the base soft.</p>
