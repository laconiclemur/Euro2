			<p class="Normal-noind"><span class="lead-in">Richard Olney</span> may not have achieved the fame of his contemporaries Julia Child or James Beard, but among home cooks his lasting influence has been equal if not more important. Although Child has legendary status, she stressed a kind of to-the-letter authenticity, a kind of “correctness” that seems dated, staid, and unnecessarily fussy. Beard, a more fluid and natural cook and teacher, became a chef’s chef, a food writer for an audience of professionals. </p>
			<p class="Normal">Olney was a food lover, an amateur in the true sense of the word. You can see this everywhere in <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em>, which now celebrates its 40<span class="super">th</span> anniversary and remains . . . important, if you want to see into the mind of a smart, inventive home cook who had access to fine ingredients, as so many of us do now but did not then; valuable, especially if you want to learn the basics of French regional cooking and what it means to improvise once you begin to understand the ingredients; and incomparable, because, oddly enough, there are far fewer good primers in the world of French cooking than there are in Italian, or even Chinese. </p>
			<p class="Normal">If you want to learn your way around the French kitchen, Richard Olney is probably the best English-speaking guide there has ever been. </p>
			<p class="Normal">You can point, of course, to the mostly French-oriented Time-Life <em class="ital">Good Cook</em> series, of which he edited all 27 volumes. But <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> is more concise, useful, and lovable than any of those books; it’s a desert-island book, and the best part of it is that it’s about as untechnical as a primer can be. It’s a collection of both traditional and innovative recipes that demonstrate fantastic kitchen sense and literate writing—sometimes at great length—all by an experienced cook. </p>
			<p class="Normal">Above all, <em class="ital">Simple French Food </em>was influential. Olney’s special love for southern French food, for Mediterranean French food (which is in fact quite Italian), had a bigger impact on the development of California cuisine—that is, simple, ingredient- (rather than technique-) based cooking—than any book of its time. Among my friends and acquaintances, all of the serious home cooks of the 1970s who learned from books were fans of Olney. He was soulful, passionate, artistic, and literate. No one else had those qualities in that combination. </p>
			<p class="Normal">There’s an argument to be made that the best cooks have the best palates, and that everything grows from there. With the exception of overblown preparations and complicated baking, cooking technique is almost absurdly simple, especially compared to the fuss that’s made around it. Once you know how to cook, what matters is being able to judge what’s going to be most pleasing in the mouth. A cook with a good palate can envision what food will taste like long before “testing” it. Olney could do that, and he had his priorities straight. “The important thing,” he famously said, “is that the food taste good.” What more do you want? </p>
			<p class="Normal">Olney had zero formal training. He was born in Marathon, Iowa, a speck of a town he couldn’t leave fast enough. In New York, he waited on tables in Greenwich Village, and then, before his 25<span class="super">th</span> birthday, he bought a house in a town in Provence called Solliès-Toucas, where he spent most of the rest of his life. I did not know him, and one never knows how strangers acquire their “gifts,” but Olney developed several, and the ability to judge whether food tasted good was but one of them. He had trained as a painter, but somehow developed a clear, enormously appealing writing style. In fact there’s an argument to be made that he was the first recipe writer to actually care about language, and as you can see from leafing through this book, many recipes are described lovingly not as step-by-steps to be followed slavishly but as guidelines for assemblies to be tackled according to availability guided by your experience and judgment—and his. </p>
			<p class="Normal">He was also known for a lack of pretense; while he loved haute cuisine and all that went with it, he appreciated down-to-earth food just as much. And then there was his candor, which perhaps didn’t serve him well; Olney was not universally loved. </p>
			<p class="Normal">Yet he was in love with his Provençal hillside, and evidently everyone who visited it, especially in its heyday from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, understood that love and wound up sharing it. Thus his simple French lifestyle was absorbed by his fellow Americans, including Alice Waters, who has called Olney’s way of cooking “the truth.”</p>
			<p class="Normal">For cooks looking for “the truth,” the real way to understand cooking and good eating, Olney is as good a source as there is. It’s a fact that you won’t learn Indian or Mexican cooking from him, but you’ll learn what matters the most: that taking fresh, local, seasonal ingredients and treating them simply is the best way to prepare and enjoy food. That’s a lesson that speaks to every cuisine. </p>
			<p class="Normal">It sounds so corny now, doesn’t it? Yet before Olney no American was saying things like this. (Elizabeth David and her British cohorts were, but their influence on this side of the Atlantic was sadly limited.) He was among our first locavores, although—oddly enough—his locality was abroad. </p>
			<p class="Normal">There were some inconsistencies. You may no doubt—as I have—stub your toe on the recipes in <em class="ital">“Simple” French Food</em> that are anything but simple. My advice is to set these projects aside for a rainy day, or perhaps for never, and concentrate on the vast majority of recipes that can be cooked and enjoyed on any given day when you have access to good ingredients. What’s perhaps most astonishing is that some of Olney’s most basic lessons remain creative, vibrant, and little known: his ways with cream, for example, and his combination of that resurgent ingredient with lemon; his salting of vegetables, and his still-exciting turnip omelet; and of course his genius with fish: along with Beard, he was among the first Americans who instructed us <em class="ital">not </em>to overcook seafood. </p>
			<p class="Normal">To show how much the pendulum has swung, turn now to the meat chapter and note Olney’s unabashed love for animal fat and off-cuts of meat and his insistence on their use. These are things we appreciated in the 1970s, and they’re only now being recognized once again for their value in the kitchen and in overall ecology. The relevance of <em class="ital">Simple French Food</em> has never been greater. </p>
