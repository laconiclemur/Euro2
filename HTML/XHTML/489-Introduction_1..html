<p class="noindent">ScandiKitchen, our wonderful café and grocery shop in London’s West End, was born out of pure homesickness and a need to find a space where we could meet up with people for a <i>fika</i> – a cup of coffee and a bite of something sweet to eat. A place where we could meet with family and friends to just enjoy being together and <i>hygge</i> a bit, escaping from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life. When we first had the idea of opening a Nordic-inspired café almost ten years ago, it was near on impossible to find all the food goodies we missed from home. So we decided to create a place that reflected our love for the foods we missed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Being Swedish and Danish, it always seemed natural that the concepts of <i>fika</i> and <i>hygge</i> had to be at the heart of everything we do at the café. One of the first things Jonas made sure was on the menu was the wholesome cinnamon bun – and Brontë even toyed with the idea of naming the café <i>Hygge</i> – reflecting just how important this concept is to us. We decided <i>hygge</i> might be tricky to pronounce for some, so settled for what we are: a homely Scandinavian kitchen run by a friendly bunch of people. To create a welcoming space was always a priority for us, whether you are a homesick Nordic expat looking for your fix of salty liquorice or anyone else just searching for a nice place for a cup of coffee and a good piece of cake. Anyone can feel a sense of <i>hygge</i>, a state of content cosiness with friends where nothing else seems to matter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Of course, not everybody has the opportunity to just pop by our café to say hello. With this book, we wanted to share some of our favourite autumn and winter treats – perfect for the short, dark winter days. From buns, to cakes, to little pastries – a selection of recipes to make your own traditional <i>fika</i> at home and create cosy feelings of <i>hygge</i> with people you love. For everybody to be able to bring a bit of Nordic loving to their lives through the cakes we love to make and bake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the years since we opened our doors, much has changed about the way Scandinavia is viewed from outside our home countries. Back when we opened, nobody knew the word <i>fika</i>, and <i>hygge</i> was just another unpronounceable Danish word. Nowadays, books are being written on the concepts of <i>fika</i> and <i>hygge,</i> and it truly feels as if the world is waking up to the wonders of remembering to turn off the noise from our busy everyday routines. While we’re sure they could have done this without Scandinavia’s help, having the words to define what we feel is important.</p>
<p class="noindent1">We hope you enjoy this selection of our favourite autumn and winter treats from Scandinavia and that you enjoy creating feelings of <i>hygge</i> and <i>fika</i> in your own homes.</p>
