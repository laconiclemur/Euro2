<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> don’t know if there’s a meaningful irony in this, but it wasn’t until the end of our time in Plaisance that I had the following epiphany: The most ingenious part of mealtime in Gascony is the beginning.</p>
<p class="indent">The Gascons have taken the quaint French tradition of the pre-meal apéritif and Gasconized it. Their <i>heures de l’apéro</i>—especially during the holidays—are long, extravagantly provisioned, and enlivened with ceremonial flair: decanters, serving trays, ice bowls, toothpick holders, cocktail napkins—all of it meant to convey that, upon taking possession of your glass of floc or pastis or whiskey, you have agreed to leave mundane cares behind and give yourself over fully to the sacramental rites of imbibing and feasting. It is not unusual in Gascony to be invited to a cocktail gathering—I use the word <i>cocktail</i> loosely, as the drinks are usually not strong—that’s <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248" title="248"/>supplied with more food than a typical American family’s dinner. Pâté, saucisson, homemade cheese puffs, crudités, nuts, crackers, cheese-stuffed olives, brandade-stuffed peppers, foie gras–stuffed duck hearts—these are a bare sampling of the vast panoply of Gascon cocktail snacks. A proper Gascon apéro (the word denotes both the ritual and the drink) can feel like a meal unto itself, and even when it’s a simpler affair, an enveloping feeling of détente and good cheer prevails.</p>
<p class="indent">Our final week in the Gers was filled with a dizzying succession of holiday-season apéros—some more elaborate than others—to which our fast-approaching departure imparted a certain emotional charge.</p>
<p class="indent">The longest, and probably the most Gascon, apéro we attended was at Alphonse’s. He lived in a renovated eighteenth-century farmhouse on the edge of town, just past Plaisance’s retirement home. He and Lorette put out the biggest snack spread I’d ever seen outside a catered event: homemade <i>pâté-en-croûte canapés</i>, toasts topped with more homemade pâté, baked cheese tartlets drizzled with chile oil, sliced chorizo, sliced saucisson, pimiento olives, slices of smoked duck breast, cornichons and some other pickled things that escape my recollection, several kinds of nuts, and, in the center of the immense glass coffee table, resting on a length of cheesecloth, one of Alphonse’s home-cured hams, its surface covered in a fine flowering of white mold, a knife lying next to it.</p>
<p class="indent">There would be no need for dinner.</p>
<p class="indent">Alphonse kicked off the evening by carving slabs of the ham, which he was quite proud of, for all of us to taste. With equal pride, he showed me his well-stocked bar. I studied the collection of spirits and liqueurs, then glanced over at the coffee table, my gaze falling on the bowl of pimiento olives.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked Alphonse to slide the ice bucket my way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249" title="249"/>Borrowing a glass pitcher and a slotted spoon from the kitchen, I made two straight-up gin martinis. Alphonse took a sip of his, raised his eyebrows, and looked admiringly at the drink.</p>
<p class="indent">“Strong!” he said. “But sophisticated.”</p>
<p class="indent">He’d summed it up nicely.</p>
<p class="indent">That evening’s cocktail hour lasted three. Alphonse liked his martini so much that he asked for a second. I obliged him. Then he brought out the wine. By ten o’clock, the coffee table was covered with crumbs and balled-up napkins, and Charlotte was asleep in my lap. Michele, who’d been soldiering through a long conversation with Lorette and her visiting sister about baking, was looking ready for bed, too.</p>
<p class="indent">When we got up to leave, Alphonse boozily draped an arm over my shoulder. “We’ve gotten pretty used to having you in Plaisance,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">I told him we’d gotten pretty used to being there.</p>
<p class="indent">I exited before things could get mushy.</p>
<p class="indent">A few days later Alain Lagors invited us to join him for drinks at the home of Jacqueline Sanvert, the Anglophobic nonagenarian we’d met at the cookout in Préchac back in the summer. This apéro was the most elegant one I’d ever been to, in Gascony or anywhere in France.</p>
<p class="indent">Jacqueline lived by herself in a wide row house near Plaisance’s town hall. She remembered all of us by name, and crouched down to plant a long, wet kiss on Charlotte’s cheek.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Entrez</i>,” she said, favoring the formal mode of address, in the accepted manner of the <i>haute bourgeoisie</i>. “The others are already here.”</p>
<p class="indent">Jacqueline, short and sprightly and sporting a flame-orange cravat, led us into a spacious sitting room with an urbane, old-money vibe: pristine wainscoting, discreetly positioned reading lamps, contemporary furniture in taupes and beiges. Lagors was ensconced on <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250" title="250"/>a couch beneath a moody oil painting of a Spanish maiden playing a lyre. In an armchair opposite him sat a friend of theirs named Aline, who, when we approached, popped a cracker into her mouth, rubbed her fingers together to release some crumbs onto a napkin, and shook our hands with a deferential tilt of the head.</p>
<p class="indent">We took our seats around a marble-topped coffee table laid with a porcelain platter of homemade Parmesan tuiles and tapenade toasts. Next to this sat a gleaming two-handled silver serving tray that held a few heavy-bottomed drinking glasses, a bottle of Spanish gin, a bottle of tonic, a bottle of Banyuls wine, and a glazed ceramic decanter in the shape of a goose.</p>
<p class="indent">Jacqueline invited Charlotte to sit on the rug and gave her a game of pick-up sticks and an enormous candy shish kebab. These would keep her happily occupied for the remainder of the evening, which would go on nearly as long as Alphonse’s soirée. Despite a few attempts by Lagors to steer the conversation toward subjects of a historical bent, the talk that night centered entirely, and without the least digression, on <i>la gastronomie</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Jacqueline, a native of Pau, had traveled widely in her day, and now she spoke rapturously of dinners at the Carlyle and platters of <i>fruits de mer</i> at Le Procope, occasionally tilting her head back, eyes closed, and uttering a respectful “Mm, <i>dé-li-cieux</i>.” Aline rhapsodized in a similar vein about the <i>bonnes tables</i> she’d dined at in the region: Les Puits Saint Jacques, La Table des Cordeliers, La Bonne Auberge. When I mentioned that Michele and I had recently had lunch at Les Prés d’Eugénie, Aline moaned and rolled her eyes ecstatically, and Jacqueline gasped, leaned back in her chair, and began fanning herself with her hand.</p>
<p class="indent">Infused with the holiday-cocktails spirit—not to mention the spirits of holiday cocktails—I ended the evening by inviting all of them to the moulin for drinks the next night. Michele looked a <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_251" title="251"/>little startled by my impromptu proposal. But it seemed like the friendly thing to do. We had bought a small Christmas tree and had decorated it with festive lights, and (I’d nearly forgotten) I was in possession of a salt-cured duck breast that, if I’d marked my calendar correctly, was finally ready to eat. I decided I’d invite Henri and Monique, too, to liven the mix.</p>
<p class="indent">The next evening, I cut into the duck breast, which had been buried in coarse salt in the bottom of our fridge for weeks—I had been afraid to hang it, given the house’s dampness and its resident population of spiders and mice. The duck had undergone a magical transformation in its salt sarcophagus. The red flesh had become firm, like prosciutto, and darkened to a deep garnet hue. The fat had become smooth and pearly. The magret had the salty, funky tang that all good dry-cured meats possess, but with an extra richness. I sliced the breast thinly, fanned out the pieces on a plate, and smiled upon my creation.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele had made a special trip to Aire sur l’Adour, a nearby bourg, to procure two other things for our cocktail gathering: some very good Basque chorizo from the town’s covered market, and a box of savory puff-pastry petits fours from a patisserie Aline had recommended the night before with no small amount of euphoric eye-rolling. The two-bite cocktail snacks were of varying shapes and flavorings: mini quiches studded with bits of chive and <i>pimentón</i>; triangles of golden, flaky pastry folded around tiny squares of anchovy; macaroons flecked with caramelized shavings of Emmentaler and filled with creamy duck-liver terrine. The pastries were almost too pretty to eat.</p>
<p class="indent">Not that I should have been surprised, but our company arrived laden with gifts, making me feel badly that Michele and I hadn’t thought to reciprocate. Henri and Monique gave Charlotte three French Christmas books. For Michele and me they’d brought a hand-<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252" title="252"/>embroidered dish towel from the Pays Basque and—in the cocktail-hour vein—a lacquered drinks tray inscribed with the words “It’s Wine O’Clock.” Aline and Jacqueline had gone in on a T-shirt for Charlotte; it had a photo of a kitten in a hat and scarf on the front. Lagors, who had gotten wind of my pigeon-hunting misadventure, presented me with a pen-and-ink drawing, made by an artist he knew, depicting a hunter climbing up to his treetop palombière.</p>
<p class="indent">I poured champagne, and we drank and snacked in front of the fire, wrapped in scarves.</p>
<p class="indent">The evening concluded with Charlotte singing the first few stanzas of “La Marseillaise.” This got a standing ovation. On leaving, Jacqueline took my hands in hers and invited us to join her and her daughter for Christmas dinner. She looked let down when I told her we were departing the day before. Aline gave Michele a handwritten list of her favorite restaurants; it was two pages long.</p>
<p class="indent">Monique, on her way out the door, said something that has stuck in my mind ever since: “Thank you for bringing life to this old moulin.”</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>I’M LOUSY AT GOOD-BYES</small>. When faced with the prospect of a long separation, I tend to dissemble, joking and joshing and making promises of imminent reunions that have little chance of happening. Gascons, however, are not easily distracted from the sentimental gravity of a situation, and while they don’t go in for lots of hugging, they do express their feelings with a disarming openness. As the holiday gatherings in and around Plaisance ramped up, this state of affairs began to test my powers of avoidance.</p>
<p class="indent">Parting ways with our expat friends—at a Christmas cocktail party thrown by Tim and Chloé—was easy enough, because, like me, they tended to keep the tone chummy and droll, in the British–<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_253" title="253"/>Northern European manner. But when Patrick, the only Gascon in attendance, gave us a book of his photos as a going-away gift, I clammed up, my jesting reflex suddenly disabled. The book was a collection of a hundred or so black-and-white portraits of the people of Plaisance: the butcher, the baker, the grocer, the pharmacist, the florist, the mayor. I paged through it and realized that I recognized almost all the faces.</p>
<p class="indent">The next afternoon was the elementary school’s annual holiday pageant, held in Plaisance’s municipal gymnasium. It was to be followed, as is the case with most large gatherings in Gascony, with <i>le verre de l’amitié</i>. There were skits performed in Occitan, poetry readings, and the singing of Christmas carols. The <i>spectacle</i> concluded with the principal taking the stage, microphone in hand, and asking everyone to join her in wishing a fond farewell to Charlotte, <i>notre jeune Américaine</i>, who would now be performing a special dance number with some of her schoolmates.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele and I had not been informed of this.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlotte and six older girls took the stage. Maîtresse Nathalie, standing in the wings, pressed a button on a boom box, and pop music echoed tinnily through the room. The girls began executing a series of pliés and arabesques, which were followed by some <i>Flashdance-</i>like business with folding chairs and then a few leaps and shaky relevés. As the music faded out, the other girls formed a circle around Charlotte and started chanting her name. Soon the rest of her classmates joined in. Then the whole room, parents and all. Charlotte held her ballet pose, a bewildered smile on her face.</p>
<p class="indent">After it was over, Michele and I remained in our seats, dumbstruck. Michele rummaged in her purse for a tissue. Eventually we got up and followed the other parents over to a long bar that was, as far as I could tell, a permanent fixture of the gym. We served ourselves cups of wine and shook hands with parents who came by to <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_254" title="254"/>wish us a <i>bon retour</i>. Charlotte found us, and soon was surrounded by teachers from the school. Most of them, including the stoic Nathalie, were wiping away tears. I couldn’t blame them.</p>
<p class="indent">The good-byes kept coming. André Dubosc invited me to his house for a midday apéro—not a rarity in Gascony—and persuaded me to stay for what he insisted would be a simple, improvised lunch. We ate homemade pâté, grilled quail, a zucchini-tomato tart, and a sorbet made on the spot from pears that Françoise had picked from the trees in the fall and frozen. All of this was whipped up with the nonchalance that an American might associate with the making of a ham sandwich. Dubosc also gave me a book to take back to the States: an illustrated catalog of all the known grape varietals of southwestern France. It was a hefty tome.</p>
<p class="indent">That night we had yet another farewell apéro, this one at Henri’s. I was grateful for the invitation, though I’d been less than enthused at the idea of an evening of stiff conversation in the fussy upstairs salon. But when we arrived, Henri led us to their cozy living room on the main floor. The TV was on. A fire crackled in a wood-burning stove. We sat in comfy old armchairs. Henri opened a bottle of Pacherenc and brought out a bowl of nuts. Monique gave Charlotte a comic book to read. The couple’s Springer spaniel snuffled around our feet, begging for snacks. Monique chattered about gardening, Henri chiming in from time to time to correct the exaggerations to which his wife was prone. It was spare as Gascon cocktail hours go, but it was one of the most relaxing, familial moments I can ever remember having in France.</p>
<p class="indent">Henri asked us to stay for dinner, and we did. As we were leaving, I remembered a dozen items of unfinished business at the moulin: returning the sleeping bag Henri had loaned me, locating the screws for the wobbly headboard I’d taken out of the master bed<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255" title="255"/>room, giving back Henri’s books. Henri stopped me before I could get halfway through the list.</p>
<p class="indent">He rested a hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="indent">“Don’t worry,” he said. <i>“Je m’en occupe.”</i></p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>IN THE FACE OF SO</small> much generosity and goodwill, I kept my composure as best I could.</p>
<p class="indent">The Friday before our departure, I made my final visit to the Esbouhats. It was their annual tapas night, the club’s most popular event of the year: an apéro to end all apéros. The bodega was packed when I got there, and plates of food, contributed by various members, occupied every inch of counter space: scallop crudo, thin-sliced <i>jamón</i>, pieces of crisp-bottomed Spanish tortilla, curried chickpeas, bruschetta, plus the usual Gascon hit parade of pâtés and cured sausages and ducky things.</p>
<p class="indent">I found a spot at the bar. Doudou, the school cook, passed me a plate of his homemade samosas, and mentioned offhandedly that the club had raised funds so that he could fly back to Madagascar to visit his sick father.</p>
<p class="indent">Well-wishers migrated over: Bernd with his halo of smoke and a recipe for goulash he’d been wanting to give me; Henri Michel with a sampling of his homemade foie gras; Luc with an extra-long “Whassuuuuuup!”; Francis with an unexpected invitation to return to his palombière next year. Basso materialized, brandishing a bottle of Jameson’s. He refilled my glass, raised his own, and bid me safe travels. I was certain I saw, for the most fleeting instant, his puckish grin disappear.</p>
<p class="indent">The evening rolled on. Someone topped off my drink again. Bernd offered me one of his cigarillos. For some reason, I smoked it. <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_256" title="256"/>I noshed, drank some more, chatted with some Esbouhats I hadn’t previously met, and generally lost myself in the splendid conviviality of it all.</p>
<p class="indent">Now Alphonse was standing behind the bar, clinking a spoon against a glass. Suddenly the room was quiet and he was speaking. Heads turned in my direction. My face felt hot. Alphonse was saying something about bidding au revoir to “our American Esbouhat.” I’m sorry to say I can’t remember the rest, as my emotional defenses by this point had been reduced to rubble and I found myself in tears, in the middle of a roomful of rugby players, blowing my nose into a cocktail napkin.</p>
