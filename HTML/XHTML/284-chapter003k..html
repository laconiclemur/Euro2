<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">My guests at Buvette start asking for this salad as soon as the snow melts. Shelling fava beans can be tedious, but this task’s repetition can also be quite meditative. To shell favas, first remove the beans from their large pods. Place the beans in a pot of boiling water for just a minute, drain them, and let them cool to room temperature. Carefully peel away and discard the tough, pale layer from the outside of each tender, bright-green bean.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups freshly shelled fava beans (see note above)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 fresh red chili, sliced, or pinch red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 garlic clove, finely minced or puréed on a Microplane grater</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 head escarole, cleaned and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh mint, roughly torn</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 4 sprigs fresh basil, roughly torn</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 lemon, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 ounces pecorino Romano cheese, thinly shaved</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Heat the olive</strong> oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fava beans, chili, garlic, and a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the favas have lost their raw bite and are bright green, about 5 minutes. Set the favas aside to cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, using your hands, mix the escarole, mint, and basil together in a large bowl. Once the favas are cool, add them to the escarole mixture and squeeze over the juice from the lemon. Gently combine all of the ingredients and add salt. Season with more lemon and more olive oil, if needed. Scatter over the shaved pecorino Romano and serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Tomato salads depend entirely on your tomatoes and should only be made when the fruit is at its best. I like to add big, rustic croutons made with toasted bread that’s been rubbed with garlic and well seasoned, then soaked with vinegar and water so they soften. Combined with crunchy cucumbers and fresh scallions and basil, this salad is substantial and full of texture and great summer flavor.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 pounds ripe heirloom tomatoes (a mixture of different shapes and colors is great)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 scallions, sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ English cucumber, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 slices toasted country bread</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 garlic clove, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups water</p>
<p class="ingredient">Handful fresh basil leaves, torn</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Cut the tomatoes</strong> into bite-size pieces. (Small cherry tomatoes can simply be halved while large tomatoes should be stemmed and cut into wedges; use your judgment.) Place the tomatoes in a bowl and season aggressively with salt and pepper. Add the scallions and cucumber and pour in the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the sherry vinegar. Using your hands, gently toss all of the ingredients to combine.</p>
<p>Rub the toast with the garlic and season with salt and pepper. Place the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar in a large bowl along with the water and dunk the bread into the mixture briefly just to soften the bread. Tear the bread into large pieces and combine them with the tomatoes in the bowl.</p>
<p>Arrange the salad on a large platter and scatter the torn basil over the top. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Everyone who has this dish at Buvette asks what’s in it, and can never believe how simple it is. I like small, irregular bits of cheese throughout this salad. It seems obvious that you should use a grater to easily cut small pieces of cheese, but I find the consistency of grated cheese bits too uniform and unpleasingly perfect. To achieve the right texture, simply twist the tines of a fork into a chunk of cheese, raking it as you go.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 dozen Brussels sprouts</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup raw walnut halves</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup finely fork-crumbled pecorino Romano cheese (see note above)</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Trim off and</strong> discard the bottom ends of the sprouts and discard any loose or discolored outer leaves. Using a mandoline, the slicing attachment on a food processor, or simply a sharp knife, carefully shave the sprouts. Combine them in a large bowl with the remaining ingredients, scrunching the sprouts with your hands as you mix so that they wilt a little. Season to taste with more salt, if necessary, and a bit more olive oil if you think it needs it; the exact amount will depend not only on your preference, but also the size of the Brussels sprouts.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">The radicchio in this gorgeous salad can be swapped for <em>castelfranco,</em> one of the most beautiful lettuces in the whole world. A cross between red-leafed chicory and endive, it’s pale green with red specks the color of wine. It is not always easy to find, so jump on it if you see it, but absolutely feel free to substitute easier-to-find radicchio in its place.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I learned of this salad from Rita Sodi, who runs the fine restaurant I Sodi on Christopher Street, just around the corner from Buvette. It’s the best thing to make when you’re confronted with too much zucchini in the summertime. Not only is it quick to throw together but also incredibly beautiful with its long, thin ribbons of zucchini interrupted with shards of cheese and perfectly imperfect torn mint leaves.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 large or 3 medium zucchini, ends trimmed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 4 sprigs fresh mint, torn</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ fresh red chili, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 ounces pecorino Romano cheese, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup high-quality extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Using a mandoline,</strong> vegetable peeler, or a sharp knife, slice the zucchini lengthwise into long ribbons. On a serving platter or on each of four individual plates, arrange them so that they have some height, folding them here and there so that they rest on one another and stand up a bit. Scatter the torn mint, red chili, and cheese over the zucchini, and drizzle with the olive oil. Season the salad with plenty of salt and pepper and serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This salad is all about the beauty of the randomness. I like to think of it as an ode to Andy Goldsworthy, the inspiring British artist who makes sculptures out of natural materials, often set in nature. I take my time composing each serving so it looks both stylish and earthy and season not only the vegetables, but the plate too. This technique ensures that each bite is surrounded by flavor.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 celery stalks</p>
<p class="ingredient">Small handful tender celery leaves</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 large button mushrooms (if you can find fresh porcini mushrooms, use them!)</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Cut the celery</strong> in half crosswise and then thinly slice the pieces lengthwise on a mandoline so you have beautiful, crunchy celery ribbons. Place the sliced celery, celery leaves, and shallots in a bowl of icy-cold water for a few minutes, then lift them onto paper towels to drain. This step will help take the bite out of the shallots and crisp the celery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thinly slice the mushrooms and the cheese using a mandoline or a sharp knife and set them aside.</p>
<p>Drizzle each of four salad plates, or one large serving dish, with a little olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Lay down the mushrooms in a single layer and then artfully and casually arrange the celery, celery leaves, shallots, and cheese on top of the mushrooms. Drizzle everything with a bit more olive oil, and season with a final pinch of salt and a few more grinds of black pepper. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This salad, a riff on a French classic, <em>carottes râpées,</em> allows me to sneak in coriander in two ways, first with roughly crushed seeds that have been toasted and second with fresh cilantro, the plant that grows from coriander seeds. Rounded out with pistachios and an assertive lemon dressing, this salad is bright in both color and flavor.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>

</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In a large bowl,</strong> whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and chili flakes. Using the flat side of your knife blade or a mortar and pestle, gently crush the coriander seeds and add them to the dressing. Stir the carrots and pistachios into the dressing, then gently stir in the cilantro. Let the salad sit for at least half an hour before serving. The salad will keep, well covered, in the refrigerator for a few days.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">While this dish calls for yellow wax beans, it is great with a variety of fresh beans, including thin green haricots verts, stunning purple string beans, and long, flat Romano beans.
