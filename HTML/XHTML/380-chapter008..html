<p class="center">Preparing meals becomes an easy, doable routine when things like olive oil, crème fraîche, mustard, vinegar, mayonnaise, capers, and butter are in reach. Cooking becomes even more interesting when you go from merely keeping your pantry stocked to building a larder.</p>
<p class="center1">Traditionally, larders were cool areas in homes, typically cold cellars, which were used for food storage before refrigerators became commonplace. Nowadays, a larder has become more a personal tradition of canning, pickling, and other do-it-yourself crafts, and suggests being resourceful and economic. A larder is also about preparedness, having tins of anchovies and jars of jam on your shelf, a stack of clean kitchen towels folded nearby, and knowing how to keep copper polished. Having a larder means honoring the age-old traditions of keeping a home running, and taking pleasure in the time these tasks require.</p>
<p class="center1">A larder is also very much about give and take. It’s about accepting jars of homemade jam from a neighbor and remembering to put them out when you have the neighbor over for breakfast. It’s about drying bundles of herbs and crushing them for herbes de Provence and storing them in jars to use in your cooking and also to offer as a housewarming gift. Keeping a larder means being able to easily make a pot of soup for a friend who is ill, or making more vinaigrette than you need, knowing that your dinner guest might want to take some home so that they are one step closer to making dinner for their family. The following pages include my favorite larder recipes and many tricks of my trade. Pass them on.</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I would not touch a piece of Tarte Tatin (<a href="chapter007f.xhtml#page-243">here</a>) without crème fraîche. One of my most frequently used ingredients, crème fraîche is in many of my recipes. If you can’t find it, here’s how to make it. Plan ahead if you want to make this from scratch, as it will take some time.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 2 CUPS CRÈME FRAîCHE]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 cups heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons buttermilk</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>It is as</strong> easy as mixing the heavy cream together with the buttermilk. Let the mixture rest, unrefrigerated, at 70°F for 10 hours, or until thickened. Stir, cover, and refrigerate. The crème fraîche keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.</p></div>
