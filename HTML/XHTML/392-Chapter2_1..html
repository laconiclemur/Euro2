<p class="intro">These basic recipes are referred to in various recipes throughout the book. They are good staples and can be mixed and matched with other ingredients of your choosing – once you have exhausted the delicious options in this book, of course! Be sure to double-check whether to use the full amount or half the quantity listed here.</p>
<p class="chap-title1">LAYER CAKE BASES</p>
<p class="noindent1">This base for layer cakes is similar to a very light Genoise sponge. You can, of course, bake these in three pans to make them uniform, but I find it just as easy to draw circles on baking parchment and then cut the edges to fit once baked. Some people use baking powder in layer cakes but I usually opt to use just eggs and sugar as the leavener because I feel the end result is more delicate. However, it can be trickier. The secret is to whip the eggs and sugar properly to ribbon stage – this can take several minutes to achieve. Secondly, when you fold in the flour, do so very gently in figure-of-eight folds and don’t rush it.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">25 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> stick butter, melted and set aside to cool</p>
<p class="ingrd">4 eggs</p>
<p class="ingrd">120 g/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">120 g/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup plus 2 tablespoons plain/all-purpose flour or cake flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds of 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd2">3 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat together the eggs and sugar on high speed in a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk. Beat until the mixture reaches ribbon stage – you will be able to see the traces of the mixture when you move the whisk.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Use a 20-cm/8-inch diameter plate to draw three circles on baking parchment. Cut these out and place one parchment circle on each of the three baking sheets. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the flour, salt and vanilla in a separate bowl. Sift into the egg mixture, bit by bit, carefully folding using a figure-of-eight movement until incorporated. Pour the cooled melted butter down the side of the bowl and fold carefully again, trying not to knock out air.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Divide the mixture evenly between the parchment circles on the baking sheets spreading right to the edges of each circle with the back of a spoon. If they go over a bit, don’t worry, you can cut these bits off afterwards.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for about 5–7 minutes or until light golden brown.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before removing the baking parchment. If the parchment sticks, slightly dampen the paper side with cold water and the paper will come off easily. Trim any untidy edges using a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Note:</b> If you really want to use baking powder, add 1 teaspoon to the flour for a slight lift.</p>
<p class="chap-title1"><a id="page_13"/>DANISH PASTRY</p>
<p class="intro">Many people are scared to attempt Danish pastry from scratch. It is, admittedly, a little time-consuming, but it isn’t actually hard – it is so worth it once you taste those flaky pastries, straight from the oven. Originally, Viennese pastry (Vienna bread or <i>Wienerbrød</i>) was brought to Denmark by Austrian bakers around 1850, and the Danish variety developed from there.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">25 g/1 oz. fresh yeast or 13 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons dried/active dry yeast</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 ml/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup whole milk, heated to</p>
<p class="ingrd">36–37°C (97–98°F)</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons butter, softened</p>
<p class="ingrd">350 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups strong white/bread flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg plus 1 yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd1">FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">350 g/3 sticks butter, softened</p>
<p class="ingrd">25 g/3 tablespoons plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a baking sheet, lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="noindent1">If you are using fresh yeast, add the yeast and whole milk to a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix until the yeast has dissolved.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If using dried/active dry yeast, pour the milk into a bowl, sprinkle over the yeast and whisk together. Cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to activate and become frothy and bubbly. Pour into the mixer with the dough hook attached.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Stir in the sugar and softened butter, then mix the flour with the salt and start to add, bit by bit. Add the egg halfway through along with the remaining flour. Keep mixing with the dough hook for a good 5 minutes. The resulting dough should still be a little bit sticky.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cover the bowl with clingfilm/plastic wrap and leave to rise for an hour or until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead through, adding more flour as needed until you have a stretchy, workable dough. Roll the dough out into a big square 35 x 35 cm/14 x 14 inches or as evenly as you can.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For the filling, mix the butter with the flour into a just mouldable ball using your hands. It’s important this mixture ends up being a similar consistency to the dough – this will make it easier to roll. If your hands are too warm, use a rolling pin and beat the butter flat between two sheets of baking parchment. Flatten the butter out to a square around 25 x 25 cm/9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> x 9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches then place this butter square onto your dough at a 45 degree angle so that the dough corners can fold back in to cover the butter, like an envelope.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Carefully fold the dough corners over the butter until you have completely enclosed it. Dust with flour and carefully roll out the package to a rectangle around 30 x 50 cm/11<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> x 20 inches then fold the layers the short way twice so you end up with a rectangle approx 30 x 15 cm/11<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> x 6 inch (3 layers with butter). It is important that you roll carefully so that the butter stays inside the pastry package.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place the dough on the prepared baking sheet, cover with clingfilm/plastic wrap and chill for 15 minutes in the refrigerator. Repeat the folding process: roll to a rectangle and fold back on itself – you now have 9 layers of butter. Again, rest the dough in the fridge for 15 minutes, then repeat the rolling process again so you end up with yet another rectangle in 3 folds with 27 layers of butter in total. After a final rest in the refrigerator, your pastry is now ready to shape into whatever you want to bake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At any stage during the making of Danish pastries, if your hands or the dough get too warm, step back and cool things down a bit, as this can spoil your end result.</p>
<p class="chap-title1"><a id="page_14"/>SWEET SHORTCRUST PASTRY</p>
<p class="intro">This basic sweet shortcrust pastry is useful for many recipes in this book. If you prefer a less sweet base, simply reduce the sugar content slightly. Remember that keeping the butter as cold as possible is key to making pastry with a good short texture.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks cold butter, cubed</p>
<p class="ingrd">350 g/2<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">125 g/1 cup plus 1 tablespoon icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla extract OR seeds from half a vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 700 G/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> LB. DOUGH</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rub the cold butter into the plain/all-purpose flour until sandy in texture, then add the icing/confectioners’ sugar and vanilla. Add the whole egg and mix until the dough holds together and becomes smooth, taking care not to over-mix. You can also make the dough in the food processor by pulsing the ingredients together briefly, if you wish.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Wrap the dough in clingfilm/plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator before using.</p>
<p class="chap-title1">PASTRY CREAM</p>
<p class="intro">There is something so deliciously decadent about cakes with pastry cream. The comfort of custard, I usually call it. I love making it from scratch and use it for anything from filling cakes to layering trifles and serving it with crumbles (for that, I simply thin with a bit of milk). The only thing to watch out for is not to burn the milk, as this will spoil the whole lot.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">500 ml/2 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 vanilla pod/bean, seeds scraped</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup caster/superfine sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">30 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup cornflour/cornstarch</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">25 g/2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES APPROX. 600–625 G/21–22 OZ.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a saucepan, heat the milk with the scraped out seeds from the vanilla pod/bean.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar and add the cornflour/cornstarch.</p>
<p class="noindent1">When the milk has just reached boiling point, take off the heat and pour one third into the egg mixture while whisking continuously.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Once whisked through, pour the egg mixture back into the remaining hot milk. Return to the stove and bring to the boil, carefully. Whisk continuously as the mixture thickens, for just under a minute, then remove from the heat and stir in the salt and butter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour into a cold bowl and place a sheet of baking parchment on top to prevent the cream from forming a crust as it cools. The mixture will keep well in the refrigerator for a few days.</p>
<p class="chap-title1"><a id="page_15"/>MARZIPAN (FOR BAKING)</p>
<p class="intro">I love baking with marzipan – from <i>Kransekage</i> to Mazarin Tart and even Lent Buns, a good 50/50 marzipan has many uses. If you buy marzipan in most UK supermarkets, you will get 25% almond and 75% sugar – but in Scandinavian baking, we use 50% almond for baking and 60% almond for petits fours and finer cakes. This is such a simple way to make marzipan. I use egg white to bind – which means that it won’t keep as long, so make only what you need.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/2 cups finely ground almonds (if the grind feels a bit coarse, re-grind it at home a few times in your grinder or processor)</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon almond extract</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 medium egg white (approx. 30 g/1 oz.) ideally pasteurized</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES APPROX. 400 G/14 OZ.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Blend the ingredients together in a food processor until you have a smooth marzipan.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll the mixture into a log and wrap tightly in clingfilm/plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before using.</p>
<p class="chap-title1">REMONCE ALMOND PASTE</p>
<p class="intro">This is a classic almond-based filling for Danish pastries. It is nearly always baked rather than used raw and is integral to many Nordic cake and pastry recipes. Sometimes, cinnamon, vanilla and dark brown sugar are added (for cinnamon swirls and buns, for example). Remonce is sometimes translated to Lord Mayor’s filling, although I’ve never heard this term used in the UK, so I wonder if this translation perhaps stems from the filling used in <i>Borgmesterkringle</i> – the name meaning ‘Mayor’s Kringle’.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">100 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. marzipan (minimum 50% store-bought or see recipe above)</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/7 tablespoons butter, softened</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup plus 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons icing/confectioners’ sugar, sifted</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES APPROX. 300 G/10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> OZ.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Grate the marzipan into a bowl.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the softened butter and icing/confectioners’ sugar.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Whisk everything together until smooth. Your remonce paste is now ready to use.</p>
