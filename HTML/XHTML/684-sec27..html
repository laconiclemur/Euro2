<p class="nonindent">I really love the vinegary flavor in the fried fish here. It’s a surprising contrast where you’re not really expecting it. Traditionally, this dish is made with cazón, known as “dogfish,” which has meaty, firm white flesh. I’ve tried it with grouper and orange roughy, too. Any white fish that can hold its shape in chunks when fried will work here.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 piquillo peppers</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon pimentón (smoked sweet paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Pinch cayenne pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons packed fresh oregano leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Arbequina Olive Oil Mayonnaise (<a href="sec10.xhtml#page49">here</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ pounds skinless grouper, orange roughy, or other firm white fish fillets, cut into 1½-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Canola oil, for frying</strong></p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">IN A FOOD PROCESSOR OR BLENDER, COMBINE THE</span> piquillos, cumin, pimentón, black pepper, cayenne pepper, vinegar, parsley, oregano, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon water. Puree until smooth, scraping the bowl occasionally. The adobo mixture should be thick enough to stick to the fish but not be stiff and pasty. If needed, blend in another tablespoon water. Transfer half of the adobo mixture to a bowl and stir in the mayonnaise. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Transfer the remaining adobo sauce to another large bowl. The adobo and adobo mayonnaise can be refrigerated in airtight containers for up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="indent">When ready to serve the dish, season the fish chunks on all sides with salt, toss in the bowl with the adobo to completely coat. Place the flour in a shallow dish.</p>
<p class="indent">Fill a large skillet with oil to a depth of ¼ inch. Heat over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. While the oil heats, dredge a few fish chunks in the flour and shake to remove excess flour. Add to the hot oil and cook, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining fish. Serve with the adobo mayonnaise for dipping.</p>
