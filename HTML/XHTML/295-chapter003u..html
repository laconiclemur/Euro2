<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I begin making this soup in spring as soon as basil arrives in the market, and the last bowl is served late into Indian summer. I allow the vegetables to change with the season and use leeks and favas in the spring instead of the green beans and zucchini of summer. Whatever vegetables you use, this soup is always made with water, and topped with an ample drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a generous spoonful of bright green basil <em>pistou</em>.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 6 TO 8]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 cup dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight and drained</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup dried cranberry beans, soaked overnight and drained</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 celery stalks, diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large carrots, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 fennel bulb, including the light green stems, diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">One 15-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, seeded and chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 large outer escarole leaves, torn into pieces</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large handful green beans, trimmed and cut in half crosswise</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 small zucchini, diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch red chili flakes, plus more as needed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups fresh basil leaves, washed and dried</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the soaked</strong> beans, all of the vegetables, the chili flakes, and 2 teaspoons of salt into a large soup pot and cover with cold water. Add 2 additional cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, lower the heat, and allow it to simmer until the beans are tender, about 1 hour, adding more water as the soup cooks if it gets too dry or too thick at any point. Season the soup to taste with additional salt and chili flakes, if necessary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, place the basil leaves in a mortar and use a pestle to crush them with 2 teaspoons of salt. Work in the Parmigiano-Reggiano and the olive oil to make a coarse paste. Alternatively, you can pulse the basil, salt, and Parmigiano-Reggiano together in a food processor and stream in the olive oil to make the paste. Either way, season the pistou with additional salt, if necessary, and set it aside. A thin layer of olive oil poured on top will prevent the pistou from browning.</p>
<p>Serve the soup hot, topped with a generous drizzle of olive oil, a big spoonful of the pistou, and a handful of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTES</h1>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>1.</strong> <span class="special">You can speed up the cooking by substituting two 15-ounce cans of beans for the dried beans. Simply rinse the beans under cold running water and drain them. Add them to the soup once the vegetables are tender and let the whole mixture cook for 15 minutes before serving.</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>2.</strong> <span class="special">Other uses for the more tender inner leaves of the escarole include Grilled Escarole (<a href="chapter006k.xhtml#page-180">here</a>), Poached Eggs over Scafata (<a href="chapter001h.xhtml#page-13">here</a>), or Fava Bean Salad (<a href="chapter003k.xhtml#page-83">here</a>).</span></p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This hearty soup is taken from the Sicilian tradition of emptying your cupboards at the end of winter to make a pot of soup and clear the way for spring. It’s sometimes referred to as San Giuseppe Soup because spring-cleaning coincides with the celebration of Saint Joseph (<em>Giuseppe</em> in Italian). Note that the chickpeas must be soaked overnight, so plan ahead.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES A BIG POT; ENOUGH FOR AT LEAST 8 SERVINGS]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cup dried chickpeas</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup dried fava beans</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup green split peas</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup dried cranberry beans</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup green lentils</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Leaves from 2 bunches Swiss chard, thoroughly washed and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 yellow onion, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 fennel bulb, trimmed and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon fennel seeds, finely ground</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons Homemade Tomato Concentrate (<a href="chapter008d.xhtml#page-266h">here</a>) or tomato paste</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">8 thick slices toast, rubbed with garlic, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the chickpeas</strong> in a bowl, cover with cold water, and allow them to soak overnight. You can leave them out at room temperature or place them in the refrigerator. Wherever they’re out of your way!</p>
<p>The next day, drain the chickpeas and set them aside.</p>
<p>Place the fava beans, split peas, cranberry beans, and lentils into a large bowl and cover with warm water. Let the legumes soak for half an hour. Drain them and set them aside, separate from the chickpeas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, place ¼ cup of olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the Swiss chard, onion, and fennel and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Stir the ground fennel seeds and the tomato concentrate into the vegetables and cook until fragrant, just about a minute. Stir in the drained chickpeas and cover the mixture with water. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce the heat, and allow it to simmer for half an hour.</p>
<p>Add the reserved legumes to the pot and add enough water to cover. Cook until all of the legumes are tender and soft and the soup is quite thick, about 1½ hours, adding water as the soup is cooking if it gets too dry or too thick at any point. Season the soup with plenty of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Place a piece of garlic-rubbed toast into the bottom of each of eight soup bowls, drizzle each slice liberally with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Ladle the hot soup over the toast and serve immediately.</p>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">Even though only the leaves from the Swiss chard should be used for this soup, don’t discard the stems! Trim off any dark bits and cook the stems in salted, boiling water until just tender and then grill them with olive oil and salt and serve them just like that—especially good with fish. Or use the blanched stems to make a gratin, like the Cauliflower Gratin on <a href="chapter006k-2.xhtml#page-181">here</a>, but use Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of Gruyère, and season the sauce with plenty of garlic.</span></p>
