<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Duck eggs cooked in browned butter and sage is simple food. Of course you can prepare regular chicken eggs this way, but I appreciate the rich taste of duck eggs and the nutty flavor of brown butter.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 3 EGGS; EASILY MULTIPLIED]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 duck eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Place the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sage leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns brown. Gently crack the eggs into the pan and place it in the oven (alternatively, you can turn the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid). Bake until the egg whites are just set and the yolks retain a bright yellow color, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, sprinkled with salt and pepper. Don’t forget about the browned butter left in the pan. Be sure to pour it over the eggs when serving.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-10"/><span class="blue">Ramps and Eggs</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Ramps, small wild onions with dark green leaves and pale red roots, arrive early during springtime on the East Coast and disappear quickly. Both their ephemeral presence and strong flavor make them a real treat. I like to prepare them as simply as possible by wilting them in olive oil and combining them with eggs.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 1 GENEROUSLY]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small bunch ramps, root ends trimmed and discarded, thoroughly washed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 large eggs</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Warm the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ramps and a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the ramps just begin to soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Gently crack the eggs into the pan directly alongside the ramps and place the pan in the oven (alternatively, you can reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid). Bake until the egg whites are just set and the yolk retains a bright yellow color, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, sprinkled with additional salt.</p></div>
