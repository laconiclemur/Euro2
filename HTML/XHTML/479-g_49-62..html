			<p class="Normal-noind" style="page-break-before:always;"><span class="lead-in">french dressing is vinaigrette sauce</span>. As I understand it, it is made of salt, freshly ground pepper, good red-wine vinegar, and first cold-pressing olive oil. It is so easy to make that to prepare a quantity in advance to be stored is risibly impractical. Its commonest faults are: An excess of vinegar; poor oil; poor vinegar.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The flavor of good olive oil is rich, clean, clear, and fruity. There should be no muddy, acid aftertaste. It belongs to the realm of voluptuous experience. Good olive oil (that commercialized in France as <em class="ital">“Extra-Vièrge”</em>) contains less than 1 percent oleic acid. The oil has been extracted from healthy, ripe olives by purely mechanical means with no application of heat or intervention of chemicals.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The light-bodied, light-colored olive oils preferred by some for their minimal flavor are, although sometimes deceptively labeled, almost certainly not pure olive oils. Even the better of commercialized French olive oils are blends (usually of Tunisian, Spanish, and Provençal oils), but they are pure olive oil. The best I have found on the American market is labeled “James Plagniol.” It carries only the designation “Pure Olive Oil,” but the quality corresponds to that of <em class="ital">“Extra-Vièrge.”</em> The New York distributors are: M. H. Greenbaum, Green Tree Bldg., 165 Chambers Street, New York, N.Y. 10013; the New Orleans distributors are: Gerde Newmann &amp; Co., P.O. Box 30.310, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page50">Walnut oil is also a natural product and may, in some salads, be used to very good effect, but its very personal and powerful flavor radically limits its use and a tendency to turn rapidly rancid discourages its purchase.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The light-bodied, lightly colored vegetable oils, extracted from a variety of different seeds—peanut, corn, sunflower, grape, etc.—do not usually taste bad. Some have a vaguely bitter aftertaste, but most have no taste at all. They do, however, “feel” bad in the mouth and their lack of taste is disconcerting—nor is it particularly comforting to know that most have been submitted to a series of violent chemical treatments (the addition of solvents for the extraction of the oil, the addition of other chemicals to neutralize the effects of the solvents and to render the oil odorless and colorless—and, finally, for most, a further treatment designed to give a yellowish tone to the emasculated product).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Quite apart from the excessive acidity lent a salad by an overdose of vinegar, the resultant wateriness of the sauce is unpleasant. Vinegars have different strengths and certain salad materials require more or less vinegar than others (pungent greens support more vinegar than sweet lettuces, for instance). A good mean ratio is about one part of vinegar to four or five parts of oil.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A vinaigrette may often be enhanced by a suggestion of garlic and, in many fewer instances—with cold meats, for instance—by the addition of some Dijon-type mustard (whose strength smothers the lovely fruit of the oil, but is welcomed by the meat). If garlic is used, it should be pounded to an absolute purée with the salt and pepper before being dissolved into the vinegar; mustard also should be mixed first with the seasoning and then the vinegar and, in any case, the oil should always be added after the perfect dissolution of the other ingredients into the vinegar.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A lettuce salad or one of varied greens without any other garnish most often finds its place following the main course, serving as a weightless and cleansing pause before the cheese and, perhaps, between two wines, but it may, as well, provide a happy prologue to a simple supper. The salads suggested or discussed here are all conceived as overtures to a meal.</p>
			
			
			
			<hr class="Subhead" style="page-break-before:always"/>
			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page51">Crudités</h2>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">An extremely attractive way to begin a meal—or to form the main body of a hot summer day’s luncheon—and one that always creates a particularly sympathetic atmosphere at table consists of presenting a large and colorful still life of seasonal vegetables, whole and raw when possible, peeled, sliced, grated, or chopped if necessary, garnished with peeled hard-boiled eggs and bouquets of fresh herbs—basil, dill, chervil, tarragon, hyssop, lemon thyme, leaf thyme (parsley and chives should be chopped and served in dishes apart). Oil, vinegar, lemon halves, a pitcher of heavy cream, mustard, and seasonings are served apart, and each guest fabricates his own salad or series of salads, seasoned to personal taste or whim (the lemon, cream, and dill are for small, firm cucumbers, the seeds still unformed, peeled and split in four, the sticks to be dipped in the sauce). The vegetables, depending on the season, may be chosen from tender young broad beans and young artichokes, quartered bulb fennel, celery hearts, Belgian endives, tomatoes, cucumbers, scallions, Italian sweet green peppers, cauliflower (raw if tiny and sweet), parboiled green beans (which, like parboiled cauliflower, are marvelous rapidly drained and served alone, hot, accompanied by olive oil and lemon), freshly parboiled asparagus . . .</p>
			
			
			
			<hr class="Subhead" style="page-break-before:always"/>
			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page52">Asparagus</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">But, it may be a sacrilege to eat asparagus any other way than alone, barely cooked, the head of each stalk delicately limp but firmly intact, warm, but not boiling hot, well drained and accompanied by olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper—and good sweet butter to be eaten in chunks on rough country bread.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It does no good to scrape or thinly peel asparagus with a vegetable peeler; they should be peeled with a sharp knife, starting at the cut end and terminating at the point where the skin becomes tender, so that all the fibrous material is removed and the entire stalk of tender asparagus can then be eaten, dipped repeatedly in its sauce. No cutlery is needed.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Many people suffer torture trying to tie up bundles of asparagus with a tiny length of string wrapped once around the bundle: Arrange the stalks carefully so that they form a neat and compact bundle held in the cup of your hand, the end of the string held firmly against the bundle with your thumb, and wrap the string tightly and repeatedly around, spiraling downward and back up to meet the string end, clipping the other end with plenty of length to permit easy tying; they are not only tied with no difficulty but, with strings wound the length of the bundle, they are easily lifted from their cooking water with the prong of a large kitchen fork. Cooking time may vary from 8 to 20 minutes, but for large, tender asparagus 12 minutes is a good mean to observe, testing the stems for firm doneness with the tip of a knife after 8 or 10 minutes. Drain the bundle first on a towel and transfer it to a platter containing a folded napkin (which absorbs further draining liquid and, at the same time, folded over the surface, prevents them from cooling too rapidly) before clipping the strings and arranging the asparagus.</p>
			<p class="Normal">I think one owes it to oneself in a restaurant never to accept a ready-made vinaigrette (nearly always muddied up with mustard and vegetable oils) and, unless it is particularly unmanageable, one owes it to one’s guests to present salt, pepper, vinegar and olive oil at table, never imposing a prepared vinaigrette, however pure, with asparagus. Restaurants often serve warm asparagus that has been cooked, refrigerated, and dipped into boiling water—it is repellent; if asparagus is left over, do anything but that: Eat it cold, toss it in butter, throw it into a salad or an omelet, cover it with <em class="ital">béchamel</em> and buttered breadcrumbs and gratiné it, purée the stems and mix with the tips into a soufflé batter . . .</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page53" style="page-break-before:always;">Impromptu Composed Salad</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Salade Canaille</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">To baptize this kind of salad <em class="ital">canaille,</em> underlining the French affection for the delinquent and the demi-monde, is to suggest a quality of refreshing vitality allied to insolence—a certain flaunting refusal to respect accepted formulas. And, indeed, one need not often respect any of the endless and precisely defined classical recipes for composed salads (Niçoise, Waldorf, Andalous, Mimosa, Francillon, Bagration, and so forth interminably) to be struck with the puerility of such a pastime and to realize how much more valuable and exciting is the imaginative and playful, self-renewing invention of a giant composed salad, never once repeated, its composition dictated by the materials at hand. And, given the fanciful but far from frivolous presence of flowers and a sufficient variety of green things, presented in a vast, wide ceramic or earthenware vessel (you need the space for easy tossing and the large surface for decorative effect), nothing in the entire repertory of food possesses the same startling, vibrant visual immediacy—the same fresh and casual beauty. It is a concentrated, pulsating landscape of garden essences and must absolutely be tossed at table, for, no matter how delicious, the visual explosion of joy, mixing intricately and lastingly with your guests’ memories of mingled flavors, adds a dimension.</p>
			<p class="Normal">This salad, in the seasonal round of my own life, symbolizes the happiest time of the year—that which is lived almost entirely out of doors with the table set daily on the terrace in the shade of a grape arbor, the sparkling play of light heightening the effect of the table display of variegated greens and bright-colored punctuations. Alternating the honors of the summer luncheon table with the earlier-mentioned <em class="ital">crudités,</em> it serves sometimes as an hors d’oeuvre; often, preceded by melon or figs with ham in the Italian manner and followed by cheeses, it is the principal course, and sometimes it represents the entire meal.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page54">Aside from those elements listed under <em class="ital">crudités,</em> possible ingredients may include leftovers of all kinds: Meats, poultry, game or fish, the flesh carefully separated from bones and fat and cut into cubes, thin slices or rough juliènne, flaked or broken up, depending on its nature; boiled potatoes, macaroni, rice, white, kidney, or flageolet beans, chick-peas or lentils; peas, leeks, spinach, or beets; sautéed zucchini, mushrooms, raw or cooked, or grilled sweet peppers. Anchovies may be incorporated into the sauce or used as a garnish and, in the absence of more amusing leftovers, tinned tuna, crab, or lobster can be useful. Leafy things may include tiny tender leaves of borage or sorrel, purslane, arugula, rocket, chicory (the tiny, richly dark red heads of Italian chicory add wonderful color to their bitter freshness), watercress, field cress, young dandelion, and any of the lettuces—with the possible exception of the ignoble iceberg. The herbs I choose from among basil, parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon, hyssop, dill, lemon thyme, leaf thyme, fennel, marjoram, and, if it is young and tender, savory. The decorative splash of nasturtiums, calendula petals, or ultramarine hyssop is supplemented by delicate peppery savors, that of the nasturtium being particularly attractive and highly personal.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Roasting juices, carefully cleansed of all fat, or the syrupy liquid from grilled sweet peppers may be added to the vinaigrette or, for variety’s sake, it may be replaced by a cream and lemon base.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In the face of so many possibilities, special care must be taken to avoid unhappy marriages between flavors that are either quarrelsome or tend to cancel each other out: It is wise not to mix up fish, meats, and poultry (even cured anchovy—which, in meridional France, is as common a flavoring agent as garlic—seems often to muddy a total effect and is probably best used either by itself or in combination with tuna); the peculiarities and the preferences of the various herbs have been discussed in the preface; tomatoes and beets clash . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page55">Few of the other possibilities mentioned will cause any trouble, but one should not attempt to pack too many things into a single salad and each should be chosen for the unique texture and flavor it lends to the whole: One starchy element is usually enough (although it is true that beans and rice or lentils and macaroni are common and good combinations); celery and bulb fennel are too similar in their crunchiness and sweetness to logically share a salad; too many herbs will confuse the palate; avocado and cooked artichoke, both delicately flavored and soft of texture, are also confusing together, whereas raw artichoke may be perfectly allied to avocado. A salad of this sort need not necessarily comprehend a meat or a fish, but, if it does, that ingredient should be thought of as holding a star part, everything else relating to it, lending it relief.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Consider, decorative effect apart, the roles of each of the ingredients in the following recipe: Raw onion is always a useful accompaniment to cold boiled beef—it, the garlic, the herbs, and the flowers are essentially seasoning agents; the potatoes attenuate some of the stronger flavors and, at the same time, lend body and a unifying effect; the lettuce also, although not absolutely essential, acts as a buffer for the bitterness of the rocket and the hyssop and the spiciness of the basil and nasturtium; the hard-boiled egg’s gentle presence is always welcome among sharply flavored green things; the celery lends crispness and sweetness; and the remaining vegetables, each distinctly different in texture and flavor, complement one another. And, bearing these specific roles in mind, try to imagine a number of replacements: The <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> replaced by tuna and the potatoes by white beans; the bitter herbs and greens replaced by a handful of chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> containing tarragon; in place of the meat, a remainder of squid braised in tomato and white wine, the sauce incorporated into the vinaigrette, tomatoes and eggs eliminated and the potatoes replaced by rice; mussels, fennel, and rice, eliminating meat, hyssop, basil, and potatoes; or, replace the meat with shrimp or crab, the potatoes with macaroni, the vinaigrette with lemon and cream, the herbs with dill, the tomatoes with cucumbers . . . One could go on forever, and, in practice, one does.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page56">It is important to remember that many ingredients gain, and give, flavor by macerating some time in the sauce. Others are indifferent to this treatment and certain ingredients—leafy greens and green beans in particular—should only be tossed at the last minute. Tomatoes, if used as surface garnish, may simply be cored and cut into sections, but if they are to join in the maceration, they should be peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped, sliced, or cut into small sections. Not only does the proportion of vinegar to oil vary depending on the ingredients, but the amount of seasoning necessary is also greatly elastic: A vinaigrette that is perfectly seasoned for a simple green salad will require a bit more salt in the presence of most starchy products—and a great deal more for grilled sweet peppers, for instance. The only way to satisfactorily prepare a sauce for a compound salad is to begin with the basic sauce, taking care not to oversalt—an irremediable error, and then season progressively, adding oil and vinegar also, if necessary, as the various elements are added.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It goes without saying that the following recipe is an example and that neither proportions nor specific ingredients need be strictly respected.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">3 medium firm yellow potatoes	</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup dry white wine</li>

				<ul class="IL-LIST">
				<li class="IL">8 to 10 ounces pot-au-feu meat (cooled out of its bouillon), slivered, cubed, or cut into rough juliènne strips</li>
				<li class="IL">1 small heart of celery, sliced thinly crosswise</li>
				<li class="IL">2 or 3 scallions (or 1 small sweet onion), finely slivered</li>
				<li class="IL">1 small lettuce (Boston, romaine, or escarole)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 handful each of purslane leaves, rocket or arugula, and fresh basil leaves and flowers</li>
				<li class="IL">6 to 8 ounces tender young green beans, parboiled (8 to 10 minutes), drained, but not “refreshed,” preferably still tepid</li>
				<li class="IL">2 or 3 medium tomatoes, firm and ripe</li>
				<li class="IL">4 hard-boiled eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">2 teaspoons finely chopped hyssop leaves</li>
				<li class="IL">12 to 15 nasturtium blossoms and buds plus small tender leaves</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Boil the potatoes in their skins, peel them while still hot, holding them in a towel, slice them into a bowl, pour over the white wine and leave to cool.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Grill the peppers, preferably over hot coals, or in the broiler, turning them regularly until evenly grilled on all sides, the skin charred and the flesh softened. Leave them to cool on a plate, peel them, slit them, and discard all seeds, but carefully collect all the juices. Tear them into strips lengthwise.</p>
			<p class="Normal">See the <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page181">section on artichokes</a> for methods of paring. If they are young and tender enough to be eaten raw, prepare the vinaigrette first and then slice or cut them into quarters or eighths and stir them immediately into the sauce to prevent their blackening through contact with the air. Otherwise rub them with lemon and cook in salted boiling water with a branch of thyme until only just done, leaving them to cool in their cooking liquid.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Slice the clove of garlic into the salad bowl, add salt and pepper, and work vigorously with a wooden pestle until the garlic is completely puréed and forms a dry paste with the salt and pepper. Add the vinegar, stir until dissolved, and stir in the olive oil. Add the peppers with their juices and stir vigorously, taking care not to crush the peppers, until the sauce is in a state of semi-emulsion; taste for seasoning and rectify with salt, if necessary.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If using cooked artichokes, drain them, remove the chokes, leaving the edible base attached, slice them, and add to the peppers. Drain the potatoes and add them (the wine may be used for cooking), along with the meat, the celery, and the scallions. Stir everything well together, but gently so as not to crush the potatoes, and taste again for seasoning—add more oil or vinegar also, if necessary.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page58">The lettuce and other greens should be gently but thoroughly dried between two towels after being washed. Place the serving fork and spoon crosswise in the bowl to help protect the salad greens from contact with the sauce, prop a few of the larger leaves between the service and the sides of the bowl and tumble the rest of the salad greens loosely on top, distributing the green beans over the surface. Decorate with tomato sections and quartered hard-boiled eggs, sprinkling with hyssop, and finish with the nasturtium flowers and their leaves. Present the salad in this state, tossing only at the moment of serving, turning all the ingredients thoroughly and repeatedly (few people toss a salad well and it is a matter of no small importance—if you are not sufficiently adept with fork and spoon, do not hesitate to use your hands to arrive at a loose but intimate intermingling of elements).</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page58a">Salads with Hard-boiled Eggs</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The hard-boiled egg is not simply another salad ingredient that may or may not find its place depending on the demands of décor or supplementary flavor. Its function, residing largely in the yolk, is, like that of salt, fundamental. It is a dulcifying agent, suavely veiling the bitterness or acerbity native to numerous leafy vegetables or bitter salads. With a vinaigrette or, more rarely, with cream and lemon, alone or in combination, chicory, endive, escarole, dandelion, parboiled spinach (rinsed in cold water, squeezed, and coarsely chopped), lambs’ lettuce, or cress expands in its presence, mollified or flattered by the union. A salad for which I have a particular affection is that of rocket and hard-boiled eggs sauced with a vinaigrette. A breath of garlic may be welcome and the fantasy of scattered calendula petals is amusing. The eggs may be halved, quartered, sliced, chopped or, as in the following recipe, incorporated into the sauce:</p>

				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">
				<li class="IL">Salt, freshly ground pepper	</li>

				<ul class="IL-LIST">
				<li class="IL">3 hard-boiled eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">1 handful chopped parsley</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">See <a href="f_3-48.xhtml#page17">instructions for paring and cleaning leeks</a>. Use only the white and very light-green parts of the leeks. Tie them into bundles as for asparagus, plunge them into salted, boiling water, and cook, covered, at a simmer for about ten minutes or until they are only just done, the flesh offering but the slightest resistance to the point of a small sharp knife. Drain well before transferring to a serving platter, remove the strings, arrange the leeks, and spoon over the following vinaigrette: Mix the mustard with the salt and pepper, add the vinegar, stirring until the mustard is completely dissolved, mash in the egg yolks coarsely, without reducing them to a purée, stir in the oil and, finally, the finely chopped whites of the eggs and the parsley. Taste for seasoning. For the sake of a prettier presentation, half of the chopped whites and parsley may be mixed together and kept apart for sprinkling the surface. Serve tepid.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page60" style="page-break-before:always;">Salad of Hot Chick-Peas</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Salade de Pois-Chiches</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Chick-peas, even more than dried beans or lentils (also delicious served in this way), are extremely sensitive to hard waters. I usually soak them overnight with sifted wood ashes and rain water. Most people substitute a healthy pinch of bicarbonate of soda for the wood ashes and do not bother with the rain water. They should, in any case, be well rinsed after either treatment, largely covered with cold water (rain or not), an onion stuck with a couple of cloves, a carrot, some thyme, and a bay leaf added, the water brought slowly to a boil and kept, covered, at a barely perceptible simmer until done (salting only toward the end of the cooking)—about two hours, or less if they are from the year’s crop. A good idea is to save spinach cooking water, only lightly salted, in which to cook them.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Serve them drained, hot, accompanied by olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper grinder, and dishes of finely chopped onion and parsley, each guest preparing his own salad to taste. The immediate explosion of perfume when good olive oil is added to any hot vegetable is always exciting.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page60a" style="page-break-before:always;">Wilted Cabbage Salad</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Salade de Choux à l’Alsaciènne</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">In Alsace this salad, accompanied by potatoes (boiled in their skins or sautéed) would most often represent the body of a family supper. In Lyonnaise country, a certain amount of chopped, hard-boiled egg and potato (boiled in the skin, peeled, then sliced hot) might be tossed with the salad, and it might preface a lovely mess of tripe. In the first instance, it would be washed down with a Zwicker or a Sylvaner and, in the second, with a young and light-bodied, cool Beaujolais.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page61">If slab bacon is not easily available, use lean packaged bacon, taking care to cook it slowly until semicrisp—neither flabby nor crumbly.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 cabbage, about 2 pounds	</li>
				<li class="IL">About 12 ounces lean slab bacon, rind removed, cut into ¼-inch wedges</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup wine vinegar</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup olive oil</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage, slice off the ribs of the visible remaining leaves, wash, cut in half vertically, remove the core, and shred the two halves as for coleslaw. Pick out and discard thick sections from inside ribs. Pack into the salad bowl, pour over boiling water, and leave, covered, to steep for ten minutes or so.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cook the bacon wedges, with a spoonful of olive oil to start them off, over a moderate heat, tossing regularly until lightly crisp on all sides.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Drain the cabbage, pressing to extract the maximum of liquid, return to the hot salad bowl, season with salt, grind over a generous amount of pepper, pour over the bacon and its fat, the vinegar, and the oil, and toss rapidly but thoroughly. Serve on preheated plates.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page61a" style="page-break-before:always;">Fresh Fig and Mint Salad</h1>

			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">5</span> or <span class="oldstyle">6</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The most successful of a number of experiments purposed to rescue the great wines of Sauternes from the dessert quarantine; the association is of the happiest, but the Sauternes’ rich caress increases the difficulty of choosing a succeeding wine. If you prefer not to begin a meal with a Sauternes, a white wine with a certain roundness and depth of fruit is, nonetheless, indicated—one of the Côte de Beaune growths or perhaps the usually impossible-to-place Gewürztraminer (above all, oyster wines of the “bone-dry, flinty” category should be avoided).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page62">French friends find the recipe bizarre, but all who have tasted it have been delighted by the clean, clear, surprising combination of flavors and fragrance. It is a refreshing summer day hors d’oeuvre. The only pity is that figs, even more than most fruit, suffer from being picked unripe; the fragility of the tree-ripened product precludes its commercialization.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">2 pounds ripe figs, freshly picked, if possible</li>
				<li class="IL">3 thin slices prosciutto, fat removed</li>
				<li class="IL">12 to 15 leaves of fresh mint</li>
				<li class="IL">Juice of 1 lemon</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">¾ cup heavy cream, unpasteurized and thick, if possible</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Note: I have found unpasteurized cream on the market in Iowa—it may be illegal in some states. Cartons of pasteurized “heavy” cream contain a certain amount of milk. If poured into a bowl and kept, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days, the surface will thicken and may be skimmed off for use in sauces of this kind. Otherwise, half-whipped cream will give a mousseline effect with more body.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Peel the figs and cut halfway down from the stem end, making two incisions in the form of a cross. Press gently from the sides to open them slightly (as one does with a baked potato). Arrange them closely on a serving dish and chill for about one hour in the coldest part of the refrigerator (not the freezer).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cut the ham into fine juliènne strips (about 1-inch lengths, matchstick width).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Crush about half of the mint leaves in the lemon juice and leave to macerate for 20 or 30 minutes, then discard them. Dissolve the salt into the lemon juice and slowly stir in the cream—the acid of the lemon will thicken it somewhat and its addition in small quantities at a time with continued stirring encourages the thickening. Taste for salt.</p>
