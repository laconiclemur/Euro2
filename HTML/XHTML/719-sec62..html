<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">DURING A COSTA BRAVA BEACH VACATION, I HAD</span> the best paella ever. When I asked the cook how he did it, he went on and on about the stock. He didn’t talk about the rice or the just-caught seafood; he focused on the one ingredient you can’t even see in the finished dish. As he expounded upon the ingredients that went into it and the time it took, it struck me: Spaniards take pride in how long their cooking takes, both in terms of actual simmering hours, but also in terms of the years it takes to master a dish. This cook has spent over 25 years perfecting paella. His primary job is actually as a fisherman, so he gets to turn out paella with the best and freshest possible ingredients, namely his daily catch.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though that paella was made in Catalonia, the dish itself originated in Valencia. The word paella refers to the pan, derived from the Latin word for pan, “patella,” but now is synonymous with the rice dish found all over Spain. Valencia was the dish’s birthplace because it is home to wetlands ideal for growing the short grain rice needed for the dish. In fact, the only specialty items you need to make paella are Spanish short-grain rice, such as bomba, and a paella pan, which creates a charred crust, called the soccarat, on the bottom. (I especially like the heavy duty Pata Negra pans.)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page187"/>Once you have the right rice and pan, you can cook the rice in stock or tomato sauce or both, and you can add any combination of meat, seafood, or vegetables. The Valencian classic combines locally sourced rabbit, snails, and vegetables. In my versions, I follow that spirit of local cooking when choosing ingredients. Because paella already has a rice base, it’s the ideal one-dish meal, even for entertaining. I don’t bother to serve anything else aside from plenty of sangria, wine, or beer.</p>
<p class="indent">Both grill and stovetop-oven techniques work, but the smokiness from outdoor cooking is incomparable. It actually isn’t more complicated than the indoor version. Paella technique lends itself to live fire cooking: It needs to start over high heat, then scale down to medium and, eventually, medium-low. As the coals burn, they’ll naturally diminish in heat, right at the times you need. I’ve made paella in grills countless times and remain amazed at how consistently this holds true.</p>
<p class="indent">The real appeal to cooking paella outdoors is being able to hang out with friends while creating a huge family meal that you’ll dig into together. It isn’t just a meal you make and serve, it’s one you share from start to finish.</p>
