			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_3822.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Rosé Champagne (Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier); Franck Pascal</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This can be a starter, a dessert, or a great hors d’oeuvre: just add toothpicks! The salty ricotta salata brings the seasoning to the dish, balancing the sweetness of the watermelon.</p>
			<p class="RHN">At the restaurant, we place the watermelon in a sous-vide bag and compress it under the highest pressure, which gives the watermelon the dense meaty texture and bright color shown in the photograph (opposite). If you have a vacuum-pack machine, you can try this. However, the dish is outstanding even when simply prepared as directed below.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the watermelon</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 mini seedless watermelon (about 4 pounds/1.75 kg.)</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons pine nuts</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the chile oil</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 small red chile pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI2">A chunk of ricotta salata (about 3 ounces/85 grams)</p>
			<p class="RI">2 mint sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The watermelon</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut off both ends of the watermelon, then cut it into a rectangular shape, removing all the rind. Cut it into 1-inch cubes and refrigerate.</p>
			<p class="RP">Melt the butter in a small skillet over low heat. Add the pine nuts and toast, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The chile oil</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut the chile lengthwise in half, remove the seeds, and slice into a very fine julienne (matchsticks). Put in a small bowl and cover with the oil. Let infuse at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Using a vegetable peeler, cut thin shavings of ricotta from the chunk of cheese. Remove the mint leaves from the stems.</p>
			<p class="RP">Place 5 or more cubes of watermelon on each plate and season with fleur de sel. Scatter the pine nuts, mint leaves, and ricotta shavings over the top and drizzle with the chile oil.</p>

			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Austrian Riesling; Kamptal Loimer</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This summer dish is based on panzanella, the traditional Italian salad of tomatoes and stale bread. It’s <em>cocina povera</em> at its best—with the contemporary addition of tomato water, a technique I learned at Gramercy Tavern.</p>
			<p class="RHN">Note that you need to start the tomato water a day ahead.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the tomato water</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 shallots</p>
			<p class="RI">½ bunch cilantro</p>
			<p class="RI">½ bunch basil</p>
			<p class="RI">2 pounds (1 kg.) ripe tomatoes</p>
			<p class="RI">Dash of sherry vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Dash of white balsamic vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the croutons</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ small sourdough bread (about 4 ounces/115 grams)</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, smashed</p>
			<p class="RI2">16 fresh almonds in the shell (or substitute Marcona almonds)</p>
			<p class="RI">4 ounces (125 grams) red currants (or substitute 1 cup raspberries)</p>
			<p class="RI">2 pounds (1 kg.) heirloom tomatoes of different varieties and colors</p>
			<p class="RI">16 basil leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Extra virgin olive oil</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The tomato water</h3>
			<p class="RP1">One day ahead, peel and mince the shallots. Remove the leaves from the cilantro and basil. Cut the tomatoes into quarters. Combine the tomatoes, shallots, herbs, and vinegars in a bowl and, using an immersion blender, blend to a coarse puree (or use a regular blender). Season with the salt and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
			<p class="RP">The next day, set a sieve lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter over a bowl. Pour in the tomato mixture and allow to stand until the clear tomato water drains into the bowl, at least 30 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The croutons</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">With a serrated knife, remove the crust from the bread, then cut the bread into ¾-inch cubes. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add about 1 teaspoon olive oil and the butter. When the butter begins to foam, toss in the thyme, garlic, and bread cubes and fry the cubes, turning often, until nicely golden, about 6 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Transfer the croutons to a baking sheet and toast in the oven until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">If using fresh almonds, crack the almonds open with a small knife (rather than a nutcracker, which would break the nuts) and peel off the yellow outer skin. Remove the currants from the stems.</p>
			<p class="RP">Cut the heirloom tomatoes into big irregular chunks. Put them in a salad bowl and gently toss with the currants, basil leaves, and croutons. Add some or all of the tomato water as desired (see the photo at top right), season with fleur de sel, and toss again. Divide among four shallow bowls or plates. Sprinkle with the almonds, drizzle with olive oil, and serve immediately.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_6627.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Saint-Joseph white (Marsanne, Roussane); Pierre Gonon</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This beautiful plate of pasta combines the earthiness of mushrooms, the acidity of lemon, and the delicate tang of thick crème fraîche. It’s easy but hugely rewarding to make your own pasta.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the pasta dough</h4>
			<p class="RI">1½ cups (200 grams) Italian “00” flour </p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (100 grams) pastry or cake flour</p>
			<p class="RI">Pinch of fine salt</p>
			<p class="RI">2 extra-large eggs</p>
			<p class="RI">3 extra-large egg yolks</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the Mushrooms</h4>
			<p class="RI">9 ounces (250 grams) small chanterelles</p>
			<p class="RI">½ bunch flat-leaf parsley</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ tablespoons (21 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt </p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cup (60 grams) crème fraîche</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">Generous ½ cup (80 grams) freshly grated Parmesan</p>
			<p class="RI2">Generous handful of baby arugula</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The pasta dough</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine the flours and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Lightly beat the eggs with a fork in a small bowl, then beat in the yolks. Pour the egg mixture into the flour “well” and gradually stir in the flour with a fork; when the dough becomes too stiff to stir, mix and knead in the remaining flour with your hands. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it until it comes together into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The tagliatelle</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Divide the dough into 3 pieces. With a rolling pin (or your palms), flatten each one to ½ inch thick. Roll one piece through the pasta machine on the widest setting. Fold the dough in half or into thirds and pass it through the same setting, then repeat several times, until it’s smooth and silky. Lower the setting and again pass the dough through the machine, sprinkling the dough with flour if it becomes sticky. Repeat until you have rolled the dough through the next-to-the-last setting. Lay the sheet of dough on a floured surface and repeat with the remaining dough.</p>
			<p class="RP">Cut the pasta into 8-inch-long sheets, then use the fettuccine cutter on the pasta machine to cut the sheets into ¼-inch-wide ribbons. Toss with a little flour and spread out on a floured baking sheet to dry at room temperature (refrigerate if not using the same day).</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The mushrooms</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Trim the chanterelles and scrape clean with a damp cloth and/or the tip of a small knife. (If they are very dirty, wash them very quickly in cold water, then immediately drain on a kitchen towel and pat dry.) If your chanterelles are large, halve or quarter them.</p>
			<p class="RP">Remove the parsley leaves from the stems.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Cooking the pasta</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the chanterelles and sauté until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and set aside in a warm spot.</p>
			<p class="RP">When the water is boiling, add the coarse salt, then add the tagliatelle and cook until al dente, about 2 minutes. Drain, reserving a little of the pasta water, and transfer the pasta to the pan with the mushrooms.</p>
			<p class="RP">Add the crème fraîche, parsley leaves, lemon zest, half of the lemon juice, and three-quarters of the Parmesan. Stir well, adding a little of the reserved pasta water if necessary, and season with salt.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Toss the arugula with a drizzle of olive oil, the rest of the lemon juice, and a pinch of fleur de sel.</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide the arugula among four shallow bowls and top with the pasta. Sprinkle with the rest of the Parmesan and serve immediately.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_4872.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Old Muscadet de Sèvre-et-Maine sur Lie (Melon de Bourgogne); Domaine de Fay d’Homme</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Smoking fish at home is actually quite easy if you have an inexpensive stovetop smoker, and the result is gently cooked fish with a very delicate smoky flavor—far more subtle than any you can buy. I love the way the yogurt and avocado lighten the fattiness of the fish, and the combination of its smokiness and the acidity you get from the pickled onions and marinated cucumbers.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">Equipment</h4>
			<p class="RI">A stovetop smoker</p>
			<p class="RI">Beechwood or other smoking chips</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the pickled onions</h4>
			<p class="RI">⅔ cup (150 ml.) white wine vinegar or rice vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant ¼ cup (50 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cup (50 grams) sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small beet</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small red onion or other sweet onion</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the avocado purEe</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 ripe avocado</p>
			<p class="RI">Generous ½ cup (125 grams) Greek yogurt</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Avocado oil or olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the marinated cucumbers</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 to 3 small cucumbers, such as gherkin or kirby</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">½ teaspoon granulated sugar</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the smoked trout</h4>
			<p class="RI">4 fresh trout fillets</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI2">White wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<p class="RI">Leaves from 2 or 3 dill sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Borage flowers (optional)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The pickled onions</h3>
			<p class="RP1">To make the pickling juice, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, kosher salt, and beet in a small nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, slice the onion very fine (1⁄10 inch thick or less) with a mandoline and put the slices in a small deep bowl. Pour the pickling juice, with the beet, over the onions (the beet will tint the onions pink), and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. (The onions will keep for at least 5 days in the refrigerator.)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The avocado puree</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Peel, pit, and dice the avocado. Transfer to a blender, add the yogurt, lemon juice, a drizzle of oil, and a pinch of salt, and puree. Transfer to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The marinated cucumbers</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut off both ends of the cucumbers. With the mandoline, slice them lengthwise into strips, about 1⁄10 inch thick; you need 12 slices for this dish (discard the first and last slices from each cucumber). Toss with the coarse salt and sugar, arrange on a large deep plate, and let marinate for 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Carefully rinse the cucumbers with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Reserve in the refrigerator.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The smoked trout</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Set up the smoker with the wood chips as directed by the manufacturer. </p>
			<p class="RP">Season the skin side of the trout fillets with fleur de sel and a drizzle of olive oil.</p>
			<p class="RP">When smoke starts coming out of the smoker, place the trout fillets skin side down on the rack, cover, and smoke for 3 to 5 minutes, until the trout is just cooked. Transfer the fillets to a plate and carefully remove the skin.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the cucumber strips in a bowl and gently toss with a dash of white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of piment d’Espelette, and most of the dill, reserving some for the garnish. Season to taste with fleur de sel if necessary.</p>
			<p class="RP">Spread some of the avocado puree across the center of each plate. Top with the trout fillets and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Roll up 12 of the cucumber strips and place 3 rolls seam side down on each fillet. Top each cucumber roll with a pickled onion slice. Garnish with borage flowers, if using, and the remaining dill.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_5172.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: White Rioja (Viura grape); Olivier Rivière</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Inspired by Mediterranean home cooking, this is a light, fresh dish with intense flavors (from the brine, tapenade, and herbs). It is essential to get organic free-range chicken and to cook it with its skin until crisp. The chicken breast shown in the photograph (opposite) is boned but with the wing bone left intact, a cut sometimes called a <em>suprême </em>; these are readily available in France but less so in North America, although you may find a butcher who can prepare them. If possible, have the butcher cut up a whole small chicken for you; if not, you may have to order skin-on boneless breasts and thighs.</p>
			<p class="RHN">Note that the brining time is 4 hours.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the brine</h4>
			<p class="RI">1¼ cups (295 grams) water</p>
			<p class="RI">⅓ cup (75 ml.) white wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant ¾ cup (125 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">6 tablespoons (100 grams) fine sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon mustard seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bunch thyme (reserve 1 sprig for the zucchini and 1 for cooking the chicken)</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the chicken</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 skin-on boneless free-range chicken breasts (see the headnote)</p>
			<p class="RI">2 skin-on boneless free-range chicken thighs</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon grapeseed oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig (from above)</p>
			<p class="RI">1 rosemary sprig</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the roasted zucchini</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 pounds (1 kg.) mixed zucchini, such as green, yellow, and round</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig (from above)</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the tapenade</h4>
			<p class="RI">Generous ½ cup (100 grams) unpitted black olives, such as Kalamata</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the brown butter vinaigrette</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Fine sea salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">Leaves from ⅓ bunch tarragon</p>
			<p class="RI">Leaves from ⅓ bunch dill</p>
			<p class="RI">Leaves from ⅓ bunch chervil</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The brine</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine the water, vinegar, sugar, salt, mustard seeds, garlic, and thyme (reserving 2 sprigs) in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Let cool, then refrigerate until cold.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Brining the chicken</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the chicken in a large deep bowl. Add the brine, making sure the chicken is submerged, and refrigerate for 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="RP">Drain the chicken, rinse under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The roasted zucchini</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">Cut the zucchini into slices about ½ inch thick. Put the zucchini on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and toss with a drizzle of olive oil. Season with fleur de sel and piment d’Espelette and spread out on the baking sheet. Add the sprig of thyme.</p>
			<p class="RP">Roast the zucchini for 15 to 20 minutes, until just tender. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The tapenade</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Halve and pit the olives (I prefer to buy unpitted olives and pit them myself, since they are much more flavorful). Transfer to a blender, add the lemon juice and a dash of olive oil, and blend until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The brown butter vinaigrette</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Heat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until it is brown and smells nutty (in French, this is <em>beurre noisette</em>, hazelnut butter). Strain through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into a small bowl. Whisk in the lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Set aside in a warm spot.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The chicken</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, 30 minutes before cooking, take the chicken out of the refrigerator and pat dry. (Do not season it—the salty brine took care of that.)</p>
			<p class="RP">Heat a very large skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then add the grapeseed oil and heat until hot. Add the chicken pieces, skin side down, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 12 minutes, or until the chicken is almost cooked through (lower the heat slightly if necessary). Add the butter, garlic, thyme, and rosemary to the pan. Once the butter is foaming, turn the chicken pieces over and cook, basting the skin with the butter, until cooked through, about 2 minutes for the thighs and 6 minutes for the breasts. As the chicken is done, transfer it to a plate.</p>
			<p class="RP">Let the chicken rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut each piece of chicken in half.</p>
			<p class="RP">With a rubber spatula, spread a spoonful of tapenade on each plate. Arrange some of the roasted zucchini and one piece of breast and one piece of thigh on each plate. Toss the herbs with the vinaigrette (if it has thickened, rewarm it briefly over low heat), then scatter the herb salad over the plates and serve.</p>

				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_6134.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">6 servings / Wine pairing: Sicilian Nero d’Avola; Arianna Occhipinti</p>
			<p class="RHN1">I love pairing anchovies with beef or lamb; they bring a great kick to the meat. It’s best to use salt-packed anchovies rather than oil-preserved ones, since they have much more flavor. Cooking the potatoes in the embers is an unusual but hassle-free technique that results in soft, moist flesh. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">Equipment</h4>
			<p class="RI">Parchment paper</p>
			<p class="RI">Mortar and pestle</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the potatoes</h4>
			<p class="RI">1¾ pounds (800 grams) small potatoes, such as fingerlings</p>
			<p class="RI">1 large red onion</p>
			<p class="RI">24 cherry or grape tomatoes</p>
			<p class="RI">1 rosemary sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the anchovy and rosemary vinaigrette</h4>
			<p class="RI">3 salt-packed anchovies</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small rosemary sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the beef</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 bone-in beef rib-eye steak, 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8 kg.)</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Crushed black pepper</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The potatoes</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut the potatoes into scant ¼-inch-thick slices. Peel and mince the red onion. Remove the rosemary leaves from the stem.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the potatoes, onion, cherry tomatoes, and rosemary in a large bowl. Add the lemon zest, a generous pinch of fleur de sel, and pepper to taste and toss with a drizzle of olive oil.</p>
			<p class="RP">Lay a 12-by-24-inch sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Fold it crosswise in half, then open it out. Arrange half the vegetables on one side, leaving a border on the 3 open sides, then fold the paper over and seal the 3 open sides securely, folding and crimping them over themselves several times. Wrap the bag in three 12-by-24-inch sheets of foil (or 2 sheets, if you will be cooking the potatoes in the oven). Repeat to make a second package of vegetables.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The anchovy and rosemary vinaigrette</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Rinse the anchovies under cold water to remove the salt. Remove the 2 fillets from each anchovy, pat them dry, and coarsely chop them.</p>
			<p class="RP">Remove the rosemary leaves from the stem and finely chop, then crush with a pinch of fleur de sel in a mortar to a coarse paste. Add the anchovies and lemon juice, mashing the anchovies with the pestle, then stir in a drizzle of olive oil to emulsify. Transfer to a small serving bowl.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The beef</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Fire up an outdoor girl. (If using a gas grill, preheat the oven to 350°F.)</p>
			<p class="RP">Generously season the beef on both sides with fleur de sel and crushed pepper. Grill the beef over a medium-hot fire for 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat.</p>
			<p class="RP">Carefully lift up the grill and place the potatoes-in-a-bag in the coals. (Or put the bags on a baking sheet, slide into the oven, and cook for 20 to 25 minutes; check with the tip of a knife as described below.) Turn the beef over and grill it on the other side for another 8 to 12 minutes: when the first beads of blood appear on the surface, the meat will be cooked to medium-rare. Transfer the meat to a rack or plate and let rest for about 15 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, after they have cooked for 20 minutes, take one packet of potatoes out of the embers and check the doneness with the tip of a knife (inserted through the foil and paper). When they are ready, transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Carve the meat and season each slice with a little bit of fleur de sel and crushed pepper. Serve with the potatoes and vinaigrette on the side.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Languedoc white (Viognier); Pierre Vaïsse</p>
			<p class="RHN1">A straightforward dish that can be served as an appetizer or a combination dessert/cheese course. Tearing the peaches apart, rather than cutting them, gives them an appealingly rustic look and also allows the flavors to penetrate the flesh better. I love the layer of smokiness from the smoked mozzarella, but you can use fresh mozzarella or creamy burrata.</p>
			<p class="RI">2 basil sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">2 purple basil sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">4 ripe, juicy peaches</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">About 2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 ball smoked mozzarella (about 1 pound/450 grams)</p>
			<p class="RI">Crushed black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">About 1 tablespoon aged balsamic vinegar</p>
			<p class="RP">Remove the leaves from the basil stems. Halve the peaches and remove the pits. Tear the peaches into big irregular pieces and put them in a bowl. Toss with the basil leaves, a pinch or two of fleur de sel, and a drizzle of olive oil. </p>
			<p class="RP">Cut the mozzarella into 4 wedges and place in four shallow bowls. Season with fleur de sel and crushed pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Garnish with the peaches and basil leaves and finish with a dash of balsamic.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_5068.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">8 servings / Wine pairing: Red Pineau des Charentes; Domaine Château de Beaulon, or a good sherry</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Wild strawberries, <em>fraises des bois</em>, are a rare delicacy that form a magical alliance with the intensity of bittersweet chocolate. If you cannot find them, choose the smallest, most fragrant strawberries at your farmers’ market.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">Equipment</h4>
			<p class="RI">A 10-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom</p>
			<p class="RI">Dried beans or pie weights</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the sweet tart dough</h4>
			<p class="RI">8 tablespoons (1 stick/113 grams) cold unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1¼ cups plus 5 tablespoons (175 grams) all-purpose flour </p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (66 grams) pastry or cake flour</p>
			<p class="RI">2½ tablespoons (25 grams) almond flour (finely ground almonds)</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (72 grams) confectioners’ sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ teaspoons fine sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 large egg, at room temperature</p>
			<p class="RI2">1 egg, beaten, for egg wash</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the chocolate filling</h4>
			<p class="RI">6 ounces (170 grams) 70% bittersweet chocolate</p>
			<p class="RI">1 cup (237 ml.) heavy cream</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (118 ml.) whole milk</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small egg</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">8 ounces (225 grams) wild strawberries (see the headnote)</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The dough</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut the butter into small pieces. Whisk the flours, almond flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. With your fingertips, work in the butter until the texture is sandy. Quickly beat the egg with a fork in a small bowl, then add to the butter mixture and mix with your hands until the dough just comes together. Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 2 hours.</p>
			<p class="RP">Put the dough on a large sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper, cover it with another sheet, and roll it into a 12-inch circle. Lift off the top sheet of plastic wrap and carefully invert the dough into the tart pan. Lift off the second sheet and gently press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan, then cut off the excess by running the rolling pin over the edge. (The dough is fragile, but any tears can be patched easily.) Chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The tart shell</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">Cut out a parchment paper circle (see the photos that follow) and line the tart shell with the parchment. Fill with dried beans or pie weights and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the beans and paper and bake for 5 more minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Brush the tart shell all over with the egg wash. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes longer, until golden brown. Let cool to room temperature. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F.</p>

			<h3 class="RPH">The chocolate filling</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Finely chop the chocolate and put it in a bowl. Combine the cream, milk, and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour the boiling liquid over the chopped chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds, then mix with a rubber spatula until the mixture is smooth. Let cool to lukewarm, then mix in the egg.</p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the filling into the baked tart shell and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. The tart is done when the filling is just set. If you shake the pan gently, the chocolate mass should move in one block. Let the tart cool to room temperature on a rack. Do not put it in the refrigerator! This tart should be served at room temperature on the day it is made.</p>

			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Unmold the tart. Arrange the strawberries on top of the tart (if using bigger strawberries, cut them into halves or quarters). Sprinkle with fleur de sel and add a dash of olive oil.</p>
