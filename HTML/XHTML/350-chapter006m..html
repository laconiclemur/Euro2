<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">My mother was not a great cook, but she could make delicious potato pancakes—and with a box grater no less. This was one of my favorite meals as a child, especially when topped with homemade Roasted Applesauce (<a href="chapter007f.xhtml#page-244">here</a>). Other serving ideas are Brandade de Morue (<a href="chapter006y.xhtml#page-217">here</a>) or crème fraîche and slices of smoked salmon. They’re also really nice alongside Roasted Heirloom Apples Filled with Pork Sausage (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-201">here</a>).</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 1½ DOZEN POTATO PANCAKES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">2 russet potatoes, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ yellow onion, peeled and very finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 egg yolks, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt, plus extra for sprinkling on the cooked potato pancakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup cornstarch</p>
<p class="ingredient">Oil, for frying (corn, peanut, canola, or grapeseed oil all work well)</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Coarsely grate the</strong> potatoes into a colander. Squeeze the potatoes so that they release most of their starchy liquid, but no need to go overboard here—a little liquid is okay. Transfer the potatoes to a large mixing bowl and stir in the onion, egg yolks, salt, pepper, and cornstarch and combine thoroughly.</p>
<p>Heat ¼ inch of oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, place heaping tablespoonfuls of the potato mixture into the oil, leaving plenty of space between the pancakes. Using the back of your spoon, gently flatten each heap of potato so that the pancakes are 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Cook until the undersides are browned, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn each pancake and cook until brown on the opposite side, another few minutes. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a paper towel–lined plate and season with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Continue cooking the pancakes, in batches, until you’ve used up all of the potato mixture, adding more oil to the skillet as needed.</p>
<p>Serve hot. These can be kept warm in a low oven, or reheated in a hot oven, so feel free to make them in advance.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-185"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Aligot</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Combining roughly equal parts potatoes and cheese, this smooth, elastic mixture is like potato fondue. <em>Aligot</em> is traditionally made with Cantal cheese, but any soft, young, cow’s-milk cheese will work. At Buvette, since our tables are so small and we don’t have space for big plates, we serve our aligot on garlic-rubbed toast and drape it with thin slices of prosciutto. Aligot also goes well with country ham, grilled sausages, or a Roast Chicken (<a href="chapter006o.xhtml#page-202">here</a>). Note that any leftover aligot—unlikely—can be heated up in a pan with an extra splash of cream.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4 HEARTILY]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1¼ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 cups grated Cantal or Jack cheese</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the potatoes</strong> in a large pot of salted, cool water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until they’re tender, about 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set them aside to cool slightly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pour the cream into a small saucepan and, using a Microplane grater, grate the garlic into the cream. Heat the cream over medium heat until it’s quite hot, but not boiling. Keep the cream warm while you continue with the potatoes.</p>
<p>While the potatoes are still warm, peel them (see Recipe Notes <a href="chapter006m-6.xhtml#page-197">here</a>) and pass them through a food mill or a <em>tamis</em> (see Recipe Notes <a href="chapter006m-6.xhtml#page-197">here</a>) into a clean pot or large skillet. Pour the hot cream into the potatoes and stir to combine. Season the potatoes to taste with salt and pepper, then set the pot over low heat. While stirring constantly and quite aggressively, add the cheese to the potatoes a handful at a time. The mixture will get thick and almost glutinous. Between the stirring and the gentle heat, the cheese will begin to really melt into the potatoes and the two will become a single, uniform, remarkably elastic mixture. It will take 3 to 5 minutes, once all the cheese has been added, to achieve this texture.</p>
<p>Serve immediately.</p></div>

<p class="noindenth1"><em>When I opened up Buvette I put a sign in the window that said</em> “Aligot,” <em>hoping to attract customers who knew the dish and loved it as much as I do. A woman came in and said that aligot comes from her hometown, and she walked back into the kitchen and gave me a lesson on how to make it her way. If you love cooking classic dishes, as I do, but didn’t grow up in the places your most beloved dishes come from, fear not. Just get yourself as close to the source as possible… and listen and watch.</em></p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Pommes vigneron</em> translates to “winemaker’s potatoes” and while it’s a decadent side dish, it can also stand on its own as the main attraction. Traditionally it’s been considered an all-in-one meal: a combination of hearty potatoes with some meat that can be cut into large wedges and tucked into a lunch pail, ready for a day of picking grapes. To round out to a complete meal, serve this with a salad of shredded cabbage dressed with mustard, vinegar, and oil.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large shallot, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 pound Yukon gold potatoes (about 4 medium potatoes), peeled</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 slices bacon</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup coarsely grated Comté cheese (about 4 ounces), or substitute a mild Gruyère or Jarlsberg cheese</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, stir together the melted butter, shallot, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Set the mixture aside.</p>
<p>Using a mandoline or a sharp knife, thinly slice the potatoes into disks that are about <span class="font1">⅛</span> inch thick (which is to say thin, but not paper thin). Add the potatoes to the bowl with the butter mixture and stir to combine, making sure the aromatic mixture is evenly dispersed among the potato slices.</p>
<p>Lay the strips of bacon across a small, 6- to 8-inch diameter skillet or similar size baking dish so that they overlap in the center and spiral outward. The majority of the bacon will cover the bottom of the skillet and the ends should hang over the edge.</p>
<p>Place a quarter of the potato mixture over the bacon and sprinkle with one-third of the cheese. Repeat this layering until you’ve used up all of the potatoes and the cheese. Cover the exposed potatoes with the exposed ends of the bacon strips. Cut a piece of parchment paper into a circle just slightly larger than the skillet, press the paper on top of the bacon, and transfer the skillet to the oven.</p>
<p>Bake until the potatoes are cooked through, the exposed bacon is nice and crisp, and the entire surface is browned, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>Cut into wedges and serve hot or at room temperature.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-187"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Risotto with Meyer Lemon</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">The action of making risotto is what I think of as “real cooking” since it requires your attention the whole time you’re making it. More than any other dish I can think of, when risotto hits the table, it’s an expression of the cook’s skill. Luckily, making risotto, while it does entail patience, isn’t all that difficult. This simple lemon variation is especially elegant.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup high-quality risotto rice</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 to 4 cups boiling water</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 lemons (preferably Meyer lemons)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 sprig fresh basil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup coarsely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Warm 1 tablespoon</strong> of the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until the shallot just begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring a bit, until it turns opaque and starts to make a faint popping sound, just a minute or two. Add the white wine and a pinch of salt and cook until the wine has nearly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add a cup of the boiling water and cook, stirring continuously, until the water has nearly evaporated. You will know when to add more water when the surface of the rice is coated with small bubbles—it’s not unlike knowing when to flip a pancake. Repeat the process with a second cup of the boiling water and the zest and juice of one of the lemons. Once that second cup of water has nearly cooked off, add a third cup of water and the basil sprig and cook until the liquid is nearly evaporated.</p>
<p>Test the rice by tasting it—it should be just cooked through, but still have a bit of a bite. If it’s too uncooked, add ¼ cup of water. Depending on the cooking temperature and the type and age of the rice, it may or may not need it. Trust your instincts.</p>
<p>When the rice is just cooked through, about 20 minutes of cooking altogether, turn off the heat, remove and discard the basil, and vigorously mix in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil along with the cheese and the zest and juice from the second lemon. This final vigorous mix will help encourage all of the rice’s starch to get to its fullest, most creamy and decadent potential. The cheese doesn’t hurt! Season the risotto to taste with more salt, if needed.</p>
<p>Serve immediately with a little extra Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>

<h1 class="simplesect-titlehs">On Meyer Lemons</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">As a kid in California, my friends and I would reach through the schoolyard fence to steal Meyer lemons, which we used as lemon bombs. I can’t believe we used to have lemon wars! I have now learned to appreciate these special lemons as an incredible ingredient with the most floral, fragrant flavor. If you can find them at your greengrocer, it’s worth trying them.</span></p>

<p class="noindenth1"><em>Take it from someone who has spent hours upon hours cleaning artichokes: don’t let juiced lemons go to waste. Lemons are a remarkable cleaning device. The juice and oils are very good for your cuticles and take the strong smells of food away. Use them to refresh your hands by rubbing them across your nails and palms, especially after cleaning artichokes, garlic, or fish. They work so well that you won’t want to wait to have juiced lemons around.</em></p>
