			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page170a">Béchamel Gratins</h2>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">“<span class="lead-in">Au Gratin</span>” has long since been adopted into English. It seems, at times, to be a precarious transplant, ill at ease in its surroundings, if not a hopeless case of lost identity. Some believe it to denote specifically a cheesy surface; others may be content with the international flair that it bestows on any appellation. Nor does it carry the same associations as in the past in its home tongue: At one time, for instance, a <em class="ital">poulet au gratin</em> was a roast chicken presented on a dish, the bottom of which had been spread with a forcemeat and baked; today, pieces of chicken masked with a sauce, usually sprinkled with cheese, and colored in a hot oven or beneath a flame are called <em class="ital">poulet au gratin.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">A gratin is the crusty material that forms on the bottom and the sides of a dish in which a preparation has been baked and must be scraped or scratched loose. Primitively, gratin means “scrapings,” and, by extension, it refers to the crust that forms on the surface of either a baked dish or, in the instance of a “rapid gratin,” a hot, ready-cooked preparation that is passed summarily beneath intense heat. Crumbs or grated cheese may lend their properties to the formation of the crust but neither belongs inevitably to the definition.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page171">In the minds of many, a gratin is only one thing—a precooked material (which may be a collection of leftovers of all kinds, but which is most often a parboiled vegetable) over which is spread a <em class="ital">béchamel;</em> cheese or buttered breadcrumbs or a mixture of both is then sprinkled over the surface and 20 minutes or so later it leaves the hot oven bubbling and golden. All these preparations are not only of an exemplary goodness, but also very much of a kind, I think, that belong to sentimental childhood memories, and I wonder that those who share the fashionable distaste for flour-bound sauces suffer no pangs of regret for having banned the friendly <em class="ital">béchamel</em> from their tables.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Béchamel</em> vegetable gratins are very usual American home preparations; the French consider them to be typically Lyonnaise. For the purposes of this book, a <em class="ital">béchamel</em> is a “white” or “cream sauce.” If a certain amount of cheese is incorporated into it at the last minute, it may be rebaptized <em class="ital">mornay.</em> It is rare that it gains from meat flavoring but, in some instances, an herb or two or an onion cooked in it can do no harm.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Béchamel</em> must not be undercooked or it will have an unpleasant “floury” taste (the scientific explanation for this I cannot give. If only brought to a boil, as for the thick souffle or croquette bases, or in the final addition of a <em class="ital">beurre manié,</em> this quality is not in evidence; it begins to invade the sauce only after a couple of minutes’ cooking and begins to disappear only after half an hour or so). In general, a minimum of an hour’s slow cooking is best, but for masking a gratin which is subjected to supplementary cooking in the oven, 30 or 40 minutes will do. No more than the amount of butter necessary to absorb the flour should be used in the preparation of the roux (unlike the fat in other sauces, which may be skimmed, it is here held in suspension by the milk, never rising to the surface—butter added for flavor or smoothness should always be whisked or stirred in after removal from heat, and for a gratin, no additional butter is added) and the sauce should be only lightly bound with flour, its body depending, eventually, as much on reduction as on the initial binding.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page172" style="page-break-before:always;">Bechamel</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Béchamel</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">3 tablespoons butter	</li>
				<li class="IL">4 tablespoons flour</li>
				<li class="IL">1 quart milk</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan, stir in the flour with a wooden spoon, and cook for less than a minute over a tiny flame before beginning to add the milk, very slowly at first, stirring rapidly the while to prevent lumping (should lumps form, it is no disaster: Finish adding the milk, bring it to a boil, strain it, whisk, and put it back to cook). After further additions of milk, turn the flame up a bit. Stir constantly, adding more milk only as the previous addition begins to thicken (remove the saucepan from the heat for a moment if thickening too rapidly). The last half may be poured in steadily while stirring. Bring to a boil and adjust the heat, using an asbestos pad, if necessary, to keep the sauce at the slightest suggestion of a boil. Undersalt—seasoning may always be rectified. Stir from time to time, thoroughly scraping sides and bottom, the sauce tending to settle and thicken there. After long cooking, this repeated scraping will make the sauce rather uneven, but that is unimportant for a gratin, and if you are using the sauce as a base for others, simply whisk it or strain and whisk it again. Nutmeg is sometimes added (it should be used so sparingly as to be nearly undetectable) and cream—as much as one likes—may be used to thin and to enrich the sauce.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Precooking, for most vegetables, means parboiling until barely done—(varying from a couple of minutes to a ½ hour or so and settling usually around the 10-minute mark)—Artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, chard ribs, Belgian endives, fennel, leeks, onions, small new potatoes, spinach, sprouts, turnips . . . And most gain from being dried out in butter, gently tossed over low heat for a few minutes before being sauced.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page173">Zucchini, tender young artichoke hearts, and mushrooms are better cooked raw in butter. Sliced eggplant will have more character if fried in olive oil and drained (in Provence, the butter would be replaced by olive oil in the preparation of the <em class="ital">béchamel</em>).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Celery hearts, fennel, or endives, after being parboiled, are sometimes braised until melting-tender in a rich stock; in that case, the <em class="ital">béchamel</em> (or <em class="ital">mornay</em>) is best transformed into something richer—stirring in, for example, a healthy quantity of mushroom purée (puréed raw and sautéed in butter until the liquid is evaporated), forming with the mixture a bed in the bottom of the gratin dish on which are placed the braised vegetables sprinkled first with their reduced braising juices and, finally, with Parmesan before they go in the oven.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Combinations of vegetables are attractive: Peas and green beans may be scattered through the thing; beds of juliènned, butter-cooked carrots, mushrooms, turnips, or zucchini (the last two first disgorged with salt) may receive other vegetables in other forms; parboiled but for a minute or two, well drained but not squeezed, spinach and sliced, sautéed mushrooms form an exquisite combination—and, if the mushrooms are replaced by sliced raw truffles (the sauce sprinkled with butter-cooked breadcrumbs—no cheese), words fail; leftover rice or pasta, cooked chicken, brains, sweetbreads or tripes may, of course, be added . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">If the dish is to be sprinkled with breadcrumbs, alone or in combination with cheese, they are better first gently cooked in butter until lightly colored—and, although dried crumbs are most often used and are perfectly good, stale but still soft crumbled bread (crusts removed) gives a more interesting result.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Beignets de Légumes</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">The <a href="l_261-278.xhtml#page278">fritter batter recipe</a> is given in the next chapter.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Turned artichoke hearts</em> (quartered, chokes removed, rubbed with lemon, raw if young and tender, parboiled if their first youth is past), <em class="ital">asparagus tips</em> (parboiled but firm), <em class="ital">cauliflower flowerets</em> (parboiled, firm), <em class="ital">2-inch lengths of the white parts of leeks</em> (simmered for 10 minutes), <em class="ital">mushrooms</em> (cultivated—raw), <em class="ital">small spring or summer white onions</em> (raw), <em class="ital">green beans</em> (parboiled, firm), <em class="ital">young sorrel leaves</em> (raw), <em class="ital">small zucchini sliced lengthwise in </em>¼<em class="ital">-inch thicknesses</em> (raw) are my fritter preferences. All, with the exception of sorrel leaves, should be first marinated with a bit of lemon juice and olive oil, salt, pepper, and a selection of finely chopped fresh herbs—parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon, lemon thyme, hyssop, marjoram. The best oil for frying is a good olive oil but, in the interest of economy, a tasteless vegetable oil may be preferred. Rather than dipping, one by one, each fragment in the batter, it is easier to dump them all in (with the continuing exception of the fragile sorrel leaves), turning them around gently to be certain that each is well coated, and to remove them one by one, either with a teaspoon or one’s fingertips, depending on the form of the object, dropping each immediately into the hot oil (test it for heat by letting drop a touch of batter—when it sizzles at contact, the oil is ready; the heat may have to be turned up or down several times before all are finished). Don’t try to fry too many at a time and keep those that have been removed from the oil, after draining rapidly in a towel or in paper towels, well covered in the folded napkin (placed on a hot platter) from which they will be served. A handful of tiny bouquets of parsley leaves plunged for a few seconds into the fat as the last fritters are removed provides, scattered over the surface, a most attractive and flavorful garnish. Serve lemon wedges at the same time; some like to serve a tomato sauce apart.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">If the raisins seem bizarre to you, leave them out; if you have no taste for coriander, leave it out; the dish will lose its Oriental distinction but will not, otherwise, be the worse for the omissions. If the presence of crunchy, hot peppercorns is distressing, leave them out . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">At the height of summer, replace the preserved tomatoes by fresh, firm, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely cut up or chopped; replace the fennel by quartered celery hearts and the parsley by fresh basil leaves and flowers.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Slices of sweet pepper may be added, as may any of those vegetables normally prepared <em class="ital">à la Grecque</em>—small zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 2-inch lengths; cauliflower flowerets; asparagus tips; chard ribs . . .</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 large sweet onion (4 to 5 ounces), chopped</li>
				<li class="IL">1 cup olive oil (in all)</li>

				<li class="IL">1 ounce dried currants (or other seedless raisins), soaked 1 hour in tepid water, drained</li>

				<li class="IL">About 20 peppercorns</li>
				<li class="IL">Chopped parsley</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Cook the chopped onion with ¼ cup olive oil in a large, heavy copper saucepan or earthenware <em class="ital">poëlon</em> for from 20 to 30 minutes without permitting to color, add the tomatoes and the garlic, stew gently for about 10 minutes, stirring, until nearly all liquid has evaporated, salt lightly, add the cayenne, the sugar, the herbs, and the artichoke quarters with their olive oil. Stir well together, add the raisins or currants and, a handful at a time, the remaining vegetables, stirring so that all are evenly coated with the tomato mixture. Add the wine, the coriander, and the lemon juice, bring to a full boil over a high flame, reduce the heat, and simmer, covered, for about 40 minutes (the acidity of the cooking liquids prevents the vegetables from softening—they will remain firm and even slightly crunchy despite the length of cooking time).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Remove the vegetables with a large wire skimming spoon to a non-metallic serving utensil, add the peppercorns to the cooking juices, and reduce at a high heat for 5 or 10 minutes, stirring all the while. About 1½ cups—or slightly more—should remain, just enough to barely cover the gently packed vegetables. Taste for salt (the vegetables will be somewhat undersalted if correctly done and the sauce should be relatively salty—without exaggeration). Leave, uncovered, to cool and then refrigerate, covered. Serve either chilled or at room temperature, generously sprinkled with parsley.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page177" style="page-break-before:always;">Mixed Vegetable Stew</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Ragoût de Légumes</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">One thinks of a stew most often as a variety of foodstuffs cooked together in sauce; the Lyonnais <em class="ital">barboton,</em> whose preparation, but for the absence of meat, is that of a simple meat stew (potatoes lent relief by onion, garlic, often a bit of tomato, and a bouquet garni, gently cooked in a lightly roux-thickened bouillon), or the genial <em class="ital">ratatouille,</em> whose vegetables, intact but purée-tender, are cloaked in a syrupy reduction of their own abundant juices, correspond nicely to that concept.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The subtle structure of harmonies drawn from a combination of tender young vegetables cooked (or, to be more accurate, sweated) together with butter (or olive oil or a combination) in a heavy, tightly covered vessel, each added, raw or precooked, at a specific moment corresponding to its own needs, the complexity of savory autonomies butter-bound in an amalgam of their own fragrances, accented by the caress of an herb or two—a melting, shimmering balance of separateness and unity in fragile suspension—is quite another thing and many have claimed that it deserves to be dignified by another name: <em class="ital">estouffade de primeurs, potée printanière, jardinière à l’étouffé,</em> and I know not what have been suggested as possibilities. None, in any case, can touch the succulent beauty of the thing and <em class="ital">ragoût</em> it must remain.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The composition of these stews depends on the season and on whim and, insofar as they are never twice identical, one must, each time, more or less “feel” one’s way through the preparation, adjusting the heat, shortening or lengthening the cooking time, and, if the chosen vegetables fail to furnish enough liquid of their own, adding a couple of spoonfuls of water or white wine at one or several points. The cooking time may vary from about 45 minutes in all to 1¼ hours or so. Small whole onions (or, lacking that, 1 or 2 large sweet onions, finely sliced or coarsely chopped) should always be present (I always add unpeeled garlic cloves—some readers may prefer to overlook that ingredient). Tender young peas or broad beans—each bean peeled—are particularly attractive additions, and if savory is added, the combination will assume a special meaning (if only dried savory is available, add it to the bouquet—tender spring or early summer leaves may be finely chopped and mixed with the parsley garnish). Under different circumstances, <em class="ital">fines herbes,</em> fresh marjoram, or fresh basil are valuable additions. A garnish of artichoke bottoms, butter-cooked apart and filled with a fine, buttered purée of peas or broad beans, can lend variety to the textures and style to the presentation.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page178">Young artichoke hearts, onions, unpeeled garlic cloves, lettuce or sorrel <em class="ital">chiffonade,</em> tender, crisp turnips, carrots, and cauliflower flowerets (if delicate enough to eat raw) count among the vegetables that should be added at the beginning. Mature artichokes or split hearts of bulb fennel should be first parboiled for about 10 minutes and added at this time also. Some 20 minutes before removing from the heat, add the raw peas or broad beans (but, if so tender as to be edible in their raw state, 10 minutes will do—in either case, a bit of water should be added at the same time and the heat intensified somewhat, for they cook by steaming), the parboiled flowerets of cauliflower that is too strongly flavored to be eaten raw, or the parboiled lengths of leek whites. Then, 5 to 10 minutes before, add the rapidly sautéed mushrooms; parboiled, but firm, asparagus tips; snow peas (their edges carefully trimmed to eliminate strings) parboiled for hardly a minute; small, firm zucchini, sliced coin-thin and sautéed for 5 or 6 minutes over a high flame. Small, fresh green beans should be cooked in a large quantity of rapidly boiling water for from 8 to 12 minutes—until barely tender—and tossed in with the other vegetables only at the moment the butter is swirled in just before serving.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page179">The <em class="ital">ragoût</em> is perfect as a first course, an intermediate course, or a garnish. I usually serve it after a first course, first to be savored alone and uncomplicated by the presence of meat flavors; then it acts as either a unique or a supplementary garnish to a roast. A choice of from 5 to 7 vegetables is best—with too many, one tends to lose one’s bearings. To attempt to serve such a stew otherwise than directly from its cooking vessel would only entail a loss of valuable heat without improving the presentation.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A large copper low-sided saucepan or an earthenware <em class="ital">poëlon,</em> these materials absorbing heat slowly, regularly, and holding it for long, are the ideal receptacles. If working with a direct flame, an asbestos pad should be used to disperse the heat. One may begin at high heat—no longer than the time necessary to heat the vessel—before turning it low.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The ingredients below would serve from 4 to 6 people.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST" id="page180">				
				<li class="IL">½ cup butter (in all)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 pound walnut-size white spring onions (or small garnish onions), peeled</li>
				<li class="IL">1 head garlic, cloves cleansed of superficial loose husk, but unpeeled</li>
				<li class="IL">6 medium-size <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page181">tender artichokes, pared</a>, quartered, chokes removed</li>
				<li class="IL">Bouquet garni (celery branch, parsley, bay leaf, thyme, other herbs to taste)</li>

				<li class="IL">1 pound small firm zucchini, sliced thinly</li>
				<li class="IL">Pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">Chopped parsley (finely chopped fresh marjoram added if available)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Melt about 3 tablespoons butter, add the onions, the garlic cloves, and the artichoke quarters (they should be pared at the last moment and added as they are ready, turned around in the butter, coating all surfaces to protect them from contact with air, which rapidly blackens them—if you are not accustomed to working rapidly, best do them just ahead of time, adding the quarters immediately to olive oil and, subsequently, cutting down on the amount of butter used in the cooking), embed the bouquet at the heart of things, scatter over the lettuce <em class="ital">chiffonade,</em> sprinkle with salt, cover tightly, and leave to sweat, cooking ever so gently, tossing from time to time (or stirring with a wooden spoon), for about ½ hour. Check the onions and the artichokes for their degree of doneness and note the moisture—there should be just the suggestion of a slightly syrupy juice. If the heat has not been too high, the lettuce, normally, provides enough liquid without a further addition, but if the vegetables are cooking in fat only and in danger of coloring, add a couple of tablespoonsful of liquid, shaking the contents of the pan gently. Depending on the degree of doneness, the zucchini may be put to cook now or somewhat later: Sauté them, tossing very often, over a high flame, in a fairly large omelet-type pan with a couple of tablespoons of butter for 5 or 6 minutes—or until all are just tender and a number lightly colored. Add to the other vegetables when they are melting tender and leave, covered, for the flavors to intermingle for another 5 or 10 minutes. Taste for salt, pepper generously, and, away from the heat, add the remaining butter, cut into small pieces or dabs, swirling or gently stirring the contents until it is absorbed into the juices, forming a slight sauce. Sprinkle with the parsley and optional marjoram, return the lid, and serve. It is best to count an approximate hour for the cooking.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Unless they are boiled whole to be served hot, tepid, or cold with a melted butter or a vinaigrette sauce, artichokes must be pared or “turned,” and every precaution should be taken to prevent their blackening: Contact with air discolors them and one should work as rapidly as habit permits, immediately rubbing them with lemon, thrusting them into acidulated water, or, preferably, coating them with olive oil, which, unlike lemon, will not alter their flavor. In addition, contact with carbon knives or with iron, steel, or aluminum cooking vessels not only blackens them but also lends them a harsh and disagreeable taste—they are best pared with sharp stainless steel knives and, if cooked in liquid, prepared in stainless steel or enameled ironware; for baking, use earthenware, enameled ironware, porcelain, or Pyrex and for sautéing use tinned copper or earthenware.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In professional kitchens absolute whiteness is considered essential to an elegant presentation of artichokes and, to that end, they are always rubbed with lemon and cooked—or precooked—in a <em class="ital">blanc</em> (acidulated water containing a bit of flour and a dribble of oil), producing one of the characteristic and recurrent flavors of international hotel cooking; the native qualities of the artichoke are hopelessly perverted. Even rubbed with lemon, an artichoke bottom cooked simply in salted water, a branch of thyme added if one likes, will be slightly grayish but far finer of flavor.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is said that the stem of an artichoke should always be broken off rather than cut in order to pull out the tough strings from those bottoms no longer in their first youth. Young or old, that is the easiest procedure, but one must not imagine that a tough old artichoke, even deprived of its strings, can ever be of any great interest.</p>

				<p class="caption">Artichoke pared to heart (in two different ways, depending on tenderness of leaves) and halved and quartered (one quarter freed of its choke)</p>
			</div>
		</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">Whether preparing hearts of artichokes, whose leaves are tender and whose chokes are barely formed or completely unformed, or bottoms of larger, mature artichokes, the procedure is the same: Break off the stem, tear off the tough outer leaves, pulling each first backwards, then downwards, in order to break the leaf on its inside surface at the point of its becoming fleshy. Pull the tough part of the leaf loose from its fleshy base (which must remain attached to the artichoke bottom). This can be done very rapidly if the artichoke is fresh and the flesh crisp, but be careful never to break the leaf off at the extremity of the base, for each base of flesh forms a resistant, buttress-like support against the inner rows of leaves—once off to a bad start, all the leaves will tend to break off too far down. For tender hearts, cut off the top third of the remaining leaves; for bottoms, cut off a good two thirds. Pare the artichoke, starting at the point from which the stem has been broken, peeling spirally and removing dark green, tough parts all the way around. A finished bottom will take the form of a flattened sphere and, unless unusually tender, in which case its choke should be removed with the help of a vegetable ball-cutter <em class="ital">(cuillère à racine)</em> and it may be cooked directly in butter, it should be parboiled, the choke removed only after cooking. A finished heart will remain loyal to its primitive form in reduced proportions and need never be parboiled.</p>

Pour ½ cup of olive oil into a bowl, pare the artichokes to hearts, split each in two, remove choke, if necessary, and slice each half, in the sense of the leaves’ length, into ¼-inch thicknesses, plunging the slices immediately into the olive oil and turning them around in it to coat them thoroughly. When all are finished, turn the mass well together with your hands and turn it out onto the layer of bread mixture, spreading it evenly over the surface and pressing it firmly into place. Spread the remaining bread mixture on top, pressing with the palm of your hand to create an even, smooth surface, sprinkle with cheese, dribble the remaining olive oil in a fine crisscross pattern over the surface, and bake in a hot oven (about 425°), turning it down to about 375° after 10 minutes or so. Count 1 hour to about 1 hour and 10 minutes; the surface, sides, and bottom should form a richly golden-brown, crisp encasement, easily detached from the dish and, within, the layer of artichoke slices should be of a white tenderness in their voluptuous and alliaceous sheath. Serve the lemon wedges apart.</p>

Slice off the top half of the remaining leaves, slice off the broken stem end, leaving the base flat, and force the leaves outward, one at a time, working circularly toward the center until the artichoke resembles an opened-out old-fashioned rose. Put the prepared artichokes into a large mixing bowl and pour over the olive oil, turning them around so that all surfaces are covered.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Soak the bread slices for a few seconds in hot water—only until they have swelled and the crusts are completely soggy; squeeze them out in your hands and mix them with the parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper, mashing and stirring with a fork, adding a tablespoonful or so of olive oil while working to render the mixture less resistant. Hold each artichoke upside down for a moment to drain it of excess oil, sprinkle the interior with salt, and place a heaping tablespoonful of stuffing on top, forcing it into the crevices and smoothing the surface with the palm of your hand. Arrange them in a gratin dish just large enough to hold them without having to force them into place (enough space should be left to permit basting). Pour the oil that was drained from them over the stuffed surfaces—about 1 tablespoon per artichoke—and bake in a medium oven (375°) for about 1¼ hours, basting four or five times after the first 20 minutes. When done, the surface should present a firm, crisp, golden gratin, the outer leaves will be crisply browned, and a knife point run through the center should find no resistance in the bottoms. If the artichokes are advanced enough for chokes to have developed, each guest must remove his own.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Stringless green beans picked immaturely with the flower still clinging should be cooked some 8—or, at the most, 10—minutes, uncovered, in a vast quantity of generously salted rapidly boiling water. As a garnish, they are drained, tossed rapidly over a high flame to rid them of clinging liquid and bound, away from the flame, by tossing them in butter, first cut into small fragments. As a salad, they are best served only well drained, hot, accompanied by olive oil and lemon wedges. One of the finest accompaniments to a roast leg of lamb, <em class="ital">haricots panachés,</em> consists of tossing, away from the flame, equal parts of drained green beans and white beans, together with salt to taste, a liberal amount of freshly ground pepper, freshly picked, chopped Italian parsley, and lots of butter. Restaurants often parboil green beans, rinse them in cold water to prevent their turning gray from slow cooling, and reheat them at the last minute by tossing them in butter over a high flame. The color remains intact, but their integrity is, otherwise, seriously compromised.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Larger green beans—those picked at the moment of their greatest weight rather than at that of their highest quality—are usually neither of an exemplary tenderness nor delicacy of flavor, but they may, with a bit of pampering, be transformed into good, wholesome, and sympathetic nourishment (a recipe for a purée of green beans is given in <em class="ital">The French Menu Cookbook</em>). The following recipe may, depending on personal taste, be simplified by eliminating the tomatoes or altered by the addition of chopped bacon, by tossing in precooked white beans or sautéed little new potatoes . . .

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page190">Broad Beans or Fave Beans <span class="French-translation">(Fèves)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Broad beans pass through four distinct stages of development: (1) The downy pods, having attained some 6 or 7 inches in length, remain firmly cylindrical and regular in form and the tiny, newly formed beans, the flesh not yet firm beneath its bright, clear, green skin, are most often eaten raw, shelled at the table. The skins have a slightly bitter, pleasant, and refreshing flavor, and it is only at this early stage that broad beans may be cooked, each in its skin; (2) the pod has lengthened and flattened, swelling irregularly around each bean, the skin of each remains a clear green color but has thickened and toughened, the light bitterness turning acrid, and it should be removed. The bean measures from ½ to ¾ inch in length and the flesh, bright green, is absolutely tender, requiring but a couple of minutes’ boiling if the beans are to be served simply drained and tossed in butter. At this stage and prepared in this way, a sprig of savory boiled with them and a pinch of chopped tender young savory leaves tossed with them, they have a unique and subtle beauty; (3) the beans are nearly mature in size, measuring about 1 inch in length, the tough individual skins are paler but retain still a greenish color. The flesh beneath the skin is still a clear green but less intense than in the preceding stage, is hard to the touch but tender enough to offer little resistance to a piercing fingernail. Boiled, they will require from 8 to 12 minutes and, as such, are still a good vegetable, but pureed, reheated over a high flame, vigorously stirred, and beaten with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking or burning, a generous amount of butter stirred in away from the heat, they provide one of the most heavenly of all vegetable purées; (4) the skins have turned a dull yellowish white, the flesh is hard and has turned from a light green to a dull yellow-buff; delicacy no longer numbers among the broad bean’s virtues at this point. Dried, the beans must be soaked overnight and the skins removed before being cooked.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Cabbage, in French cookery, is always cooked for a relatively long time—often 4 or 5 hours—is, preferably, parboiled before being subjected to its final cooking process (which attenuates its often aggressive flavor and encourages its digestibility), is pared of the leaf ribs whenever possible, and, whether shredded, chopped, quartered, or stuffed—whole or each leaf individually—and is usually braised in stock or bouillon, often with lean salt pork (first parboiled to rid it of excessive salt), a bouquet garni, and aromatic vegetables (which always include carrots and onions), chopped or cut up and first cooked in fat—olive oil, pork, or goose. Red cabbage, usually coarsely shredded, is treated in the same way except that half of the stock is replaced by red wine; an apple, peeled, cored, and chopped, is usually added; and sometimes chestnuts are braised with it.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind-first">If served hot, a cabbage loaf gains by being sauced—a creamed <em class="ital">béchamel</em> or a tomato sauce, buttered at the last minute. Cubes of boiled ham may be added to the mixture and it may be served cold, sliced, as an hors d’oeuvre.</p>

Stir in the chopped cabbage, pour the mixture into a generously buttered baking dish, and bake for from 30 to 40 minutes in a medium hot oven (400°) or until the center of the loaf is firm to the touch. It may be unmolded or served directly from the cooking dish. If to be unmolded, press a buttered piece of parchment paper into the bottom of the mold before filling it and run a knife around the edges before unmolding.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page193" style="page-break-before:always;">Stuffed Whole Cabbage</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Chou Farci à la Grassoise: “Sou-Fassum”</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Traditionally, this stuffed cabbage is one of the elements of the <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> native to Grasse, a Gargantuesque Sunday repast that is further distinguished by counting mutton among its meats. The integral preparation requires a 20- or 25-quart receptacle, but the stuffed cabbage alone provides a more than honorable supper and may be cooked in a large saucepan or <em class="ital">marmite</em> of a size to easily hold it submerged in liquid. Lacking stock or leftover bouillon, it may be cooked in salted water to which a couple of carrots, an onion stuck with cloves, and a bouquet garni have been added. In season, a handful of freshly shelled peas are a welcome addition to the stuffing.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The Grassois nourish a proud affection for the thing that, to me, seems justified, although a group of friends, all originally from the southwest of France, once surprised me by unanimously pronouncing it insipid and flabby. The cook had, admittedly, been overcautious with seasoning, but their common yardstick for judgment was the golden, firm, egg-yolk-bound <em class="ital">farci</em> of the next recipe—quite another thing, which, to my mind, may be as good but is certainly no better than the <em class="ital">sou-fassum.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">A net-like arrangement called a <em class="ital">fassumier</em> was, in the past, manufactured in Grasse. A string bag, the top of which has been cut off, permitting it to be opened out flat, is its most practical replacement. Lacking that, cheesecloth may be used.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Spread the prepared string bag (or cheesecloth) out on a tabletop or chopping board, place the cabbage in the center, carefully open out about twenty of the outer leaves, spreading them flatly without damaging them or detaching them from the core. Remove the heart, slicing across the core so as to leave a base to which the outer leaves remain attached and, after cutting out the core from the heart, chop the leaves, pressing the chopped mass well to rid it of moisture.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Mix thoroughly the chopped cabbage leaves and all the remaining ingredients (with the exception of the bouillon), using your hands, and form the mixture into a compact ball, placing it at the heart of the opened-out cabbage leaves and re-forming the cabbage by pressing the leaves, one by one, back around the ball of stuffing. Enclose it in the net bag or cheesecloth, drawing the edges up around the cabbage and interlacing a length of kitchen string through the holes (or, in the instance of cheesecloth, threading it through with a trussing needle) and tying tightly so as to make a compact package. Place it in the <em class="ital">marmite,</em> pour over enough bouillon to generously cover, bring to a boil and cook, covered, the lid slightly ajar, at a bare simmer, for about 3½ to 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page195">Present it in a large salad bowl (place the tied-up cabbage in the bowl, tied end up, undo it, spread the net out and away from the cabbage, “unmold” it onto a plate, placing the plate upside down over it and turning bowl and plate over together, remove the net, replace the bowl upside down over the cabbage and turn the lot over again to present the cabbage right side up in its bowl) and serve, apart, a sauceboat of the cooking liquid with which to moisten the servings.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The stuffing in these leaves is the <em class="ital">farci</em> of the southwest, about which many a sentimental word has been written but for which one rarely sees recipes—and, in fact, to give a specific recipe is no doubt to falsify the spirit of the thing, for the only rule of its preparation is that it be based on bread <em class="ital">panade</em> thickened with egg. It is often only that with aromatic support and, when it contains meat, it can be a chopped mixture of any odds and ends of leftover roasts, boiled meats, or poultry giblets. Often a piece of chopped salt pork is the only meat ingredient. If the stuffing most often garnishes cabbage, either whole as in the preceding recipe, destined to serve as the principal element of the meal, or individual leaves, as in this recipe, sometimes serving as a garnish to soup, sometimes served by itself, the reason is economical—whenever something else is stuffed (veal or mutton breasts for braising, chickens for <em class="ital">poule-au-pot,</em> various vegetables . . .), the same <em class="ital">farci</em> finds its place there.

When arriving at the smaller leaves, two may have to be used. You should have approximately 16 stuffed leaves in all, which should be placed, as they are finished, folded side down, on the bed of vegetables in the cooking utensil. Pour over boiling water to just cover, sprinkle with a bit of salt, and cook at a simmer, lid slightly ajar, for 1½ hours.

			<p class="Normal-noind">Tender, small cauliflower may be broken into flowerets and cooked gently in butter until done, tossing regularly, but very often the larger cauliflower is too strong in flavor to permit this treatment. Parboiling attenuates the taste, but few people realize how little cooking is required—usually, if it has been broken into flowerets, simmering for 5 minutes is enough. A couple of minutes more and it is transformed into an unpleasant mush. Parboiled but kept slightly firm, well drained, flowerets sautéed in a generous quantity of butter over a brisk flame until well colored, a handful of chopped parsley tossed in a couple of minutes before removing from the heat, are delicious as a garnish for roast or grilled meats. Whole cauliflower steamed (about 20 minutes—kept slightly firm also) afford a very pretty gratin, first coated with <em class="ital">béchamel</em> and sprinkled with cheese on top.</p>

The syrupy braising juices may, removed from the heat, be bound by whisking in butter or, once braised, the hearts may be transformed into a gratin with a sprinkling of Parmesan and some 20 minutes in a hot oven.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page200">(Swiss) Chard <span class="French-translation">(“Bette,” “Blette,” or, Rib Alone, “Carde”)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The wide, fleshy rib of the chard leaf is appreciated throughout France, usually parboiled in a court bouillon like that of the following recipe, drained, and gratinéed with a <em class="ital">béchamel</em> and cheese. Sometimes a simple white <em class="ital">(bâtarde)</em> sauce is prepared with a roux and a couple of ladles of the court bouillon and given a terminal egg-yolk binding (in which case it must not be permitted to return to a boil nor may it be submitted to a gratin process; the preparation is conveniently baptized <em class="ital">à la Poulette,</em> and it is best to omit the vinegar from the court bouillon and add lemon juice to taste at the last minute), or the ribs may be diced and added to soups.</p>
			<p class="Normal">La Mazille <em class="ital">(La Bonne Cuisine du Périgord)</em> writes, with a certain satisfaction (and an evident disdain for the eaters of chard greens), “In the country [of Périgord], one has no taste for them [the green parts]. The white ribs, which, when cooked, are tender and perfumed, are preferred.” And, in fact, outside of meridional France, where they are an indispensable element in most stuffings, in many gratins, and in occasional soups, the green leafy parts of the chard are usually fed to the rabbits and the ducks. In Nice, however, they replace the Italian’s spinach in the fabrication of green pasta, and the Niçois have a passion for a <em class="ital">tourte</em> of olive oil pastry containing a mixture of shredded chard greens, raisins, pine nuts, grated cheese and sugar, bound with egg. Sometimes a bit of marc is added and sliced apples may mask the filling before the top crust is sealed into place. Sugar is sprinkled on top as it is removed from the oven. It is a thing more often eaten in the streets than at table. Parboiled and served hot, tepid, or cold, seasoned at table with olive oil and lemon (or vinegar), the clean, uncomplicated, and uncompromising, healthy flavor of the chard green is an appreciable thing.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Eggplant has an important place in Provençal cooking and, as in Italy, tomato commonly assists in its preparation. Their affinity cannot be questioned, but it is sometimes good to savor an eggplant alone. For instance, you can bake them whole. Use small eggplants—5 or 6 ounces, baking them for about ¾ hour or until the flesh is purée soft at the stem end—but don’t test with the point of a knife, for, while cooking, they swell, retaining the hot air in their skins and each guest should have the pleasure of puncturing his eggplant at table; accompany with olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon, and, if one likes, finely chopped parsley, onion, and garlic. They may be eaten split lengthwise and spooned directly from the skins or the contents spooned out and mashed with a fork and the chosen seasoning. They are also good grilled (split in two lengthwise, if they are small, crisscross incisions made deeply into the flesh, taking care not to cut through the skin, marinated in olive oil for 15 minutes or so, seasoned and grilled over hot coals, flesh side first—until golden brown, finished on skin side until the flesh is completely tender at the stem end). And, of course, they can be fried.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page206">	If only the large, egg-shaped eggplant is available, split it and cut it into slices crosswise. Otherwise, split the small elongated variety, place the halves, split side down, on the chopping board, and cut each, leaving the slices attached at the stem end, into ⅓-inch thicknesses, forming “fans.” Slip tomato slices into the slits of the sectioned eggplant halves and arrange them, gently forced together, side by side, in a large, oiled gratin dish, on the bottom of which has been scattered half of the chopped onion and sliced garlic.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour the olive oil into a bowl and, the moment the artichoke quarters are pared, turn them around in the oil, coating them to protect them from contact with air. Force them and the olives (first rinsed) into the crevices or hollows left by the eggplant fans, fit in the bay fragments here and there, scatter the remaining onion and garlic over the surface, and sprinkle with the mixed herbs, salt, and pepper. Press everything into place to form as nearly regular surface as possible, and dribble the oil left over from the artichokes over the entire surface, adding a bit more, if necessary. Bake for about 1½ hours, a sheet of aluminum foil placed loosely over the surface, starting with a 450° oven and turning it down to about 350° after 10 minutes or so. When done, the stem ends of the eggplant should be perfectly soft to the touch. Serve as an hors d’oeuvre, either tepid or cold (but not chilled), sprinkled, if you like, with chopped parsley or fresh basil leaves torn into small fragments.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Most Provençal gratins of eggplant consist simply of alternate layers of precooked eggplant slices and stewed tomato, the surface sprinkled with cheese, or, in some instances, there is only an intermediate layer of stewed tomato with <em class="ital">béchamel</em> poured over the surface and sprinkled with cheese. This recipe seems to me very much more interesting, both from the point of view of presentation and of flavor. Often the eggplant is parboiled rather than being precooked in olive oil, but the latter method lends a more exciting savor. In any case, the eggplant must be precooked and the usual reason for failure is insufficient precooking; the stem end is tougher than the rest of the flesh, requiring longer cooking, and the slices should not be removed from the olive oil until the stem end offers no resistance to a knife tip.</p>
			<p class="Normal">With any preparation involving eggplant precooked in olive oil, it is a mistake to add more oil, for the eggplant has, in its first cooking, absorbed a great deal of oil, which, even though the slices are drained on towels, is partly retained and exuded during the subsequent cooking process.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Check them carefully, spreading small quantities at a time out on a plate, to remove any tiny stones or foreign grains. Rinse in a couple of waters, drain them, and cook them in a heavy utensil—earthenware is perfect—covered generously with cold water, a carrot, an onion stuck with a clove or two, a couple of cloves of garlic, thyme, a bay leaf, and salt, the water brought slowly to a boil and reduced to the suggestion of a simmer, covered, for from 1 hour to 1½ hours (depending on their age and quality) or until purée soft but still intact.

			<p class="Normal-noind">The steadily increasing number of adherents to mycological societies apart, most people still fear all but the widely commercialized cultivated mushroom. It is a pity, for, though a faithful standby, it knows nothing of the delicacy of certain of its wild cousins. Edible wild mushrooms are not all very good; to my way of thinking—a way perhaps at variance with that of the passionate mycologist—no more than a dozen or so are of real culinary interest. Some few are sublime and all grow wild in one part or another of the United States.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Two American field guides appear to me to be particularly serious and, at the same time, easy and enjoyable reading for the amateur:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-hanging"><em class="ital">The Mushroom Hunter’s Field Guide</em> by Alexander H. Smith  (University of Michigan Press, 1971)</p>
			<p class="Normal-hanging"><em class="ital">The Savory Wild Mushroom</em> by Margaret McKenny and  Daniel Stuntz (University of Washington Press, 1971)</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">Dr. Smith’s book is of the greater interest to the general reader, <em class="ital">The Savory Wild Mushroom</em> concentrating mainly on the mushrooms to be found in the states of the Pacific Northwest; both are replete with information that cannot fail to interest even the timid reader who would not trust himself to pick and eat a wild mushroom.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The greater a mushroom’s delicacy, the simpler—and more respectful—should be its preparation (the morel and the Caesars’ amanita are little appreciated by many Provençaux because of the autochthonous habit of sautéing all mushrooms <em class="ital">à la Provençale,</em> a handful of heavily garlicked <em class="ital">persillade</em> thrown in at the last minute; cèpes have a sufficiently bold presence to support this treatment, whereas chanterelles, milk caps, or trumpets of death are positively flattered by it). The Caesars’ amanita, for instance, is never so good as when simply rolled in melted butter, seasoned, and grilled over hot coals, a few drops of lemon juice sprinkled over as it is served (these mushrooms, according to Dr. Smith, are found in the southeastern states; another closely related variety with which I am unfamiliar but which, apparently, possesses the same qualities, <em class="ital">Amanita calyptroderma,</em> is found along the Pacific coast, most commonly in northern California. These are autumn mushrooms. Both of the above-mentioned books concur in discouraging the beginner from collecting them because of the danger of confusing them with deadly varieties—so, under no circumstances should you try them without professional assurance of their identity; with this assurance, you may well agree with many a European lover of mushrooms—and with the Caesars before him—that they are the loveliest of all).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page217">Morels (which are said to be poisonous if eaten raw) are best gently stewed and tossed in butter for some 10 to 15 minutes, finished or not with heavy cream (the stem ends must be trimmed and they should be split in two and well rinsed beneath a vigorous jet of water, then sponged dry before being put to cook; dried morels, after first being soaked in cold water until supple—usually for about 1 hour or slightly more—and drained, must also be trimmed, split, and rinsed and can then be treated like fresh morels). First stewed in butter, they provide a sumptuous addition to delicately flavored forcemeats—chicken <em class="ital">mousseline,</em> for instance—or to scrambled eggs. They are a spring mushroom; the state of Michigan is celebrated for its May morel festivals.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Despite the intellectualizing myco-hedonists’ pretension that to wash a mushroom is sacrilege, the unpleasantness of grinding one’s teeth into gravel, soil, or other foreign matter will proscribe such blind reverence to a rational palate unless the mushroom’s firm smoothness permits its being, once the stem end has been carefully pared, wiped absolutely clean with a damp cloth. Of the noble varieties, only the Caesars’ amanita and the cèpe <em class="ital">(Boletus edulis)</em> may successfully be cleaned in this way. The hearts of cèpe stems are sometimes worm-riddled—they should be pared clean or discarded, depending on the extent of the damage. Firm, healthy cèpe stems make the best of all <em class="ital">duxelles.</em> Cèpes may be creamed (thickly sliced, stewed with a bit of chopped onion in butter, submerged in heavy cream, reduced until they are coated with sauce, a bit of fresh cream and chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> stirred in just before serving); to me, they seem best sautéed with olive oil either <em class="ital">à la Bordelaise</em> (with shallots) or <em class="ital">à la Provençale</em> (with garlic), or merely marinated in olive oil and grilled over hot wood coals, a few drops of lemon juice added as they are removed from the grill. Cèpes occasionally are found in the springtime but they are commonly an autumn mushroom. Dr. Smith notes that “collectors are not prone to give away information as to localities where this species may be found.”</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">This is the easiest and best method of treating any number of mushrooms whose native flavors tend to be a bit flat, such as the milk caps (<em class="ital">Lactarius deliciosus</em> or <em class="ital">L. sanguifluus</em>), spreading hedgehog mushrooms (<em class="ital">Dentinum repandum</em>—known as <em class="ital">pieds de mouton</em> in France), or trumpets of death <em class="ital">(Craterellus cornucopioides).</em> Cultivated mushrooms are often prepared in this way also and, despite a more alluring personality, chanterelles <em class="ital">(Cantharellus cibarius)</em> are most commonly treated this way. They, unlike the others, must first be <a href="k_170-260.xhtml#page219">disgorged of their excess liquid</a> before being sautéed.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The garlic is usually finely chopped, but its presence will be more discreet if it is pureed and mixed with the chopped parsley.</p>
			<p class="Normal">If, after carefully trimming the earthy stem ends, it is possible to wipe the mushrooms clean, do so—otherwise, plunge them into a large basin of cold water, swirl them around vigorously with your hands, and remove them immediately to a colander, lifting them with both hands, fingers splayed.

They should be tossed every few seconds. Add the garlic purée and parsley, well mixed together, and continue tossing for a minute or two—until the mingled perfumes of the two explode—add the crumbs and toss for a few moments more, pepper generously, squeeze over a bit of lemon juice, toss again, and serve.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">The bread and butter cases afford an attractive presentation but may be replaced by a scattering of croutons. To easily carve the cases, the bread should be of a relatively heavy, firm-textured body and not too fresh. Light-bodied loaves will have to be deep frozen to be workable.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Chanterelles throw off much more liquid in contact with heat than any of the other commonly used mushrooms and this liquid should be drained off. It is flavorful and may be added to soups or reduced to a syrup and added to sauces—in particular the butter-bound juices of sautéed chicken or rabbit that take the sautéed chanterelles as garnish. If the chanterelles were permitted to remain in their juices until those juices were reduced and reabsorbed, they would become tough and rubbery from overcooking. After having picked them over, discarding any spongy specimens and trimming earthy stem tips, wash them briskly, drain them, and put them, lightly sprinkled with salt, into a heavy, tightly covered saucepan over a high flame. Hold the lid tightly in place and shake the pan over the flame to prevent their sticking to the bottom. No sooner will the heat have thoroughly penetrated them than they will be completely submerged in their liquid. As soon as it reaches a full, foamy boil, remove the chanterelles from the heat, drain them in a sieve, pressing gently with the back of a wooden spoon, and put them aside. Raw, chanterelles should be absolutely fresh, firm, and dry, but, once heated and drained, they may be refrigerated for a day or so in a tightly covered bowl without suffering.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">We have nearly forgotten; good potatoes—like good rice—have an exquisite and delicate flavor, a flavor of such fragile purity that only a breath of salt, a turn of the pepper grinder, and a chunk of sweet butter can fail to mask it.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A reviewer of my last book, commenting on a recipe that called for a firm-fleshed, non-mealy type of potato, complained that it was hard enough to find an edible potato, let alone one of such specific attributes. I felt that the remark was unfair, for I remembered delicious potatoes from my childhood and, on recent visits to American markets, although the plethora of potatoes that had been dipped in a ghastly pink dye was depressing, a substantial choice of different types of potatoes was, nonetheless, in evidence.</p>
			<p class="Normal">I appealed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for all the information they could give me concerning different potato varieties, the specific qualities of each, and their general availability in different parts of the country. I described in detail those available on the French market, the qualities that each possessed, and, in particular, one hybrid variety, the “B-F-15,” whose qualities I hoped to find duplicated in an American variety (small, in the form of an elongated kidney, with a dark, dull, dusty umber-colored thick skin, a firm, moist, compact, yellow flesh that remains intact even over a prolonged cooking period, and a good, clean taste. It is not a productive variety and the price is approximately double that of most others).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page227">I received in gracious response, some months later, an impressive collection of literature. One pamphlet was devoted to U.S. grade standards for potatoes. I learned that, in order to meet the requirements of “U.S. Extra n<span class="super">o</span> 1” (formerly “U.S. Fancy”): (1) size gradation is of particular importance; (2) soil clinging to the skins is considered a defect; (3) potatoes should not show more than slight shriveling; (4) artificial coloration is only considered a defect if it entails “more than 5% waste when discolored flesh is removed,” is “unsightly,” or is designed to disguise other defects (U.S. Extra n<span class="super">o</span> 1 may be “8% defective”); (5) no more than 10% of the potatoes in any lot of “U.S. Extra n<span class="super">o</span> 1” may have sprouts over ¾ inch long! The message, in short, would seem to be that, but for the cardinal importance of size gradation, mediocrity of appearance is tolerated and no qualities other than appearance are deemed even worth consideration.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The remaining literature consisted mostly of articles reprinted from recent years of the <em class="ital">Yearbook of Agriculture.</em> One opened with this puzzling statement: “In general, potatoes can be classed as long or round and white, red or russet. It would also be desirable to classify potatoes for use, as boiling, baking, or frying. Unfortunately this is not possible because of the wide range of growing and storage conditions as well as personal preferences.” The nature of the potato, itself, is, apparently, the only thing that does not apply to its use in cooking. Most of the article is devoted to the potato’s interest and versatility in its tinned, deep-frozen, or dehydrated forms.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Another article was, promisingly, actually consecrated to a potato variety—and, but for the previous suggestion that potatoes might be long or round, white, red, or russet, that was the only indication in the whole pile of stuff that a potato may possess any other quality than anonymous potatoness. The article is entitled: “An All Purpose Potato” (anyone knows—or should know—that an all-purpose anything can serve no single purpose well). The potato’s name is “Kennebec” and the article opens with a charming verse dedicated to it:</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p class="Normal-noind">Some like it hot</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Some like it cold</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Some like it as a chip,</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Bright as gold.</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page228">It may be baked,</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">It may be fried,</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">It may be mashed,</p>
			<p class="Normal-noind">Or even be dried.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="Normal">“The American potato grower today (1968) grows about 50% more potatoes on only 44% of the land area used in 1930.” And, thanks to Kennebec, yield trends are still soaring . . . Its qualities are fantastic: gigantic production, disease resistance, aptitude for dehydration . . . Only its taste and its texture are ignored in the eloquent little homage to Super-Potato. The last lines look brightly to the future: “The all-purpose Kennebec of today will most certainly be replaced by a still more superior potato of tomorrow. The future holds great promise for potato growers, shippers, processors . . .”</p>
			<p class="Normal">And so—I cannot help it—I shall continue to recommend potato types, but, if real potatoes cannot be found, substitute Kennebecs.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">If you are fond of potatoes boiled in their skins, try, for a change, adding sliced onion, crushed garlic cloves, a couple of cloves, and a choice of bouquet garni elements (branches of parsley, celery, lovage, thyme, oregano, savory, marjoram, bay leaves . . .) to a pot of salted boiling water and leaving it to simmer, covered, for ½ hour before cooking the potatoes in it. Drain the whole lot together and serve with unsalted butter apart (and/or, for the meridional temperament, olive oil).</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page229">In America only cheap restaurants moisten mashed potatoes with their cooking water rather than with milk and cream. In France no self-respecting peasant would think of doing otherwise. But the greatest difference between American mashed or whipped potatoes and a French potato purée lies in the fluffy, white, firm, and slightly elastic body of the one—a result of the beating it is given—and the supple, relaxed, grayish, thinner body of the other. The potatoes, halved or quartered if large, should be only just cooked—usually 20 minutes, drained (cooking water saved), and gently pushed through a sieve with a large wooden pestle (with direct pressure—no grinding or mashing), a generous quantity of butter stirred, but not beaten, in and enough cooking liquid added to bring them to a barely pourable consistency, tasted for salt, and generously peppered. Try them on the family (guests might suspect that you had make a mistake—or that you had never read a cookbook). I love them. They are often served liberally onto a plate with a grilled sausage—<em class="ital">andouillette,</em> blood sausage, or other—plopped into their middle.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Try sautéing tiny new potatoes (scraped and rinsed—or merely scrubbed—and wiped dry) in butter, olive oil, or a combination with a handful of unpeeled garlic cloves thrown in: Use a heavy omelet pan, cook, covered, over a low heat for about ½ hour, shaking the pan often to discourage sticking and tossing them regularly (but never stir them, be it ever so gently—if one should stick, delicately pry it loose with the tip of a blunt knife). Cook another 10 minutes or so, tossing, with the lid off. Chopped parsley may be thrown in a minute or two before removing from the heat. The potatoes should be creamy soft inside, lightly golden outside, and the garlic cloves, if the heat has not been too high, will contain a creamy purée that may be squeezed out and spread on bread.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind" id="page230">The question of rinsing potatoes or not is not one of personal preference; it is dictated by the type of a given preparation. One of my preferred garnishes for grilled or roast meats or fowl is a potato <em class="ital">paillasson</em> (sometimes called <em class="ital">pommes Dauphin:</em> a mass of potatoes passed through the medium blade of a Mouli-juliènne, well rinsed in a couple of waters, rapidly drained, spread out on a towel, rolled tightly up, squeezed dry, and packed into a heated omelet pan containing lots of butter, cooked covered over a low flame for 20 minutes or until the bottom is golden crisp, flipped—or unmolded onto a plate and slipped back into the pan to which a bit more butter has been added—and cooked, uncovered, for another 18 or 20 minutes before being slipped onto a hot serving platter). Repeatedly, friends who have asked for the recipe have complained that it does not work for them and repeatedly, after stubborn questioning, they have admitted refusing to rinse and dry the potatoes “because all that chi-chi doesn’t really make any difference.” In fact, that chi-chi is responsible for the voluptuous smoothness contained cleanly within the still sharply defined juliènne texture (assuming the potatoes to be not of an inferior, mealy, soup variety). Left unrinsed, the inside of the cake will be unpleasantly glutinous and the outside will stick to the pan (one friend, thanks to Teflon, had no trouble with sticking but the outer casing, falling short of golden crispness, seemed to be of gray leather). Any raw potatoes, cut to whatever form, that are destined to be sautéed should be well rinsed and wiped dry if only to prevent sticking.</p>
			<p class="Normal">That which mars the perfection of one preparation may reinforce the quality of another; the cooking liquids of a <em class="ital">gratin dauphinois</em> or an Irish stew are lent extra body by the superficial starch clinging to sliced potatoes and that of shredded potatoes serves the same purpose in the batters for <em class="ital">criques</em> or fritters . . .</p>

			<p class="Normal">It is impractical to give precise proportions for this kind of preparation: Count approximately a pound of potatoes, preferably non-mealy and yellow-fleshed, to a third of a cup of butter, using a heavy 8-inch omelet pan and proportionately more for a 10-inch pan to serve for from 3 to 6 people. But for the less exacting method of preparation, these potatoes are, in effect, <em class="ital">pommes Anna.</em></p>
			<p class="Normal">Use large potatoes; peel them and slice them lengthwise in order to obtain the largest possible slices, cut thinly as for potato chips, rinse in a large basin of cold water, rubbing them gently between your hands, drain rapidly, spread them out on a towel, and pat them dry with another towel.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Melt the butter, turning the omelet pan around in all directions in order to coat the sides as well as the bottom, add the potatoes, arranging those on the surface neatly in an overlapping design, press the mass compactly with the palm of your hand, season the surface, and cook, covered, over a low flame, gently shaking the pan in a to-and-fro motion from time to time to make certain that they are not sticking, for about 20 minutes or until the underside is crisp and forms a solid block. Turn the flame up or down slightly after 10 or 15 minutes if the potatoes seem to be coloring too little or too rapidly. Shake the pan to be certain that the mass slides freely and toss them over (or unmold them onto a plate and slip them back into the pan, to which has been added a small lump of butter). Finish cooking, uncovered, for another 15 or 20 minutes, seasoning the surface lightly just before slipping them from the pan to the serving dish.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">A quarrel rages in France as to what may be the true <em class="ital">gratin dauphinois.</em> Egg and cheese are included in the recipes from old cookbooks (too far removed from the sources, according to the purists). Nearly every reputed restaurant has its celebrated <em class="ital">gratin dauphinois</em> and each is willing to divulge its recipe, usually incomprehensible and conceived in the interest of mystification (I have eaten potatoes boiled in milk and dryly reheated days later under a salamander in a restaurant whose publicly presented recipe pretends that they should be poached in milk, the milk discarded, covered with heavy cream, and gratinéed in the oven). When one gets rid of the nonsense, there is nothing very mysterious about this dish, suddenly become one of the masterpieces of <em class="ital">la grande cuisine;</em> but for the breath of garlic, it is the scalloped potatoes of our American mothers and grandmothers.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page234">The quality of the dish depends on a number of different things (but not only one quality is the right one): The thinness of the potato slices as well as their breadth; the proportions of the dish in which they are cooked; the proportion of milk to cream; the heat at which they are cooked . . . Thickly sliced potatoes piled thickly into a deep dish, moistened only with milk, and cooked in a slow oven for 2 hours are neither less authentically <em class="ital">gratin dauphinois</em> nor less good (although a totally other experience) than paper-thin slices spread thinly in a wide and shallow dish, richly endowed with cream and baked in a hot oven for less than half the time . . . The most important factor remains the quality of the potato and it should not be mealy.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Earthenware will take the garlic better than other materials. Rub a large gratin dish with garlic (or, which is easier and more effective, put the peeled cloves through a garlic press, rubbing the purée and juices all over the sides and bottom of the dish and discarding any solid debris that remains), leave for a few minutes until the garlic juice has completely dried and is no longer tacky to the touch, butter the dish liberally, and pack in the potatoes in lightly salted layers. Pour over enough milk to just cover the potatoes, bring the liquid to a boil on top of the stove (using an asbestos pad to protect earthenware from the direct flame), dribble a thin layer of cream over the surface, distribute thin shavings of butter, and bake in a 375° to 400° oven for about 45 to 50 minutes or until the liquid has been nearly completely absorbed, the potatoes give no resistance to a knife point, and a richly colored skin has formed on the surface.</p>

They should be eaten hot from the pan and it is impractical to prepare them for more than 2 or 3 people. A salad of wild or other slightly bitter greens would complement them handsomely.</p>

Stir each time before taking up a new spoonful, don’t try to fry too many at a time, and adjust the flame—repeatedly, if necessary—to prevent the oil from overheating or cooling. When the undersides are deeply golden, delicately turn each over with the tines of a fork. A flat wire skimming spoon <em class="ital">(araignée)</em> is the most practical instrument with which to remove them. Drain on absorbent paper for a few moments before serving.</p>

			<p class="Normal" id="page238">Stew the onions, salted, in the remaining butter for at least ½ hour, covered, stirring or tossing regularly. The saucepan should be heavy and not so large as to impose a depth of less than 1 to 1½ inches on the layer of onions—they should sweat as much in their own humidity as in the butter, and, finally, should be translucid, uncolored, and melting on the verge of purée.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Mix together the sorrel and the onions in a bowl and, when no more than tepid, whisk or beat the cream, eggs, and seasonings apart; then pour the mixture slowly into the onions and sorrel, stirring all the while. Pour into the pastry shell and bake in a 375° oven for about 40 minutes or until swelled, firm in the center, and lightly colored. Serve warm 20 minutes to ½ hour after removing from the oven. A well-chilled, young, light, dry white wine with a suspicion of sparkle or a light-bodied Champagne are perfect companions.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page238a">Spinach <span class="French-translation">(Épinards)</span></h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">If bought unpicked-over and unwashed, tear the spinach leaves free of the stems, soak them in a basin of water to dissolve clinging soil and then wash thoroughly at least three times, swirling them in a large basin of water and transferring them by handsful to another basin of water—don’t pour the lot into a colander before transferring it to another basin of water; you will only collect all the dirt with the leaves. Lift the leaves from their final rinse water to a colander to drain.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is often said that spinach should be cooked “dry”—that is to say, only in the bit of washing water that clings to the leaves or, at most, with a couple of tablespoonsful of water added—and that to cook it in a large quantity of water entails a serious loss of flavor and vitamins; this method requires a longer cooking time, a large part of the spinach is subjected to a sort of stewing process rather than to a rapid contact with boiling water, and, although the draining liquid may be relatively small in quantity, it will be a thick, black concentration of all the vegetable’s goodness that is discarded.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page239">When it is to be parboiled, plunge it into a large quantity of salted boiling water. As the water returns to a boil begin repeatedly forcing the mass of spinach back beneath the water with the back of a wooden spoon, counting no more than 2 minutes’ cooking time—or, if its youth and tenderness are suspect, at most 3 or 4 minutes—from the moment the water has returned to a boil. Drain it, pressing lightly with the back of the spoon to rid it of excess moisture (drained and simply tossed for a moment over a flame with butter, it is delicious) or, for those recipes that call for it squeezed dry, refresh it beneath cold running water until cool enough to handle and take the mass in both hands, squeezing tightly and repeatedly. In this state it may be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for use in days to come.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In Provençal cooking, spinach is often cooked directly, raw, in olive oil without a preliminary parboil. Sometimes, as for flat omelets, it is stewed gently over a low flame before being incorporated into the egg mixture, but most often, alone or in combination with other vegetables (mushrooms, sliced and oiled raw artichokes—Parmesan may be sprinkled between the layers), it is presented as a gratin. To be used in this way, the leaves must be young and tender or the flavor will be harsh and tannic. Tough, leathery-textured leaves are to be avoided. Light, clear-green leaves are dependably young and gentle of flavor, but, with certain varieties, the leaves are dark green in youth, as well. Spinach produced at the height of the summer is often strong. Prepared raw, it is always wisest to pick over the leaves, tearing the stems backwards, thus removing any tougher veining that runs into the leaf itself.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Mash the Roquefort to a paste in a mixing bowl, mash a bit of the squash with it, then stir in the lot, adding the onion, the garlic purée, the marjoram, and the egg, and beating well with the fork. Stir in the Parmesan, grind in pepper to taste, and, finally, add the rice. Taste before adding more salt (the pumpkin has already been salted as well as the garlic purée, Roquefort is often oversalted, and Parmesan sufficiently so . . .).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Using a cookie cutter, an empty tin can, a large highball glass, etc., cut rounds approximately 4 inches in diameter from the rolled-out pastry, stacking them as they are cut and filling them and sealing them immediately afterward to prevent their drying out and becoming unmanageable: Hold a round in the flat of your hand, place a heaping teaspoonful of filling in the center (the amount should not be forced or the pastry walls will split during the baking), dip fingers of the other hand in a bowl of water, smearing it around the edges of the pastry round and fold gently closed, pinching the edges well together. As each is prepared, place it on an oil-filmed baking sheet and lightly crinkle the sealed edges, forming a ruffled crest. Place them an inch apart, one from the other, to permit even baking, brush the surface of each (or smear with your fingers) with olive oil, and bake for from 25 to 30 minutes in a hot oven (about 425°) or until the body of the pastry is lightly golden and the lacy edges of the crests are prettily browned, but not blackened.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Deux Gratins de Courgettes Farcies</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Recipes for stuffed vegetables should not be taken too seriously—at least insofar as the ingredients for the fillings are concerned; vegetables may be stuffed with practically anything, and, if a bit of common sense is brought to the composition, they cannot help being good. Leftover roast, boiled or stewed meats or poultry often find their way, chopped, into these stuffings. Stock meats, although most of their goodness has been drained from them, may be ground or finely chopped—revivified by a larger than usual dose of herbs and a pinch of cayenne, they provide an absolutely respectable base. Something alliaceous always gives a spark of life; soaked, squeezed bread, precooked rice, leftover mashed potatoes, or chopped leftover pasta will lend lightness and consistency; egg is for binding and cheese both for sapid relief and textural coherence. Throughout this treatise, Parmesan and Gruyère have been recommended to the exclusion of other grating cheeses and there can be no doubt but that, along with aged Cheshire, they are the best—but other firm cheeses that may have become too unsightly, too dry, or too strongly flavored for continued use on the cheese platter should certainly not be discarded; the various <em class="ital">tommes</em> and related cheeses or Cantal serve this purpose well, and if American Cheddar continued to resemble its English parent, so would it. Dry goat cheese, become too sharp or too salty to be pleasant as an eating cheese, may, used discreetly, be an interesting and unusual flavoring agent.</p>

Roll the sealed edges upward and inward on themselves, forming a slightly thicker ribbon of dough surrounding the filled center, and press firmly all the way around with the back of a fork, forming a striated pattern like the rays of symbolic sun images (or press all the way around with the floured edge of your thumb).

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pudding Soufflé aux Courgettes</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">The traditional soufflé, raced from oven to table with, its lovely golden head bobbing precariously, is a pretty sight and may have evinced more gasps of admiration than any other single bit of culinary theater. Even served rapidly by an accomplished maître d’hôtel, it has already collapsed into an indefinable ectoplasmic stuff before the tines of one’s fork can reach it (the uncooked heart of the matter, it is said, serves as the sauce).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page255">A pudding soufflé and, in particular, one that has been gratinéed, being thus subjected to two separate cooking processes, is a sublimely different thing: It is first cooked gently in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> until done, then unmolded when slightly cooled; it settles somewhat, its volume diminishing, but, inundated with a light-bodied sauce (often simply heavy cream) and put to gratiné, it swells again, retaining its newfound volume. It is light—for it, too, is mostly air—but it remains, nonetheless, firm. One of these little puddings, prelude to an amicable chunk of rare meat, might take many a jaded gastronome by surprise.</p>
			<p class="Normal"><em class="ital">Soufflés à la Suissesse,</em> the inspirational source for this recipe, are individual soufflés in which a cup of grated Parmesan replaces the zucchini. They are, otherwise, treated in the same way and are particularly exciting if unmolded onto a bed of parboiled, squeezed, and chopped spinach before being drowned in heavy cream, sprinkled with cheese, and returned to the oven. Of possible variations, I have found mushrooms to be the most interesting (about 10 ounces mushrooms—put through a Mouli-juliènne and sautéed in butter until their liquid is evaporated—replacing the zucchini). An addition of puréed, butter-stewed sorrel to the cream is an especially attractive variation on the sauce, in which instance I think that fresh crumbs, first lightly colored in butter, may be a better surface garnish than the grated cheese. The presence of the zucchini—or of mushrooms—in the mixture need not necessarily preclude the addition of cheese as in the <em class="ital">soufflés à la Suissesse;</em> try it both ways . . .</p>
