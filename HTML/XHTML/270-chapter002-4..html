<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">A <em>tisane</em> refers to any hot, steeped drink that, unlike tea, does not have caffeine and is typically made with fresh or dried herbs, flowers, spices, seeds, berries, barks, and fruit. A tisane can be as simple as a <em>canarino,</em> which is simply lemon peel steeped in hot water, often served after dinner in Italy, and said to be good for digestion. Or a tisane can be a combination of flavors, such as lemon verbena mixed with fresh ginger and orange peel, or a warming combination of hibiscus flowers with apple, cinnamon sticks, and cardamom. Tisanes can even be medicinal if you use ingredients like burdock root and milk thistle, both good for your liver. Any dry tisane mixture, such as a combination of dried mint and rosemary, can be packed into a jar and makes a wonderful gift.</p>
<p>Drinking a tisane is a chance to pause, relax, and escape—a way to take your system and mind out of a cloud. To make a tisane, simply place whatever herbs or ingredients you are using into any kind of strainer you have: a metal tea ball, a silver strainer, an infuser spoon (which looks like two perforated spoons clamped together), or even a clean cotton sock. Place the device into a teacup or teapot. Wet the ingredients with a bit of cold water before pouring hot water over and let it steep however long you desire, at least 1 minute for a light brew and up to 10 minutes for a strong, robust one.</p></div>
