<p class="nonindent">Grilled sardines represent the best of coastal Spanish cuisine. All you need for the day’s catch are olive oil, salt, and fire. If you’re lucky enough to live somewhere with a fish monger who can sell you the day’s catch, become friends with her and start cooking. Look for sardines with bright, shiny eyes and skin and ask the fishmonger to gut them for you.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME, RUB YOUR GRILL</span> grate with a paper towel dampened with olive oil. Get your grill really hot with the coals on one side of it. Season the sardines with a little salt inside and out, and rub them with a sheen of olive oil. The key to keeping the fish from sticking to the grate is getting the grate superhot first; when it’s ready, put the fish on it, right next to the coals but not directly above them. If they’re right over the coals, their dripping juices will cause flare-ups. Flames hitting the fish can create an acrid taste.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the sardines are on, don’t touch them. Flip them only when they release from the grate easily; minutes will have gone by. Once turned, they should cook only until their flesh is opaque throughout, which you can see by peeking in the centers. Don’t overcook them. The skin on the second side may stick, so you may end up with one presentation side and one stuck side, but that’s okay—it’s better than ending up with dry fish. Eat them while they’re hot and their skin is blistered and crisp.</p>
