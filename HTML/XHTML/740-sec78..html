<p class="nonindent">The relics of Saint James are believed to be buried in Galicia’s Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Pilgrims from around the world who trek the Camino de Santiago end up at the site. Though the origins of Santiago’s eponymous cake aren’t clear, its current popularity is evident in the streets of Galicia. Pastry shops for miles around the cathedral, and even beyond Galicia’s borders, sell rich almond cakes sugar-emblazoned with the cross of Saint James. (You can find a stencil online to print and cut out to dust the top with confectioner’s sugar.) While many bakers make low, tart-like cakes, I prefer a taller one. And I like to soak it with cream sherry and brandy. For a more traditional take, you can skip that final step. This cake is sweet enough for dessert, but also works well with tea in the afternoon or for brunch.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for the pan</strong></p>

<p class="side-text"><strong>6 large egg yolks, room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 large egg whites, room temperature</strong></p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325°F. BUTTER A 9-INCH-ROUND</span> (2-inch-deep) cake pan, line the bottom with parchment paper, and butter again.</p>
<p class="indent">Spread ⅓ cup almonds on a half-sheet pan and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool completely on the pan, then spread in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared cake pan.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, grind the remaining 2 cups almonds in a food processor until very finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk in the flour, salt, and lemon zest. Reserve.</p>
<p class="indent">Beat the egg yolks, ¾ cup granulated sugar, and 2 tablespoons hot water with the whisk attachment of an electric mixer on medium-high speed until tripled in volume, light, and airy, about 5 minutes. With the machine running, slowly pour in the melted butter in a steady stream. Remove from the mixer and very gently fold in the almond flour mixture. Be careful not to overmix; mix it just until incorporated and reserve.</p>
<p class="indent">Beat the egg whites with a clean whisk attachment in a clean bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. With the machine running, add ¼ cup sugar in a steady stream. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped whites into the egg yolk mixture. Be sure not to deflate the mixture. Gently and carefully dollop the batter over the almonds in the cake pan, then smooth the top.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.</p>
<p class="nonindent">While the cake bakes, heat the sherry and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the brandy.</p>
<p class="indent">When the cake is done, cool it in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. With a pastry brush, brush half of the syrup on top of the cake. Cool completely in the pan on the rack. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and brush the remaining syrup on top. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When ready to serve, place the stencil of the cross of Saint James (Santiago cross) on top of the cake and dust around it with a nice layer of confectioner’s sugar. Remove the stencil and serve.</p>
