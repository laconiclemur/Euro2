<p class="nonindent">Blood sausage is one of my favorite Spanish delicacies, especially the rice-studded variety known as burgos. The tender rice grains break up the tight texture and cut through the meatiness. The most difficult part of this dish is tracking down fresh pork blood, which has a rounded taste that’s far less tannic than beef blood. The sausage mix itself is actually much easier to stuff than <a href="sec38.xhtml#page125">Pork Sausages</a>. Once you make a full batch, you can keep the links in your freezer for a 20-minute meal.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">BRING A LARGE SAUCEPAN OF WATER TO A BOIL.</span> Stir in the rice and 1 tablespoon salt. Boil the rice like pasta until cooked through and tender, about 12 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold running water until cold, then drain well. Spread on a half-sheet pan and refrigerate until cool.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the pork fat and reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Drain the pork fat and add to the onion. Refrigerate until cold.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Whisk the egg yolk, cream, pimentón and hot pimentón, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, and remaining 2½ teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Stir in the pork blood until well combined, then stir in the chilled rice, onion, and pork fat until evenly distributed. Refrigerate until cold.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, soak the casings in room temperature water for 20 minutes. You want the casings to feel soft. Run cold water through the softened casings to rinse out the insides.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Set up an area to fill the casings. Wet a half-sheet pan to create a slick surface and put the casings on it. Pull one end of the casings over the mouth of the bottle, leaving the rest of the casings on the wet pan. With kitchen string, tie the casings around the bottle opening tightly and tie the opposite end shut. Hold the casing against the bottle shut with one hand while ladling the blood sausage mixture into the wide-open end of the bottle. Ladle in enough to come three-quarters of the way up the sides. Slowly release your fingers around the other end to let the mixture slowly flow through without creating air bubbles. If the solids have trouble getting through the opening, push them through with the handle of a wooden spoon. Repeat with the remaining sausage mixture until the casings are completely full. Tie the end closest to the bottle shut and snip off the part tied to the bottle. Gently massage the mixture to evenly distribute the solids. Starting from one end, tie into 6-inch links with kitchen string using double knots. Don’t make the links too taut and firm or they’ll burst when cooking. When you press a link, it should have the wobbly softness of a poached <a id="page131"/>egg. Once all the links are made, tie the two ends together to create a ring.</p>
<p class="indent">Bring a large pot of water to 170°F. Carefully lower the sausage ring into the pot and poach for 20 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a constant 170°F.</p>
<p class="indent">To check for doneness, carefully pull a sausage up over the edge of the pot with the end of a wooden spoon lifting between links and prick a link with a needle. Brown, not red, liquid should ooze out.</p>
<p class="indent">Carefully transfer to a half-sheet pan in a single layer and cool to room temperature. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until cold and the casings are dry, about 2 hours. The sausages can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When ready to serve, cook in a lightly oiled pan over medium-low heat until crisp on the outside and very hot inside, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and slice into rounds. Return to the pan and cook until both sides are well-seared. Transfer to a serving plate, drizzle with olive oil, and spear with toothpicks. Serve with toast points.</p>
