Males have more seeds and can be identified by an oval spot at their bottom ends. The females are almost seedless and are much less bitter. Look at its bottom. A small brown round spot indentation identifies its sex as female. Choose the female. They are much sweeter.</p></aside>
<p class="bmh1">Risotto Julienne</p>
<aside epub:type="footnote" id="chapter5-2"><p class="ntx"><a epub:type="noteref" href="chapter5.xhtml#cha-2">2</a>. While I was writing this book, I received good news from my <span class="epub-i">compare</span> Sandro La Bozzetta concerning his daughter Cinzia. Forget about Pino of the roving eye. She will marry a lieutenant of the Carabinieri (the Italian state police) very soon. Probably by the time this book is published (it takes forever, believe me), she will have had her first child. What’s Pino doing? Still looking at every skirt that passes by.</p></aside>
