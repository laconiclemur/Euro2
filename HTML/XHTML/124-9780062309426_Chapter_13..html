<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Gers has just one city: Auch, with 23,000 residents, a nice cathedral, one fancy-ish hotel, and a bunch of shops selling foie gras gift boxes. Beyond that, you’ll find around a dozen gritty rural hubs known colloquially as <i>bourgs</i>, with populations in the vicinity of 5,000, and also a couple of dozen <i>bourgades</i>, which are villages like Plaisance: big enough to have, say, their own post office and at least a few of the standard-issue <i>commerces</i>—pharmacy, tobacconist, newsstand, butcher shop, bakery, and so on. Finally, scattered more or less evenly across the Gers like grains of rice are hundreds of somnolent hamlets possessed of a church and maybe a tiny <i>mairie</i>. With no big urban centers to connect to, the Gers has just a handful of rail lines and only a couple of stretches of four-lane highway. Both of those are on the route between Auch and Toulouse, and both are very short—no sooner have you set the cruise control than the highway <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128" title="128"/>peters out again, as if its builders had knocked off early for a round of floc and never bothered to finish the job.</p>
<p class="indent">The deeply rural character of the Gascon heartland owes in part to its distinctive terrain, which is, geologically speaking, runoff from the Pyrenees deposited over millennia in a fantail formation, creating a vast bed of fluvial sedimentary deposits known to geologists as <i>molasse</i>. The Gers is also one big collecting basin for the Garonne and Adour rivers, which enclose the département like a pair of cupped hands. The hundreds of rain-fed brooks, riffles, streams, and small rivers that empty into those two great waterways have, over a great deal of time, carved the molasse into a dense mosaic of arable hills and rich-soiled valleys ideal for sustaining small farms and villages but not particularly conducive to building cities.</p>
<p class="indent">The Gers is, more than anything else, a place where edible things grow. Plums, walnuts, hazelnuts, apples, tomatoes, pears, melons, berries, peaches, legumes, oil-seed plants, cereal grains: All are commercially farmed in the département. Quite a few of those things are raised by non-farmers, too. Gascons are consummate gardeners, and their <i>jardins potager</i> tend to be bigger and more professional-looking than the kitchen gardens to be found in American backyards—sprawling, neatly furrowed beds bursting forth riotously with fruits and vegetables in summer, often flanked by fruit trees, sometimes with a few rows of grapevines added to the mix, for the <i>vin maison.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Ducks, of course, are raised in abundance—some 18,500 tons’ worth per year, nearly half the production of the entire Midi-Pyrénées region—as are, to a lesser extent, geese. The Gers has its own heritage-breed cows, called <i>vaches mirandaises</i>, and heritage-breed chickens, called <i>poules Gasconnes</i>. There’s also a local race of pig, the free-foraging <i>porc noir de Bigorre</i>, which, as its name suggests, is black, and has what must be one of the more eclectic porcine diets in all of France: It includes chestnuts, acorns, earthworms, snails, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129" title="129"/>white truffles, apples, and wild grasses, among other delicacies. During our strolls in the hills outside Plaisance, it was not unusual for Michele and me to surprise a few <i>porcs noirs</i> nosing around the woods.</p>
<p class="indent">Intensive farming has made inroads in the Gers, in the form of monoculture crops like corn, soybeans, rapeseed, and sunflowers. The rapeseed and sunflowers turn whole swaths of the countryside bright yellow in summer. Big agricultural operations have altered the landscape here and there—trees cleared away, the land flattened or graded. But to a surprising extent, old-fashioned polyculture still thrives: small farms raising a few different kinds of crops and livestock, often of the web-footed variety. This has gone a long way toward preserving the variegated, patchwork feel of the Gascon countryside.</p>
<p class="indent">The particular brand of beauty proffered by the Gers is neither grandiose nor stark. The Gers lacks cliffs, waterfalls, deserts, canyons, dramatic rock formations, and most other kinds of natural assets that attract photographers and generate coffee-table books. The fertile core of Gascony is inviting but unimposing: a hodgepodge of oddly shaped farm plots, forest remnants, vineyards, oak and hawthorne groves, shrubby hedgerows, irrigation ponds, orchards, grazing pastures, and miles and miles of paved and unpaved farm roads—some 7,000 kilometers of them in all—extending across the Gers like fine capillaries, plus many more miles of foot paths, including a segment of the Chemin de Saint Jacques pilgrimage route.</p>
<p class="int_blsp">And yet, the undulant landscape has a way of getting under your skin. In <i>Les Paysages du Gers</i>—by far the most informative book I’ve found on the département, and one of the most lavishly detailed volumes I’ve read on any subregion of France—the French geographer Bruno Sirven allows that the Gers often inspires its chroniclers to rhetorical excess (a tendency to which he himself falls prey):</p>
<p class="ext"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130" title="130"/>Many an author has praised the qualities exuded by the countryside of this beguiling and convivial province, whose aesthetic raptures are numerous . . . and where the sensuality of the land’s contours inflames erotic metaphors, attributing to this carnal terrain an unconditionally feminine soul: rumps, buttocks, breasts, friendly hillocks, intimate valleys.</p>
<p class="int_tpsp">Such associations are strictly in the eye of the beholder, but I’d agree that there is something decidedly sensual about the topography of the Gers. It’s the kind of landscape you want to wrap your arms around.</p>
<p class="indent">The heart of Gascony is one of the finest places I know of for a long walk, especially if you’re of the ilk who enjoy hot running water and a bed after a day of lugging a pack across hill and dale. The Gers may not be very populous, but its villages are spaced close together, and strolling from one to another along the region’s back-roads and hiking trails doesn’t require traversing busy highways or ugly exurbs, as the département is largely devoid of both.</p>
<p class="indent">A couple of millennia of continuous human habitation have seeded the countryside with all manner of interesting man-made things that a car traveler might easily miss: crumbling stone windmills with trees growing out of their foundations; dovecotes that once belonged to grand feudal estates; Roman-era footbridges; moss-covered mission crosses and Virgin Mary shrines, which are remnants of the various religious revivals that came on the heels of the Revolution; grass-covered earthen mounds, called <i>mottes castrales</i>, that served as village fortifications at the dawn of modern times; medieval wash basins; abandoned railroad tracks; wells; hunting blinds; cemeteries—the eye seldom wants for something to gaze at.</p>
<p class="indent">Modernity hasn’t completely passed over the rural reaches of the Gers, but a traveler who happens onto even a substantial village or <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131" title="131"/>bourg is likely to encounter a quaint datedness. In the hotels and restaurants catering to the Gers’s seasonal influx of mostly domestic—and occasionally English and Dutch—tourists, you might find a few Spanish dishes, but generally the specialties are Gascon, served in an ambiance that ranges from frumpy to fussy.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of—and, on occasion, in spite of—that, hiking through the Gers can be a very enjoyable kind of time-travel.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>IT HAD BEEN QUITE A WHILE</small>—twenty years, at least—since I’d backpacked the rural byways of France on my own. As I embarked on a two-day walk from Auch to Condom—a span of thirty-odd miles extending north from the geographical center of Gascony—I fell briefly under the spell of nostalgia. Images from my youthful travels spooled forth like flickering home movies: empty train platforms, cheap hotels, hitched rides, seedy roadside cafés, cigarettes and cheap wine, sore feet and damp clothes.</p>
<p class="indent">At first these recollections were like gauze draped over my eyes, filtering everything through the distorting welter of memory. After a while, though, I started to find my rhythm and tune in to my surroundings. I began to undergo the rejuvenating mental cleansing that comes from putting one foot in front of the other thousands of times. Also, I got reacquainted with the pleasures of solitude—I wouldn’t cross another person on the trail for the entirety of my walk.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele had dropped me off in Castin, a village just outside of Auch, and I had set off in a northerly direction, following the directions in my TopoGuide, which had surely been written by a Gascon: “Follow the lanes that snake. . . . Skew to the right and take the em-pebbled path that traverses a wooded zone. . . . At the place of the lone oak, cleave leftward to a grove of trees and a patch of fallow land.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132" title="132"/>It was fall, and the bright hues of summer had given way to gradations of ocher, beige, and brown, colors rendered more subdued by the weather, which was drizzly. The vistas that unfolded around me were stygian and lovely. Sunflowers that had been flanking the trail—which at present overlapped with a stretch of dirt road—had been recently harvested, leaving behind a strange, stippled landscape. Near the top of a gentle rise, a rain-streaked water tower, probably from the 1950s, came into view, a dour concrete monolith set against bruised clouds. It had four buttresses at the top that looked like fins on the upturned tail of a rocket. A little ways beyond, half-hidden in a grove of trees, sat the rusted hulk of a Peugeot 405. I passed the remains of what might have been a stone farm building, or maybe an old <i>cabane de vigneron</i>. For a stretch, the path descended into a tunnel of dripping bramble, then emerged into a field of tall grass, which was quite pleasurable to walk through, since someone had mowed a wide corridor so that hikers wouldn’t lose their way.</p>
<p class="indent">The village of Lavardens, which rose from a spur of bedrock and boasted what passed in the Gers for a very large château, had been shifting, mirage-like, on the horizon for some time. And now suddenly I was upon it. At the foot of the promontory, I passed an ancient stone lavoir, where, I imagined, peasant women had once washed doublets and pantaloons.</p>
<p class="indent">I ate a picnic lunch in Lavardens, on a bench next to the town hall, and resumed my walk. I needed to get to Castéra-Verduzan, the nearest village down-trail with lodging, before dark. About halfway there, I veered off the path to inspect a crude stone chapel that I’d seen rising from a crinkle in the hillside. It was nothing more than four stone walls and a <i>clocher-mur</i>—the humblest kind of belfry there is, a chevron-shaped extension of the façade with an aperture punched through it, for the church bell. There was no village around the chapel, and, in fact, no other work of man at all, just <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" title="133"/>trees. According to Bruno Sirven—he of the friendly hillocks and intimate valleys—at least 700 isolated <i>chapelles Gasconnes</i> are thought to still exist in the Gers. Many of them were built on the site of an even older place of worship from early-Christian times or before, often where an underground spring—apparently a sign of divine intent—bubbled forth. A soggy laminated printout tacked to the church door by the <i>Fondation du Patrimoine</i> said the edifice had been built in the twelfth century and had doubled as a defensive outpost during times of siege.</p>
<p class="indent">I took off my pack and sat on it, resting my feet for a spell and soaking up the quiet.</p>
<p class="indent">The rain had stopped. I followed a gravel road—no wider than a car’s axle—over a ridge. The ceiling of clouds had risen enough to bring the farther-flung reaches of the landscape into relief. From this vantage, I could see what Sirven had described as the Gers’s “sea of hills,” extending into the beyond.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>THE HÔTEL DES THERMES, THE</small> only of Castéra-Verduzan’s meager lodging options that appeared to be open, was, like a lot of two-star establishments in the Gers, prim and clean but showing its age. It sat at the southern end of the village’s main street, next to a natural-hot-springs spa, for which the town was locally famed. The hotel’s décor was a palimpsest of styles that seemed to start in the 1890s and end in the 1980s. The reception desk was fronted with wainscoted wood panels that had flowers painted on them. The adjacent restaurant was adorned with neon-hued, Leroy Neiman–type prints depicting bullfighters in balletic poses. A Victorian birdcage stood at the dining room’s entrance, two lovebirds flitting about inside. And across from a small bar—which lacked stools, in the eternally vexing French tradition—a lounge area had been furnished with colorful <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134" title="134"/>upholstered cubes that were presumably meant to be sat on. When I checked in, tired and sore from the hike, the disheveled proprietor—perhaps because I was an American and would thus know a little something about the invisible hand of the market—complained at great length and with no prompting about the pay-to-play business of getting listed in France’s major travel and dining guides. He applauded my savvy decision to stay in a place, like his, that <i>wasn’t</i> listed in those publications.</p>
<p class="indent">After getting settled, I walked across the street to the spa. I paid a small fee to a white-clad receptionist in return for a locker key and a very small bathing suit, then spent forty minutes beneath a sparkling glass-topped rotunda in a warm soaking pool, my feet positioned in front of soothing water jets. After that, I returned to the hotel, put on fresh clothes, and proceeded to the lounge. The entirety of my evening plan consisted of a drink followed by dinner at Castéra’s only other notable attraction: Le Florida, the venerated restaurant of Bernard Ramounéda, one of the Ronde des Mousquetaires chefs. I’d read that Ramounéda was rarely at the stoves anymore and that his son, Baptiste, was doing most of the day-to-day running of the place, which Bernard’s grandmother, Angèle, had founded after the war, but I was still curious to try it.</p>
<p class="indent">Presenting myself at the Hôtel des Thermes’s bar, and feeling I had earned something stronger than a watered-down pastis, I ordered a martini. It’s a drink that’s well known in most parts of France, if not well loved—the French generally preferring their strong spirits in the form of a <i>digestif</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">My request caused confusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Receiving silence and a furrowed brow from the shy young woman behind the bar, I described the making of the cocktail, pointing to the gin and dry vermouth that were plainly displayed on a shelf just over her left shoulder.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135" title="135"/>She chewed her lip.</p>
<p class="indent">I told her she could make it on the rocks and simply charge me for a double gin.</p>
<p class="indent">She went over to consult with a colleague who was exiting the dining room. I overheard her say, “Go find Marc.” The second woman sped off.</p>
<p class="indent">A minute later, a pale, thin man in a black vest and bow tie strode into the room and took the girl’s place behind the bar. He tamed a rogue lock of his comb-over and asked, in the most deferential possible tone, what I was having.</p>
<p class="indent">I explained my order again.</p>
<p class="indent">Marc blinked rapidly a few times and sucked his teeth. Then he tapped both hands on the bar in a decisive gesture. He put a few cubes of ice in a tall glass and added a slice of lemon. On top of that he poured just enough gin to wet the ice. I made a twirly “keep going” gesture with my forefinger. He did so, then stopped again. I twirled my finger some more. He poured some more. Now I pointed to the bottle of vermouth and held my thumb and forefinger a hair apart. He followed my instructions and slid the drink over. I took a sip and nodded.</p>
<p class="indent">Marc looked immensely pleased. Tapping the bar again as if he’d just made another bold decision, he pulled down a second glass and made himself a martini, too.</p>
<p class="indent">He produced a bowl of snack crackers and rested an elbow on the bar. “We don’t get too many Americans,” he said. “Mostly Dutch and English, here to take the waters.”</p>
<p class="indent">I told him I’d just enjoyed a <i>détente thermale</i> at the spa.</p>
<p class="indent">“And don’t you feel renewed? Rejuvenated?”</p>
<p class="indent">I did, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">“They are quite miraculous, the waters,” he said. “Famous since Roman times.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136" title="136"/>I ate a cracker.</p>
<p class="indent">“I do hope you’ll spread the word,” said Marc.</p>
<p class="indent">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="indent">He topped off the snack bowl. “Will you be dining with us this evening?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">I told him that I was thinking of trying Le Florida.</p>
<p class="indent">His face darkened.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s not good?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“You’ll eat quite well there,” Marc said. “But . . .” He slid the bowl aside so he could lean across the bar unimpeded. “Monsieur Ramounéda isn’t well-liked around here.”</p>
<p class="indent">I reached around him for another cracker.</p>
<p class="indent">“He’s an excellent chef,” Marc continued, “but he cut the grass from under our feet.”</p>
<p class="indent">I said I didn’t quite get his meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">Marc elaborated. “He started letting rooms above his restaurant to tourists, stealing our clientele. It was a dishonorable thing to do. We’d had an arrangement for many years.”</p>
<p class="indent">I reflected on this for a moment, then asked whether Ramounéda minded that the Hôtel des Thermes had a restaurant that might attract <i>his</i> clientele.</p>
<p class="indent">Nettled, Marc stood up straight. “It’s not the same! He’s a well-known<i> chef gastronomique</i>. He already has all the customers he needs.”</p>
<p class="indent">I gazed over at the hotel’s still-empty dining room and decided to stick with my original plan. I thanked Marc for the martini.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Avec plaisir</i>,” he said with what I think would qualify as a bow.</p>
<p class="indent">Le Florida, though it was only slightly more crowded than the hotel’s restaurant, was a pleasant surprise. The typical <i>restaurant gastronomique</i> in rural southwestern France is a fusty sanctum with starchy napkins that match the drapes, the kind of place where you can inevitably hear other patrons’ chewing. Le Florida was quiet, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137" title="137"/>certainly, and the napkins were a little scratchy, but the dining room was inviting, with thick roof beams, exposed stone, plenty of windows, and mirrors framed in blond wood. (Michele would have approved.) Jazz emanated from a pair of tiny speakers suspended discreetly from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="indent">I was comfortably ensconced at a corner table, a basket of bread and a half bottle of wine in front of me, and had a nice view of the room. Two Dutch couples occupied a nearby table. I pegged them as international spa-hoppers. Across from them were, to judge from the accent, a man and a woman of more-local provenance, both middle-aged, out for a nice dinner. I could hear no one’s chewing but my own.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the food, it achieved the rare feat, at least for a restaurant in the Gers, of treading the line between stuffy and rusticated. The demitasse of cold white bean purée, which, in an admittedly silly flourish, arrived on a slab of rough-hewn slate, was a kind of homage to the garbure, and was appropriately rich and fortifying, even though there wasn’t much of it. The cumin-spiced octopus salad with pearls of couscous was urbane, but also pleasingly simple. So was the roasted guinea fowl with lacquered skin and wild rice. So was the miniature croustade, a perfectly shrink-rayed version of the ubiquitous Gascon apple tart. Overall, I realized with some amazement, it was a meal one might have been served in a bistro in a hip neighborhood in Paris, except it was much cheaper.</p>
<p class="indent">When I returned to the Hôtel des Thermes, the lobby was dark and empty, save for a spectral-looking Marc, who was placing a cover over the birdcage for the night. I offered a <i>bonsoir</i>, and he responded unsmilingly with another deep nod of the head.</p>
<p class="indent">I was the only guest at breakfast the next morning. My muscles were stiff and my shoulders felt raw where the pack’s straps had rubbed at them, but I was eager to get back on the trail. I <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138" title="138"/>brushed crumbs from my TopoGuide and traced the day’s route with my finger. More strange place names: Jamon, Bidet, Bomit, l’Inquiétude—ancient <i>lieu-dits</i> for even more-ancient settlements—and, at journey’s end, Condom!</p>
<p class="indent">When I got outside, the streetlamps were still on. A soupy fog had descended overnight. After twenty minutes of walking, Castéra and its outskirts had completely disappeared behind me. I was alone again, on a ribbon of pebbly asphalt curving through a mist-shrouded tableau of oak groves and more stubbly fields. My muscles started to loosen up. The trail dipped between hedgerows of broom and honeysuckle. I noticed a perfectly symmetrical spiderweb stretched between two stalks of a thistle-like plant, each strand of silk glistening with dewdrops.</p>
<p class="indent">Soon the path diverged from the road and edged a vast vineyard. I’d entered an Armagnac-making zone known as the Ténarèze. Beyond the vineyard, arching prettily over a low hilltop, was a plum orchard—the fruit destined to become prunes, which Gascons like to soak in Armagnac mixed with sugar syrup and vanilla. Beyond that, more sunflowers, these ones still on the stalk, their heads black and drooping morosely, their seeds waiting to be hulled and pressed. A farmstead came into view on my left. In a garden some distance from the house stood dozens of staked tomato vines, all of them taller than me.</p>
<p class="indent">I was nearing Valence-sur-Baïse, a village that had once been protected by thick stone ramparts. Small sections of the fortifications remained. I realized I’d driven through Valence on an earlier visit to the Gers, on my way to somewhere else, but the village looked completely different to me now as I approached it on foot. I entered the medieval <i>centre ville</i> via a narrow lane that passed underneath a lancet-arched portal known, according to a plaque nearby, as the Hedgehog Gate. The plaque didn’t say why it was called that.</p>
<p class="int_blsp"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139" title="139"/>I had a bite to eat and rejoined the trail. The sun had come out, and soon I was sweating through my shirt. As I pushed on toward Condom, I stopped to snap a photo here and there—a lichen-covered postbox in a deserted hamlet, another chapel with a clocher-mur, a quartet of enormous and very old cypress trees that had outgrown a tiny, walled cemetery. Not far outside Condom, the path took me past a grass airstrip—just a meadow, a wind sock, a mothballed two-seater, and a small building that had been locked up for the season. I peeked inside and could see a couple of café tables and a short counter with a coffee machine and a few bottles on it. Nearby, where the trail crossed a road, a weather-beaten sign was being swallowed by greenery. It had been lovingly hand-lettered—and, to judge from the outdated phone number, not recently:</p>
<p class="chap_sng_f"><b>AÉRODROME</b></p>
<p class="chap_sng_f"><span class="bold_italic">tél: 28-09-06</span></p>
<p class="chap_sng_f"><b>ÉCOLE</b> <span class="sc_bl_ital"><small>DE</small></span> <b>PILOTAGE</b></p>
<p class="chap_sng_f"><span class="bold_italic">il est Formellement Interdit de Pénétrer sur la</span> <b>PISTE</b></p>
<p class="chap_sng_f"><b>pour</b> <span class="bold_italic">les</span> <b>VOLS et visites</b> <span class="bold_italic">des</span> <b>AVIONS</b></p>
<p class="chap_sng_f"><b>S<i>er</i></b> <span class="bold_italic">au</span> <b>BAR</b></p>
<p class="int_tpsp">I was mesmerized by this for some reason. I loved the sign’s calligraphic panache, its quirky lettering and abbreviations, its arbitrary italicization and capitalization, its obliviousness to France’s mania for standardized signage. I loved the way its huffy warning—“it is Strictly Prohibited to Set Foot on the RUNWAY”—gave way in the next breath to an invitation: Inquire about flights at the bar.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>CONDOM, A BOURG OF 7,000</small> souls, is an unlovely place at first glance, long on auto body shops and cheap eateries and short on cozy medieval <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140" title="140"/>charm. Its limited offerings to the leisure traveler include a somewhat high-end restaurant (which accounts for one of the Gers’s three Michelin stars), the vestiges of an old bishopric, a larger-than-life bronze statue of Dumas’s musketeers touching sword tips, and a mid-size cathedral, which has the not-inconsiderable distinction of serving as the venue for the most, and to my knowledge the only, glamorous social event of the year in the Gers: an annual black-tie gala called—yes—the Dîner des Mousquetaires. (It bears mentioning that this gala is thrown by a Gascon fraternal organization whose <i>capitaine</i> is the Duc Aymeri de Montesquiou; readers may recognize the last name as that of D’Artagnan’s mother, whom the duke has claimed, not without controversy, as an ancestor. I had occasion to meet this dignitary at one of the galas; he was very tan and wore a blue sash affixed to his tuxedo with a pin in the shape of a musketeer’s sword.)</p>
<p class="indent">If people outside of Gascony know the humble <i>sous-préfecture</i> of Condom at all, it’s probably because they’ve seen <i>Le Bonheur est Dans le Pré</i>, a hit movie from the ’90s about a middle-aged Parisian who leaves his wife for a beautiful goose farmer from the town. (The erstwhile soccer star Eric Cantona played the girl’s brother, his native Marseille accent passing for a Gascon one.)</p>
<p class="indent">Wander around Condom for a few hours, though, with no particular destination in mind, and a curious kind of beauty reveals itself. It’s not the beauty of very old things restored to grandeur, like that of France’s celebrated churches and châteaux. It is the beauty of moderately old things unaltered from how they’ve always been.</p>
<p class="indent">After arriving in Condom in the middle of the afternoon and checking into a cheap hotel, I explored the streets for a while, filled with a pleasant wistfulness. Here was the very kind of faded provincial bourg I used to stumble on in rural France back in the day. Here was the grubby bar with its foosball table and brown-tobacco <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142" title="142"/><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141" title="141"/>smells, the rusty security gate being noisily cranked down for the night, the narrow commercial streets with their slightly gone-to-seed ’70s vibe and plastic shingle signs advertising mundane services and amenities: C<small>OIFFURE</small> M<small>ESSIEURS</small>, P<small>HILDAR</small> L<small>AINES ET</small> T<small>EXTILES</small>, C<small>HAMBRES</small> T<small>OUT</small> C<small>ONFORT</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">I strolled by the locks of the canal at the edge of town, past an abattoir and a lumberyard, then circled back to the center and ascended the Rue Gambetta. Down a side street, in the window of the local chamber of commerce, someone had installed a display of black-and-white photos of a Dîner des Mousquetaires gala from the 1960s: men with shellacked hair and skinny ties squeezed in at banquet tables crowded with bottles and ashtrays. The last names of certain of the <i>grands hommes</i> in attendance had been written in grease pencil next to their likenesses—“Lapeyre,” “Abeillé,” “Serres,” “Gerbaud,” and, near the image of a young, be-sashed man, “de Montesquiou.”</p>
<p class="indent">Michele picked me up the next morning. I had considered asking her for another day, so I could hang around Condom some more and explore its environs. But when I phoned, she sounded eager for me to come home; there was a mouse problem that needed to be dealt with, and Charlotte had caught a cold.</p>
<p class="indent">Being in a car again felt strange. The countryside hurtling by outside the window was like a sped-up movie of my two-day walk: hill-valley-hill-valley-hill-valley. I could see bits of old-looking structures peeking up from indentations in the landscape, and longed to know what those structures were. But they went by too fast. Before I knew it, we were back in Plaisance.</p>
<p class="indent">In a little over an hour, we’d crossed half the Gers.</p>
