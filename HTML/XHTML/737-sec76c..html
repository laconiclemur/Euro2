<p class="nonindent">The first time I ever had a pan con tomate sandwich was during an all-day date with Félix. He packed two for us—they were the road-trip sandwiches of his childhood—and when I dug into mine hours after we’d left that morning, I was overwhelmed. I decided it was the best sandwich I’d ever had. It holds up well from morning to lunch, with its crusty bread and charcuterie. Of course, it’s really good the second after you assemble it, too.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">MAKE <a href="sec01.xhtml#page22">PAN CON TOMATE</a> THEN SANDWICH</span> 2 pieces with sliced charcuterie, like chorizo or Serrano ham, and then you can add sliced Manchego cheese. It’s a great picnic sandwich or any type of to-go sandwich because it holds up really well.</p>
