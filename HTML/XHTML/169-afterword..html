			<p class="FMTX1">I left France when I was twenty, and I didn’t look back. I wanted to see the world, and I never thought of returning.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">But then France came to me in the person of Marie, who became my wife. Love and the impending birth of our first child brought me back to my homeland. Marie and I have two children now: Tom, born in 2008, and Lily, born in 2011. We also work together: she’s the associate managing director of Frenchie to Go, my new venture down the street. She takes care of everything there so I can be in the kitchen and cook!</p>
			<p class="FMTX">I lost my family when I was a child, and I found I had to rebuild my life somewhere else before bringing it back home. Because this place is definitely my home: the restaurant, which now has two little sisters, Wine Bar and Frenchie to Go; my wife and kids, with our apartment a block away; and my staff. Our little street, the rue du Nil, is now populated with friends and coworkers, suppliers, and customers. This is the community I’ve always dreamt of, a community that shares my love of food and the good life.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">This book started as a small project, and I didn’t realize it would become so meaningful to me. I’m grateful to all my coworkers who were involved, as well as to Djamel, the photographer, who worked in great synergy with us. I am so happy and proud of this English version, which allows me to share my journey and my universe with a whole new community. I hope you too feel my excitement. More than anything, I hope the book will entice you to cook and to explore new flavors.</p>
