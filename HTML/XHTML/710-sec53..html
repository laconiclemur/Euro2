<p class="nonindent">Swapping in olive oil for butter in classic mashed potatoes adds complex fruity notes, particularly if you use oil pressed from Arbequina olives. My favorites are California Olive Ranch’s Arbequina or Miller’s blends, but you should use whatever you like. Lighter than buttery mashed potatoes but just as rich in taste, these potatoes are the perfect base for just about anything from octopus (see <a href="sec21.xhtml#page77">here</a>) to oxtail (see <a href="sec33.xhtml#page112">here</a>).</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes (about 6 large), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PLACE THE POTATOES IN A 4-QUART SAUCEPAN</span> and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to keep a steady boil. Cook until the potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes. When you pierce a potato with a fork, it should break in half.</p>
<p class="indent">Drain well, then return to the pan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring to release some of the moisture, until they look dry, about 1 minute. You’re not trying to color them at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Microwave the cream in a liquid measuring cup until really hot but not boiling, about 1½ minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Pass the potatoes through a food mill or ricer into a large bowl. You could also mash them by hand with a fork or potato masher. The texture won’t be quite as smooth but pretty close.</p>
<p class="indent">Fold the hot cream into the potatoes. Fold in the oil a couple tablespoons at a time. You can’t add it all at once because you need the fat to blend into the potatoes and not separate. Season with 1 teaspoon salt, then taste and add more salt if you’d like. Serve hot.</p>
<p class="nonindent">The potatoes can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. As they chill, they stiffen. When ready to eat, stir them in a saucepan over low heat with a little more cream, olive oil, and salt to return them to their original consistency.</p>
