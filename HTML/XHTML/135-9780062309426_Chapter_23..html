<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y culinary education in Gascony would draw to a close in much the same way it began: with a baptism by duck fat. The moment had finally come to make confit.</p>
<p class="indent">Foie gras and magret may have more widespread cachet, but confit is the true coin of the realm in Gascony, the mother ingredient, the foundation on which the entire cuisine has been built. Confit has survived the rise and fall of monarchies and empires and the vicissitudes of French gastronomy, from Escoffier to Cuisine Minceur. Confit is the purest embodiment of agrarian resourcefulness, a conduit to the foodways of antiquity. It is the soul of Gascon cookery.</p>
<p class="indent">Paula Wolfert, who was seduced by confit during her five-year vision quest in the Southwest of France, surmises that the practice of preserving lightly cured meat in rendered fat may have come <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242" title="242"/>from North Africa, where dried beef and lamb are given a similar treatment, but she acknowledges that it was in Gascony where the technique was perfected. Wolfert devotes lots of superlatives to the subject in her writing. Calling Gascons “the most extreme devotees of this splendid food,” she goes on to declare: “So clearly has it left its stamp on great reaches of the South-West that one could construct an accurate map of culinary boundaries simply by the presence or absence of confit.”</p>
<p class="indent">Duck confit is not deep-fried but, like a good braise, simmered slow and low for hours—usually just in duck fat, but sometimes with the addition of goose and pork fat—and allowed to cool gently before being transferred with its <i>graisse</i> to jars or crocks. Many visitors to Gascony who try duck confit have trouble believing that it was cooked and preserved in deep fat. A nicely aged and properly reheated confit duck leg, with its dark, moist flesh and carapace of crisp skin, is rich but not nearly as fatty and salty as lots of other kinds of preserved meat. Confit has a clean, nutty taste all its own.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Confire</i> means simply “to preserve.” For a long time in Gascony, the preserving was done by laying the simmered pieces of meat along with their cooled cooking fat in an earthenware vessel called a <i>toupin</i>, topping off the meat with more rendered fat, and then tucking the toupin away in a cool, dark place. In a testament to the miraculous preserving qualities of waterfowl fat, duck and goose put up in this manner have been known to keep for as long as a year. Toupins are still in use here and there: André Dubosc and I had lunch at the home of a winegrower whose mother-in-law responded to our impromptu visit by hauling a crock from her cellar, retrieving a couple of duck legs from the soft off-white fat, and crisping them in a skillet for our lunch. Nowadays, though, most home cooks transfer the cooked meat and its fat to jars, which they then seal and sterilize.</p>
<p class="indent">Duck confit is not the kind of dish a typical suburban cook might <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_243" title="243"/>make for a weekend dinner party. For one thing, you have to have lots of rendered fat around. This is no problem in a land inhabited by 25 million ducks, most of them fattened on grain, but it’s a considerably taller order in America, where cooking in animal fat has largely fallen out of favor and you can’t just pop over to the neighbor’s farm for a few jars of the stuff. For another, confit is meant to be made in large quantities—part of the age-old seasonal ritual of provisioning cellars and pantries for the winter.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, when I witnessed Gascon large-scale confit-making for the first time—at Nadine’s house (where else?) on a frigid morning not long before we left Gascony—I felt I’d slipped out of the modern era altogether. And I couldn’t escape the sense that all the grilling, searing, and braising I’d been doing for the better part of the past year had been building up to this moment.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine was all business when Michele and I showed up at her house. There was a lot of confit to make, and little time for pleasantries. Aprons were donned, and we got straight to work. On the long table in her canning room—so cold we could see our breath—the following items had been laid out: an enormous aluminum bowl filled with duck legs, maybe twenty in all; another large aluminum bowl filled with duck wings and necks; one slightly smaller bowl filled with several dozen pinkish-brown goose gizzards, each resembling two ravioli fused together at the edges; and, finally, a couple of three-quart plastic tubs filled to the brim with duck fat that Nadine had accumulated during the year. The gizzards and duck parts had been salted and seasoned with black pepper and thyme the night before. They were ready for their long dip in hot fat.</p>
<p class="indent">To that end, an immense flat-bottomed kettle, three feet wide at the top, had been set over a propane burner. Nadine lit it, then raised an index finger and delivered her confit-making preamble: <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244" title="244"/>“Confit,” she said, “must be built from the bottom up. It must cook gently and slowly. If it cooks too fast, it’s ruined.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine issued our marching orders. I was to add the wings and necks to the kettle and let some of the fat render out from the skin. This, she reiterated, had to be done slowly, over gentle heat. Next I was to tip in a few heaping scoopfuls of the reserved duck fat, enough to nearly cover the duck parts once it melted. Then I was to stir the contents of the kettle gently to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom. The legs would go in a short while later, with more fat. The gizzards would go in last.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele was given the tedious job of scraping tiny stray feathers from the crook of some of the duck legs—a task that, to Nadine’s chagrin, the duck farmer had failed to perform. Michele, who had a lifelong aversion to handling raw fowl, looked unnerved by her assignment.</p>
<p class="indent">After the wings and necks had cooked for twenty minutes or so, I added the legs, along with a baseball-size dollop of reserved fat.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine took the spoon from me and added a slab twice the size of the one I’d just dropped in, scolding me for being too timid. The truth was, I found the sheer quantity of fat Nadine was using to be intimidating. For better or worse, fat was an ingredient that I, like many Americans of my generation, had been taught to use sparingly if at all, and even to regard as something bad or dangerous. So pervasive was the anti-fat dogma in contemporary American food culture that, despite my knowing full well that fat gives flavor and richness, and despite the gustatory rewiring that had resulted from my Gascony experience, I had apparently not extinguished a reflexive squeamishness when faced with cooking with many pounds of fat.</p>
<p class="indent">What’s more, making confit is not pretty.</p>
<p class="indent">As the fat in Nadine’s kettle liquefied, it became turbid, taking <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_245" title="245"/>on a soupy brown tint. The skin and flesh of the duck pieces poking out at the top were covered in a gelatinous sheen. After a while, the thick liquid in the kettle became animated, percolating like a witches’ brew. Enormous bubbles swelled and popped with a wet <i>blorp</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine came over to me while I was stirring. “Beautiful music, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="indent">She told me it was time to add the gizzards. I did so, and then put in a few more slabs of fat, which melted faster than the first ones. I stirred and listened as the music returned: <i>blorp</i>, <i>blorp</i>, <i>blorp.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Just past noon, Jenny came in wearing a pin-striped apron and carrying a bowl of peeled onions and garlic cloves. She gave the bowl to Nadine and shook hands with me and Michele, smiling—we were familiar faces now. Nadine added the garlic and onions to the kettle, asked me to transfer custody of the wooden spoon to Jenny, and announced that it was time for lunch.</p>
<p class="indent">We ate roasted chicken stuffed with baguette ends, rosemary, and garlic. The bread had soaked up the chicken fat and the flavor of the garlic and turned spongy. This humble stuffing—one of the oldest paysan preparations in the book—was as delicious as the bird itself. It felt good to be out of the cold canning cellar, appetites awakened by our morning’s work. We emptied a bottle of Madiran, and Michele and I listened to Nadine talk about the past in her fond and melancholic way.</p>
<p class="indent">When we returned to the arrière cuisine, Jenny was seated dutifully next to the burbling kettle, the wooden spoon held upright on her knee. A fine haze hung in the air, which was infused with the scent of cooked fat. It felt like a scene from another age—and yet one could find a similar picture in homes and on farms all over the Gers at this time of year.</p>
<p class="indent">It was nearly dark outside by the time we’d removed all the meat <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246" title="246"/>from the kettle, strained the cooking fat, and scraped out the gelatinous <i>fond</i> from the bottom of the duck-fat tubs—this Nadine would use to make her beloved graisserons. The duck parts would keep fine in the chilly canning room overnight, and Nadine would start putting them in jars tomorrow. Now she had the makings of months’ worth of meals: The necks would be used for soups and stews, the gizzards for salmis and salads, the wings for garbures, the legs for unexpected company. As for the fat, she could use it again the next time she made confit. Duck fat was the ultimate reusable asset.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine gave us a few duck legs, wrapped in foil, to take home. She expressed frustration that we wouldn’t be sticking around Gascony long enough to wait until the duck’s flavor deepened—confit, she said, doesn’t really come into its own until it’s mellowed for two or three months. Our imminent departure, in fact, seemed to cause Nadine more annoyance than sadness: Before we said good-bye, she rattled off a list of old-time Gascon foods she hadn’t yet taught me how to make: sanguette, alicot, graisserons, rillettes d’oie. In Nadine’s mind, Gascon cuisine was a gospel to be spread for the good of humanity, and she was clearly worried that her chosen emissary was going out into the world less than fully prepared.</p>
<p class="indent">That night I crisped three of the duck legs in the oven for dinner. I’m sure Nadine had been right about them getting better with age, but I can say without reservation it was the best confit I’ve ever had.</p>
