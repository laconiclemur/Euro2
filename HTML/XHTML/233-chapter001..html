<p class="center">Breakfast is easy to love. More than any other meal, it can embrace both sweet and savory; it can be quick and light, or quite substantial. And, if you’d like to prolong this special meal, you can linger while you finish one more cup of coffee. Breakfast also has more specificity to it than any other meal. How you take your coffee is so particular. Or maybe it’s how long you steep your tea, how soft you like your egg yolk, how crisp your bacon. Bread can be sliced thick or thin, toasted, cut in half or in triangles. All these decisions are not just preferences, but a collection of small rituals that define you.</p>
<p class="center1">The following recipes are great for those mornings when you sleep late, or you want to make a weekday special. They are also great for a <em>nuit blanche</em>, because after a long night of fun sometimes breakfast can be your last meal of the day. No matter when you prepare these dishes, take care with the small things too—wrap your warm toast in a cloth napkin, squeeze your own juice, decant your jam into a beautiful little bowl. Your intention really does count.</p>
