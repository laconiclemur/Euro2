			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_9560_1.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Sancerre (Sauvignon Blanc); Jean-Dominique Vacheron</p>
			<p class="RHN1">When fresh greens are scarce in the winter, this is a lovely salad alternative, which combines sweet, salty, smoky, and bitter flavors, brightened by the refreshing taste of mint. You can use tangerines instead of clementines and bresaola instead of speck, as long as you keep the four flavors in balance. </p>
			<p class="RI2">4 clementines</p>
			<p class="RI">12 mint leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">A big handful of bitter greens, such as radicchio, dandelion, arugula, purslane, and/or watercress</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">8 thin slices speck</p>
			<p class="RI">Parmesan shavings</p>
			<p class="RI">Balsamic vinegar</p>
			<p class="RP">Peel the clementines and cut them into ¼-inch-thick wheels. Put them in a bowl and add the mint and greens. Season with the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of fleur de sel, and pepper, and toss gently with your hands. Taste and adjust the seasoning (be careful not to add too much salt, as the speck and Parmesan are salty).</p>
			<p class="RP">Arrange the salad and speck slices on four plates and add some Parmesan shavings, a drizzle of olive oil, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to each one. Serve.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_6081.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc; Shaw &amp; Smith</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This delicious dish is all about contrasts: the black blood sausage versus the pure white burrata, rustic meaty flavors versus the delicate creaminess of the cheese. I like <em>boudin</em> from the Basque country, which has very little fat. For this recipe, use a young very green olive oil, which complements the subtle taste of the burrata. </p>
			<p class="RHN">I fell in love with chutneys when I was working in England, and I make them all the time. The apple chutney will keep in the refrigerator for several months. It can also be served with foie gras, cheese, or charcuterie. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the apple chutney</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 small onion</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">1 pound (450 grams) tart apples, such as Pippin or Granny Smith</p>
			<p class="RI">6 tablespoons (95 ml.) white wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant 3 tablespoons (70 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant 3 tablespoons (70 grams) brown sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">½ teaspoon mustard seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cinnamon stick</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons (50 grams) small raisins</p>
			<p class="RI2">About 14 ounces (600 grams) blood sausage</p>
			<p class="RI">2 burratas (about 8 ounces/225 grams each), halved</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">Extra virgin olive oil (see the headnote)</p>
			<p class="RI">A few leaves of bitter greens, such as endive, radicchio, or dandelion</p>
			<p class="RI">½ Granny Smith apple, cut into ⅓-inch cubes</p>
			<p class="RI">½ lemon </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The apple chutney</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Peel and finely chop the onion.</p>
			<p class="RP">Fill a medium bowl with water and add the lemon juice. Peel, halve, and core the apples, then cut into ½-inch cubes and immediately put them in the lemon water so they don’t oxidize and turn brown. </p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the chopped onion, vinegar, sugars, mustard seeds, and cinnamon in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then lower the heat and simmer until the liquid has reduced to a thin syrup, about 10 minutes. </p>
			<p class="RP">Add the apples and raisins to the syrup and cook over low heat, stirring regularly so the chutney doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan, until the apples are tender, 18 to 20 minutes. </p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the hot chutney into a sterilized jar, seal it, and turn it upside down. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The blood sausage</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut the blood sausage into 1½-inch-long pieces. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the blood sausage and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, until seared and crisp. Drain on paper towels.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Place a burrata half on each plate and season with fleur de sel, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Arrange the blood sausage on top of the burrata, then add a spoonful of apple chutney, some bitter green leaves, and a few fresh apple cubes. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_3110.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Burgundy red (Pinot Noir); Morgon Jean Foillard</p>
			<p class="RHN1">A little stew salad, with Spanish and Portuguese influences in the combination of shellfish and pork. Jerusalem artichokes are one of my favorite root vegetables. They are slightly astringent and go really well with the spicy chorizo and the delicate mussels. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the Jerusalem artichokes</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 pound (500 grams) Jerusalem artichokes</p>
			<p class="RI">3 thyme sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">2 garlic cloves, crushed but not peeled</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the mussels</h4>
			<p class="RI">1½ pounds (680 grams) small mussels</p>
			<p class="RI">2 shallots</p>
			<p class="RI">A 1-inch piece of fresh ginger</p>
			<p class="RI">1 lemongrass stalk</p>
			<p class="RI">2 teaspoons unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">Zest of 1 lemon, removed in strips with a vegetable peeler</p>
			<p class="RI">½ star anise</p>
			<p class="RI">½ teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">½ teaspoon coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon white peppercorns</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant 1 cup (200 ml.) dry white wine</p>
			<p class="RI2">A handful of flat-leaf parsley, dill, and tarragon leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">3½ ounces (100 grams) Spanish chorizo</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">About 3½ ounces (100 grams) baby spinach leaves</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The Jerusalem artichokes</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">Scrub the Jerusalem artichokes with a brush under cold running water; drain well. Combine the artichokes, thyme sprigs, crushed garlic, and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and toss well. </p>
			<p class="RP">Spread the Jerusalem artichokes on a baking sheet and roast, turning once or twice, for 28 to 30 minutes: they should hold their shape but be soft to the touch. Let them cool, then cut lengthwise in half. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The mussels</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Scrub and debeard the mussels. Peel and mince the shallots. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Finely chop the lemongrass. </p>
			<p class="RP">Melt the butter with a drizzle of oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallots, ginger, lemongrass, thyme, lemon zest, star anise, fennel and coriander seeds, and peppercorns and cook over low heat until the shallots soften, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the mussels, cover, and cook until they open, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon (reserve the cooking liquid). Shell the mussels and refrigerate. Strain the cooking liquid and set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Chop the herbs. Dice the chorizo into ¼-inch cubes. </p>
			<p class="RP">Heat a splash of olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet large enough to hold the Jerusalem artichokes in one layer. When the oil is hot, lay the artichokes cut side down in the pan and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Add the chorizo, turn the Jerusalem artichokes, and cook for another minute. Deglaze the pan with the mussel cooking liquid, stirring well, then add the butter, bring to a boil, and boil until the sauce is slightly reduced. Add the chopped herbs, mussels, and a splash of lemon juice and heat through, then taste and add salt and more lemon juice if needed.</p>
			<p class="RP">Remove from the heat, add the spinach leaves, and toss well, then serve immediately.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_7486.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 to 6 servings / Wine pairing: Burgundy red (Pinot Noir); Joseph Roty</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is a simple peasant dish, wonderfully comforting on cold winter nights. In France, pork loin roasts are generally sold with a thicker layer of fat than those in the United States, as you will see in the photo that follows; I’ve also made this with pork belly, which is a little fattier. The acidity of the beet broth and pickled mustard balance the richness of the meat. The extra pickled mustard seeds will keep for weeks; serve alongside a charcuterie platter or use as a condiment in sandwiches.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the pickled mustard seeds</h4>
			<p class="RI">Scant 4 ounces (1¼ cups/125 grams) mustard seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (175 ml.) rice vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (175 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">6 tablespoons (62 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the beet broth</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 cups (500 ml.) beet juice</p>
			<p class="RI">7 tablespoons (100 ml.) apple juice</p>
			<p class="RI">4 teaspoons (20 grams) grated fresh ginger</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (100 grams) green lentils (lentilles du Puy)</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bouquet garni (a few thyme and parsley sprigs and a bay leaf, tied together with kitchen string)</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">3 carrots, preferably 1 each yellow, purple, and orange</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the roast pork</h4>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 boneless pork loin roast, about 2 pounds (1 kg.)</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil (if the pork has very little fat)</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">3 thyme sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">3 rosemary sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI2">Cider vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Raspberry vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bunch chives, chopped</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Crushed black pepper</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The pickled mustard seeds</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine the mustard seeds, vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a medium heavy nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt, then lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the mustard seeds swell and soften slightly; add more water if necessary.</p>
			<p class="RP">Let cool, then refrigerate. (The mustard seeds will keep for up to 2 months.)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The beet broth</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine both the juices and the ginger in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by half, removing the foam regularly. Strain and refrigerate. </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the lentils in a medium saucepan, cover with water by 2 inches, and add the bouquet garni and a drizzle of olive oil. Bring to a simmer and simmer gently until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Season the lentils with salt and set aside. </p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, peel the carrots and cut them into ½-inch cubes. Add them to a saucepan of boiling salted water and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The roast pork</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 350°F. </p>
			<p class="RP">Salt the pork loin generously. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Unless the pork has a thick layer of fat, add a splash of olive oil to the pan and heat it. Add the pork, fat side down, and cook until browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Turn the pork and brown on the second side, about 4 minutes, then brown the remaining 2 sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 135°F on an instant-read thermometer. </p>
			<p class="RP">Take the pan out of the oven and spoon off the fat. Add the butter, herbs, and garlic cloves and heat over high heat until the butter foams, then baste the meat, turning once, for about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a rack and let rest for 15 minutes, then cut into thick slices.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, pour the beet broth into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Add the carrots and heat over low heat for about 5 minutes. Drain the lentils, remove the bouquet garni, add the lentils to the broth, and heat through. Remove from the heat and season the broth with a dash of cider vinegar, another dash of raspberry vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the chopped chives.</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide the broth and vegetables among shallow bowls, then top each with a slice of pork. Spoon over some pickled mustard seeds and finish with a pinch each of fleur de sel and crushed pepper.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_6163.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Sardinian red (Grenache); Gianfranco Manca</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is my take on duck à l’orange. Although very different from the classic dish, it uses similar flavor combinations. Celeriac is one of my favorite vegetables, especially with a splash of lemon. During the winter, I use a lot of citrus fruit to add sparkle to a dish. The candied kumquats provide a fragrant combination of acidity and sweetness. </p>
			<p class="RHN">Magrets are the big, meaty breasts of moulard ducks (which are raised for foie gras); see <a href="sources.xhtml#p137">Sources</a>. Or, if necessary, substitute 4 smaller breasts from Pekin (Long Island) or Muscovy ducks and adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the candied kumquats</h4>
			<p class="RI">7 ounces (200 grams) kumquats</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (120 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant ½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 star anise</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of 1 lemon</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the braised and pureed celeriac</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 celeriac</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ cups (350 ml.) orange juice</p>
			<p class="RI">2 teaspoons unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">2 cups (500 ml.) whole milk, or as needed</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bay leaf</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the port sauce</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 cups (500 ml.) port</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ teaspoon coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">Dash of sherry vinegar</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the duck breasts</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 magrets (Moulard duck breasts), about 1 pound (480 grams) each</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">1 rosemary sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">To finish</h4>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel </p>
			<p class="RI">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">A few dill sprigs</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The candied kumquats</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the kumquats in a medium heavy nonreactive saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil, then drain in a colander and cool under cold water. (This will help remove some bitterness from the fruit.)</p>
			<p class="RP">Halve the kumquats lengthwise and remove the seeds. Put them back in the pan and add the sugar, salt, star anise, and water just to cover. Bring to a simmer and simmer very gently for about 45 minutes, adding a little water if needed to keep the kumquats covered, until the peel is very tender. Remove from the heat and remove the star anise.</p>
			<p class="RP">Using a slotted spoon, transfer the kumquats to a blender, preferably a heavy-duty one. Add some of the poaching syrup and puree, adding more poaching syrup as necessary. Mix in the lemon juice. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The braised celeriac</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Trim the celeriac and peel it. Cut a 1-inch-thick slice from the center of the celeriac and cut it into 6 wedges (see the photo that follows). Reserve the remaining celeriac for the puree. </p>
			<p class="RP">Put the celeriac wedges in a small nonreactive saucepan and add the orange juice, butter, and thyme. Bring just to a simmer and simmer gently for 20 to 25 minutes. Check a wedge with a knife: if the knife goes in effortlessly, it’s done. Set aside in the cooking liquid.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The celeriac puree</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut the remaining celeriac into ½-inch cubes. Put in a medium saucepan and add enough milk to cover, then add the bay leaf and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and simmer gently until the celeriac is very tender, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Using a slotted spoon, transfer the celeriac to a blender and puree, adding a little bit of the cooking liquid if needed. Season to taste with salt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The port sauce</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, combine the port and seeds in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, and boil until reduced to a syrupy consistency, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with a dash of sherry vinegar, strain into a small saucepan, and set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The duck breasts</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Trim the duck breasts, removing the excess fat and the strip of sinew from each one. Score the skin and fat with the tip of a sharp knife in a crisscross design, making sure not to pierce the meat. (This will help the fat to render.) Season with salt only on the skin side. </p>
			<p class="RP">Heat a large skillet over high heat until very hot, then add the breasts skin side down and cook over low heat, carefully removing the melted fat along the way, until the skin is browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the butter, garlic, and herbs and turn up the heat so the butter foams. Season the flesh side with salt and pepper, then turn the breasts over. Cook, basting with the butter and fat, for about 30 seconds for very rare, or about 2 minutes for just rare. Transfer to a rack and let rest for 15 minutes in a warm spot. </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">While the duck rests, reheat the celeriac puree, braised celeriac, and sauce. Once the braised celeriac is warm, remove it from the pan and keep warm, then boil the cooking liquid to reduce it slightly.</p>
			<p class="RP">Spoon some celeriac puree onto each plate in a swirl. Add a spoonful of candied kumquat puree and a wedge of braised celeriac, topped with some of the reduced cooking liquid.</p>
			<p class="RP">Slice the duck breasts and arrange them on the plates. Season each with a pinch of fleur de sel and pepper. Finish with the sauce and the dill sprigs.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_6104.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Banyuls ambré (Grenache); Philippe Gard Coume del Mas</p>
			<p class="RHN1">In the winter, it’s difficult to find any local fruit other than apples and pears in Paris, so I often indulge in exotic flavors, such as mango, pineapple, and passion fruit. Serve the extra passion fruit caramel over ice cream or other desserts.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the passion fruit caramel</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons water</p>
			<p class="RI">Generous 2 tablespoons heavy cream</p>
			<p class="RI">Generous 2 tablespoons unsweetened passion fruit juice</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant 2 tablespoons (25 grams) salted butter</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the candied ginger</h4>
			<p class="RI">3½ ounces (100 grams) fresh ginger</p>
			<p class="RI">1¼ cups (300 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">Scant ½ cup (110 ml.) honey</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the chocolate pots de crème</h4>
			<p class="RI">4½ ounces (125 grams) 65% bittersweet chocolate </p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon (200 ml.) heavy cream </p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (125 ml.) whole milk</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cup (50 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">3 large egg yolks, beaten</p>
			<p class="RI2">12 lychees</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The passion fruit caramel</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine the sugar with the water in a small heavy nonreactive saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring just until the sugar dissolves, then cook, swirling the pan for even cooking, until you have a golden brown caramel. Remove from the heat and add the cream and passion fruit juice (be careful—the hot caramel will spatter) and whisk vigorously. Gradually add the butter, whisking until completely incorporated. Let cool, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The candied ginger</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, peel the ginger and dice it into ⅛-inch cubes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Bring the water and honey to a boil in a small heavy saucepan. Add the ginger and cook over low heat, adding a little water if necessary, until the ginger is translucent and the syrup has reduced to a glaze, about 1½ hours. Stir in the lemon juice, and reserve in the refrigerator. (The ginger will keep for several weeks.) </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The chocolate pots de crème</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">Finely chop the chocolate and put it in a medium bowl. Combine the cream, milk, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour over the chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds to melt it, then stir with a heatproof spatula until smooth. Let cool slightly, then add the egg yolks and stir until smooth. </p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the mixture into four 4-ounce ramekins. Put the ramekins in a baking dish and add enough warm water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 28 to 30 minutes. The pots are done when they are firm to the touch but still jiggle when gently shaken. Remove from the water bath and let cool. (It is best not to put the pots de crème in the refrigerator: set aside at room temperature and serve the same day.)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Peel the lychees and remove the seeds.</p>
			<p class="RP">Put the pots de crème on serving plates and place a tablespoon of caramel, a teaspoon of candied ginger, and some lychees on each one.</p>

			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Sake</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This delicate panna cotta is made with less gelatin than many recipes call for, so be sure to allow enough time for it to set. Infusing the cream with chamomile gives it slight notes of hay, and the panna cotta and citrus fruit soup are an exciting combination, both floral and wild, acidic and sweet. I like to serve this dessert with a good sake. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the panna cotta</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ vanilla bean</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ cups (350 ml.) heavy cream</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon crumbled dried chamomile or chamomile tea</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ sheets (6 grams) gelatin</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons (50 ml.) whole milk</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the citrus soup</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 small grapefruits</p>
			<p class="RI">2 oranges</p>
			<p class="RI">8 kumquats</p>
			<p class="RI">2 clementines</p>
			<p class="RI">½ sheet (2 grams) gelatin</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cinnamon stick</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon honey</p>
			<p class="RI2">Mint leaves</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The panna cotta</h3>
			<p class="RP1">With a small knife, split the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds; reserve the pod and seeds.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the cream, sugar, chamomile, and vanilla seeds and pod in a small nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let infuse for 20 to 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. </p>
			<p class="RP">Meanwhile, put the gelatin in a bowl of cold water and let stand for 10 minutes, or until softened.</p>
			<p class="RP">Drain the gelatin and squeeze out the excess water. Heat the milk in a small saucepan, just until warm, then add the gelatin and stir to dissolve it. Pour the milk into the infused cream and stir well. Pour into four 4-ounce timbale molds (about 2 inches high and 2 inches wide) or 4-ounce ramekins.</p>
			<p class="RP">Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The citrus soup</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Juice 1 of the grapefruits and both oranges; reserve ½ cup of each type of fruit juice.</p>
			<p class="RP">Quarter the kumquats lengthwise and remove the seeds. Place them in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water.</p>
			<p class="RP">With a sharp knife, peel the remaining grapefruit and the clementines, removing the skin and all the bitter white pith. Then cut between the membranes to remove the citrus segments. Combine with the kumquats in a bowl.</p>
			<p class="RP">Put the gelatin sheet in a bowl of cold water and let stand for 10 minutes, or until softened. </p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the orange and grapefruit juice, cinnamon, and honey in a small nonreactive saucepan and heat until warm. Drain the gelatin, squeeze out the excess water, and add to the juice, stirring to dissolve it. Let cool to room temperature. </p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the cooled juice over the fruit segments and refrigerate until chilled.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">To unmold the panna cottas, briefly place each one in hot water, then invert into a shallow bowl. Pour the citrus soup around (discard the cinnamon stick) and garnish with mint leaves.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_5801.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">8 to 10 servings / Wine pairing: Moscato d’Asti (Muscat); Ca d’Gal</p>
			<p class="RHN1">I’ve always loved cheesecake made in the style of a Bavarian cream (that is, gelatin-based rather than baked): it’s both rich and airy at the same time. Brillat-Savarin is a wonderful triple-crème cheese from Burgundy, named after the first French gastronome. My cheesemonger once told me that a lot of his Eastern European customers were buying Brillat-Savarin to make cheesecake. So I gave it a try and found that the result was a delicious cheesecake, with a definite French touch.</p>
			<p class="RHN">Note that the cheesecake needs to be refrigerated for at least 4 hours before adding the glaze (and then for at least another 30 minutes before serving).</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the cheesecake</h4>
			<p class="RI">6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">About 5½ ounces (150 grams) speculoos, gingersnaps, or cinnamon cookies</p>
			<p class="RI">1 vanilla bean</p>
			<p class="RI">3 sheets (12 grams) gelatin</p>
			<p class="RI">12 ounces (350 grams) Brillat-Savarin cheese (or another triple-crème cheese)</p>
			<p class="RI">1¾ cups (425 ml.) very cold heavy cream</p>
			<p class="RI">3 large eggs</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (140 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons lemon juice</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the passion fruit glaze</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 sheets (8 grams) gelatin</p>
			<p class="RI">2 passion fruit</p>
			<p class="RI">1 cup (250 ml.) unsweetened passion fruit juice</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the mango puree</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 ripe mango</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of 1 lime, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons granulated sugar</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The cheesecake</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat.</p>
			<p class="RP">Crush the cookies into crumbs in a food processor. Add the melted butter and pulse just until incorporated. </p>
			<p class="RP">Put a bottomless 10-inch square mold on a baking sheet lined with a Silpat or parchment paper; or use a 9-inch springform pan. Pour the crumb mixture into the mold and pat it evenly over the bottom. Refrigerate. </p>
			<p class="RP">Split the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds. Put the gelatin in a bowl of cold water and let stand for 10 minutes, or until softened. Carefully remove all the rind from the cheese. Cut the cheese into chunks and set aside to come to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="RP">With an electric mixer, beat the cream until firm peaks form. Refrigerate.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and beat on medium-high speed until pale and tripled in volume. Add the Brillat-Savarin, lemon zest, and vanilla seeds and beat at medium speed until smooth.</p>
			<p class="RP">Warm the lemon juice in a small saucepan. Drain the gelatin, squeeze out the excess water, and add it to the juice, stirring until dissolved. Add to the cheese mixture and beat at high speed until smooth. Delicately fold in the whipped cream with a rubber spatula.</p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the mixture into the mold and smooth the top. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The passion fruit glaze</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the gelatin in a bowl of cold water to soften. Cut the passion fruit in half and spoon out the seeds; drain the seeds well in a strainer. </p>
			<p class="RP">Warm ¼ cup of the passion fruit juice in a small saucepan. Drain the gelatin, squeeze out the excess water, add to the warm juice, and stir to dissolve. Add the rest of the juice and the passion fruit seeds; remove from the heat and let cool. </p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the glaze on top of the cold cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The mango puree</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, peel and pit the mango and cut it into chunks. Put it in a blender or food processor, add the lime juice and sugar, and puree. Refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Run a sharp knife around the sides of the cheesecake mold to loosen the cake and lift off the mold (or remove the sides of the springform pan). Cut into portions, running the knife under very hot water and wiping it dry after each for a clean cut. </p>
			<p class="RP">Spread some mango puree on each plate and top with a slice of the cheesecake.</p>
