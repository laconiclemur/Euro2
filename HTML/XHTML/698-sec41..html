<p class="nonindent">This was Félix’s favorite dish by his mother while growing up, so he asked that I learn to make it once we decided to settle in America. It’s the ideal dish for Asheville, which is a beer mecca. Any lighter pale ale or lager or Kölsch-style beer is nice. Since you need only a can and a half, make sure you choose something you’d like to drink. If you’re not into craft beer or don’t happen to have any at home when you’re craving braised chicken, use dry white wine or sherry instead.</p>
<p class="indent">One of my favorite parts about this dish is that it can be made ahead of time. It’s really easy to put together, but it’s nice to be able to simply reheat it on busy weeknights or just before guests arrive on weekends. If you decide to add the potatoes, this becomes a one-pot meal. Otherwise, serve it with a crusty whole-grain or sourdough loaf.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 whole (3¾-pound) chicken</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup blended oil, plus more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 cups beer, dry</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>white wine, or dry sherry wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong><a href="sec55.xhtml#page169">Patatas Bravas</a> potatoes only, optional</strong></p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">BREAK DOWN THE CHICKEN BY CUTTING IT INTO</span> 10 pieces: 2 wings (wing tips removed), 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, and 4 breast pieces (each breast half cut in half crosswise). You can ask your butcher to do this for you. Season the chicken pieces on all sides with 2 teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat until very hot. The oil should coat the bottom of the pan to a depth of ⅛ inch; add more if needed. Add half of the chicken and cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken.</p>
<p class="indent">Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 5 minutes. Nestle all of the chicken with its juices in the pan in a single snug layer. Pour in the beer, raise the heat to high, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and move the chicken pieces a little bit so they nestle in the sauce a little better.</p>
<p class="indent">Cover and cook until the breast pieces just lose their pinkness. Start checking after 10 minutes, but they may take up to 20 minutes, depending on how thick and large they are. When you pull a breast piece out, you want it to be just cooked. Transfer the breast pieces to a plate. Cover again and continue to simmer the rest of the chicken until very tender. Start checking after 10 minutes, but they may take up to 25 minutes more. When you poke them with a fork, their meat should pull away from the bone easily.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Uncover the skillet, raise the heat to high, and boil the sauce until the acidity of the alcohol has cooked off and the sauce has thickened slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Put the chicken breast pieces and any accumulated juices back in the pan and turn to coat in the sauce and to warm them. Toss in the minced parsley and add the potatoes if you’d like. If you are adding the potatoes, let them rest for a couple of minutes to soak up some of the sauce before serving.</p>
