<p class="tni"><span class="epub-i">Risi</span> (rice dishes) are recipes where the rice, usually long-grain, is cooked separately and drained. It is combined with the other ingredients in the recipe and then served as is, or baked. But in the following recipe the rice is cooked along with the chicken and vegetables.</p>

<p class="y"><span class="epub-sc">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">A beggar’s life is not easy. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of homelessness in Italy also. This recipe, according to legend, was invented by a poor beggar woman in the middle ages who gathered her alms at the end of the day and with her few pennies bought the ingredients for this dish. She used her imagination and lovingly cooked this magnificent supper for her husband and children.</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1 whole 3-pound chicken with innards</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 carrots</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 medium onions, peeled and left whole</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1 large rib celery</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1½ quarts water salted with one tablespoon salt</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">Salt and pepper to taste</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1½ cups long-grain rice</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="rt1">Wash the chicken well in cold water. Dry it and cut all the meat into bite-size pieces. Remove skin and reserve. Wash the carrots, whole onions, and celery, and place in a large saucepan with the water; bring to a boil. Add the chicken skin, the carcass, and innards, and bring to boil again. Lower heat to simmer and cover for one hour. Strain the broth and put into another pan and keep on simmer for later use. Wash the boiled vegetables and mince them. Place them in a saucepan and cook gently in 1 tablespoon butter for two minutes. Add the chicken pieces and brown lightly (about six minutes). Add wine and cook until evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Add rice and, stirring, cook for four minutes. Now begin adding the hot chicken broth, cup by cup, stirring constantly for eighteen minutes until the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Remove from heat, mix in remaining tablespoon butter and grated cheese. Serve immediately. That beggar lady sure did know how to cook!</p>

<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">Green beans, I was told by a pink-faced, slim shepherd who was only 97 years old, were so expensive in Italy a century ago, that they were not often found in the cuisine of the common folk. I met Basilo Paternò on the piazza of Rhogudi, a small mountain village inhabited by a few Grecanici (Greek-speaking) families in the province of Reggio Calabria. There were more sheep and goats than people in the piazza that golden November day. I was invited by Basilo to break bread with him and his 50-year-old wife (his second; he married when Filomena, his 70-year-old first wife, died a year ago). Rosinedda was thrilled that this American priest who could speak their dialect was going to write down her recipe.</span></p>

Stir and cook for three minutes. Add the julienned ham. Add the eggs beaten with the milk, two tablespoons grated cheese, and seasoned with salt and pepper (she used hot pepper flakes). Scramble in skillet until eggs are set but still moist (about three minutes). Set aside. Bring water to boil in large pot. Stir in rice, allow water to return to boil. Cook the rice fifteen minutes. Drain in colander. Pour into mixing bowl, add two eggs, 1 tablespoon butter, one tablespoon grated cheese, and a pinch of nutmeg. Mix well with wooden spoon. Grease a two-quart angel food cake pan with the last tablespoon of butter. Press in all the seasoned rice. Place in oven for five minutes. Remove, let stand five minutes.

My</span> <span class="ntx">compare</span> <span class="epub-i">Sandro La Bozzetta and his wife Clelia traveled to Egypt on an Italian cruise ship. The second day on board they were served this “Malaysian” rice. They loved it. But Clelia, nifty lady that she is, asked to speak to the chef. He was an Italian from the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples. Clelia asked him where did the name of this dish originate. He smiled and said: “I made it up. I thought it sounded exotically oriental.” So, that’s the story.</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1 cup long grain-rice</span></p>

<p class="rt1">Boil rice uncovered in salted water for fifteen minutes. Drain and reserve. Meanwhile, slice the onion thinly. Dice the boiled beef and cut the seeded bell pepper into about one-inch squares. In a large skillet, brown the onion in 4 tablespoons of olive oil on low heat. Remove with slotted spoon. In same oil, brown the meat and remove with slotted spoon. Sauté the pepper squares in same oil for eight minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. Put all the sautéed ingredients in a bowl. In the same skillet, fry the beaten eggs on low heat, beating with a fork until they firm up but are still moist. Pour eggs into a bowl. To the same skillet, add 2 remaining tablespoons of olive oil. As soon as it is hot, add the boiled rice, the cooked onion, beef, bell peppers, and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. On moderate heat, stir to amalgamate all the ingredients. Remove from heat. Let rest for two minutes, then pour into serving dish. Bring to table. This dish is about as Malaysian as Luciano Pavarotti!</p>

Stir three minutes. Add the broth and bring to boil on high heat. At the same time, fry the skinned sausages in a nonstick skillet until well browned all over, at least twelve minutes. Try to keep the sausages whole. Transfer the cooked sausages to the boiling soup. Lower heat to low and simmer for ten minutes. Remove sausages with slotted spoon. Transfer soup into tureen. Sprinkle cheese. Serve in individual soup bowls, topping each with a sausage. <span class="epub-i">Molto buono!</span> (Very good!)</p>
