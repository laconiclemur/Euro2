<p class="C3608">Tapas were originally created by barkeeps to attract customers. They gave away small, salty snacks to keep patrons on their stools sipping away for a few more rounds. From those humble beginnings, tapas have evolved into the sophisticated dishes you have learned to prepare in this book. One thing, however, has not changed: free-flowing drinks and conversation are as intrinsic to the tapas experience as ever.</p>
<p class="C3609">In Spain, ice-cold draft beers enjoy top billing at tapas spots everywhere, but regional preferences abound. Andalusíans opt for nutty manzanilla or fino sherry, while Basques prefer txakoli (pronounced “chalk OH lee”), a crisp, effervescent local white wine. Catalans revere vermouth, but Navarros are partial to <em>potes</em>, two-sip glasses of red wine, perfect for a one-tapa pit-stop. New Yorkers? They like to kick things off with a well-crafted cocktail before tucking in.</p>
<p class="C3609">At Boqueria we honor all these traditions. Our beverage menu winds through all of Spain before jumping across the Pond for a lap around the five New York boroughs, picking up wines, spirits, and regional favorites along the way. There is something for everyone and for every occasion. But sangría, usually reserved in Spain for parties at home, has emerged as our guests’ absolute favorite. Pitchers full of seasonal favorites and house classics paint a rainbow across our dining room every day of the week. For most of our guests, their favorite Boqueria experience always begins with the familiar swoosh of liquid and clink of ice as it fills their first glass.</p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_251">Wine</span></p>
<p class="C3601">A few years back, we had a chance to visit Mallorca with Miguelangel Cerdá, a winemaker most famous for his cult favorite Ànima Negra. He walked us through the fields surrounding a small vineyard and pointed out the different wild herbs that grew among the gnarled, weathered vines. “They are the most fragrant herbs on the island,” he declared, as the wind stirred up his curly hair. Big puffy clouds pushed shadows across the fields, and, from the center of the vineyard, we could see a falcon making lazy circles over the rocky, shrubbed landscape.</p>
<p class="C3677">Miguelangel pointed to the vines and then to a couple of wind-warped apricot trees at the center of the vineyard. “These are the best grapes on the island, and those are the sweetest apricots. They are also the last of each to ripen. Why do you think?” We looked at each other, anxious to get the answer right. “The elevation?” “The sun exposure?” “Something in the soil?”</p>
<p class="C3677">He shook his head. “No. Look around again. Have you ever seen a place so beautiful?” We gazed out past an old stone barn and watched the picturesque landscape in its crumbling descent toward the sea. His voice lowered to a whisper. “The fruit ripens last here because it doesn’t want to leave this beauty. It hangs on as long as it can. It is the sweetest because life here is so good.”</p>
<p class="C3677">Every time we uncork a bottle of Miguelangel’s Ànima Negra, we watch all the beauty of Mallorca spill out into the glasses in front of us. And that magic happens with every wine on our list. They all come from Spain, and each bottle holds a message from its origin. Crisp, white albariño speaks in a sea-salty lilt from Galicia’s green coast. A ripe Catalan cariñena tells its story in the stony aromas and rugged tannins it stole from the craggy slate cliffs and toasty afternoons of Priorat.</p>
<p class="C3677">Spanish tapas taste best with Spanish wine. When choosing a bottle or two for your dinner, there are a few general comparisons with wines from other countries that can make this easier. When it comes to whites, pinot grigio and sauvignon blanc drinkers usually love albariño or verdejo, whereas chardonnay drinkers appreciate white Rioja or garnacha blanca. When looking for a bold red, lovers of cabernet and malbec should choose Priorat or Ribera del Duero, and pinot noir junkies will fall in love with mencia.</p>
<p class="C3677">The best choice of all? Nothing beats a tapas feast with plenty of sparkling cava and red Rioja; both are versatile and delicious and pair well with almost everything.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_131">Watermelon</span> Sangría</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">We threw our tenth anniversary party in the dog days of summer and wanted something special and refreshing to welcome a decade of staff and regulars.</p>
<p class="C3637">Kieran Chavez, our Beverage Director, worked as a server at our first little outpost right when we opened, so who better to come up with something to celebrate? His watermelon sangría was such a hit at the party we put it on all of our menus. Much like Kieran himself, it’s cool and festive, and it packs a punch. Make this refreshing sangría your go-to summer barbeque beverage.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">8 to 10</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes, plus infusing and chilling</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>2½ cups watermelon chunks (from a baby watermelon weighing about 14 ounces), plus more if needed, and wedges for serving</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 bottle (750ml) dry white wine, preferably Garnacha Blanca, unoaked Godello, or Viura</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>8½ fluid ounces good-quality London dry gin, preferably Fords</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4½ fluid ounces lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>5 fluid ounces Basil Syrup (recipe follows)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>pinch of sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Purée the watermelon chunks in a blender on medium speed until completely juiced. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a container, cover, and refrigerate until cold. You should have 1¼ cups juice. If you don’t, purée and strain more watermelon chunks.</p>
<p class="C3636">Mix the watermelon juice, wine, gin, lemon juice, basil syrup, and salt in a large pitcher until the salt has dissolved. Refrigerate if the mixture isn’t very cold. Serve on the same day.</p>
<p class="C3636">When ready to serve, place one watermelon wedge in each serving glass and fill with ice. Stir the sangría well to mix the watermelon juice if it has separated. Divide among the glasses and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>If you wish to prepare the watermelon juice a day ahead, line the strainer with a coffee filter, place the strainer over a bowl, then add the purée; refrigerate overnight. Discard the pulp. The filter paper will prevent the juice from separating and taking on a stale flavor, as it is likely to do if left too long. You may need to use more watermelon chunks in order to get the required amount of juice.</em></p>
<p class="C3633"><strong>Basil Syrup</strong></p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>½ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>7 basil leaves with tender stems</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Bring ½ cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the sugar, stirring until it dissolves, then remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Tear each basil leaf in thirds and add to the syrup with their tender stems. Cover and infuse for 2 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a container, cover, and refrigerate until cold.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_132">Rosé</span> Sangría</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">Pretty in pink, light, and crisp, this rosé potion tiptoes between sweet and tart with both cranberry and pomegranate juices. It may look delicate, but it takes no prisoners. It’s our booziest option with a generous dose of tequila. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Makes</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4¾ cups</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">15 minutes, plus chilling</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>2¼ cups mixed cut fruit, such as slices of plums, other stone fruit, and halved grapes</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 fluid ounce orange liqueur, such as Triple Sec, for marinating</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 bottle (750ml) dry, pale rosé wine, preferably from Rioja, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4½ fluid ounces silver tequila, preferably Cimarron, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3½ fluid ounces cranberry juice, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2½ fluid ounces pomegranate juice, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons <a class="RED" href="13_Drinks.xhtml#id_10">Simple Syrup</a>, or to taste, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Put the fruit in an airtight container. Toss with a little orange liqueur to barely coat the fruit. Cover and refrigerate at least a few hours and up to overnight.</p>
<p class="C3636">Mix the rosé, tequila, cranberry juice, pomegranate juice, and simple syrup in a large pitcher. Taste and add more syrup if desired. Refrigerate if the mixture isn’t very cold. You can chill this mixture until you’re ready to serve, for up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="C3636">When ready to serve, drain the fruit and divide among serving glasses. Top with the chilled sangría and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_133">Red</span> Sangría</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Boqueria is all about feeling like a party. And there’s no better party drink than sangría. Every night, at every location, we ladle out glass after glass for customers at the bar and fill pitcher after pitcher for big groups laughing around the tables.</p>
<p class="C3637">To make our sangría as fresh as a customized cocktail, we macerate the fruit separately in Triple Sec and lemon juice and add it to our citrus wine blend just before serving. (The common practice of letting fruit sit in the red wine mix makes the sangría a little bitter.) Both the macerated fruit and wine mix can chill in the fridge until you’re ready to dole them out, a great make-ahead party drink.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>3½ fluid ounces fresh lemon juice, plus 2 ounces for marinating</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2¾ fluid ounces Triple Sec, or other orange liqueur, plus 2 ounces for marinating</strong></p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>6 fluid ounces London dry gin, preferably Fords, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>8 ounces lemon-lime soda, preferably KAS Limón, chilled</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Put the fruit in an airtight container. Add equal parts lemon juice and orange liqueur to barely cover it. Cover the container and refrigerate overnight.</p>

<p class="C3636">When ready to serve, add the soda to the pitcher and stir once or twice. Drain the fruit and divide among serving glasses. Top with the chilled sangría and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_134">Pineapple</span> Sangría</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">We serve this sangría twice a year. In January, the tropical flavor transports us from Manhattan's chilly avenues to distant warm and sandy beaches. In July and August, the savory mezcal and grilled pineapple punch is the perfect nod to the summer barbeque.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">8–10</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">30 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">30 minutes, plus infusing overnight</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 pineapple</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>oil, for grilling (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>750ml bottle of white wine, such as Viura (white Rioja) or Garnacha Blanca</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>11 fluid ounces pineapple juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>5½ fluid ounces good-quality bourbon whiskey, such as Buffalo Trace</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 fluid ounce mezcal, such as Fidencio classic</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 fluid ounces Velvet Falernum</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1½ fluid ounces fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Peel the pineapple and slice it into ½-inch-thick rings. Brush a grill with a small amount of cooking oil and heat the grill to hot.</p>
<p class="C3636">Place the rings directly on to the grill and grill on both sides until slightly charred with grill marks. Alternatively, use the broiler, first lining it with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone mat. Place the pineapple rings in the broiler for 15 minutes, until they begin to blacken/char on the outside. Remove, and let cool.</p>
<p class="C3636">Cut each pineapple ring in half and half again to make quarters. At this point the core can be easily cut off of each piece.</p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the liquid ingredients in a large container. Add the pineapple wedges, cover and refrigerate. Leave to infuse for at least 10 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p class="C3636">After infusing, remove the fruit and set aside to use as garnish if desired.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_135">Shishito-</span>Infused Margarita</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">Our single most popular cocktail is this spicy margarita. From the moment we created it, it became an immediate—and lasting—hit. Letting shishito peppers steep in tequila for a day gives the drink a pleasant peppery heat. We garnish the glass with a fried shishito to echo the peppery notes in the drink, but you can skip it if you want. Or, you could fry a whole batch of the peppers to nibble on while sipping your icy margarita.</p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>1 Pimiento de Padrón, oil patted off</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Place a thin layer of salt on a saucer. Run the lime wedge against the rim of a glass, then coat the rim with salt. Use a paper towel to wipe out the inside rim so there isn’t too much salt for the drink. The outside rim should still have a light coating.</p>
<p class="C3636">Fill a cocktail shaker with ice to the rim, then add the infused tequila, lime juice, and simple syrup. Cover and shake very well, then strain into the glass. Add ice and garnish with the shishito pepper. Serve immediately.</p>
