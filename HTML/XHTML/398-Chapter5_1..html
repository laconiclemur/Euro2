<p class="intro">Meeting up for coffee and something sweet is one of the most popular Scandinavian pastimes, and we do it several times a day. It allows us to sit down and connect with the people around us, to take a bit of time out and just have a good old chit-chat. Our love of <i>fika</i> means we have a huge array of tasty, staple no-fuss cakes that are not hard to make, but fit perfectly on the kitchen table, ready to slice and share.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_62"/>Blåbärsmuffins</p>
<p class="head1">BLUEBERRY STUDMUFFINS</p>
<p class="intro">At the café, people were always asking for a breakfast option that wasn’t too ‘green’ but also not overly sweet. Our wholesome studmuffins are somewhere between a healthy muffin and those sugary ones you find at many coffee shops.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Combine all the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir together.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mix all the wet ingredients together in another large bowl (apart from the bananas and berries). Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix using a wooden spoon until just combined.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roughly mash the banana and add to the mixture. If using frozen blueberries, fold these in now. Portion out the batter into the muffin cases. If using fresh blueberries, add these to the batter now. Top each muffin with a scattering of porridge oats.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. The baking time will vary depending on the size of the muffins. Cool on a wire rack.</p>

<p class="head1">SAFFRON BUNDT CAKE WITH PEARS</p>
<p class="intro">Across Scandinavia in December you will likely be offered a saffron-flavoured Lucia bun in honour of the Feast of St Lucia. I also make this beautiful, light saffron cake with pears.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">30 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup breadcrumbs</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Dust the greased Bundt or ring pan with the breadcrumbs, tipping out the excess.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Melt the butter and add the milk and ground saffron. Stir to combine and set aside to infuse.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Peel and core the pears and cut into bite-sized chunks. Add a dash of lemon juice, stir and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a mixing bowl, beat the sugar and eggs until thick, light and fluffy using a balloon whisk or a hand-held electric whisk. Mix the remaining dry ingredients together and sift into the egg mixture. Fold in until incorporated. Add the Greek yogurt and saffron-milk mixture and fold gently until completely combined. Pour the cake batter into the prepared Bundt pan. Add the pieces of pear – these will sink down during baking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake for around 30–35 minutes in the preheated oven or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the pan before turning out onto a serving tray. Dust with icing/confectioners’ sugar and serve, sliced, with a good dollop of whipped cream.</p>

<p class="head1">GINGERBREAD CAKE WITH LINGONBERRIES</p>
<p class="intro">This cake is for those days when the wind is blowing outside, the rain smashes against the window and nobody has any intention of leaving the house. I think most Scandinavians love autumn and winter, despite the cold and dark, but I admit that perhaps I love it more than most. The childhood longing for snow and Christmas never left me as I got older and I can think of nothing nicer than spending time with the people I love, at home – ultimate <i>hygge</i>. If you can’t find lingonberries, raspberries or other tart berries also work well with this cake.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">175 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">3 eggs</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup light brown soft sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups plain/all-purpose flour or cake flour</p>

<p class="ingrd">freshly squeezed juice of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lime</p>
<p class="ingrd2">3 x 18-cm/7-inch round cake pans, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8–12</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Melt the butter and set aside to cool a little.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a balloon whisk or a hand-held electric whisk, beat the eggs with the caster/granulated and light brown soft sugar until light and fluffy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl, then sift into the egg mixture and fold in gently. Add the melted, cooled butter and whole milk and fold again until incorporated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Divide the mixture between the three prepared cake pans and bake in the preheated oven for around 15 minutes or until well-risen, golden brown and springy to the touch. A skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean. Turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the icing/frosting, combine the butter, cream cheese and icing/confectioners’ sugar and beat on high speed using a stand mixer or a hand-held electric whisk until smooth. Drain the excess juice from the defrosted lingonberries, reserving a little, then add to the mixture. Beat again until light and fluffy. Add a few drops of the reserved juice at the end to give a pale pink colour to the icing/frosting.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To assemble the cake, place a sponge layer on your serving dish and spread over a layer of icing/frosting. Repeat the process with the second and third layers, reserving a generous layer of icing/frosting for the final layer. Scatter with more lingonberries to decorate.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Tip:</b> If you don’t have three equal-sized pans you can bake this as one cake and then cut into three layers. Adjust the baking time to suit.</p>

<p class="head1">THAT BANANA CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">We’ve been making this banana cake since ScandiKitchen first opened. We wanted to make one that wasn’t like all the others: this one is lighter in colour and feels really indulgent with the sweet, tangy frosting. You can use either <i>filmjölk</i> (a kind of Swedish soured milk) or yogurt in this cake, but the soured milk gives a slightly lighter finish. Both are delicious.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">3 ripe bananas</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingrd">125 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> sticks butter, softened</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Blend the bananas with the lemon juice in a food processor to a purée and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cream together the butter and sugar in a stand mixer (or using a hand-held electric whisk) until very smooth, light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well with each addition.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl and then fold into the batter. Add the banana purée, bit by bit, and fold in. Then gently fold in the yogurt or soured milk until combined.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake in the preheated oven for around 50–55 minutes or until golden brown and springy to the touch. A skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean. The baking time with this cake varies depending on the size of the bananas that have gone in, so keep checking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Turn out the cake and leave to cool on a wire rack. It must be completely cool before adding the topping, so ideally make it several hours in advance.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For the icing/frosting, whisk together the butter, cream cheese, vanilla, lime juice and icing/confectioners’ sugar for several minutes until very smooth and creamy. If it becomes too soft then chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before use.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spread the icing/frosting generously onto the cooled cake and decorate with a small handful of chopped pecan nuts.</p>

<p class="head1">RHUBARB AND CUSTARD CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">Every year when the rhubarb season starts, we make this cake. The custard isn’t really ‘custard’ but a baked pastry cream. Luckily for us, we always have loads of rhubarb at the café. This is because one of our regulars at the café, John, has an allotment nearby where the rhubarb seems to grow faster than he can eat it. We exchange huge amounts of his delicious rhubarb for coffee - and everybody wins. It’s one of my favourite local trade agreements!</p>
<p class="ingrd1">150–200 g/5–7 oz./<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>– 1 cup Pastry Cream (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">First, make the topping. Wash the rhubarb and chop into 2 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch pieces. In a saucepan set over low heat, melt the butter then stir in the caster/granulated sugar and ground cardamom. Add the chopped rhubarb, stir to coat in the butter and stew for 2–3 minutes to start the cooking process, then remove from the heat and set aside to infuse.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the cake, cream together the butter and sugar in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment (or using a hand-held electric whisk) until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit, whisking constantly but stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary. Ensure all the egg is fully incorporated before adding more.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the dry ingredients and sift into the egg mixture. Fold in until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread out evenly. Spread the pastry cream evenly on top of the batter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove the rhubarb from the syrup and scatter over the cake. Reserve the syrup for drizzling over the cake once it’s cooked.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake for about 60 minutes in the preheated oven (lowering the heat if the top gets too dark). A skewer inserted into the middle of the cake should come out clean, however the pastry cream will remain a bit wet. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly before drizzling with leftover rhubarb syrup and cutting into slices to serve.</p>

<p class="noindent1">To make the buttercream filling, gently heat 30 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> cup water with the caster/granulated sugar in a pan until dissolved to make a sugar syrup. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat the butter, egg yolk (if using) and vanilla together on high speed and slowly add the sugar syrup, bit by bit, whisking well with each addition. Continue beating for several minutes until creamy and fluffy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To assemble the cake, cut the sides off the sponge cake to make a neat rectangle. Cut the cake down the middle lengthways and place one piece on a serving tray. Add enough buttercream to cover generously, then place the other half on top.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the chocolate topping, place the cocoa powder and icing/confectioners’ sugar in a bowl. Gradually add tablespoons of hot water, bit by bit, and keep stirring until you get a smooth, sticky and glossy consistency. Add more sugar if it gets too runny, or more water if too dry. Spread neatly on top of the cake using a palette knife and decorate with sprinkles. Slice into squares to serve.</p>
<p class="head2"><a id="page_74"/>How to fika</p>
<p class="intro">If you know any Swedish people or have been to Sweden, you are likely to have encountered the word <i>fika</i>. Swedes love the word and use it both when they speak Swedish and other languages, as it is hard to find another word that conveys exactly the same thing: to meet up for a chat over a drink and a bite of something to eat, usually baked.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The word <i>fika</i> is both a noun and a verb. The name of the action of ‘taking a <i>fika</i>’ and the name of the delicious baked treats themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The word ‘coffee break’ would be the closest translation in English, but this doesn’t always include the social element of a <i>fika</i>. Whether you <i>fika</i> at a café, at work, at someone’s house or just at home, the vital element is that it is done with other people, because engaging in conversation is essential.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Fika</i> is a very casual concept – Scandinavians usually <i>fika</i> with colleagues twice a day in a <i>fika</i> room (most workplaces have these), over a cup of tea or coffee and a bite of something sweet.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The length of a <i>fika</i> break varies – if you’re at work, it might be 10–15 minutes, but if you are in town with friends, it can be several hours. There are also different kinds of <i>fika</i> depending on the occasion. An evening <i>fika</i> with your family is called <i>kvällsfika</i> and may involve savoury food, as well as cake. You can even arrange to have a <i>fika</i> date, which is just like a normal date except casual – you don’t need to invest in a new dress.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is often implied that you need to drink coffee in order to <i>fika</i>, but actually, any non-alcoholic drink is fine. Scandinavians drink more strong coffee than anyone else in the world, so this is perhaps why <i>fika</i> is synonymous with coffee.</p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="img" src="images/C5-F10.jpg"/></p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_75"/><img alt="img" src="images/C5-F11.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">The cinnamon bun is one of the most popular choices of baked goods for a <i>fika</i> – I often say that the smell of a batch of freshly baked buns can stop anyone from remembering what they are supposed to be doing – but any of the baked goods in this book are perfectly suitable, whether biscuits, buns or a slice of fancy cake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is debate on the origin of the word <i>fika</i>, which first became popular in the 1960s – although Swedes have most certainly <i>fika’ed</i> for centuries. One theory is that it simply comes from the French slang word for café, <i>feka</i>. Another theory is that it comes from a dialect word for coffee from the Dalarna region (<i>fäka</i> or <i>fik</i>), first mentioned in a book in 1733. Another possibility is the old Stockholm term for meeting for coffee – <i>fikhäck</i>. Yet another theory is that <i>fika</i> comes from the Swedish military, where cups had the word <i>fic</i> on them. In 2009, Professor Lars-Gunnar Andersson from the University of Gothenburg theorized that it evolved from the word <i>kaffe</i> (or <i>kaffi</i>) without much historic meaning at all. Wherever it comes from, <i>fika</i> is as much part of Swedish culture as ABBA, meatballs and red Dala horses.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In recent years, the concept of <i>fika</i> has become more and more popular outside Sweden, as the coffee revolution has taken hold across the world and we all try to take time out of our busy lives to enjoy the company of others. Since we opened ScandiKitchen, we have seen a huge increase in people choosing to sit down mid- morning for a cinnamon bun and a coffee, and again later on in the afternoon with a slice of cake, sometimes combining this little <i>fika</i> with a casual meeting with colleagues. Fewer people now take coffee to drink on the go. Are we turning a corner and going back to connecting with each other instead of always being in a hurry? I certainly hope so.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_76"/>Kladdkaka</p>
<p class="head1">STICKY WHITE CHOCOLATE CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">Every café in Sweden has a <i>kladdkaka</i> or ‘sticky cake’ on the counter and they outsell the other cakes two to one. It is the same at our place: there is just something about a slightly underbaked, chocolatey mess that just is so intensely alluring. Getting the right baking time may take a few attempts – but the general rule is: if you think it needs a few minutes more, take it out now. Here is a recipe that you can make with your preferred chocolate.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">150 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/5 oz. good-quality white chocolate (or milk/semisweet or dark/bittersweet chocolate) broken into pieces</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1 cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/1 cup plain/all-purpose flour or cake flour</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanila pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingrd">optional toppings (see method)</p>

<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the white chocolate pieces until melted. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat together the eggs and caster/granulated sugar until pale and fluffy in a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk. Sift the dry ingredients into a separate bowl and fold gently into the egg and sugar mixture. Fold in the lemon zest and chocolate-butter until combined.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour into the prepared cake pan and place in the preheated oven immediately. Bake for about 15–17 minutes until the cake is just under-baked. The middle should still be really sticky and only the side should be fully baked. Keep an eye on it, as baking times will vary. If it wobbles, it still needs a little more time in the oven. A skewer inserted 2 cm/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch from the edge should come out clean.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leave the cake to cool in the pan for at least an hour before transferring to a serving plate. If you think you have overbaked it, then remove from tin immediately to stop baking process. Serve the kladdkaka on its own or with one of the toppings below:</p>

<p class="head1">CLOUDBERRY AND WHITE CHOCOLATE CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">The thing with cloudberries is, they are evasive little things. Not only are they near impossible to cultivate, they have a short season and grow in such a way that every time you try and pick them, most burst in your hand. Their flavour is unlike any other berry – tart yet sweet but very subtle when cooked. For me, they are my favourite berry. This is one of those cakes you can whip up in a jiffy and I have used cloudberry jam here, which is the only form most people who don’t live near the Arctic Circle get to taste. Serve with fresh cloudberries if you can find them, or whipped cream mixed with extra cloudberry jam/jelly.</p>

<p class="head1">MAZARIN TART WITH PLUMS AND BLACK PEPPER</p>
<p class="intro">We Scandinavians love mazarin – it’s our version of a frangipane, made using actual marzipan. We also tend to add plain/all-purpose flour to the mixture when we bake it, which results in a lovely cakey finish, one that complements most fruits and berries. Towards October when there isn’t much going on fruit-wise, plums are a good option for baking and prove a welcome break from overdosing on apples. The black pepper gives this tart a nice kick.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">7–8 ripe plums</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 tablespoons caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> batch Sweet Shortcrust Pastry Dough (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAZARIN:</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/5 oz. store-bought marzipan (or see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a> for basic recipe), cubed</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>

<p class="ingrd">crème fraîche or sour cream, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 25-cm/9-inch loose-based flan/tart pan</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8–10</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">First, prepare the fruit. Remove the stones/pits from the plums, cut the fruit into thick slices and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put the caster/granulated sugar into a bowl. Slice open the vanilla pod/bean and remove the seeds with a sharp knife. Add these to the sugar. Grind the mixture with the back of a spoon to lightly crush the seeds and mix the sugar with the vanilla. Next add a good few grinds of black pepper (about 7–8 or to taste). Add the plums to the bowl and mix together gently so that the fruit is coated in the sugar.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the sweet shortcrust pastry. Line the flan/tart pan as neatly as you can with the pastry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the mazarin, mix the together the marzipan and caster/granulated sugar until combined, using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or a wooden spoon, then add the softened butter. Mix again until smooth then add the eggs, one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Sift in the flour and salt and fold into the mixture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spoon out the mazarin onto the pastry base and spread out evenly. Shake the fruit again to ensure all the slices are covered with the vanilla, sugar and pepper mixture. Arrange the plums in a pretty pattern on top of the mazarin.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add a little more black pepper on top and bake in the preheated oven for around 45–50 minutes or until the pastry is nicely browned at the edges and the mazarin has set.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Dust with icing/confectioners’ sugar and serve slices with whipped crème fraîche or sour cream on the side.</p>

<p class="head1">LEMON MOON CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">Around 45 years ago, a big Danish cake producer started making a cake called <i>citronmåne</i> or lemon moon, owing to the crescent shape and yellow colour. It quickly became one of those popular, convenient cakes your mum would pick up at the store when she didn’t have time to bake and the neighbour was due to pop over to discuss the latest gossip. This tangy, beautiful version of the supermarket classic is several degrees more delicious than the plastic-wrapped variety. It has certainly earned its prominent place in our ‘staples’ recipe book at the café.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1 cup caster/granulated sugar</p>

<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 160°C (300°F) Gas 2.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk, cream together the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Grate the marzipan into the mixture, add the seeds from the vanilla pod/bean and mix again. Next add the eggs, one at a time, ensuring you incorporate fully between each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Sift into the cake mixture and fold with a spatula until combined. Add the lemon zest and half the juice and fold again. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a bit more lemon juice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for around 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Turn out the cake onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely before decorating.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the icing/frosting, place the icing/confectioners’ in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tablespoon hot water, mixing in well. Add more lemon juice until you get to the consistency of runny honey: spreadable, but not so liquid that it runs off the cake. Add the lemon zest and vanilla and stir until smooth. If the icing/frosting becomes too runny, add a bit more icing/confectioners’ sugar.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Decorate with chopped almonds if you wish, or make a pattern with a darker coloured icing for a more traditional look.</p>

<p class="head1">SUCCESS CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">Ah, how I love the names of cakes from Norway. <i>Suksess</i> means success, so this cake really does talk itself up a bit and sets expectations high! It does not disappoint. You may wonder where you might have tasted something like this before – the base and topping are very similar to that of the infamous Daim tart available in many supermarkets the world over (and in those big stores that also happen to sell Swedish bookcases). Add melted Daim and extra chocolate on top, and it all falls into place. This cake is wonderfully gluten-free, too.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/2 cups whole almonds</p>
<p class="ingrd">160 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cups icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>

<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F) Gas 3.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roughly grind the almonds in a food processor, leaving a few chunkier pieces in there. Combine the ground almonds with the icing/confectioners’ sugar and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer (or using a hand-held whisk), beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until lightly stiff. Add the ground almond mixture and gently fold in until incorporated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour the mixture into the prepared pans and bake in the preheated oven for around 35–40 minutes or until light brown and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Turn out carefully onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Meanwhile, make the topping. Put the egg yolks, whipping cream and caster/granulated sugar into a saucepan over a low heat. Bring just to the boil, whisking constantly – as soon as you see the first bubble, quickly take the pan off the heat. To check the mixture is thick enough, dip a spoon in it, then run your finger through the back of the spoon; if the line stays, the mixture is ready.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leave the mixture to cool to room temperature. Then slowly beat in the room-temperature butter using a hand-held electric whisk, a little at a time, until you have a nice thick, glossy topping.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spread <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the topping mixture onto the first almond base, add the top layer of almond cake and spread the remaining topping on the top. Decorate with chocolate curls and serve chilled and sliced.</p>

<p class="head1">TOSCA CAKE</p>
<p class="intro">Said to be named after the Puccini opera, the Tosca cake is one of the most well-loved Nordic cakes. It started appearing in Swedish cookbooks in the 1930s, but some say the cake actually has its origins in Norway. Rather than start any cross-border disagreements, let’s just celebrate the cake as a general Nordic triumph – a delicious love story between almonds and buttery caramel. Prepare to be seduced.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/7 oz. marzipan (at least 50% almond content)</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>

<p class="noindent1">Coarsely grate the marzipan into a bowl or stand mixer. Add the icing/confectioners’ sugar and beat well using the whisk attachment or a hand-held electric whisk. Beat in the cooled melted butter. Add the eggs, one by one, ensuring each addition is completely incorporated and scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift togther all the dry ingredients and fold into the mixture until incorporated.

<p class="noindent1">To make the topping, put all the ingredients apart from the almonds in a saucepan over a high heat. Beat with a balloon whisk until the mixture starts to separate from the sides of the pan. (Beat too little and it will not set, beat too much and it will be rock hard, so really keep an eye on it.) As soon as it stops sticking to the sides, remove from the heat, stir in the flaked/slivered almonds and pour over the cake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place the cake under a hot grill/broiler for 5–7 minutes to brown the topping but watch it doesn’t go too dark. Serve warm with pouring cream on the side, if you wish.</p>

<p class="intro">Cloudberries look a bit like plump orange raspberries, but the taste is unlike any other berry on the planet. Because of their short season, most cloudberries are made into jam/jelly – and this is usually the only way most people can get hold of them. We love a New York-style baked cheesecake at the café, but admittedly it is not very Scandinavian. It seemed obvious to combine it with our favourite berry to create this amazing New York-meets-Scandi-style treat.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/7 oz. plain biscuits/cookies (I use malted milk or digestives)</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> stick butter, melted</p>
<p class="ingrd">740 g/4 cups full-fat cream cheese</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</p>

<p class="ingrd1">TOPPING 1:</p>

<p class="ingrd2">a 23-cm/9-inch springform/springclip pan (ideally leak-proof), greased and base lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a large, deep roasting pan</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 12</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Prepare the springform/springclip pan, then wrap foil around the outside to form a leakproof seal. Place the springform/springclip pan in the large, deep roasting pan.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Crush the biscuits/cookies to crumbs (either with a rolling pin or in a food processor) and mix with the melted butter. Press the mixture evenly into the base of the prepared springform/springclip pan.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pulse the cream cheese in the food processor for 30 seconds to break up any lumps, then tip into a mixing bowl. Add the sugar, vanilla and lemon zest and juice and whisk to combine fully. Add the eggs and whisk again until just combined, taking care not to overbeat.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour the mixture onto the biscuit/cookie base. Pour water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the cheesecake pan to form a bain-marie.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake for 45–50 minutes on the middle shelf. The cheesecake is done when it wobbles ever so slightly in the middle. Remove the cheesecake but leave the oven on.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Meanwhile, make topping 1: combine the sour cream, sugar and vanilla then pour over the cheesecake and bake for a further 8–10 minutes. Leave the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door ajar for an hour, then leave to chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a knife or metal spatula, carefully loosen the sides of the cake from the pan, then open the springform/springclip. It is easiest to serve on the actual base, so don’t worry about removing that.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For topping 2, gently heat the jam/jelly mixed with a small splash of water in a saucepan. When warm (not hot), pour over the cake and spread carefully to cover. If you have extra cloudberries, decorate with these too. Leave to cool, then chill again in the refrigerator so the jam can set before serving.</p>
