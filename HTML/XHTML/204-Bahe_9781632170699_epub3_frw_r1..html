<p class="left morespaceabove" id="p1"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">AS SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN</span> and raised in Norway, I am often asked the question, “What’s different about Scandinavian food?” I always give the same answer: “The winter!” There, the days are dark and very cold, so what else is there to do other than eat and drink?</p>
<p class="left indent" id="p2">My fondest childhood memories include my <em>mormor</em> (<em>grandmother</em> in Norwegian), who would cook and bake all winter long. Every fall she and my great-aunt would make jam, chutney, and <em>saft</em> (a drink made from berry concentrate mixed with water). As a matter a fact my entire family had to leave the house for a week while they were preserving the summer harvest so we wouldn’t get in their way. My parents were okay with it, as we all went to Spain and had fun. I still remember returning from our trips to find the house smelling sweet from all the preserving they’d done. Mormor would proudly show me the basement with all the shelves filled up with jars—she called them her “jars of sunshine”—and in the middle of winter she would ask us to go down to the basement and get her a jar of sunshine. I still call raspberry jam that to this day.</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p3">Whether you have Scandinavian heritage or simply an interest in our food and culture, I think you’ll enjoy this book. <em>Scandinavian Gatherings</em> is a lovely collection of recipes and craft projects inspired by Nordic holidays and celebrations. Many of these gatherings evoke memories from my childhood, and they are a fun introduction to the traditions both Melissa and I grew up with. Scandinavian food is simple, easy, and has a deep respect for the ingredients. But you don’t have to have grown up in Scandinavia to enjoy the seasonal celebrations and foods, because now you have Melissa’s book to explore.</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p4">Happy cooking!</p>
