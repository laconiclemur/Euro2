<p>Butter the surface of a large mixing bowl, and transfer the dough to the bowl, making sure to use your fingers or a rubber spatula. Using your fingertips, spread the surface of the dough with a tiny bit more butter, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set the dough aside until it has risen a little bit and is quite soft to the touch, either a couple of hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. Know that brioche, heavy with all of its rich dairy, is a slow riser. Don’t be disheartened if the dough hasn’t doubled in size like most bread doughs. It will be just fine.</p>
<p>Once the dough has relaxed and risen, generously flour your work surface. Break off walnut-size pieces of dough (about 1.5 ounces each) and roll them on the work surface with the palm of your hand to form even balls. You should have 13 pieces.</p>
<p><strong>To make brioche à tête,</strong> thoroughly butter and flour a dozen small, 1½-inch diameter brioche à tête molds.<a href="footnotes.xhtml#fn0002fn" id="fn0002"><sup>*</sup></a> Transfer 12 of the dough balls to each of the prepared molds. Using the tip of your index finger, indent the top of each brioche à tête. Break the thirteenth dough ball into a dozen small pieces and roll them to form little balls. Place one small ball into each indentation.</p>
<p>Drape the formed brioche with a clean kitchen towel and let them have their second and final rise for an hour or two at room temperature. You’re looking for dough that maybe hasn’t quite doubled in size, but has risen a little and taken on some new air, and, most important, appears relaxed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p>Using a pastry brush or your fingertips, brush the top of each brioche à tête with some of the extra beaten egg. At this point you can sprinkle the top with coarse sugar if you’d like. Place the brioche in the oven and bake until beautifully browned, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Let the brioche cool on a wire rack and enjoy just slightly warm or at room temperature with plenty of butter and jam alongside.</p>
<p><strong>To make bomboloni,</strong> transfer the 13 dough balls to a floured baking sheet and cover with a clean kitchen towel for an hour or two. You’re looking for dough that hasn’t quite doubled in size, but has risen a little and taken on some new air, and, most important, appears relaxed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, heat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy pot set over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F, or until a pinch of flour sizzles on contact. Dust the excess flour from the bomboloni and carefully place them, in batches if necessary depending on the size of your pot, in the hot oil. Fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the browned bomboloni to a paper towel–lined plate or tray to drain. Roll in plenty of sugar and serve immediately while hot.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>For a short time, when I worked in Japan, I was assigned to the tempura frying station and was offered a set of extra-long chopsticks. Fortunately for me, I am a quick study. The good thing about frying with chopsticks is that you can keep a safe distance from the hot oil. They also give you better control over turning and removing the food without capturing any excess oil.</em></p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">A tender scone is one of the most perfect vehicles for lots of butter and jam. At Buvette, we serve our scones with plenty of each and present the butter and jam right on the spoons we use to retrieve the condiments. Note that any dried fruit works well in these, I just happen to love currants! Chopped dried cherries or apricots would be especially nice.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 8 SCONES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cup currants</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups unbleached all-purpose white flour</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups whole wheat flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredient"><span class="font1">⅓</span> cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) cold unsalted butter, cubed</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup buttermilk, plus extra for brushing</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup rolled oats</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Place the currants in a small bowl or mug, cover with very hot water, and set them aside to plump.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whisk together the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and, using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture is crumbly and the butter is evenly distributed. Drain the currants and stir them in with a wooden spoon. Stir in the buttermilk, and mix just until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</p>
<p>Dust the countertop with a bit of whole wheat flour and pat the dough into a rectangle that’s an inch tall. At that height, your rectangle will be about 5 inches by 8 inches if you want to be specific, but there’s no need to be that specific—these should be nice and rustic, really. Cut the dough into 8 squares and evenly space them out on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the top of each scone with a bit of buttermilk (incidentally, fingertips make for a great brush) and top each brushed scone with some of the oats.</p>
<p>Bake until the scones are evenly browned and smell buttery and wonderful, about 25 minutes. Serve warm.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-37"/><span class="blue">Carrot Spoon Breads</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This recipe, the ambrosia of carrot cakes, is adapted from <em>The Silver Palate Cookbook,</em> published in 1982. I bake the batter in individual ramekins and serve each with a generous spoonful of crème fraîche, which is actually plunged into the little cakes, hence the name spoon bread.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 8 SPOON BREADS]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">Butter, for greasing ramekins</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for the ramekins</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup vegetable oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="ingredient"><span class="font1">⅓</span> cup drained canned crushed pineapple</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, if sugar isn’t vanilla flavored</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup sugar, scented with spent vanilla pods (see <a href="chapter007d.xhtml#page-241">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ teaspoons baking soda</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ cup raw walnuts, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ cup shredded coconut</p>
<p class="ingredient">Crème fraîche, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 350°F. Thoroughly butter and flour eight 4- to 6-ounce ramekins and set them aside.</p>
<p>Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the carrots. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the carrots, place them in the bowl of a food processor, and blitz until they’re roughly puréed. The mixture should measure <span class="font1">⅔</span> cup. If you have extra, set it aside for another use. In a small bowl, whisk together the carrot purée with the vegetable oil, eggs, pineapple, and vanilla extract, if using, and set the mixture aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sift together the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in a large bowl. Whisk in the wet ingredients and stir in the walnuts and coconut.</p>
<p>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins and place them on a baking sheet, which makes it much easier to transfer them to and from the oven. Bake until the spoon breads are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of one comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let them cool at least 15 minutes (or up to a few hours) before topping each with a generous spoonful of crème fraîche. Once you’ve done that, serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Made with an incredibly simple-to-prepare batter, these fritters are light and crunchy and not too sweet. If you can get your hands on ricotta made from sheep’s or goat’s milk, by all means substitute it. And feel free to try any combination of nuts and dried fruit instead of the pine nuts and currants, or go minimal and leave them out altogether.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES ABOUT 20 FRITTERS]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 cup (½ pound) high-quality whole milk ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large eggs, beaten together</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons currants, soaked in hot water for 5 minutes and drained (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Oil, for frying (corn, peanut, vegetable, canola, or grapeseed oil all work well)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Cinnamon-sugar, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Stir together the</strong> ricotta, flour, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, and eggs, as well as the pine nuts and currants, if using.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, heat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F, or until a pinch of flour sizzles on contact. Using 2 spoons, drop walnut-size spoonfuls of the fritter batter into the hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Do this in batches so that the pot is not crowded, and keep in mind that they will expand while they cook so be sure to keep plenty of room between them.</p>
<p>Transfer the browned fritters to a paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain while you continue frying the remaining batter.</p>
<p>Roll the fritters in plenty of cinnamon-sugar and serve immediately while warm.</p></div>
