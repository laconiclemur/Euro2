<p class="center">I’ve been working off educated guesses for a long time—in and out of the kitchen. This is especially true when it comes to making desserts. I’ve rarely worked in restaurants large enough to have a pastry chef so, even though I’m untrained, I’ve often been my own dessert department.</p>
<p class="center1">I’ve developed a small repertoire of classic desserts that satisfy both my sweet tooth and my love for working with my hands. Beating egg whites for Mousse au Chocolat (<a href="chapter007.xhtml#page-234">here</a>), using just a big bowl and a whisk, or peeling a case of apples for Tarte Tatin (<a href="chapter007f.xhtml#page-243">here</a>) are fulfilling tasks that I’ve come to look forward to. But for the days when I don’t have time to make something so labor-intensive, I’ve come to rely on a handful of remarkably simple desserts that everyone seems to love. And remember, a bowl of ripe seasonal fruit and a spoonful of Nutella is sometimes all you need.</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I had my first flourless chocolate cake in the Marais, in Paris, while I was in college (not) studying history. The slice of cake was served to me unadorned, with a fork stuck in it. If I failed to mention my suburban upbringing, sponsored by Sara Lee and Betty Crocker, let me confirm it here now. Needless to say, I was quite impressed with the cake, and Paris too. This recipe has been in my repertoire for more than twenty-five years and it hasn’t changed.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 8]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, cubed, plus more for the pan</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ pound (12 ounces) semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 large eggs, separated</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 325°F. Generously butter a 9-inch springform pan and set it aside.</p>
<p>Put the butter and chocolate in a bowl set over a small pot of barely simmering water. Stir until completely melted. Set the chocolate mixture aside to cool slightly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, put the egg whites in a large mixing bowl, or into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the wire whip, and whip until they form soft peaks. Add ¾ cup of the sugar to the egg whites and continue whisking until they’re shiny and stiff peaks are just beginning to hold. Set the egg whites aside.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk the remaining ¾ cup sugar with the egg yolks until the mixture is thickened and pale yellow. Whisk in a healthy pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Whisk the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks, one-third at a time, making sure each addition is completely combined before adding the next. Don’t be tempted to add the chocolate all at once—adding it in batches will help regulate the temperature of the egg yolks and keep them smooth and uniform. Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture, being as gentle and careful as possible so as not to lose any of the volume you have worked so hard to create in the egg whites.</p>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until it’s just barely firm to the touch and a paring knife comes out clean when you pierce the cake, about 20 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Note that although the cake will almost inflate and swell with air as it bakes, it will collapse and crack when it cools down. This is a good thing—beautiful, even. And serving with crème fraîche never hurts!</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I have enjoyed hot chocolate while standing in Bar San Calistro, a dive bar in Rome, where it’s served in little water glasses with unsweetened cream, and I’ve had it at Angelina on the Rue de Rivoli in Paris served in monogrammed porcelain cups set on silver trays in a room with frescoed walls. Both are capable of breaking my heart. After roasted chestnuts, hot chocolate topped with whipped cream is one of my favorite parts of winter. At Buvette, bowls of hot chocolate are an after-school tradition, along with chocolate-stained faces.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 cups whole milk</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon cornstarch</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ pound (12 ounces) semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Pour the cream</strong> into a large mixing bowl and whisk until it forms soft peaks. Alternatively, you can do this with an electric mixer, but be careful not to overwhip the cream. Set the whipped cream aside.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk ¼ cup of the cold milk with the cornstarch and set the mixture aside.</p>
<p>Place the remaining 3¾ cups milk in a large saucepan over low heat and warm until bubbles just begin to appear around the edge. Do not let the milk boil!</p>
<p>Add the chocolate and the salt to the warm milk and whisk until the chocolate has completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the reserved cornstarch mixture; this will give the chocolate a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Pour the hot chocolate into mugs and top each serving with a quarter of the whipped cream.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-234"/><span class="violet1"><span class="dotted">Mousse au Chocolat</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Less is often more. Case in point: we offer two desserts at Buvette—this chocolate mousse and Tarte Tatin (<a href="chapter007f.xhtml#page-243">here</a>). But sometimes less is really more, as most customers can’t decide and order both! Try giving new use to old things by serving the mousse in demitasse cups, or by the spoonful topped with crème Chantilly (lightly sweetened whipped cream).</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4 TO 6]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ pound (8 ounces) semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon water</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 large eggs, separated, plus an additional egg white</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons superfine sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">Crème fraîche or lightly sweetened whipped cream, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Put the butter</strong> and chocolate in a stainless-steel bowl along with the spoonful of water and set over a small pot of barely simmering water. Stir until completely melted. Set the chocolate mixture aside to cool slightly.</p>
<p>Whisk the 3 egg yolks together in a large mixing bowl with the salt. Set aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, place the 4 egg whites in a large mixing bowl, or into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the wire whip. Add the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.</p>
<p>Whisk the yolks, one-third at a time, into the chocolate mixture, making sure each addition is completely combined before adding the next. Don’t be tempted to add the egg yolks all at once—adding it in batches will help regulate the temperature of the egg yolks and keep them smooth and uniform.</p>
<p>Next carefully fold the stiff egg whites into the chocolate mixture, being as gentle and careful as possible so as not to lose any of the volume you have worked so hard to create in the egg whites. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days in advance.</p>
<p>Scoop the mousse, which will have become a striking combination of fluffy and dense, into serving bowls and serve with crème fraîche or lightly sweetened whipped cream.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">On Securing Your Bowl</span></h1>
<p class="noindent"><em>When you are whisking anything vigorously (egg whites, for example, or even mayonnaise), it’s helpful to have your bowl nice and secure. My favorite way to do this is to twist a barely damp kitchen towel into a circle underneath the bowl and, voilà, the bowl rests securely in the towel, allowing you to whip and whisk with abandon.</em></p>
