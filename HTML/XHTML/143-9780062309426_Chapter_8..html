<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ot all Gascons are of paysan stock, to be sure. The Gers may be France’s most agricultural district—with a greater percentage of its land given over to farming than any other département—but it’s populated by more than just farmers, winegrowers, and ex–rugby players. In the towns at least, one encounters the same predictable set of livelihoods as in the rest of provincial France: schoolteacher, shop owner, small-time entrepreneur, functionary in a backwater of the French bureaucracy, and so on. What struck me about the Gers was the curious preponderance of people who didn’t fall into the usual categories, who occupied the interesting spaces in between the strata of rural French society, or hovered around its edges.</p>
<p class="indent">One summer morning, a stranger appeared at our door. Stick-thin and in his late fifties or early sixties, he looked decidedly not like a Gascon, and indeed he wasn’t one.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76" title="76"/>In a thick Australian accent and a shy voice, he introduced himself as Alan. He said he and his wife, a native Gersoise named Agnès, lived just across the esplanade and took their apéro outdoors every evening around seven, and we’d be most welcome to join them.</p>
<p class="indent">(This would be an appropriate moment to point out that those seeking anonymity or privacy would be well advised to settle somewhere other than a Gascon village. Laying to rest my early misgivings about being an outsider, the residents of Plaisance, having gotten wind of the American family living in the old mill, proved themselves to be enthusiastic practitioners of the pop-in.)</p>
<p class="indent">We arrived at Alan and Agnès’s at the appointed time to find them sitting on garden chairs in front of their house.</p>
<p class="indent">“Ah, my dears, welcome!” Agnès said in British-accented English, setting down a glass of wine and extending her hand. She wore a broad-brimmed straw hat that forced her to tilt her head back to see her interlocutor. “I’m just having my nightly <i>vin mousseux</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">She reached over and touched Alan’s hand. “Alain, <i>chéri</i>?” She pronounced her husband’s name the French way. “Bring chairs for our new friends, <i>s’il te plaît</i>, and some of the good pâté.”</p>
<p class="indent">Alan retrieved three more garden chairs from the house and invited us to sit. I’d brought a bottle of <i>floc</i>, an Armagnac-spiked aperitif I’d grown fond of; Agnès picked it up. “Ah! From my cousin’s <i>domaine</i>. Alain, be a dear and fetch a corkscrew.” Alan hopped up without a word and went back into the house.</p>
<p class="indent">After Alan had poured drinks, I fielded a series of questions from Agnès about how we’d ended up in Plaisance. She listened to my answers intently, peering at me from under her hat and sucking on a reed-thin cigarette.</p>
<p class="indent">At length, I turned to Alan and asked what he did for a living. He thought this over for some time, as if it were a question that had never before been put to him.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77" title="77"/>“I suppose you could say I’m a reader,” he said at last.</p>
<p class="indent">“Alain <i>devours</i> books,” said Agnès. Alan got up once again and returned with a well-thumbed hardback.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m quite enjoying this one at the moment,” he said. It was an old edition of a travelogue on Italy written in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="indent">“Alain is also a collector,” said Agnès, holding her cigarette an inch or so from her lips. “<i>Chéri</i>, why don’t you show them the house?”</p>
<p class="indent">With that, Alan invited us inside and led us around three floors of dusty, curio-filled rooms, each one accoutred with ashtrays containing the butts of Agnès’s skinny cigarettes. Here and there, Alan paused the tour to tell us quietly about the provenance of a particular item—a working Victrola he’d bought in Melbourne, an antique mantelpiece clock from a <i>brocanteur</i> in the Gers—or to warn us about a loose floorboard.</p>
<p class="indent">When we got back outside, Agnès was refilling our glasses. She asked Alan to find a doll for Charlotte to play with, lit another cigarette, and looked over at me.</p>
<p class="indent">“Being a writer,” she said, waving away some smoke, “you might be interested to know that I’ve written a small book myself. A memoir, you could call it. As yet unpublished.”</p>
<p class="indent">For the next half hour or so, as Charlotte played with the doll and Michele strained to follow along, Agnès proceeded to tell us about her life.</p>
<p class="indent">The account, which was quite riveting, went something like this: Agnès was born Marie-Agnès Pinon, into a local aristocratic family, a daughter of the dwindling <i>petite noblesse</i> that had thrived in Gascony during the ancien régime, studding the countryside of the Gers with small but sturdy châteaux. The one Agnès had grown up in was a drafty old mansion called Château de Sabazan. Agnès described <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78" title="78"/>her youth there as harsh and lonely. Her mother, she said, was a cold patrician who never hugged her children and left parenting to a governess. Largely ignored at home, Agnès sought kindness among the paysans who populated the village outside the château’s walls. As soon as she came of age, she spurned her roots in the nobility and, with the help of a modest inheritance, ran off to Australia. There, she married and had children with a man who turned out to be an alcoholic and also gay. She married again, this time to a Tanzanian, moved to Africa, and had more children, only to discover she was one of several wives, added to the harem because of her money. She returned to Australia, adrift, and became ill. By divine grace she met a shy antique collector named Alan; she married him. With her new husband in tow, she returned to the Gers, reestablished contact with her children, and reunited with her siblings, who had all but given her up for lost. Finally, she reconciled with her mother, who had been forced to sell the château and now resided in the retirement home in Plaisance.</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s quite a story,” I said when she’d finished.</p>
<p class="indent">Agnès sighed and stubbed out her cigarette. “I’ve had my trials, it’s true,” she said. “But that is all behind me now.”</p>
<p class="indent">She smiled at Alan and took his narrow hand in hers. They gazed lovingly at each other.</p>
<p class="indent">We happened upon Agnès and Alan again a few nights later. They were in their usual spot, seated on garden chairs outside the house, wineglasses in hand. This time, though, they had company: an older, white-haired woman in oversize sunglasses, linen capri pants, and blue espadrilles. In one hand the woman clutched a glass of whiskey; in the other was a leash attached to a Westie terrier.</p>
<p class="indent">Agnès looked relieved to see us. “Ah, my dears,” she said, arms outstretched, “how lovely you’re here! And what fine timing. This is my mother, Irène Pinon.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79" title="79"/>I blinked, surprised to see the malevolent character from Agnès’s story seated before me in the flesh.</p>
<p class="indent">The woman gave us the once-over from behind her enormous shades. “Ah, yes, the Americans I’ve been hearing about. <i>Dites-moi</i>, how are you getting on in Monsieur De Rességuier’s old mill?”</p>
<p class="indent">Madame Pinon spoke in a clipped, rapid-fire cadence that I imagined to be a bygone affectation of the Gascon <i>haut monde</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele, whose French was inching toward the conversational level, told her we were settling in fine.</p>
<p class="indent">“You likely already know that the De Rességuiers are a very old aristocratic family,” she said. “Of course, they are <i>noblesse de robe</i>, not of blood. Monsieur De Rességuier’s forebears acquired their title through the purchase of some land, if I’m not mistaken.”</p>
<p class="indent">Henri was a member of the <i>noblesse</i>? Our retired schoolmaster with a flair for weed-wacking? This was news to me. I made a mental note to ask Henri about it. Or did one not inquire about such things?</p>
<p class="indent">Madame Pinon suggested briskly that Charlotte take her dog, named Petite Fleur, for a walk. I got the feeling that this was more to be rid of both the dog and the child than to please either of them. Then she began to gossip with Agnès and Alan about various doings in the village. After a few minutes, I spied a man I recognized as the father of one of Charlotte’s schoolmates walking across the esplanade toward the bridge. Madame Pinon leaned in toward us, discreetly pointing a finger in his direction. “And <i>that one</i>?” she said under her breath. “His marriage is in shambles. Haven’t you heard? The mother is threatening to run away with the children. <i>C’est affreux</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">Agnès and Alan remained mostly quiet, and as Madame Pinon chattered on, I began to contemplate an exit plan. It was getting late.</p>
<p class="indent">Petite Fleur led Charlotte back to the table and was now begging for a cracker. Charlotte popped one into the dog’s mouth, and Agnès’s mother snapped at her. “<i>Ah, non, ça va pas!</i> You mustn’t feed her!”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80" title="80"/>Charlotte looked like she’d just been slapped. I decided that was our cue. We said our good-byes and followed the Rue des Peupliers back home.</p>
<p class="indent">“That old lady was kind of mean,” said Charlotte as we walked up to the house.</p>
<p class="indent">We saw Agnès and Alan only a few times after that—they decamped to Australia for half of each year, and we’d arrived in Plaisance toward the end of their stay. We had them over for drinks a few days before they left. As we were seeing them out, Agnès handed me a hand-stapled booklet the size of a Playbill. It had a grainy Xeroxed photo of a château on the cover.</p>
<p class="indent">“My humble autobiography,” she said, smiling girlishly. “I’d be most eager to hear your thoughts one day.”</p>
<p class="indent">I read the homespun memoir before bed that night. Written in the third person—on a typewriter, from what I could tell—it chronicled Agnès’s travails and triumphs in soaring, dime store–romance style. The tale culminated in the heroine’s return to “her old place, the Gers.”</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>MANY FASCINATING LIVES AND STORIES</small>, in fact, played out behind the façades of Plaisance’s drab <i>centre ville</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, our friend Patrick, who lived on the Rue de l’Adour above an old cinema. You could walk right by his place and not notice it, but inside was a creepily magnificent Art Deco treasure: a vast, tenebrous room littered with torn-out theater seats and dominated by an enormous stage flanked by blood-red curtains.</p>
<p class="indent">Like Alan, Patrick had simply appeared at our door unannounced one morning. I’d been out at the time, but I’d been alerted to the arrival of our unexpected visitor by a phone call from Michele. <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81" title="81"/>“There’s a very good-looking man at our house,” she’d said, sounding as if she were muffling the phone. “He’s invited us for dinner tonight.”</p>
<p class="indent">By the time I got home, Michele was on the balcony, a glass of wine in her hand, laughing and chatting in English with a youngish fellow in jeans and Timberland boots. He was a head taller than me and had an urbane, simpatico air that seemed to have been cultivated a thousand miles from the Gers.</p>
<p class="indent">“I hope you don’t mind me springing an invitation on you like this,” he said, breaking into a luminous smile that was more eyes than teeth. “I figured you might like to meet some people your own age.”</p>
<p class="indent">We were the first to arrive at Patrick’s that night. He served us drinks at a long bar that ran along the edge of the high-ceilinged room, which was lit from above by red spotlights, giving the space a lurid, night-clubby feel.</p>
<p class="indent">Patrick noticed me gawking at the surroundings. “The place hasn’t shown a movie in years,” he said, sliding a pastis to me across the bar, “but I’ve thrown some great parties here.”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked him about the photographs hanging on the walls: dozens of stark black-and-white nudes, both male and female, in various athletic poses.</p>
<p class="indent">“I took those,” Patrick said. He poured himself a drink and then, with a disarming candor that I was beginning to think was a congenital Gascon trait, told us about himself. As he recounted it, his life was lighter on melodrama than Agnès’s but, to me at least, no less interesting.</p>
<p class="indent">Patrick explained how his grandfather, who sounded like a paysan version of Agnès’s icy mother, had, through much sweat and toil, lifted his family from peasant roots into Plaisance’s petite <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82" title="82"/>bourgeoisie. Patrick’s father became a prosperous entrepreneur, running a building-supply business. Like virtually every father in this part of Gascony, he expected his son to play rugby. Patrick didn’t like rugby. He took up photography instead. He didn’t fit in. He got picked on. In a gesture of adolescent indignation, he started calling himself Tripak, which is what a lot of friends call him still. When his schooling was done, he decided he wanted to see the world. He became a flight attendant for Air France. Soon he was traveling to New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, West Africa, South America, taking pictures everywhere he went. But Plaisance never stopped being home. He met a guy named Arnaud. Patrick, by way of coming out to his parents, brought Arnaud home for dinner one night.</p>
<p class="indent">Patrick took a gulp of his drink. “Instead of telling them, ‘Hey, I’m gay!’” he said, “I told them, ‘Hey, I’m in love!’”</p>
<p class="indent">Michele, who had been hanging on Patrick’s every word, asked, “What did they say?”</p>
<p class="indent">“They were okay with that.”</p>
<p class="indent">Patrick’s friends showed up with dishes of food and bottles of wine and beer. They were an artsy, international, and good-looking bunch, and they all knew one another. I felt as if I’d tapped into an undiscovered vein of hipness buried deep beneath Gascony’s hills and valleys.</p>
<p class="indent">A sudden shyness came over me, but it soon abated—everyone seemed genuinely happy to meet us.</p>
<p class="indent">Michele and I started chatting with a chic Englishwoman in red-and-white cowboy boots who restored antique furniture and sold it at her <i>brocante</i> shop in a nearby village. She introduced us to a skinny, shaggy-haired rocker named Tim—another Aussie, as it happened—who’d married a Gersoise, lived in a converted Armagnac distillery, and played in a band. Michele looked ecstatic to be <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83" title="83"/>conversing with a native English speaker about music, and before long she and Tim were talking about groups I’d never heard of. I migrated down the bar and found myself in conversation with a tall, garrulous Belgian in a bright yellow tie. His name was Fred. He said he and his wife, Lut, made meticulous reproductions of medieval and Renaissance leatherwork and sold their pieces to museums, château owners, “and occasionally to rich people with yachts.” Fred seemed to take a twisted pleasure in warning me how cold we’d be in the old mill come winter. “I’ve seen that place. You will suffer, my friend,” he said with a ghoulish shudder. “But don’t worry, our house has central heat and satellite TV. You can take refuge there.”</p>
<p class="indent">Glasses were filled, emptied, and filled again. Charlotte had made friends with Tim’s daughter, a cute, gap-toothed girl named Charlie. The two of them retreated to a corner of the room with Charlotte’s markers and drawing pad. Finally, sometime around nine thirty, we sat down to eat. Patrick had made, of all things, baby back ribs, which we ate with our fingers in the American fashion. This pleased Charlotte immensely. Other dishes got passed around: a saffron-tinged chicken tagine, a tortilla española, an herb-flecked tomato tart, a huge salad. More wine was opened. There was nothing particularly Gascon about the food, except that it was delicious, and offered in ridiculous abundance.</p>
<p class="indent">By the end of the meal, after the cheese and pastries had come and gone, the table was a cluttered mess of dishes and empty bottles. Charlotte and Charlie had joined a couple of other kids in a noisy game that involved jumping off the stage onto an old trampoline, which squeaked gratingly with each landing. Most everyone had broken off into pairs, each deep in conversation. A couple of joints were making their way around the table. Michele had her back to me and was speaking French—amazingly well, from what I could hear, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84" title="84"/>considering the hour and all the wine we’d drunk—with Arnaud, Patrick’s partner.</p>
<p class="indent">I ended up in a tête-à-tête with Tim’s wife, Chloé.</p>
<p class="indent">“Dave,” she said, taking a drag on a cigarette. “How in the world did you end up in the Gers?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I wanted to ask everyone else here the same question,” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">Chloé smiled and gave this some thought. “I suppose some of us sort of crash-landed here,” she said, “maybe hoping to find something, or maybe hoping to get away from something.”</p>
<p class="indent">The trampoline springs squeaked loudly; Charlotte had just made another stage dive. I did my best to ignore the racket and started off on a tangent about my family genealogy. Chloé smoked and listened, smiling beatifically.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually Charlotte and Charlie fell asleep on a threadbare couch at the far end of the room, in an alcove that had once housed the cinema’s ticket kiosk. As the evening drew to a close, Patrick sat down between me and Michele and showed us one of his recent photographic projects: a beefcake calendar featuring players from Plaisance’s rugby team. The team members were going to sell copies of the calendar around town to raise money. The photos looked pretty racy for a publication that would be sold to local grandmas and displayed in the window of the hair salon. May’s page showed the backside of a naked rugby player diving into a lake. Mr. August was a naked rugby player on a Jet Ski, his private parts obscured by the handlebars. December was a group of naked rugby players in a hot tub popping champagne.</p>
<p class="indent">When I pointed out that Patrick had developed an interest in rugby after all, he practically fell over laughing.</p>
<p class="indent">We saw a lot of Patrick after that, and not just at his expat gatherings. It was unusual for me to go into town and not run into him. <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86" title="86"/><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85" title="85"/>More often than not, he was on a photographic mission of one kind or another: scouting locations for next year’s rugby calendar, say, or taking aerial photos of the village using a drone (which eventually ended up in the river). Other villagers, young and old, would frequently stroll over to say hello to Plaisance’s resident artiste and social impresario, inquiring about his latest travels.</p>
