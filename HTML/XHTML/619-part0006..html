<h1 class="heading" id="ch03sec01"><a id="page_64"></a>Grilled vegetable &#8216;caviar&#8217;</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is when baba ganoush decided to invite his friends round to dance the <em>mamushka</em>. I love adding basil and fresh coriander to this (shock, horror, my dear Italian friends!) You have to make sure that the vegetables are properly charred, and doing this over a barbecue would be ideal, but the open flame of the hob or your grill would do the job just fine. Unrefined sunflower oil, powerful in smell and flavour as it is, may be a little bit like Marmite; try it &#8211; it&#8217;s now widely available &#8211; and if you hate it, use rapeseed oil instead. It went out of favour among those who could afford the newly available olive oil in the early Noughties in Ukraine, but now it is enjoying a comeback.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 6 as a dip</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 beef tomatoes</p>
<p class="hang">2 long green peppers</p>
<p class="hang">1 aubergine</p>
<p class="hang">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; small red onion, finely diced</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; tablespoon unrefined sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling (optional)</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon chopped dill</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon chopped basil</p>
<p class="hang">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang1">crusty bread, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the tomatoes, green peppers and aubergine on a barbecue or oil lightly and place under the grill. Cook them, turning occasionally, until the vegetables are well charred and have pretty much collapsed.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Pop the vegetables into a large bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave them to sweat for 10 minutes &#8211; it will then be easier to take the skins off.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Core and deseed the peppers, discarding the stalks. Take off most of the tomato and aubergine skins; if some black bits remain, don&#8217;t worry, as they will add a beautiful smoky flavour. Roughly chop all the grilled vegetables.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Mix the chopped vegetables with the garlic and red onion, then dress with a slither of the oil. Season well with salt and pepper, then stir through the herbs. Serve with some crusty bread.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is my version of a salad that my cousin Ira used to bring to our huge family gatherings. The original had a mayo dressing as far as I remember, and the beetroot was boiled. The dressing should be really garlicky; the edges of the beetroot crispy and intense. Spring onion would make a great substitute or an addition to fresh coriander.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 6 as a side</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1kg (2lb) beetroot, peeled and each sliced into 8 wedges</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) soured cream</p>
<p class="hang">1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="hang">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="hang">25g (1oz) good-quality pitted prunes, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hang">25g (1oz) walnut halves, toasted and halved lengthways</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons fresh coriander leaves</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C/400&#176;F/Gas Mark 6. Toss the beetroot in the oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Place in a roasting tin and bake for 40 minutes or until the beetroot is tender and starts caramelizing at the edges.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix the soured cream, balsamic vinegar and garlic together, season well with salt and pepper and stir. Add a little bit of water if the dressing is too thick.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Serve the beetroot on a platter, drizzled with the dressing and topped with the prunes, walnuts and coriander.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch03sec03"><a id="page_68"></a>Georgian kidney bean salad</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey"><em>Lobio</em> simply means &#8216;beans&#8217; in most of the Caucasus region, and there are thousands of recipes for them including soupy versions and crushed-bean versions. This is my interpretation of a dish documented by William Pokhlebkin, one of my favourite food writers &#8211; the Alan Davidson of Soviet food writing. Even though his books adhere to a dry technical style dictated by the state at the time, his love and admiration for the vast variety of Soviet cuisines manages to shine through and infect with gastronomic wanderlust.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 2</strong></p>
<p class="hang">&#188; teaspoon fenugreek seeds</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon coriander seeds</p>

<p class="hang">2 sprigs of parsley, chopped</p>
<p class="hang">2 sprigs of dill, chopped</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Heat a small, dry frying pan and toast the fenugreek, coriander and fennel seeds until fragrant, then crush them with a pinch of sea salt using a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the sunflower oil in a frying pan. Add the sliced onion and cook over a medium heat, stirring from time to time, for 10&#8211;15 minutes until they are amber and sweet smelling. Add the beans and warm them through.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Mix together the remaining tablespoon of sunflower oil, the vinegar, sugar, crushed spices, all the herbs and salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir this through the warm beans and serve. This is equally beautiful served warm or cold.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch03sec04"><a id="page_71"></a>Armenian beans with a tomato dressing</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My father lived with his uncle and his Armenian wife in Azerbaijan for a year when he was 12. When I asked him what he remembers most from his time in Baku, he said it was green <em>lobi</em> (beans), a mountain of fresh coriander, dill, mint and cress salad leaves adorning the table and women baking the thin sheets of lavash bread in deep turun ovens, which are similar to Indian tandoor ovens. I have found a beautiful man selling these yellow, purple and green runner beans, which he grows on his allotment, but you can use any fresh bean you like.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 2</strong></p>
<p class="hang">300g (10oz) mixed runner beans or French beans, sliced into 2cm (&#189;in) lengths</p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="hang">1 white onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hang">1 beef tomato (skin discarded), roughly grated</p>
<p class="hang">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Put the beans in a saucepan with the measurement water. Place the sliced onion on top, cover the pan with a lid and cook over a medium-low heat for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix the grated tomato with the garlic and season well with salt and pepper. Dress the warm beans and onion with the garlicky tomato pulp and serve warm or cold.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is a very simple Ukrainian starter that we often make and it has become one of my favourite canap&#233; dishes. We also add slices of firm tomato to the filling, but texturally I prefer to use red pepper alone. Make sure the aubergines are really well charred on one side &#8211; it makes all the difference. Serve as a starter or as a side dish with <a href="part0008.xhtml#ch05sec02">Mutton in Coriander</a>.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4 as a starter or a side</strong></p>

<p class="hang">12 sprigs of dill</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Slice each aubergine lengthways into slices 5mm (&#188; inch) thick.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Brush a griddle pan with the sunflower oil and pop the aubergines on in batches. Chargrill them well on each side until lovely deep griddle marks appear and they soften enough to be rolled. You will need to keep brushing your griddle pan with oil if it goes dry.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Mix the soured cream and garlic together in a bowl and season it well with salt and pepper. Brush a thin layer of this over one side of each aubergine slice.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Place 2 strips of pepper and a dill sprig at the bottom end of each slice and roll it up, then serve.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is a really light and flavoursome summer pickle. We used to eat it as salad, but it would also be lovely served as a relish&#8211;simply dice the cucumber instead of slicing it. We don&#8217;t really use the long sort of cucumber in Ukraine. Ours are always stubby and prickly, and despite the general consensus that cucumbers are best eaten refrigerator cold, there is nothing better than picking one off the vine &#8211; still aromatic and warm from the blistering summer sun.</span></p>

<p class="hang1">sourdough bread</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Make the sauce first. Heat the sunflower oil in a heavy-based flameproof casserole dish. Fry half the onion and all the grated carrot over a medium heat for 5&#8211;10 minutes until soft. Add the sugar and the tomato pur&#233;e and cook for 1 minute. Add the bay leaf, tomatoes and measurement water and season well with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Blanch the cabbage leaves for 2 minutes in boiling water, then refresh them in cold water and drain well on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Mix the minced meats, parboiled rice, barberries, if using, seasoning and the remaining diced onion together in a bowl. Place 50g (2oz) of the filling on to each cabbage leaf and fold up into parcels.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Place the parcels on top of the sauce, folded side down, tucking them next to each other snugly so that they don&#8217;t unravel. Cook over a low heat for about 45 minutes or until cooked through.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Serve with the chopped dill, a dollop of soured cream on the side and sourdough bread.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">My mum would start making this salad in April&#8211;May when the first cucumbers would come out. Prickly, gnarled, filling the air with an intense aroma, the smell of Ukrainian cucumbers freshly picked from our allotment will never leave me. The best part was dipping our bread into the remainder of the pastel pink soured cream dressing.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">4 small cucumbers or 1 large</p>
<p class="hang">2 beef tomatoes</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of radishes, sliced</p>
<p class="hang">1 spring onion, sliced</p>
<p class="hang">&#189; bunch of dill, chopped</p>
<p class="hang">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) <em>smetana</em> or natural yogurt, diluted with &#189; tablespoon water</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Slice the cucumbers and tomatoes over the bowl you will serve the salad in. You want to catch the tomato juices that will end up making the dressing so special.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Mix all the vegetables and dill together in the bowl. Season the <em>smetana</em> or yogurt really well with salt and pepper and stir through the salad. By the time you finish the salad there will be a delicious candy-floss pool of <em>smetana</em> or yogurt stained by tomato juices and radishes &#8211; mop it up with some bread.</p>

I remember finding this on the summer kitchen stove &#8211; Mum having made it for our lunch in the morning before going to work. It&#8217;s even better the next day and I like eating it cold. <em>Sous</em> literally means &#8216;sauce&#8217; and I really enjoy dipping bread into it, collecting pieces of melting, slow-cooked courgette.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">4&#8211;6 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) courgettes, sliced</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) plain flour</p>

<p class="hang1">toasted bread, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Heat some of the sunflower oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Toss the courgette slices in the flour, shake the excess off and fry them over a medium heat on both sides until nicely caramelized. Do this in batches, adding some extra oil each time if the pan is looking a bit dry. When done, remove the courgettes on to kitchen paper to absorb the excess oil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Now fry the potatoes in the pan, without flouring them, for about 5 minutes on each side until they begin to colour nicely.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Add the onion and tomato pur&#233;e to the same pan and cook over a medium-low heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes until the onion starts to soften and caramelize ever so slightly. Then lower the heat, add the garlic and cook for another minute.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Place the courgettes back into the pan and add the tomato pulp, measurement water and soured cream and stir gently to combine. Season very well with salt and pepper and bring to the boil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked and the liquid is slightly reduced. Sprinkle with the dill and serve with toasted bread to mop up the juices.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">I cannot rave enough about the quantity and quality of tomatoes in the south of Ukraine. The summers are so hot that the fruit we grow is everything that a perfect tomato should be &#8211; sweet, meaty but also juicy and with that knockout woody smell of the vines. I nearly included five different recipes for <a href="part0009.xhtml#ch06sec06">fermenting tomatoes</a> but then I restrained myself and now you only have two. This cooked tomato recipe is amazing though. I would seek out a little bit of <em>twar&#243;g</em> for this instead of feta and season it to your taste &#8211; it will create a lovely golden crust. Look out for an Eastern European grocery shop, or online food supplier, which will normally sell <em>twar&#243;g</em>, the equivalent of our Ukrainian homemade curd cheese, <em><a href="part0007.xhtml#pg109">Syr</a></em>. Pick whatever herbs you like to mix into it. I imagine basil would be a natural match, but me &#8211; I just can&#8217;t live without dill&#8230;</span></p>

<p class="hang">200g (7oz) Polish <em>twar&#243;g</em> or <em><a href="part0007.xhtml#pg109">Syr</a></em>, or use feta cheese</p>

<p class="hang">1 tablespoon chopped parsley</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C/350&#176;F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Cut the tops off the tomatoes and hollow them out, taking out the core but making sure you keep the tomatoes intact.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Mix the cheese, herbs and seasoning together, then stuff the tomatoes with the mixture.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Use the sunflower oil to lightly oil the bottom of a baking sheet, pop the tomatoes on and bake for 30&#8211;35 minutes or until the tomatoes are soft and the cheese turns golden.</p>
