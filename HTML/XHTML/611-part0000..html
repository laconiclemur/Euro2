<span style="font-size: 150%;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">HISTORY</span><span style="font-size: 140%;font-weight: bold;"> </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">During the last few decades of the 19</span><span style="font-size: 80%;">th</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> century and the early years of the 20</span><span style="font-size: 80%;">th</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">century many thousands of Italians left their native Italy on a quest for a better life </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">in the new world. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Many, with little more than the clothes on their backs, and perhaps a few meager </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">possessions, managed to scrape together enough money to buy boat passage to </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">America&#8230; and with it a ticket to a new life.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Most were poor in material wealth &#8230; but rich in high hopes and enthusiasm &#8230; </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">and all embraced a once in a lifetime sense of adventure! </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Several hundred of those Italian immigrants eventually settled in a little Town of </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">about 20,000 called Olean, nestled in what would later be called the &#8216;Enchanted </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Mountains&#8217; of western NY State about 60 miles south of Buffalo. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">As with most of the many varied ethnic groups immigrating to the US in those </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">days they tended to congregate in one area of the places to which they moved. </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">In Olean it was the &#8216;North End&#8217;.   </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">The &#8216;North End&#8217; was divided into two areas, separated by North Union Street, </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">which was an extension of Olean&#8217;s main thoroughfare.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">The area on the west side of North Union Street was where the Italians </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">congregated, and the other section, to the east, was where the Polish immigrants </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">grouped. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">My dad&#8217;s mother and father came over from an area of Italy near Naples, and </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">were part of the hundreds of couples and families that finally came to the end of </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">their long journey in North Olean. And there they raised a typically large Italian </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">family of seven children </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(five sons and two daughters).</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">My mom&#8217;s folks came from the Palermo area of Sicily, and ended their long </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">sojourn in the little railroad Town or Salamanca, NY &#8230; about 20 miles west of </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Olean. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Like most immigrants, the Italians who ended up in Olean tended to continue to </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">live near one and other, where they could be among familiar circumstances, and </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">together with people of the same religion </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(mostly Catholic)</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> and customs &#8230; and </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">most importantly &#8230; who spoke the same language &#8230; and ate the same foods. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Most of the Italians immigrants of those days were simply hard working people, </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">with the same old world values that are usually found in all immigrant groups that </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">come to America. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">My grandfather immigrated to the United States in 1906, at the age of 19, with </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">only $5 in his pockets. He was simply a &#8216;hard working stiff&#8217; who was just trying to </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">make a new life for his wife and children here in America. One that was better </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">than was possible back in the &#8216;old country&#8217;. </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;"> </span>

<span style="font-size: 140%;font-weight: bold;">I </span><a name="#page4"></a></p>
<p>




<span style="font-size: 120%;">Everyone on the west side of the &#8216;North End&#8217;, as it was called by the locals, </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">spoke Italian, and of course they all cooked traditional Italian dishes that had </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">been handed down from mother to daughter for generations back in Italy. The </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">range of cuisine was quite varied, and came from all of the many regions and </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">areas of Italy. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">When I grew up, during the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s, much of the old traditions and many of </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">the original immigrants were still there &#8230; and very active. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">There was a couple of small &#8216;Mom and Pop Italian Stores&#8217; that handled many of </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">the specialty foods and ingredients that the Italian cooks wanted. I remember one </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">store, Roger&#8217;s Italian Grocery</span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">,</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> on Wayne Street, </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(a main thoroughfare that was </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">essentially the south boundary of the &#8216;North end&#8217;) that would have </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Baccal&#224;</span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(Dried </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">and salted cod &#8230; which</span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;"> I never mustered up enough courage to taste)</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> and big </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">round Romano cheeses and Genoa Salamis hanging in the windows. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">There was also &#8216;The Christopher Columbus Lodge&#8217;, right next to the Fire hall </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">on Union Street, just at the entrance to the &#8216;North End&#8217;. It was a wondrous place </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">to a 10 or 12 year old boy &#8230; where most of the Italian men congregated and </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">hung out.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Many of the Italian men were also excellent cooks and chefs. </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">The Christopher </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Columbus Lodge </span><span style="font-size: 120%;">held monthly banquets where various Italian feasts would be </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">prepared and partaken of in the large hall on the upper floor of the Lodge. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Unfortunately for me, being just a kid, those banquets were only for the men of </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">the Lodge &#8230; but, my father, who, for many years, was the chairman of the </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">banquet committee, would often bring home samples of the delicious Italian </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">dishes that were prepared and served by these excellent Italian male chefs. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">And once a year the Lodge would have a big &#8216;Clam Bake&#8217; and invite the public </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(including kids)</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> so on those occasions I was able to sample some of that great </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">food for myself. I can still remember the delicious taste of one of my favorites &#8230; </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">chicken giblets cooked in spaghetti sauce and served on fresh Italian rolls &#8230; it </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">makes my mouth water just remembering it. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">What fascinating and mystical memories of that place still wander in my mind </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">after all those many years &#8230; and yet they remain just as vivid in my mind&#8217;s </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">recollection vaults as if they only happened yesterday! </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">The young ladies of the Italian families of Olean all learned the old Italian culinary </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">arts and skills from their mothers &#8230; which included many varied recipes </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">conveyed across the ocean from all parts of Italy by their mothers &#8230; who had </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">learned them from their mothers &#8230; and who, in turn, had  learned from their </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">mothers before them &#8230; for countless generation.   </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">As a result, there was a large concentration of outstanding Italian cooks, all at </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">one time in this one small Town in southwestern New York State. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">In those days Olean had so large a collection of really fine Italian restaurants that </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">it rivaled any similar sized City in America for eateries specializing in excellent </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Italian cuisine.</span><span style="font-size: 60%;"> </span>
<span style="font-size: 140%;font-weight: bold;">II </span><a name="#page5"></a></p>
<p>




<span style="font-size: 120%;">During the 1950&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s the Italian ladies of Olean formed an organization </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">called &#8216;Saint Ann&#8217;s Lodge&#8217; &#8230; kind of like a more genteel and refined female </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">oriented equivalent of the </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Christopher Columbus Lodge</span><span style="font-size: 120%;">, but without an </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">exclusively dedicated building of their own. They were more closely associated </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">with St John&#8217;s and St. Joseph&#8217;s churches that were located in the </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">North End</span><span style="font-size: 120%;">. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">As the 20</span><span style="font-size: 80%;">th</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> century progressed after World War II, with ever growing mobility, </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">more and more young Italian descendants moved away from Olean resulting in </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">families becoming increasingly separated by distance&#8230; thus dispersing this </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">concentration of Italian families &#8230; and the recipes for which they were stewards.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Luckily, in the 1970&#8217;s the ladies of Saint Ann&#8217;s Lodge &#8230; excellent Italian cooks </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">all &#8230;  decided to gather up into one volume as many of their exceptional Italian </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">family recipes as possible &#8230; before they were all widely dispersed &#8230; and </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">possibly lost forever.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">So, a concentrated effort was made to assemble, compile and print 191 great </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Italian family recipes </span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(sometimes one of a kind)</span><span style="font-size: 120%;"> that were collected from 55 of the </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">best cooks in the membership of Saint Ann&#8217;s Lodge</span><span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">(one of which was my </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;font-style: italic;">Mom)</span><span style="font-size: 120%;">and put themall into one booklet &#8230; and then to offer that booklet locally &#8230; </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">using the proceeds to fund ongoing scholarships for worthy students from the </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">area &#8230; while at the same time preserving a large piece of the Italian culinary </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">heritage that had been entrusted to these wonderful ladies for safe keeping. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">Thus came into being the original matchless authoritative source from which all </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">of the recipes in this new compilation were taken. </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">The name of that original booklet, so painstakingly and lovingly created by the </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Italian ladies of Saint Ann&#8217;s Lodgeto foreverdocument and preserve their most </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">precious family recipesis: </span>

<span style="font-size: 120%;">I&#8217;m sure that some of the recipes taken from that original booklet that are now </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">contained within the revised and updated work that you are now about to start </span>
<span style="font-size: 120%;">reading will be readily recognized &#8230; however, there are also many others which </span>

<span style="font-size: 150%;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">#106</span><span style="font-size: 150%;font-weight: bold;"> - PASTA </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Pasta is a general term for pastes made from wheat flour, which are rolled or strained </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">very thin and dried into various familiar forms of spaghetti, noodles, and macaroni, etc. </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.24000244em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Pastais usually considered easy to prepare; but there two &#8216;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">tricks</span><span style="font-style: italic;">&#8217; you should know.  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.25200194em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">trick</span><span style="font-style: italic;">is to add enough water so you can best attain the desired level of tenderness.  </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Never use less than 5 qts. of water with 2 tbsp. of salt per pound of pasta.  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.25200194em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And let the water boil briskly for about 2 minutes before adding the pasta.  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.23999634em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If short lengths of spaghetti or macaroni are desired, break the strands before you add </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">them to the water.  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.25499877em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Be careful</span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">NOT</span><span style="font-style: italic;">to overcook pasta so that it becomes mushy. It should be slightly chewy </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(al dente).  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.2519989em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Macaroni usually takes longer to cook than spaghetti, depending on its size and </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">thickness. A general guide to cooking time is as follows:  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.2519989em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Spaghetti: 9 to 15 minutes. </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Spaghettini: 8 to 12 minutes. </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Macaroni: 10 to 18minutes. </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Noodles: 8 to 18minutes. </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.24199829em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cooking time varies with brands &#8230; and especially with your desired level of al dente.  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.24000244em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The best thing to do of course is to cook it according to your own taste.  </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.2519989em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The second </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">trick</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> to be able to have unsurpassed tasting Pasta is to </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">ALWAYS</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> test the </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Pasta for doneness in order to get it to the perfectdesired al dente firmness. </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.2519989em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A foolproof tried and true method that never fails to get it just the way you want it is to </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">take out a piece with a fork just before the estimated time for it to be done and bite into it. </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.23999634em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When the desired level of al dente is achievedremove the pot from the heat, and drain. </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 0.24000244em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If you are as particular about the level of el dente as I am, you can keep it fromcontinuing </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">to cook after it is removed from the heat by first running cold water over it to stop the </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">cooking, and then running hot water over it to bring it back up serving temperature. </span>

</p><p style="margin-top: 1.523999em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">St. Joseph is the patron saint of the family. It is said that the family that prays and eats  </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">together stays together. On March 19th, in Sicily it is an occasion for feasting. The  </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">wealthier villagers set tables, either in their homes, or in the public piazza of the town. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">All of the poorer neighbors are invited to the feast. The food is blessed by the priest and </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">prayers of Thanksgiving are offered to St. Joseph and then everyone partakes of the </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">cornucopia of food set before them. The tables are loaded down with dishes of fish, meat, </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">pasta with sardine and fennel, vegetables, legumes, cookies and special cream puffs </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">called ZEPPOLE or SFINGE DE SAN GIUSEPPE. This is also a popular practice with some </span>
