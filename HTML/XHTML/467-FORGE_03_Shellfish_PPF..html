			<p class="QuotePara">“Close your eyes and think of the beach. What I see is blue water, what I feel is the sand, and what I smell are the flavors of the sea. Delicate and briny, perhaps a little sweet, the options and varieties are endless. Each oyster or clam is unlike any other, bearing a distinct flavor and smell that brings you back to the place where it was harvested. From popping open a raw oyster, to steaming a lobster, to making chowders and stews or having a clambake on the beach, no other raw food product can be so rewarding when prepared simply and correctly.”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">This chowder was born in the <span class="ital">Next Iron Chef</span> finale, the theme of which was Thanksgiving. Olde Salt clams, native to Virginia, are grown off the shores of the beautiful Chincoteague Island. The clams are very briny and salty, making them perfect for chowder where their qualities don’t disappear but, instead, shine.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I made a version of this dish while competing on an episode of <span class="ital">Chopped All-Stars</span>. For the appetizer round, each of us received a basket, and when I opened mine, there was a small bucket of live crayfish. Believe it or not, I had never cooked with crayfish before. But those crayfish looked like little lobsters, so I treated them as such.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">With only twenty minutes to make a dish, I pulled off a bisque start to finish in the time that it might normally take just to prep the ingredients! On the show, I had to incorporate the beef tendon that was also in the basket, but when I made this dish at the restaurant, I decided to use bone marrow instead.</p>

			</ul>
			
			
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Bone Marrow Crackers</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Soak the marrow bones in a bowl of cold water for 1 hour; drain. Using your thumb, push the marrow out of the bones. Return the marrow to the bowl and add enough fresh water to cover. Refrigerate for 12 hours, changing the water every 3 hours. Remove the marrow from the water and pat dry.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and Amber until combined. Set the panko in another bowl. Cut each marrow piece into 4 equal slices. Coat the marrow slices in the flour, dip them in the beaten eggs, and then dip them in the panko. Repeat process a second time. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page117">Make the Morels</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Separate the morel caps from the stems (reserve the stems for the Crayfish Bisque, below; you will need 1 cup). Slice the caps into ¼-inch rings.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the mushrooms in one even layer (you may need to do this in batches) and reduce the heat to medium. Once the mushrooms release their liquid and begin to brown, add the butter and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms and butter are nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt, and add the sherry (it will flame up, so stand back). Deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Add the thyme and bay leaf, and reduce until the pan is dry. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Crayfish Bisque</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the crayfish in the boiling water for 2 minutes. Immediately transfer the crayfish to an ice bath and allow them to cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Remove the tails from the bodies and extract the meat. Devein the tails and refrigerate, covered, until needed.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the crayfish bodies to the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and let the crayfish get a nice initial sear, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, crush the bodies and cook them for about 5 minutes. Add the reserved morel stems, leek, and shallot. Using a wooden spoon, stir to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute. Add the sherry and reduce until the pan is dry. Add the Lobster Stock and reduce the liquid by about half, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the Veal Stock and reduce the liquid by about one-third, about 10 minutes. Add the cream and bring the bisque to a simmer. Gently simmer the bisque for about 5 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Strain the bisque through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and add the ramps. Wrap the bowl tightly in plastic wrap and let it sit for 1 hour. The accumulating moisture inside the container will make it look like it is raining. This process will infuse the bisque with the ramp flavor. Strain the bisque again, season to taste with salt, and set aside until needed.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Transfer the bisque back to the pot, set it over medium heat, and warm the bisque until almost simmering.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Vegetables</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the ramps in the boiling water for 1 minute and then transfer to an ice bath. Allow the ramps to cool, then drain and set aside. Repeat the process (using fresh water every time) with the fiddlehead ferns, peas, and favas. Set the vegetables aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Add enough oil to a sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the reserved marrow to the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and sear until the marrow is crispy on both sides, about 1 minute per side.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a sauté pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat and add the reserved morel caps and blanched vegetables. Cook both until just warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season with the sugar, salt, and tarragon, and divide the mixture among the bowls with the crayfish tails.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>In a sauté pan, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat and add the reserved crayfish tails. Cook the tails until just warmed through, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and divide the tails among 4 warmed bowls. Top with wood sorrel and Bone Marrow Crackers, and sprinkle with Amber.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Using an immersion blender, buzz the warmed bisque until emulsified and pour it into the bowls tableside.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you’re looking for a stunner of a dish to serve to your weeknight guests, the bisque is lovely, delicious, and relatively fast to pull together on a moment’s notice. The other components add to the complexity of the dish, but if you’re pressed for time, forgo them—it’s the bisque you’re after.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small pot, combine the shallots, port, sugar, pepper, thyme, and bay leaf, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 40 minutes—the mixture will thicken up and become concentrated. Transfer the pot to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Veal Bon Bons</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large bowl, mix together the veal, terrine, truffle juice (if using), truffle oil, parsley, truffle, demi-glace, and pink salt. Season with salt and pepper. Make a small patty out of some of the meat. Warm a bit of oil in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat, and cook the patty until cooked through, about 2 minutes total. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. Repeat with another small patty, if necessary, until the seasonings are just right.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Lay out the phyllo dough and cut into 12 x 3½-inch strips. Brush the tops with the melted butter. Place a meatball on top of the phyllo dough every 2½ inches. Shape the balls into rectangular logs. Cut the phyllo evenly on either sides of the meat so that each is on an individual piece of phyllo. Wrap the phyllo around the logs and twist the ends to close. Place phyllo logs in the refrigerator to set until ready to use.</p>

Reduce the heat to medium and whisk in the butter, piece by piece, making sure that each piece is emulsified before adding the next. It is important that each piece of butter is fully incorporated into the mixture before another is added. If the butter mixture starts to break, whisk in a few drops of warm water. Set aside and keep warm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Oyster Bisque</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Shuck the oysters over a large bowl, reserving their juices. Set aside the oysters. Strain the oyster juice through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and measure out 1 cup. Place the strained juice, heavy cream, and Mussel Stock in a medium pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.

Sear all four sides of each bon bon until crispy.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Using a slotted spoon, remove the oysters from the bisque and divide them among 4 warmed bowls. Return the bisque to the stovetop over medium-high heat, and simmer for 1 minute. Ladle some of the bisque over the oysters, making sure that the tops of the oysters are showing. Using a fork, dot the tops of the oysters with the Shallot Reduction. Strain the remaining bisque through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, and froth the bisque using an immersion blender. Spoon the bisque around the oysters in each bowl, plant a bon bon on the rim of each bowl (if you don’t have a rim, serve them on the side), sprinkle with the spinach chiffonade, and serve.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Keith Swenson</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Keith Swenson walked away from a career on Wall Street after losing a roommate in one of the towers on September 11, 2001. He found his way back to a career in finance again, but that only lasted a few years. Simply put, he no longer saw the purpose of his career choice. He wasn’t making anything or producing anything. What he did wasn’t making anyone happier. Richer, maybe, but happier? That was debatable. He contemplated his next career move, and the best, most logical idea was to become an oyster purveyor, of course, and in 2009, he founded Righteous Foods.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">He connected with college friends, Travis and Ryan Croxton from Rappa-hannock River Oysters, who wanted to get their oysters to New York restaurants and were looking for a reliable and trustworthy distributor. And so Keith’s sister, Amy Swenson, started going door to door, visiting New York City restaurants and delivering oysters into the hands of the chefs to sample and, hopefully, to source regularly.</p>
			
			<p class="FeaturePara">My restaurant was one of Righteous Foods’ first customers. One night, Amy hand-delivered some oysters to the Monkey Bar where my dad was a consulting chef at the time, and I just happened to be there that night. I tried a few of the Olde Salt oysters and was instantly hooked. Olde Salts are brash and briny with a high salinity—they are oysters for a true oyster lover, tasting of the seawater and the ocean air. We’re proud to serve these—our favorite—at the restaurant.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Port Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a 2-quart saucepot, combine the port, sugar, pepper, and mint and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the liquid has reduced and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Do not refrigerate.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Apple Nage</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a medium bowl, mix together the honey, lime juice, olive oil, apple, celery root, apple juice, mustard oil, coriander, cilantro, honey vinegar, and Tabasco. Season to taste with salt. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Devils on Horseback</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Stuff the dates with the cheese and very tightly wrap a bacon slice around each date. Take 4 (6-inch) skewers and put 3 dates on each one.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Heat 1 inch of oil in a sauté pan until it registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Gently add the dates and fry until the bacon is crispy. Gently push the dates off of the skewers onto clean paper towels and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page122">Make the Bay Scallops</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Thoroughly pat the scallops dry. In a large sauté pan set over high heat, warm enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before it starts to smoke, season one-third of the scallops (12 scallops) with salt and add them to the pan in one even layer. (You will do 2 more batches of scallops. It is very important that you season the scallops <span class="ital">right </span>before you cook them. Otherwise, the salt will make the scallops produce liquid and they will not sear properly.) Immediately, lower the heat to medium, and do not move the pan. Once the edges of the scallops begin to brown, after about 30 seconds, add ½ tablespoon of the butter and roll the scallops in the butter on the heat for 30 seconds. Transfer the cooked scallops to a tray and repeat with the remaining scallops and butter.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Divide the scallops among 4 warmed plates. Drizzle the Apple Nage around them and brush the plate with Port Reduction. Crumble some cheese on top and sprinkle with the celery leaves. Divide the Devils on Horseback among the plates and serve.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>My younger brother, Bryan, came up with this dish, which appeared on our original bar menu. It’s a great way to cook clams in the summertime when the cucumbers are in season—they add a refreshing, herbal note to the clams. We made a version of this dish this for the <span class="ital">Iron Chef America</span> Brothers Battle where the secret ingredient was Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. You’d never think cheese and clams go together—but the combination is truly beautiful.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Manila Clams and Clam Broth</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">2 pounds Manila clams, rinsed and scrubbed</li>
			<li class="il">2 cups <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Chicken">Chicken Stock</a> or store-bought</li>
			<li class="il">1 cup dry white wine</li>

			<li class="il">Juice of ½ lemon</li>
			<li class="il">3 tablespoons chiffonade of fresh basil, plus more for serving</li>
			<li class="il">3 tablespoons chopped fresh curly parsley, plus more for serving</li>
			<li class="il">2 cups sea beans, cleaned (optional)</li>

			<ul class="ing-list">

			<li class="il">Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
			<li class="il">Kosher salt</li>
			<li class="il">Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Manila Clams and Clam Broth</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a large stockpot, combine the clams, stock, wine, pepper flakes, thyme, and bay leaf and bring to a lively simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and gently simmer until the clams open, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the broth immediately through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl; set the clams aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>To the bowl with the clam broth, add the cucumber juice, cheese, crème fraîche, heavy cream, garlic, and Tabasco. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until cold. Using an immersion blender, puree the mixture until smooth and emulsified. Add the lemon juice, basil, and parsley, stir, and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Toast</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Rub the bread slices with the garlic halves. Drizzle them with some olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the bread over high heat, turning occasionally, until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Alternatively, place the bread on a baking sheet and cook under a broiler for about 1 minute or until slightly toasted—the bread should still be a little soft. Drizzle the bread with more olive oil and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Divide the toast among 4 bowls. Return the clams to the pot with the broth, add the sea beans, if using, and warm the broth over medium heat until warmed through, 2 to 4 minutes. Ladle the clams with the broth and sea beans over the bread and scatter some basil and parsley on top before serving.</p>

			<div class="background-padding">
			<p class="FeatureHead">La Boîte à Épice</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Lior Lev Sercarz</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">“Years ago, I was in one kitchen, and these days I’m in fifty,” muses Lior Lev Sercarz, the owner of a gourmet bakery and spice company, La Boîte à Épice, tucked away on 11th Avenue in New York City’s Midtown West.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Sercarz attributes the success of his business partly to the size of his company and his hands-on approach with the chefs who are his clients. Part of the charm is the structure: When chefs call, they immediately get Sercarz. “They don’t get a voicemail or a dial-zero-for-an-operator,” Sercarz says. “They get me. I’ll go see chefs at eleven p.m. or seven a.m. When chefs ask me for something, they know that I will do it if I can. If I say that I cannot, they know that I cannot.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Born to a Tunisian father and a Transylvanian mother in Dan, a kibbutz in Israel, Sercarz grew up surrounded by culinary traditions from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This made Israel an ideal place to be exposed to various different herbs and spices.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Sercarz worked as a chef in Israel and then spent five years in Lyon with the Paul Bocuse Institute. It was while living in France that Sercarz met Olivier Roellinger, well known all over the world for his cuisine and his masterful use of spices in cooking, as well as his knowledge of the spice trade. Roellinger gradually became a mentor, of sorts, to Sercarz, teaching him about the industry and encouraging him to build his own business down the road.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">It was while Sercarz was working at Daniel, a fine dining restaurant in New York City, that his idea of working with spices started to develop. When Sercarz realized he did not want to have his own restaurant, he was at the same time realizing there was a serious dearth of knowledge of the spice world: how the spices are grown, traded, and used in the kitchen either by a professional chef or a home cook. Together, those two epiphanies made him think of doing something related to the culinary industry but not a restaurant, per se.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">As he was thinking about growing the spice blend business, as fate would have it, Sercarz’s first client was Laurent Tourondel, and I was serving as corporate chef for Tourondel at the time. Tourondel and I commissioned some spice blends for BLT Market, and a relationship was born.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When I left the BLT restaurant group to open my own restaurant, Sercarz was the first purveyor I called, and La Boîte à Épice spice blends were used in the restaurant’s dishes from day one.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">All of the spice blends have names. Some are named for important people in the world of spices, such as Pierre Poivre, a personal idol of Sercarz. Some spice blends are named for a place: Ararat, for example. Some blends are named for a dominant ingredient or a flower—it always has to do with either an ingredient, a place, or a person.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">These days Sercarz likes to think of himself as a silent partner in chefs’ kitchens, helping to elevate chefs’ creations with his unique spice blends. Sercarz creates custom blends for his clients, when asked, or can source a hard-to-find spice via his extensive network of contacts. Selecting and sourcing the right spices is a long, meticulous process. With a lot of options in the market, you need to have a discerning palate and an understanding of seasons, geography, and agriculture.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">With Sercarz flying all over the world to source the best spices and creating his unique spice blends, he has followed in his mentor’s footsteps, except, he quips, “He is in France, and I’m here, and I’m still twenty years behind him.”</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Clean the beaks from the cuttlefish, and remove the tentacles from the bodies (you will need them later). If the cuttlefish tentacles seem a bit large and unwieldy to you, feel free to use squid tentacles instead. Place the cuttlefish in a medium bowl and combine with the olive oil, Amber, and lemon zest. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. </p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Stir together the Mayonnaise and sriracha until well combined. Set aside. If making ahead, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chorizo</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Using a meat grinder or a meat grinding attachment to your stand mixer set with the medium die, grind the pork and garlic clove and fold in the Cataluña. If you don’t have a meat grinder, ask your butcher to grind the meat, and combine it with a minced garlic clove at home. Season with salt.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a small sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Break off a tiny piece of the chorizo, form it into a small patty, and just before the oil begins to smoke, add it to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the chorizo, flipping once, until cooked through, about 1 minute. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Repeat the process until the seasonings are where you want them.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page127"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Shape the chorizo into (2- to 3-inch) patties. Add enough oil to a sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil begins to smoke, add the chorizo patties (you may need to do this in batches) and cook until the bottoms of the patties are nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Do not overcrowd the pan or your patties will steam instead of brown. Flip the patties and cook until the other side is nicely browned as well and the chorizo is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to a plate and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lemon Dressing</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a medium bowl combine the oil, lemon juice, pepper, garlic, and salt to taste. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Papas Bravas</h2>

Drain the potatoes, pat dry with paper towels, and blanch in the oil, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and refrigerate until ready to assemble the dish. Reserve the frying oil until you assemble the dish.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cuttlefish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Remove the cuttlefish from the marinade, pat them dry, and season with salt. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the cuttlefish and place a heavy weight on top (a foil-wrapped brick or a foil-wrapped sauté pan). Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 minutes—the fish should be caramelized on the bottom. Remove the weight and turn off the heat. Add the wine, lemon juice, parsley, cilantro, and red pepper flakes, and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan.

			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Reheat the oil you used to fry the potatoes to 350ºF. Re-fry the potatoes until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and immediately season with salt and smoked paprika.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Divide the potatoes among 4 plates; dot the Spicy Mayonnaise around the potatoes. Divide the cuttlefish among the plates, placing it on top of the potatoes, and plate the tentacles and chorizo around. Drizzle some Lemon Dressing on the cuttlefish and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and Amber. Scatter basil around and serve.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>The Spicy Mayonnaise and Lemon Dressing come together very quickly and you can make them well in advance. Since the Papas Bravas take some time to cook, you can skip them and instead serve the mayonnaise and dressing with your favorite spicy side.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>According to the El Dorado County Museum, “No dish epitomizes California and its Gold Rush more than Hangtown Fry.” Hangtown Fry was invented during the Gold Rush in the 1850s in Placerville, California, known at the time as Hangtown. Some sources say it was invented by a gold prospector who struck it rich one day and requested the most expensive dish on the menu, thus marrying the most expensive ingredients available at the time: eggs, bacon, and oysters. Another story tells of an inmate sentenced to die, who requested an oyster omelette for his last meal, knowing full well that the oysters would have to be brought from a hundred miles away, thus delaying his execution by a day. Whatever the story, I think pairing oysters, bacon, and eggs is just a great combo. At the restaurant, we like to use Olde Salt oysters. Their briny, salty flesh is a perfect fit for bacon and eggs.</p>

Add one-quarter of the lardons and one-quarter of the Pickled Red Onions. Once the mixture begins to sizzle, add one of the egg mixtures. Cook for 30 to 40 seconds, to make sure the omelette isn’t sticking to the pan. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook the eggs for 2 minutes or until the eggs are set and a toothpick inserted into the eggs comes out clean. Remove from the heat and set aside. This works better if you have 2 nonstick ovenproof pans going at the same time. If you decide to use a large nonstick pan to fit all 8 eggs, you will need to adjust the cooking time. It should take about 4 minutes, but will depend on the size of your pan.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is a perfect example of something that sounds crazy on paper but ends up tasting magical on your plate.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">I was trying to come up with a barbecue baked oyster for a summer appetizer. The original idea came from a story I heard about Chef Mark Miller making grilled oysters with barbecue sauce and limes. While I liked my first stab at it, it was still missing something, but I wasn’t quite sure what that something was.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">At the time, we were using grated pepper jack cheese for a staff meal and it was sitting out on the counter and I grabbed a handful, sprinkled a little on top of the oysters, and broiled them. I was shocked when I tasted the finished dish—pepper jack and oysters wound up being a perfect pairing!</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">No longer just a summer starter, these oysters have been on our menu ever since. And while they are good any time of year, in the summer, with a cold beer, these make for a very good time.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Bacon Powder</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">4 strips bacon</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Oysters</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">2 ounces (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
			<li class="il">1 red bell pepper, <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#Brunoise">brunoise</a></li>
			<li class="il">1 jalapeño pepper, <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#Brunoise">brunoise</a></li>
			<li class="il">½ red onion, finely diced</li>
			<li class="il">2 tablespoons <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#Ararat">Ararat spice mix</a>, plus more as needed</li>
			<li class="il">¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>

			</ul>
			
			
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Bacon Powder</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the bacon in a shallow baking pan and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until crispy. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel and blot to remove excess fat. Let cool, mince, and set aside in a warm place on a paper towel–lined plate. As the minced bacon dries, it will become crispy again.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Oysters</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>First, make the pepper jack béchamel: In a large sauté pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat until it foams. Add the peppers and onion and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the Ararat and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the flour, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and transfer the mixture to a saucepot set over medium heat. Stir every minute or so for about 15 minutes or until you can’t taste the flour and the sauce is thick and coats the back of a spoon. If the mixture appears too thick, whisk in a little more milk to loosen it up. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and fold in the cheese, parsley, and chives. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Spoon some of the pepper jack béchamel over each oyster and brush with the barbecue sauce on top.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page132"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Cook the oysters in a shallow baking dish under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes or until the béchamel is bubbling. Remove the oysters from the oven and sprinkle with reserved Bacon Powder and a bit more Ararat. Serve with lime wedges and cilantro sprigs.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Homarus</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Jordan Elkin and Brian McGovern</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When Jordan Elkin and Brian McGovern started Homarus, neither had a background in seafood or food, unless you count dining out a background in food. Jordan, whose brother is a rabbi and who grew up in a kosher household, had a background in real estate, while his partner, Brian, came out of NYU film school.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The two of them had an idea to open up a lobster shack, and that was before the lobster shack trend had taken hold of New York. Jordan even spent some time working at a Shake Shack to better understand all the moving pieces of a food joint. But with the economy being in recession, they couldn’t raise adequate financing to open up a physical space. And that’s when the two started to think about a wholesale lobster concept.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The business model was simple: Drive up to Rockland, Maine, get the lobsters from the boats, drive back to New York, and sell them to restaurants. Oh, and work harder than anybody else. Since they opened in 2009, there hasn’t been a single day that the business has been closed. They are a seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year shop. For the first two years of operation, neither Jordan nor Brian took any vacation time. With a small business that needed growing, there were no days off. These days, when Jordan needs to take off for Jewish holidays, Brian picks up the slack; and the reverse happens around Christmastime when Jordan doesn’t mind working the holiday.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Jordan attributes part of their success to their youth and energy: “The seafood business is very competitive and set in its ways. A lot of old people, old trucks, old boats. My partner and I are younger, and it’s helped­—revving up the energy. Good attitude and smiles go a long way.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Both men live in Manhattan and are familiar with the restaurant and the nightlife scene. They started selling door to door, first visiting a couple of places and gradually building their business up to 175 restaurants. Homarus’s clients fall in all kinds of categories—from top restaurants to trendy low-key joints—and Homarus has yet to lose a single client.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">I met Jordan through my then–sous chef, Barry Frish, whose parents are good friends with Jordan’s in-laws. From the get-go, I felt a connection with Jordan and Brian. On top of selling a great product, these guys always make me laugh, and they understand that it’s not just business—it’s also a life that we live. Call me old school, but I like having a personal relationship with someone I work with. Clearly, so do they.</p>

But it didn’t become wildly popular until Sam Sifton, the dining critic for the <span class="ital">New York Times</span> at the time, wrote his review of the restaurant, devoting a whole paragraph to Chili Lobster, and adding it to his list of recommended dishes. After that, Chili Lobster got on everyone’s radar and has since remained one of our most popular offerings on the menu. On any given night, we go through anywhere from 30 to 50 lobsters, and when you’re doing 130 covers, 30 to 50 is quite a big chunk!</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">4 (1½-pound) lobsters</li>
			<li class="il">2 cups <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Lobster">Lobster Stock</a> or store-bought</li>

			<li class="il">Juice of 2 limes</li>
			<li class="il">Kosher salt</li>
			<li class="il">¼ cup canola oil</li>
			<li class="il">2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
			<li class="il">2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
			<li class="il">4 thick slices brioche or sourdough bread</li>
			<li class="il">Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li class="il">2 tablespoons chiffonade of fresh mint</li>
			<li class="il">2 tablespoons sliced scallions, green parts only, soaked in ice water</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Remove the tails from the lobster bodies and cut the tails into 1-inch pieces while they are still in their shells. Remove the claws and place them in the pot of boiling water. Simmer for 4 minutes. Transfer the claws to an ice bath. Once cool, remove the meat from the claws and knuckles and set the meat aside. (See <a href="FORGE_03_Shellfish_PPF.xhtml#HowtoKill">instructions.</a>)</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Bring the Lobster Stock to a simmer and add the sriracha and soy sauce. Piece by piece, using a hand blender or a whisk, whisk in 6 tablespoons of the butter until emulsified. Finish with the lime juice and season with salt. This sauce may seem too spicy at first but the sweetness from the lobster will help balance it out.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Season the lobster tails with salt on both sides. In a wok or a large sauté pan set over high heat, heat just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before it starts to smoke, add the lobster tails, turn the heat down to medium, and cook for 1 minute, undisturbed. Add the ginger and onion and cook for 30 seconds, stirring. Add the lobster stock emulsion and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Turn the heat down to low and cook for 1 more minute or until the lobster is cooked through. Remove the lobster meat from the sauce and distribute it among 4 plates.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add the claw and knuckle meat and reduce the remaining sauce until it thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. While the sauce is reducing, butter the bread slices with the remaining 6 tablespoons butter and season with salt and pepper. Cut each bread slice diagonally—you should wind up with 8 triangular slices. Toast the bread in a toaster oven until toasted and golden brown.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Taste the lobster sauce and add more salt and pepper, if needed. Add the claw and knuckle meat to each bowl. Finish with the mint chiffonade and sliced scallions. Divide the sauce evenly among the four bowls and serve the lobster with Texas toast on the side—you will want it all to mop up the sauce afterward.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Mussel Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a stockpot, combine the Mussel Stock, muscat, vermouth, wine, and shallot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered,  until the liquid has reduced to approximately 1 cup, about 1 hour. Transfer the reduction to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Sauce Cajun</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large bowl, whisk together the Mayonnaise, ¼ cup of the Mussel Reduction, curry paste, teriyaki sauce, ginger, lime zest, turmeric, tarragon, and salt until combined. Set the sauce aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tempura Batter</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a medium bowl, whisk together the tempura batter mix and club soda until combined. Add the ice cube and let it gradually melt into the batter—the batter will be a little lumpy.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Crabs and Vegetables</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Halve the squash blossoms, and remove the insides and outer stems.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page139"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Divide the oil between 2 large Dutch ovens, and warm the oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer (see <a href="#note2">Note</a>).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Dip the ramps in the Tempura Batter, and gently lower them into the hot oil. Fry the ramps until crispy, about 1 minute.

Dip each crab in the batter, and gently lower it into the hot oil. Be careful—the crabs sometimes pop, so wear protective clothing and be alert. Fry the crabs until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not overcrowd the Dutch oven—depending on your pot size, you may be able to fry 2 crabs at a time, but no more than that. Transfer the crabs to a paper towel–lined tray; repeat with the remaining crabs. Season the vegetables and crabs with salt, divide among 4 plates, and serve with the Sauce Cajun and a squirt of lemon.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note1"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>You will want to use 2 Dutch ovens because after half of your battered items are fried, the oil in the first Dutch oven needs to be discarded. Since it takes a while to get the oil to the right temperature, you want the second batch to be ready to go when the first batch is all used up.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is a play on an American backyard classic: potato salad. This simple side is present at just about every summer get-together—no summer barbecue is complete without it. Here, with the addition of oyster emulsion and caviar, we turn it into a very elegant starter. It’s fun to serve at the beginning and get everyone excited for the rest of the meal. It’s also a great way to kick off a New Year’s party—just be sure to have plenty of Champagne to go around.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Potato Salad</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">12 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes (1 large or 2 medium)</li>

			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">4 oysters, preferably a briny East Coast oyster such as Olde Salt or Wellfleet</li>
			<li class="il">8 ounces crème fraîche</li>
			<li class="il">Juice of ½ lime</li>
			<li class="il">1 teaspoon freshly grated horseradish</li>

			<li class="il">Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Potato Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Place the potatoes in a medium pot, add cold water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes until fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and carefully peel the hot potatoes, either wearing a pair of latex gloves or by holding down the potato with one fork and carefully peeling it with another. Once peeled, transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and mash them with a fork until the texture is mostly smooth but a few lumps remain.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Add the crème fraîche, sparkling water, Blanched Lemon Zest, shallots, garlic, and lime juice, and mix until well combined. Drizzle in the olive oil and season to taste with salt, but keep in mind that if you plan to serve this with caviar, the caviar itself is salty, so season accordingly.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a cold, clean bowl, using a handheld mixer or a whisk, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the potato mixture and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours before serving.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Oyster Emulsion</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Rinse and shuck the oysters, reserving the shells. In a blender, combine the oysters, crème fraîche, lime juice, horseradish, and salt to taste and puree. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid, and refrigerate the liquid for at least 1 hour. Using an immersion blender, buzz the chilled liquid. The liquid will separate into foam and liquid, and the foam is what you want. Skim off the foam and set it aside in a bowl. Discard the liquid underneath.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Spoon some of the potato salad into the oyster shells (there will be leftover potato salad). Top the potato salad with some caviar, if desired, and some of the oyster foam. Sprinkle the chives over the salad and drizzle with a bit of olive oil. Serve the remaining potato salad on the side.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you want to just make a delicious potato salad, this is a great one to make, even without the oyster emulsion.</p>
			
			<div class="notebackground">
			<div class="notepadding">
			<p class="RecipeNotePara-plus"><span class="RecipeNoteHead-plus">+  </span>Whenever you make any potato salad, it’s very important to work with still-warm potatoes. Warm potatoes are better at absorbing other ingredients like oil and cream, resulting in a creamier, more luxurious-tasting salad.</p>

But I hadn’t tried white gazpacho until I went to Spain in my twenties. I fell hard for it and have been making various iterations ever since.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">White gazpacho is one of the most refreshing summer meals there is—and on very hot days, it’s a relief to know you can make something so delicious without having to turn on your stove.

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I love being inspired by other chefs. A little while back, I had dinner at the John Dory, a fantastic restaurant in New York, run by a chef I really respect—April Bloomfield. At John Dory, Bloomfield makes this amazing oyster pan roast and serves it with uni (sea urchin) toast. After trying it, I was inspired to make something at my place that featured uni front and center. In fact, in this dish, uni gets featured twice: There’s uni butter and uni cream—perfect flavors to complement the briny mussels and sweet shrimp.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Uni Butter</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Uni Cream</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large pot, combine the wine with 1½ cups of water and bring to a boil.

Reduce the heat to medium-low so the liquid is at a gentle simmer, and cook until the celery root is cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the celery root to a blender with ½ cup of the cooking liquid, and puree until smooth. Pass the celery root cream through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page146"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a medium sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat.

Grill the bread over high heat until charred on one side, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, place the bread in a shallow baking pan and cook under a broiler for about 1 minute or until charred on top. The bread should be crispy on one side and soft on the other. As soon as the bread comes off the heat, spread some of the Uni Butter over it.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Divide the Uni Cream among 4 warmed bowls, making sure that the seafood is evenly distributed.

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Diver scallops got their name because unlike regular scallops, which are most commonly harvested by using scallop dredges or bottom trawls, diver scallops are hand-harvested by individual divers. This method is considered to be more ecologically friendly, as hand-harvesting does not damage the undersea environments as the dredges do; and diver scallops tend to be fresher because they take less time to reach the consumer than with alternative scallop harvesting methods, which can take up to two weeks. Diver scallops are considered to be a seasonal item (December through April) with a short harvesting window.

Add the butter and lecithin, if using, and using an immersion blender, whip the liquid until smooth and emulsified. Measure out 1½ cups for the recipe and set aside. Discard the rest—you need all this liquid for the emulsification to take place, but only 1½ cups for the dish itself.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Butternut Squash</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the squash, reduce the heat to medium, and season with salt. Add the white wine and cinnamon stick. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the pan is dry and the squash is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the squash to a plate, cover, and set aside. (The squash can be made in advance.)</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Butternut Squash Risotto</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Using kitchen twine, tie the thyme and bay leaf into a bundle. In a 4-quart pot, warm the stock over high heat until it is hot. Make sure the stock remains hot.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a 4-quart pot, heat 3 tablespoons of the Chorizo Oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook until the rice starts to toast, about 3 minutes. Add the wine, and cook until the pan is dry. Add 1 cup of the hot stock and the thyme–bay leaf bundle. Stir with a wooden spoon until the rice has absorbed the stock. Continue to add the stock 1 cup at a time, stirring until the stock has been absorbed before adding the next cup. Cook until the rice is just about cooked, but is still al dente. Add the Butternut Squash, squash juice, chives, cream cheese, sage, shallots, truffle oil, and salt to taste. Fold in the Parmigiano-Reggiano and diced chorizo. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Remove from the heat, cover, and keep warm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Diver Scallops</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Preheat the oven to 400ºF; position the rack in the middle. Thoroughly pat dry the scallops. Add enough Blended Oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add 4 scallops to the pan and immediately reduce the heat to medium. Transfer the pan to the oven for 90 seconds and then immediately return it to the stovetop over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, 1 sprig of thyme, and 1 sage leaf. Flip the scallops and baste them for 10 seconds. Transfer the cooked scallops to a paper towel–lined tray. Repeat with the remaining scallops, butter, thyme, and sage leaves.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page149">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Add enough olive oil to a medium sauté pan to come ½ inch up the sides. Set the pan over medium heat and warm the oil until tiny bubbles begin to form. Gently slide the sage leaves into the oil—they will produce a lot of bubbles as they fry. When the bubbles stop forming, the sage leaves are done. Transfer the leaves to a paper towel–lined plate using a slotted spoon.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Divide the Butternut Squash Risotto among 4 warmed plates. Evenly distribute the Diver Scallops over the risotto and season with the Chorizo Salt. Spoon the Chorizo Emulsion around and sprinkle the fried sage leaves on top.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>The Chorizo Emulsion is the longest-cooking component of this dish. Instead, you can just make the risotto and cook the scallops, which would make the meal perfectly doable for a weeknight dinner.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>The recipe makes more Chorizo Oil than you need for the dish, but since it keeps indefinitely, it’s a great flavor enhancer to keep on hand to add to any savory meal. Store it in a squeeze bottle at room temperature.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Scallops</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Scallops come in all shapes and sizes. Their number usually indicates how many are in a pound. For example, designating scallops as “20/30” means that there are 20 to 30 scallops in 1 pound of scallops. Thus, the smaller the number is, the larger the scallops are, and the fewer of them make up a pound.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Sometimes, you might also see designations like “U/15” or “U/10.” In this case, the U stands for “under,” suggesting that it would take fewer than 15 (or 10) scallops to make a pound. Sea scallops are large and reach between 1½ and 2 inches in diameter. Much like steak, they can be pan seared so the outside gets crispy and caramelized while the inside stays tender and rare. You don’t want to cook your scallops to “well done”—the texture will be rubbery.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Bay scallops, known for their sweet and delicate texture, are among the smallest of scallops, often listed as “70/120,” meaning it would take between 70 and 120 scallops to make up a pound. You can find bay scallops anywhere from Cape Cod to the Gulf of Mexico, and sometimes in Nova Scotia. In New York, bay scallops mostly inhabit the small bays and harbors of Peconic Bay on the eastern end of Long Island, and have also been found in Great South Bay, Moriches Bay, and Shinnecock Bay. Harvested between July and late September, bay scallops prefer to inhabit shallow coastal bays and estuaries with sandy and muddy bottoms and eelgrass beds.</p>
			
			<p class="FeaturePara">The vast majority of scallops are harvested by boats dragging chain nets across the ocean floor—this can be very disruptive to the delicate sea ecosystems and many unsuspecting sea dwellers can get caught and die in the process.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Diver scallops, on the other hand, are harvested by divers who jump into the water and collect them by hand. While the term “diver” itself does not imply size, the divers generally tend to go for the largest scallops they can find. You will most likely see diver scallops in the 10/30 range. Diver scallops are more ecologically sound because the divers tend to go for the bigger, more mature scallops, letting the younger ones live on, thus allowing the scallop populations to replenish themselves. </p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Dickson’s Farmstand Meats, located in Chelsea Market in New York, is a terrific small meat shop offering a selection of artisanal meats and meat products. They focus on grass-fed (and finished), organic, heritage breeds, and work with small farmers to source their products.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">One day, I was at the Food Network headquarters, which also happens to be located at the Chelsea Market, and on my way out, stopped by Dickson’s to get a sandwich. The meat in the sandwich was so delicious that I went back the next day to pick up samples of everything, including the Tasso ham, which I loved so much that I wanted to use it in a dish.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">Tasso ham is a thick hunk of fatty pork, cured in a blend of spices, and is a specialty of southern Louisiana. Technically, Tasso ham isn’t “ham,” per se, since it’s not made out of pork shoulder. But since the cut is typically fatty and has a great deal of flavor, it’s called ham nonetheless.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>One of my all-time favorite flavor combinations is your classic American-Italian marriage of sausage and peppers. I had wanted to feature the dish on our menu and was playing around with those two ingredients, but wanted to create something a little off the beaten (expected) path, and worthy of a restaurant feature. Believe it or not, clams go especially well with pork; and the fennel in the sausage is a wonderful complement to their briny, saline notes. Onions and peppers add a subtle sweetness, offsetting the salty sausage. Slightly sophisticated, this is fun to make—and even more fun to eat!</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Onions and Peppers</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Turn the broiler to high; position the rack in the top. In a large bowl, toss the peppers in olive oil. Transfer them to a shallow baking pan and broil them until the skins are almost black and the peppers are soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let stand for 1½ hours at room temperature. Peel, seed, and julienne the peppers and set them aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the onion, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until soft. Add the peppers and stir to combine with the onion. Transfer to a parchment paper–lined tray and let cool.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pork-Fennel Sausage</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a small, dry skillet, toast the fennel seeds over low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, transfer to a small bowl, and let cool. Using a meat grinder, or a meat grinding attachment to your stand mixer, grind together the pork, garlic, fennel seeds, and both salts. Set aside. If you do not own a meat grinder, ask your butcher to grind the meat and combine it with the remaining sausage ingredients at home.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page153">Make the Clams</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough olive oil to a large stockpot to cover the bottom of the pot and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the reserved sausage and sear it on one side, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Cook until the meat browns, about 10 minutes. Add the clams and the Onions and Peppers and cook for 30 seconds. Add the wine and stock and cook for 30 seconds more. Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomato sauce. Cover and cook until the clams open, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the lid and stir in the broccoli rabe leaves and basil.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Drizzle some olive oil over the bread slices and season them with salt and pepper. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the bread over high heat, turning once, until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, place the bread on a half-sheet baking pan and cook under a broiler for about 1 minute—the bread should still be a little soft, but have slight color on top. Drizzle with more olive oil and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Discard any clams that did not open. Divide the clams in tomato sauce among 4 bowls, with grilled bread on the side. Drizzle with more extra-virgin olive oil before serving.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note4"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If making your own sausage meat isn’t your thing, you can always cook with your favorite prepared sausage instead. The rest of the components come together quickly. Onions and Peppers can be made a day in advance, so when you throw the whole dish together, your dinner should be ready in half an hour.</p>

Ramps’ arrival means that the long, cold winter is finally over.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">It also means you no longer have to contend with just root vegetables. Soon, there will be asparagus, overwintered broccoli rabe, and much, much more.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Line the bottom of a 4-quart saucepot with foil. Place the soaked wood chips over the foil. Make a “basket” out of foil to hang over the edges of the pot so that when you place the scallop skirts in it, they will be suspended over the wood chips. Poke 8 to 10 holes in the “basket” with a paring knife. Remove the “basket” from the pot and set it nearby. Place the pot over high heat until the wood chips begin to smoke and smell fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and gently slide the “basket” over the pot. Gently lower the scallop skirts into the “basket,” cover the pot, and smoke the scallop skirts for about 10 minutes. Transfer the smoked scallop skirts to a parchment paper–lined tray to cool.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Once the oil has come up to temperature, fry the smoked scallop skirts until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the fried scallop skirts to a paper towel–lined tray and season with smoked salt. The skirts will curl up and get crispy, and resemble little pieces of bacon. Set aside in a dry place.</p>

			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Remove the scallops on the half shell from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Bake the scallops for about 5 minutes or until warm to the touch. As soon as the scallops come out of the oven, drizzle them with a little olive oil and add a pinch of salt to each scallop.</p>

					<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Spoon enough of the Ramp Chimichurri to cover the top of each scallop. You will have extra Ramp Chimichurri left over; set it aside for an omelette the next morning. Spoon the Roe Vinaigrette around the scallops, and give a generous squeeze of lemon. Spoon a bit of the caviar on top, if using. Place the Scallop Bacon over the caviar and garnish each plate with a raw ramp.</p>
	
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note5"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If your kitchen doesn’t come with windows or good ventilation, you might want to consider skipping the Scallop Bacon, as it will get smoky, and just make the Roe Vinaigrette and the scallops.</p>
