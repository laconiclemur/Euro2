		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">From that January day when I first set foot in No 1 rue de Loudenne, it has been clear to me that the house needed to awaken from its long slumber. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">We were looking for a family home, but we found something more, something bigger, more interesting, and in a strange way it felt like my duty to bring it all back to life. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">How</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> was much less clear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">I have always loved restaurants and spent a good deal of my life enjoying them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">But running one myself? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">In a house that wasn’t really ready, with a nonexistent staff—apart from my eager and very accommodating family? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">(And don’t you need a license? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.6">And maybe a dishwasher?)</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">We decided to start small, hosting a few cooking workshops throughout the year, welcoming a few fresh faces every month to keep the house guessing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Class after class of like-minded food-loving, wine-drinking people made its way to this quiet town to spend hours eating and drinking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">I was emboldened.</span></p>
		<p class="altp" id="p28"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Then, true to form for us, we announced, perhaps a bit prematurely, that we’d also be opening a pop-up restaurant in the summer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Sasha, ever optimistic, said, “That’s never going to happen.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Then he paused and gestured that it might be possible, with more money of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">We formed a little team, with one member we quickly realized we couldn’t live without, Allegra from Pescara, Italy, who stated on her application that she excels in scuba diving and used to play professional basketball—though her height does not suggest this (we later found out, when her father visited, that he had sponsored the team and even then she had had a hard time getting playing time).</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">When summer neared, I started getting serious jitters and would say to Oddur on a daily basis, “I’m not sure I can do this.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">But there was a little fire burning inside me that made me feel all along that somehow we would pull it off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">Every morning (or sometimes in the afternoon) I saw Sasha disappear from the garden into the part of the house where we planned to have the restaurant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">His face was usually not encouraging, though his expression tended to improve after a dozen coffees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.5">Monsieur Bianco, the French/Italian plumber who prides himself on having 1,100 clients (making me number 1,101), was by July much more interested in talking about his impending holiday in Corsica than the toilets he was supposed to install days later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.6">But we had already posted our opening date as Saturday, August 8. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.7">I still don’t really know how we managed to make it all happen, to get Monsieur Bianco and Monsieur Simon, the electrician, to work in a very un-French way in the sacred month of August. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.8">Something tells me that Sasha, whose favorite mantra is that Russians will work on any day of the year, made them an offer they couldn’t refuse.</span></p>
		<p class="altsp"><span class="sc"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">A RESTAURANT</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> is never more ready than the people who work there, and by the first week of August we weren’t ready at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">April, a free-spirited world-wanderer and a butterfly of a friend, had announced her willingness to “work for food and shelter,” and though I didn’t know her well, I knew her well enough to know that she’d be a perfect fit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">It was a mix of her experience and my intuition. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">I also needed help in the kitchen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.5">Allegra would of course do her part, but she had so many other things on her plate, and our two eldest, Gunnhildur and Þórir, amazing as they are, hardly had the experience to cook in a restaurant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.6">There was a week where I had nightmare visions of myself standing at the stove, cooking a four-course meal for thirty people without much help, and my husband’s contribution would be, as ever, to “just stall them with another bottle of Champagne.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.7">The solution came in the unlikely form of a tattooed Brooklyn dude named Miles. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.8">My friend Yolanda had recommended him to me, through a friendship with his mother, and this late in the game he would simply have to do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.9">Miles was up for it (he always is), and after a part-frightening, part-encouraging phone conversation, I bought him a one-way ticket to Paris.</span></p>

		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">We started with Champagne and radishes served with butter and salt and a selection of dried black pig sausages from my four-fingered butcher, Monsieur Manenti. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Then we planned an amuse-bouche—a thick slice of foie gras served with figs that we had picked ourselves, or oysters, baked or raw (or, later, when Miles got “cheffy” on us, a langoustine crudo with cucumbers). </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">The menu offered two choices for each of three courses: starter, main, and dessert.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">That first night the room was filled with friends: Fabien, who had been instrumental in helping us find the house, and his wife, Flo; Linda and Jeffrey, who came for a workshop in March but ended up buying a house in St Yzans three days later (and who would throw their wedding dinner in the restaurant that summer); Anne and Michelle, the wonderful couple who run an antiques store in St Christoly and have supplied a large amount of our furniture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">That night, among other dishes, we served a gazpacho made entirely from our tomatoes, a summer veal roast, and a walnut tart served with a small mountain of whipped cream. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Of course there was, as always in this house, too much wine.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Sometime around midnight the Icelandic teenage team returned from the train station with Miles in tow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">He looked much more like an out-of-it rock star than a reliable cook, and the first thing he said, when Oddur offered him a big glass of a 2000 Château Lynch-Bages, was, “This shit tastes like what we always have for my grandfather’s birthday.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Then he downed a few more glasses and got on with the party. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">I started wondering if flying him over had been such a good idea after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.5">I thought if he showed up the next morning at eight, it would be a minor miracle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.6">(Fortunately, in St Yzans at least, miracles do happen.)</span></p>
		<p class="altp" id="p32"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">At the end of the night, Anne, who had perhaps been waiting with more anticipation for this than anyone, declared the evening </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">magique</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">.</span></p>
		<p class="altsp"><span class="sc"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">THROUGHOUT AUGUST</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> and into September the “</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">magique</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">” continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Mostly it was all a big success, but there were a few moments of despair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Like that scorching hot day when the cream simply wouldn’t whip and we opened pack after pack of heavy cream. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">Everyone in the kitchen had a theory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">“It was the cream’s fault, it should have been colder.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.6">“The bowl should be cold.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.7">“We should be less stressed”—as if the cream could sense our frustration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.8">It all culminated in a scene in our little bathroom with the whole team up against an open window, Miles frantically rubbing the bowl with ice, April and Allegra taking turns whipping with a handheld machine, cream splattering in every direction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.9">Not a pretty sight, but a funny one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.10">At least one theory was tested beyond doubt during that lunch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.11">Oddur’s theory of just offering more wine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.12">It always worked.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">In that one month our clients were an interesting, international mix of readers of my blog, people who live in the region, and those who just wanted good food. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">There were date nights and family nights and even bring-your-child-with-you-to-date-night-and-put-him-to-sleep-in-a-separate-room-where-he-won’t-disturb-us-but-probably-other-people nights. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">Every day Gunnhildur or Þórir or Oddur would bring us carefully curated crates of meats from my favorite butcher sources, fresh fish, and vegetables from local markets—especially from our organic farmer friends the Auberts—and, of course, from our own garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">Every day someone would drive the extra miles to Soulac-sur-Mer, about half an hour from our house, to get what we believe is the finest baguette in Médoc from a small, unassuming bakery called Le Fournil de J&amp;J, run by the young couple behind the initials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.5">Miles, Allegra, and I would then cook all this wonderful produce to the best of our abilities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.6">April gradually improved her ironing, and by the end of it all I’d say we had gotten pretty good at “playing restaurant.”</span></p>
		<p class="altp" id="p33"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">From time to time we had special guest appearances, like that starry night when Mr. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Campari himself, the style editor of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Condé Nast Traveler</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> and now owner of No 2 rue de Loudenne, mixed Negronis in what we call </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">la boucherie</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">—the butcher shop, our second “kitchen”—where guests entered and were served Champagne and other drinks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Meanwhile Rica, my editor at Clarkson Potter (who will have approved these lines if you are reading them), was taking orders in the dining room and marshaling the kitchen in a way that I could only dream of. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">Cyrille, her French chef husband, who usually presides over a kitchen staff of forty in New York, pitched in, too, directing Miles and Allegra, probably in a gentler way than he is used to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">That same night we had two journalists from </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">House &amp; Garden</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1"> who had come to interview me and were trying to do so over dinner, although soon they got much more interested in Matt’s Negronis and all the wine that followed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">We all ended up in the “</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">boucherie</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">” at midnight, opening more bottles of wine, turning what started as a proper restaurant earlier in the evening into a casual, kitchen after-party.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">The guests who came to No 1 rue de Loudenne invariably turned into friends who would never leave, and I always took that as a compliment.</span></p>
