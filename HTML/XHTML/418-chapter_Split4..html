<p class="tx2">It’s such a joy to be writing the foreword to my good mate Alex’s beautiful book. We first met when I was looking for a fresh Food Tube star to join the family a few years ago, and as soon as I saw Alex’s ‘French Guy Cooking’ videos I knew we’d discovered a hidden gem. Since then, Alex’s channel has become super-successful. And he still cracks me up every time we cook together!</p>
<p class="tx2">Alex’s food is fantastically fun. It’s simple but delicious, and always delivered in his brilliantly quirky way. He’s a self-taught genius, and he knows exactly what home cooks really want to make. You can’t watch him in the kitchen without smiling, and that’s what the recipes in this lovely book are all about.</p>
<p class="tx2">From the French treats you might expect, like the cheat’s croissants and the epic ‘magic-crust’ quiche Lorraine to delights such as ramen four ways and street lamb shish kebab, Alex gets to the heart of joyful, happy cooking. For me, these recipes tick all the big boxes: simple, exciting and ultimately ‘eat-me’ food!</p>
<p class="tx2">It’s food to spark the imagination of beginner and pro cooks alike, with lovely chatter and helpful tips from Alex running throughout. And with the step-by-step pics, too… well, you can’t go wrong!</p>
<p class="tx2">So guys, turn the page, dive into this bright and colourful collection of gorgeous dishes, and start choosing what you’re going to have for dinner! I’ve got a feeling you’ll come back to this lovely book time and time again.</p>
<p class="tx2">Alex, what can I say mate? You’ve absolutely nailed it. It’s a beaut.</p>
