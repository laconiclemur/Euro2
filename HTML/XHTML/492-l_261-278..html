			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pâte Brisée</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">proportions for a single large crust</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">I was taught, before anyone (at least, in northwestern Iowa) had ever heard of Spry or Crisco, that, if one liked tender pastry it should be made with lard and that, if one preferred crisp pastry, it should be made with butter. I have never liked lard (and it should be noted that lard pastry tastes like lard whereas pastry made with good, fresh unsalted butter tastes like butter), and I have never liked crumbly, fatty pastry, so my narrow path was, from the beginning, cleanly defined. For as long as I can remember, but for the occasional (and fairly recent) intrusion of olive oil, I have always prepared pastry with nothing but butter and, be it in America or in France, it has, to my taste, been perfect. But, of recent years, a great many people have assured me—with <span class="lead-in">a distressing ring of authority (I have been away too long</span> . . .<span class="lead-in">)—that, whereas perfect pastry may, indeed, be made with pure butter in </span>France, the flour in America does not permit it. I had, as recently as seven years ago, prepared satisfactory pastry from “all-purpose” flour in the United States, but, troubled (memory, they say, plays tricks), I asked friends to bring me American flours—“all-purpose” and “wondra” (which, except that it is bleached much whiter, corresponds closely to a type of flour that is now widely commercialized in France); with these flours, a pinch of salt, a lot of butter, and a bit of water, one may make impeccable pastry; the “wondra” seems to require a bit more water and makes a slightly more “brittle” pastry, a quality that I appreciate and that, perhaps, everyone does not.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST" id="page262">				
				<li class="IL">¾ cup flour	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">3½ ounces cold butter (7 tablespoons)</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup cold water (for “wondra”; slightly less for “all-purpose”)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">For ease in working, use a fairly large mixing bowl; pour in the flour, sprinkle with salt, add the butter, cut into small pieces, and cut with table knives, one in each hand, blades crossed and touching, repeatedly and rapidly pulling the blades outward and away from each other and recommencing; gather the flour and the butter pieces back to the center of the bowl regularly with the knife tips. Work no more than a minute or so—the butter fragments need not all be as small as the traditional pea. Add the water (not all at once—you may need just a bit less . . .), stirring with a fork and mashing as little as possible to begin bringing the mass together; finish rapidly, working with the tips of your fingers—only enough to create a cohesive body that may be formed into a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate in the coldest part (not the freezer) of the refrigerator for at least 2 or 3 hours.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The coldness of a marble slab—if you have one—facilitates one’s work. Dust it generously with flour, flatten the dough with your hand—it should be quite hard—and give it a few gentle smacks with the rolling pin to flatten it more and render it more supple. Turn it over to be certain that both sides are well floured and roll it out rapidly. Fold the pastry round in two to facilitate draping it into the mold and gently fit it to the form, cutting off the excess pastry some ½ inch outside the border, rolling the ½ inch under, pressing it firmly into place, and crimping the border all the way around by pressing with the side of your repeatedly floured thumb while holding the inside and outside of the pastry rim in place with thumb and forefinger of the other hand. Pierce the bottom here and there with the tines of a fork or the sharp point of a knife.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page263">To half bake an empty pastry shell, line it with a sheet of aluminum foil or kitchen parchment paper, pour in dried beans, split peas, or what have you (keep something around for that use—it can serve no other purpose afterwards; a litre of chick-peas has served me well for several years) and bake for 15 minutes at 375° to 400°, remove the paper and dried contents, and return the pastry to the oven for 5 minutes to let it dry out.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Short pastry, rather than being rolled out only once and fitted to its mold, may first be rolled to a length of about one foot by some 5 or 6 inches, folded in three and then rolled out to the desired form. This is the first step in the preparation of a somewhat simplified <em class="ital">feuilletée</em> and lends the pastry a bit of the <em class="ital">feuilletée’s</em> quality of flakiness. To transform the pastry into a simple <em class="ital">feuilletée,</em> roll the folded length again to the long rectangular form, fold the two extremities in to meet each other, then fold the two, this forming four layers, refrigerate for at least ½ hour, repeat, refrigerate again, repeat and roll out (or refrigerate again before rolling out).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Fold the trimmings into a many-layered stack (or roll them up), form into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for another hour or so and you will have a <em class="ital">demi-feuilletée.</em> Roll it out (not too thinly; to about ⅛ inch) to a length about 4 inches wide, sprinkle each side very lightly with cayenne and generously with grated cheese, pressing it first into the surface with the flat of your hand, then with a cleaver, flat mallet, or the flat of the blade of a large knife, cut into ½-inch-wide strips, twist each gently—three or four turns—into a spiral, and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet, pressing the extremities lightly so that the form will hold. Bake for 15 minutes at 400° and serve with an apéritif . . .</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page264" style="page-break-before:always;">Provençal Pastry</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pâte à l’Huile d’Olive</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Little distinction is made, traditionally, in the south of France between noodle dough and pastry dough. For many a housewife, a pound, more or less, of flour, an egg, and a dribble of olive oil brought to the desired consistency with tepid water serves indifferently for the fabrication of noodles, ravioli, pies, tarts, and deep-fried, stuffed little fantasies. As such, it is neither very interesting as pasta nor as pastry. With a bit more olive oil, the pastry acquires personality and, for many, will be quite a new experience. It is best to prepare a relatively soft dough—it will absorb the necessary supplement of flour in being rolled out.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">2 cups flour	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 egg</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup tepid water</li>
				<li class="IL">Flour (for rolling out)</li>
				<li class="IL">Olive oil (with which to brush the pastry)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Add all the ingredients except the last to the flour in the mixing bowl, mix, first with a fork, then knead rapidly with your knuckles until consistent. Form into a ball, cover with a towel, and leave to rest for at least an hour before rolling out on a well-floured board or marble. Whatever the preparation, brush (in Provence, one smears with one’s fingers) the surface with olive oil before baking the dough.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page265" style="page-break-before:always;">Herb Pasta</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pâtes aux Herbes</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">3</span> or <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">This dough should not be rolled out on a machine—the uncompromising rollers force it into an amalgam in which the singleness of the savors is lost and flour is absorbed to excess. Also, it is better to pound the herbs in a mortar rather than purée them with the liquids in a blender—they remain, pounded, distinct and multiflavored fragments.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The herbs mentioned should be considered as among the many possibilities—any wild salad greens may be used and other herbs, depending on personal taste; strongly flavored herbs such as rosemary, common thyme, sage, savory, etc., should be avoided or used with a fine discretion. If you can gather together but three or four elements, don’t hesitate to try them; the spirit of the thing is just that—you put into it what you can find.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Lightness and delicacy are not among its attributes, so don’t try it on difficult guests. It is delicious—perhaps better—leftover and transformed into a gratin: The squares stick together hopelessly, so they should be taken en masse and sliced thinly, noodle-like, then “crumbled”—to loosen as well as possible the little noodles one from the other—directly into a buttered gratin dish, the bottom of which has been sprinkled with grated cheese. If the quantity of pasta is large, sprinkle cheese also over an intermediate layer. Pour over heavy cream, sprinkle the surface with cheese, and bake at 400° to 450° for about 20 minutes; the exhilarating wild green flavors are thrown into even cleaner relief this way, thanks no doubt to the cream’s sweet presence.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1¾ cups flour</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 egg</li>
				<li class="IL">4 ounces green things, in approximately equal quantities, pounded to a paste in a mortar (about 1 cup, pounded): sorrel, wild chicory, dandelion, rocket (or arugula), basil leaves and flowers, etc.—plus a leaf or two of lovage, purslane, leaf thyme, hyssop, fresh marjoram, burnet, young fuzzy borage leaves (before they become prickly) . . .</li>
				<li class="IL">About 2 tablespoons warm water</li>
				<li class="IL">Flour (for rolling out)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon olive oil (for the cooking water)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal" id="page266">	Add all the ingredients (except the water and the last two listed) to the flour, work together with a fork, adding a bit more flour if necessary, until fairly consistent—a slightly lumpy but single mass. Throw a bit of water in to bring it all together, work well with the fork, and turn it out onto a heavily floured board or marble. Roll in the flour to coat it and knead with the palm of your hand, turning it around and over and folding often. Work for some time as the herbs continue to bleed moisture into the mixture, which, finally, during the kneading, will absorb easily another ½ cup of flour from the board. As the paste becomes elastic, difficult to work, and stops sticking, flour it well, cover with a towel, and leave to rest for about an hour. It should remain quite supple—less firm than normal noodle paste.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Roll it out to about ⅛ inch, cut the sheet into 1½-inch ribbons, cut each ribbon into squares, and drop them loosely into a large quantity of salted boiling water to which has been added the spoonful of olive oil (to discourage their sticking together). Move them with a wooden fork to make certain that none are sticking together and boil for about 6 minutes from the time the water returns to a boil. Drain and serve onto hot plates, sprinkled generously with grated Parmesan and bubbling brown butter.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page267" style="page-break-before:always;">Batter Noodles</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Nouilles à la Poche</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">3</span> or <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Treated as a gratin, these rich, round, tender eggy noodles are quite astonishing—simply drowned in cream and sprinkled with grated cheese (or liberally sprinkled with meat or poultry roasting juices and cheese . . .). Served as a garnish, they may also be tossed in butter and seasoned to taste, and a few chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> may be added; or they may be tossed with fresh breadcrumbs that have first been cooked gently and tossed often in butter until lightly golden and crisp—more butter added at the moment the noodles are joined to the crumbs. They may, of course, be combined with other ingredients, either as a gratin or sautéed. With the former, it is a good way to stretch truffles, respecting their flavor. Or a bed of mushroom purée may line the gratin dish; or dried morels (soaked, trimmed, rinsed, and butter-stewed) may be mixed with them to the happiest of effects. Or rapidly parboiled little peas . . .</p>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1⅓ cups flour (more or less; the “instant blending” variety is good for this)</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">4 eggs</li>
				</ul>

			<p class="Normal">Put 1 cup of flour in a mixing bowl and whisk the other ingredients into it. When smooth, add enough more flour, sprinkling it over the surface a little at a time and whisking it in, to bring the consistency to approximately that of a firm cake batter.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Roll a large square of kitchen parchment paper into a cone, flatten it and seal the length of the loose edge with a strip of Scotch tape, fold the tip to prevent loss of batter as the cone is filled, open the cone out again and place it upright in a tall vase, pitcher, or other article that will hold it still as it is filled (a pastry bag may be used, but, with the paper, the tedious, nasty job of cleaning afterwards is eliminated). Fill the cone with the batter, squeeze the top firmly closed, snip off the tip to leave a tiny hole something less than ¼ inch in diameter and, continuing to squeeze and hold the top part in one hand, squeeze the body of the cone with the other, holding the tip just over the surface of barely simmering salted water (the movement of boiling water would shatter the batter before it has time to set). The container should be the largest—with the largest surface—available; a large American roasting pan serves well. As you squeeze ribbons of batter, relax the pressure regularly to let them separate, forming lengths of from 3 to 5 inches. Move the tip over the surface, being careful not to squeeze batter onto already formed noodles. Cover and leave to poach for half a minute or so—until the water returns to a boil—and drain.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page268" style="page-break-before:always;">Fresh Egg Noodles</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Pâtes Fraîches aux Oeufs</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Noodles, the dough of which has been rolled out by hand, well dusted with flour, rolled up, and sliced, have a charm apart, which depends largely on the slight variations of thickness and of width, but also, because the dough is worked less brutally, with greater suppleness, than by the machine, the fresh egg taste is more in evidence—or, in the instance of green noodles, the spinach flavor is cleaner. The quasi-miraculous little Italian pasta machines, however, turn the work into a fantastically effortless, amusing, childlike game, and with a smattering of experience or habit, splendid results may be had (mine bears the trademark “Titania” and is manufactured by the firm “I.P.S.” in Turin; it is commercialized in the United States—as are several others with which I am unfamiliar). I willingly bear witness to the fact that, whereas, in the past, months at a time went by without my preparing fresh pasta, a week never passes now that I do not offer myself or guests fresh egg noodles, my funny little machine doing all the work.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page269">The dough may be firmer for a machine than that which is to be rolled out by hand—and it is easier to work, but less good. It may also, if one is pressed for time, be worked immediately (although it tends to fall apart for the first two or three passages through the rollers during the kneading) rather than being left to relax, but, in that case, it must be kneaded longer before being rolled out thinly, and the result is very like that of commercial fresh pasta. For best results: (1) an “instant-blending” flour is easily superior to others; very fine semolina gives good results also—count about 3 minutes longer cooking time than for noodles made with flour; (2) the dough is much finer if forced in egg yolks—one made only of egg yolks is quite remarkable (count about 5 yolks to a cup of flour and 1 tablespoon of olive oil—soft or melted butter may be substituted); (3) the dough should be fairly supple and it should be left to rest, preferably for a good hour, before being kneaded in the machine; (4) it should be passed through the rollers, set at maximum (kneading) width, only the number of times—4, 5, or 6—necessary to render the sheet absolutely cohesive before being passed through at the desired thickness; (5) the sheets, if rolled out from a supple dough, will be slightly sticky and should be hung (over a broomstick suspended between two chair backs) to dry for 20 or 30 minutes before being passed through the noodle-cutting rollers.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Green noodles are traditional in Niçoise cooking, but they are more often made with parboiled, squeezed chard greens than with spinach as in Italy (2 cups flour; salt; 1 whole egg and 1 yolk; 1 tablespoon olive oil; ½ pound parboiled spinach or chard greens squeezed dry and chopped). The dough needs to be kneaded by hand before being put to rest, flour added as necessary, because of the green stuff’s habit of releasing its moisture progressively; otherwise it is treated in the same way as that for egg noodles. Green noodles are perhaps best understood if served tossed only with grated cheese and butter, a generous amount of pepper ground over—but a pan of tiny zucchini, sliced paper-thin and sautéed over a high flame for 5 or 6 minutes with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic (discarded before serving) in olive oil, may be strewn over the lot without incurring the displeasure of a radical purist.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1¾ cups flour	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">1 whole egg and 3 egg yolks</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal" id="page270">	Put 1½ cups flour in a mixing bowl with the other ingredients, work with a fork until consistent, adding a bit more flour if necessary, then knead with your knuckles just long enough to bring it all together in a firm, cohesive mass. Roll into a ball and leave, covered by a towel, to rest for about an hour.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Divide the dough into two or three parts, press one out flatly on a lightly floured board and turn it through the rollers set at the widest notch. Fold it in three and if it is sticky, drag the two sides over the floured board before passing it through again; fold again, in triple or double, and continue passing and folding until the sheet of dough is smooth-textured, consistent, and its width equals that of the width of the rollers. Adjust the rollers to the thickness desired (I prefer, for most purposes, the next to finest), pass it through, and hang it to dry while treating the other sections of dough in the same way. Pass the sheets through the noodle-cutting rollers and toss them lightly, sprinkled with a bit of flour, with splayed fingers, to keep them from sticking together while waiting to be cooked (for Alsatian noodles, use the finest rollers—spaghetti or tagliarini width—and keep a handful apart to be sautéed raw in butter until lightly colored and crisp; they are scattered as garnish over the remaining noodles, which are boiled, drained, and tossed in butter).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cook them in a large quantity of salted, boiling water to which a dribble of olive oil has been added (an old Italian habit, which the French, mistakenly, do not always respect). The moment they are added to the water, gently shake them free of each other with the prongs of a wooden fork. Count 3 to 4 minutes’ cooking time, surveying them closely—the time necessary may vary some 30 seconds, depending on the thickness of the noodles, the firmness of the dough, the extent to which the sheets of dough or the noodles have been dried before cooking, etc. Drain and, as a garnish, serve rapidly tossed with butter; tossed with butter and grated cheese; tossed with butter, cheese, chopped butter-stewed tomatoes (to which chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> or fragments of fresh basil may be added) . . . However served, freshly ground pepper is welcome and hot plates are essential. Note: Eaten in the Italian manner, the long strands twirled on one’s fork are an integral part of the experience; outside of meridional France, noodles are conceived of as a garnish and, as such, it is wiser to cut the sheets of dough into 7- or 8-inch lengths before passing them through the noodle cutter.</p>

			<p class="Normal">The two following recipes I have noted in the course of emptying out the refrigerator for my solitary needs.

			<p class="Normal">The dough is the same as for egg noodles but, for ravioli, it must be supple and the rolled-out sheets should not be hung to dry.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The French usually cling to the classic square form of ravioli, but they do not distinguish the Italian tortelli or tortellini (filled rounds sealed into half-moon forms) by a different name. One rarely sees cappelletti in France (half moons, the tips forced gently backwards and pinched together), but the form, quite aside from its attractive and amusing aspect, is practical if the pasta is being served directly from the boiling water, simply sprinkled with cheese and brown butter. Its eccentricity prevents the cappelletti from sticking together both during the cooking and on the plates, but the same formal irregularity makes them impractical for saucing and gratinéing, for it takes up too much space, requiring an excess of sauce. Any of these ravioli-type preparations provides one of the more elegant means to disposing of leftovers.</p>

			<p class="Normal">Cover the chopped onions with water in your smallest saucepan, bring to a boil, skim off the gray scum that forms on the surface, and simmer for about 20 minutes, checking that they do not boil dry. Turn the heat up slightly and stir until all the water has been evaporated. Add to the other ingredients in the mixing bowl, peppering abundantly, stir first to disperse the heat of the onions, then work the stuffing with your hand, squeezing it repeatedly through your fingers until thoroughly homogeneous. Pick up dabs of the stuffing (each the equivalent of a slight level teaspoonful—or about the size of a normal olive) with the tip of a teaspoon and arrange them on a large platter. Put to chill in the refrigerator for an hour or so (just beneath the freezing unit, a ½ hour will do).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page275">Prepare the noodle dough as in the preceding recipe, leaving it to rest. Don’t roll it out until the stuffing dabs are firmly chilled.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Roll out the dough (if by hand, to about 1⁄16 inch or, if by machine, somewhat finer) and, using an inverted tumbler, tin can, or cookie cutter three inches in diameter, cut it into rounds and then stack them, undersides lightly floured, to prevent their drying out. Gather the cuttings together in a ball and roll them out again.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Form the ravioli into half moons, placing a dab of stuffing in the center of each, moistening a band all around the circumference, folding and pinching firmly all around the edge to be certain that the contents are tightly sealed in. Cook in the largest pot you have—in a large quantity of salted, boiling water, counting 4 minutes or slightly over from the moment the water returns to a boil.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page275a" style="page-break-before:always;">Crêpe Batter</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Appareil à Crêpes</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Good <em class="ital">crêpe</em> pans are made of heavy iron. They differ from omelet pans only in that the sides are lower and more oblique; in their absence, small omelet pans will serve.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Like all flour-based batters or doughs, <em class="ital">crêpe</em> batter is usually left to relax, losing the elasticity that is developed to an extent relative to the length and violence of its beating; but the nature of <em class="ital">crêpes</em>—the simplicity and the rapidity of their preparation, their usefulness as an elegant means of disposing of leftovers or of tossing off a hastily improvised dessert—thrusts them often into the category of last-minute-decision preparations. Care should be taken to whisk the batter gently and no longer than necessary to perfectly combine the ingredients and they may, then, be prepared immediately.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page276">The best <em class="ital">crêpes</em> are made with a proportionately high egg and low flour content. Cognac is a useful flavoring agent, and a certain amount of either melted butter or olive oil is necessary—otherwise it seems to me to make little difference what they are moistened with; good <em class="ital">crêpes</em> can be made moistened only with water, or only with beer, or heavy cream may be added to enrich the batter. The precise proportioning of ingredients is of little importance, but the consistency of the batter is of the greatest—its body should be approximately that of American fresh heavy cream (that is to say, very thin).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sugar is usually added to dessert-<em class="ital">crêpe</em> batter; after years of dumbly respecting this rule, I realized that I preferred unsweetened <em class="ital">crêpes;</em> whatever their ultimate treatment, they will receive a large sufficience of sweetening. Recipes calling for an addition of chopped fruit, crumbled macaroons, or other cookie-like substance to the batter may sound attractive but, in practice, the added bulk necessitates the use of too much batter to make a <em class="ital">crêpe</em> and its finesse suffers greatly, thinness being part of its essential character.</p>
			<p class="Normal">For non-sweet preparations, finely chopped <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> are often added to the batter. Powdered saffron—as much as one can heap on a knife tip—may be dissolved in a bit of hot water and stirred into the batter. Saffron <em class="ital">crêpes</em> seem to me particularly useful as a wrapping for mixtures based on crustaceans or shellfish—shrimp, crab, lobster, scallops, mussels, clams . . . Spread with softened butter, rolled up, and eaten hot from the pan, they are sublime; buttered, folded in four, arranged overlapping in a buttered gratin dish, spread with stiff cream (or a small amount of stiff <em class="ital">béchamel</em> generously creamed), the surface sprinkled generously with grated Parmesan and put in a 500° oven for 10 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling and the surface colored, saffron <em class="ital">crêpes</em> cannot help but elicit admiration.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">⅓ cup flour	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">3 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">Liquid (approximately 1 cup—milk, water, beer, enrichened or not by the addition of heavy cream)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon (or 2) Cognac</li>
				<li class="IL">3 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter (butter for dessert)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal" id="page277">	Add the eggs to the flour and salt, whisk from the center of the bowl, working gradually out, until no lumps remain, then stir in (with the whisk) the other ingredients.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Use a small ladle to pour the batter into the pan; count (but do not measure) 1½ tablespoons for a small <em class="ital">crêpe</em> and 3 tablespoons for a large <em class="ital">crêpe.</em> The pan should be rubbed with a buttered or oiled rag only for the first <em class="ital">crêpe,</em> no more than a film of fat remaining in the pan—too much fat will make them buckle and cook irregularly (it is only possible to flip <em class="ital">crêpes</em> if there is too much fat in the pan—so don’t bother).</p>
			<p class="Normal">Heat the pan—give it a high flame for the first few moments if you like—and then adjust the heat to medium-low. The batter should sizzle when it touches the pan. Lift the pan and, at the same time that the batter is poured in, give it a rolling motion, turning it in all directions so that the surface is coated as rapidly as possible. Add only enough to coat the pan—a bit more can always be added (or if you add too much, pour the excess immediately back into the bowl of batter). It is ready to turn when the surface becomes almost dry—tacky—and the edges curl. Turn it either by loosening it gently and picking it up with a round-tipped table knife or by picking it up by the loosened, curled edges with your fingertips. After the first 2 or 3 <em class="ital">crêpes,</em> the heat may have to be turned slightly up or down and, since the pan heats progressively, it should be removed from the heat for a very few seconds before each successive bit of batter is poured in. The batter should be stirred lightly each time it is used, as it tends to settle, becoming heavier at the bottom of the bowl. If not to be used immediately, stack the <em class="ital">crêpes</em> on a plate to keep them from drying out and, if to be kept for some time, wrap the stack in plastic and refrigerate.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page278" style="page-break-before:always;">Fritter Batter</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Appareil à Beignets</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Unlike <em class="ital">crêpe</em> batter, fritter batter must rest for an hour or so at room temperature before its beaten egg whites are gently folded in. The slightest elasticity will cause it to shrink, coating imperfectly the articles to be fried. Its thickness is, to some extent, a question of personal taste—a relatively thin batter will fry more crisply but a certain amount is inevitably dispersed in the hot oil; a thicker batter will produce a thicker and rather spongy coating on the material treated and there will be no loss in the oil. I prefer a thin batter.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">¾ cup flour	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">2 eggs (separated, whites put aside)</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">¾ cup warm beer</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Whisk the dry ingredients with the yolks, oil, and beer, working from the center out and whisking only long enough to produce a smooth batter. Leave in a warm place for at least an hour before using. Just before using, beat the egg whites until the peaks hold and fold them gently into the batter.</p>
