<h1 class="heading" id="ch04sec01"><a id="page_98"></a>Pork ribs &#38; dumplings</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This dish must have a German origin, as there is something similar called <em>strudli</em>, except sauerkraut is used in place of the potatoes. My great-grandmother cooked it and we suspect she picked it up in Bessarabia (where Moldova met Ukraine). It&#8217;s hearty, yes, but it&#8217;s also the best dumpling recipe I know.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 8&#8211;10 as a feast</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="hang">1kg (2lb) pork ribs, cut into individual ribs</p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) potatoes, peeled and quartered lengthways</p>
<p class="hang">1 large onion, sliced</p>
<p class="hang">50ml (2fl oz) apple juice or wine</p>
<p class="hang">750ml&#8211;1 litre (1&#188;&#8211;1&#190; pints) water</p>
<p class="hang">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hang">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang1"><a href="part0009.xhtml#ch06sec03">Sour Gherkins</a> or Sour Aubergines, to serve</p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Dumplings</strong></p>
<p class="hang">2 x recipe quantities of <a href="part0005.xhtml#ch02sec04"><em>Kefir</em> Dough</a></p>
<p class="hang">plain flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="hang1">4 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Heat the sunflower oil in a large, heavy-based flameproof casserole dish. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and brown them really well over a high heat in batches, making sure they colour nicely. Lift them out and set aside. Don&#8217;t wipe the pan out.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Add the potatoes to the pan and brown well on each side. Add the onion, lower the heat and sweat for 10 minutes or until soft. Add the apple juice or wine and deglaze the pan.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Place the meat and its juices back in the pan and pour over enough of the measurement water to cover. Add the bay leaf, season with salt and pepper and cook over a low heat for 2 hours or until the meat starts falling off the bones.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, make the <em>Kefir</em> dough and divide it into 4 pieces. Flour the work surface really generously and roll out one piece of the dough into a rectangle 2mm (slightly less than &#8539; inch) thick. Pour 1 tablespoon of the sunflower oil over it and rub it all over with your hand. Roll the dough up into a thick sausage shape. Twist it gently at both ends as you would if you were ringing out clothes (how retro!). Repeat with the remaining dough and oil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Slice each dough sausage across into 5cm (2 inch) pieces. You should end up with about 35 dumplings.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Now check how much liquid there is in the stew. It should be still wet, but not too much. You want your dumpling bottoms to absorb some of the juices but their tops should steam.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Whack up the heat in your stew. My gran used to call this &#8216;breathing strength&#8217; into it. It should be boiling like crazy.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>8</strong> Now swiftly but gently pop the dumplings into the stew. Once they are all in, pop the lid over. No steam should escape, so place a folded wet tea towel around the rim of the lid if you see steam escaping. Cook over a high heat for 15 minutes, then lower the heat and cook for another 30 minutes. Serve with Sour Gherkins or Sour Aubergines.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch04sec03"><a id="page_103"></a>Soviet goose noodles</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This dish is a love child of the USSR&#8217;s far-flung bribery and <em>autarkic</em> shortcomings. My Aunt Zhenia&#8217;s husband was a surgeon. Soviet healthcare was free, but a tasty or an intoxicating bribe to speed things up has always been standard practice. My Uncle was often presented with a freshly plucked goose, so fresh that its skin still smelled of singed feathers. As for the <em>autarky</em>, Soviet shops were empty at the best of times and the only pasta you could get was a grey-tinged macaroni that disintegrated on touching boiling water. So my aunt made her own noodles. This dish is something our whole extended family adopted: silky noodles, pulled goose and its juices. So simple yet so satisfying. This recipe also works well with duck &#8211; a French mallard may work better here than the fat old Gressingham.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1 small goose or 1 large duck, jointed</p>
<p class="hang">100ml (3&#189;fl oz) water</p>
<p class="hang">1 recipe quantity of <a href="part0007.xhtml#ch04sec02">Noodle Dough</a></p>
<p class="hang">sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang1">green salad or <a href="part0009.xhtml#ch06sec06">Fermented Tomatoes</a>, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the goose pieces in a large, heavy-based flameproof casserole dish. Don&#8217;t use any oil, and don&#8217;t preheat the casserole &#8211; this will ensure that the fat is rendered slowly. Fry the pieces gently on all sides until brown and a lot of the fat has been rendered. You may need to do this in batches</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> If there is a lot of fat, skim some of it off, then add the water, season the meat well with salt and pepper and cook over the lowest heat possible, covered tightly, for 2 hours or until tender and you can easily pull the meat off the bones.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Meanwhile, make the noodle dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Roll up each sheet of dough into a tube and cut across into 5mm (&#188; inch) noodles. Leave the noodles to dry for 30&#8211;60 minutes. Once the goose is ready, cook the noodles in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Either serve the meat pieces on top of the noodles, or pull the meat from the bones and mix it with the juices from the goose, then add the noodles to the meat and give them a good stir to coat them well. Serve with a simple green salad with a lemony dressing or some Fermented Tomatoes.</p>

<p class="hang">1 tablespoon sunflower oil</p>

<p class="hang">50g (2oz) butter, melted</p>

<p class="hang1">sea salt flakes</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> First make the dough. Mix the egg and water together in a bowl, then gradually add the flour and mix it in well; if you feel that there isn&#8217;t enough flour, add slightly more than the recipe states.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Knead the dough on a well-floured work surface until it stops sticking to your hands. What you are looking for is a firm (or as we call it in Ukraine, tight), elastic dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Wrap the dough in clingfilm and rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to help the gluten relax.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Next make your chosen filling.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>For the curd cheese filling</strong>, mix the cheese and egg together in a bowl and season heavily with salt &#8211; it should be slightly oversalted.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>For the cabbage filling</strong>, heat the sunflower oil in a large frying pan and gently fry the cabbage for 5 minutes. Place it in a bowl and let it cool completely.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>For the potato filling</strong>, place the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with cold water, season well with salt and bring them to the boil. Cook for 15 minutes or until they can be easily pierced with a knife. Drain the potatoes and mash them really well.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan and fry the shallots over a medium-low heat for about 15&#8211;20 minutes until starting to colour nicely. Mix the shallots with the potatoes and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the lardons in a dry frying pan and fry them over a medium heat until crispy. Tip them into a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_107"></a><strong>5</strong> Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Flour your work surface generously and roll out the dough into a 30cm (12 inch) diameter circle or until the dough is a bit less than 2mm (about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch) thick. Cut the dough into 3cm (1&#188; inch) squares &#8211; you should end up with about 20&#8211;25. Don&#8217;t throw away the offcuts. These can be cooked along with the stuffed pasta.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Repeat with the second piece of dough.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Have a well-floured tray ready. Pop 1 teaspoon of the filling into the centre of each square, fold in half diagonally to create a triangular-shaped dumpling and press the edges together to seal. Place the <em>varenyky</em> on the floured tray, making sure that they don&#8217;t touch each other.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>8</strong> For the curd cheese- and cabbage-filled <em>varenyky</em>, have a large bowl with the melted butter ready.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>9</strong> Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and carefully pop the <em>varenyky</em> in. Boil them for a couple of minutes or until they float to the surface.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>10</strong> Drain the <em>varenyky</em> well. For the curd cheese and cabbage <em>varenyky</em>, tip them into the melted butter and swirl them around, then serve with the soured cream or Greek yogurt. For the potato with crispy pork <em>varenyky</em>, sprinkle over the lardons and pour over any fat and serve.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="ch04sec05"><a id="page_109"></a>Curd cheese</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">Almost every week my mum used to suspend a muslin cloth with milk curds over the sink and the next morning we had <em>syr</em> (which literally means &#8216;cheese&#8217; in Ukrainian). Her mother did the same, as did her grandmother and so on. Eaten with some <em>smetana</em> soured cream and fresh raspberries for breakfast, or used in numerous sweet and savoury dishes, it&#8217;s a dairy product that I cannot live without. The process may seem a little complicated (it isn&#8217;t!), and raw milk is not that easy to come by, but more and more farmers&#8217; markets sell it. The satisfaction gained from making your own cheese will certainly be worth the effort.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Makes about 300g (10oz) <em>Syr</em> and 1.3 litres (2&#188; pints) whey</strong></p>
<p class="hang">1.7 litres (2&#190; pints) raw (unpasteurized) milk</p>
<p class="hang1">You will also need a piece of muslin</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Leave the raw milk in a 2-litre (3&#189;-pint) jar to go sour in a warm place in your kitchen. Check it after 24 hours. The milk should become thick like Greek yogurt but it should still be homogenous &#8211; the whey shouldn&#8217;t separate from the cream. It may take up to 2 days.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> When the milk has soured and thickened, place half an empty egg box at the bottom of a large, deep saucepan and pop the jar of soured milk, uncovered, on top of it. Then fill the pan with water to go as far up the outer sides of the jar as possible.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for an hour or until the whey separates from the cream and you can see thick cracks forming along the sides.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Take the jar out carefully and leave to cool down a little.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> While still warm, drain the curds through a muslin cloth set in a sieve over a large bowl, then leave overnight in the refrigerator. You can tie the corners of the muslin cloth together into a bag and weight it down a bit &#8211; this will help get rid of the moisture more quickly. Don&#8217;t throw away the whey &#8211; you can use it to make <a href="part0005.xhtml#ch02sec05">flatbreads</a>, so simply pour it into a clean jar and keep it in the refrigerator. Use both within 1 week.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong><small>NOTE</small>:</strong> To make a drier, salted version of this cheese (to use as you would feta), add 5g (&#188;oz) fine sea salt to the drained curds &#8211; it should taste quite salty, almost slightly oversalted, so add more salt if necessary. Place the curds in a clean muslin cloth, tie it at the top and weight it down on a tray. Leave in the refrigerator for a day or two before using.</p>

<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">These dumplings may originally be a Chinese dish that has been adopted by many a Turkic people in Central Asia. Using pork in this recipe may be sacrilege (originally fat-rumped lamb would have been used), but this is the way we make them and I will stick to the Ukrainian version this time since I love pork belly. They should be eaten with your hands, and you should try and catch the juices that accumulate inside. This requires a bit of practice, as they are eaten hot.</span></p>

<p class="hang1">melted butter, to serve</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Slice the pork into thin strips and then cut it across as finely as you can. You are basically making hand-chopped mince here. Add the onion to the meat in a bowl, season really well with salt and mix thoroughly with your hands.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Divide the Water Dough into 2 pieces and roll each piece into a sausage shape. Cut each sausage into 10 x 25g (1oz) pieces.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Roll each piece into a rough 12cm (5-inch) square. Place 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture in the centre of each square and a tiny piece of the butter on top of the filling. Pull up 2 edges of the square and press them firmly together above the meat. Do the same with the 2 other edges, creating an X shape with the edges. Now join the &#8216;ears&#8217; by joining the corners, turning the X shape into a &#8734; shape.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Lightly oil your steamer and pop the <em>manty</em> in. Steam them for 45&#8211;50 minutes or until the filling inside is cooked. Serve with some melted butter and plenty of pepper.</p>

<p class="hang">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hang">10 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="hang">5 allspice berries</p>
<p class="hang">500g (1lb) onions or shallots, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hang">1 recipe quantity of <a href="part0007.xhtml#ch04sec02">Noodle Dough</a></p>
<p class="hang">plain flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="hang1">fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Place the chicken in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Add the bay leaf, peppercorns, allspice and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer the chicken for 1 hour or until it starts falling off the bone. While the chicken is simmering, keep skimming the fat off the top and pour it into a medium saucepan. You will cook your onions in that.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> When the chicken is cooked through, drain it into a large bowl, reserving the stock, and let the meat cool, then take the meat off the bone.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Place the onions in the saucepan of chicken fat with some salt and pepper and cook over a low heat for 1 hour until they become meltingly soft.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, make the <a href="part0007.xhtml#ch04sec02">noodle dough</a>, then roll out into 4 sheets following the instructions on.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> Have a well-floured tray ready. Cut each pasta sheet into strips about 5cm (2 inches) wide and then cut each strip into diamonds about 5cm (2 inches) across.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>6</strong> Mix the chicken with the onions and gently reheat.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>7</strong> Bring the reserved chicken stock to the boil, pop in your pasta and cook for 2 minutes until tender. Drain the pasta and mix it with the onions and meat, then serve.</p>

<h1 class="heading1">&#1052;&#1072;&#1084;&#1072;&#1083;&#1080;&#1075;&#1072; | <em>Mamalyga</em></h1>
<h1 class="heading" id="ch04sec09"><a id="page_117"></a>Moldovan polenta</h1>
<p class="paral1"><span class="grey">This is an incredibly comforting dish. If you love polenta, you will fall in love with this, too. In western Ukraine, the Hutsul people make something very similar and call it <em>banosh</em>. Any leftovers can be saut&#233;ed in butter until crispy.</span></p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Serves 2 as a main</strong></p>
<p class="hang">750ml (1&#188; pints) water</p>
<p class="hang">50g (2oz) butter</p>
<p class="hang">175g (6oz) coarse yellow cornmeal</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) <em><a href="part0008.xhtml#pg136">Salo</a></em> or pancetta, sliced into lardons</p>
<p class="hang">100g (3&#189;oz) salty sheep&#8217;s cheese, crumbled</p>
<p class="hang1">fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>1</strong> Fill a large saucepan with the measurement water, add the butter, season with salt and pepper and bring to the boil.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>2</strong> Add the cornmeal in a continuous, gentle stream, stirring all the time over a low heat. Keep stirring for about 10 minutes, then put on the lowest heat possible and cover with a lid. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally so it doesn&#8217;t stick to the pan. It will also start forming baby volcanoes, so watch out that it doesn&#8217;t spit in your face.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>3</strong> Let the <em>mamalyga</em> rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out on to a plate.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, add the lardons to a cold dry frying pan and fry until crispy.</p>
<p class="para1"><strong>5</strong> My grandmothers used a thread to cut the <em>mamalyga</em>. You can use a knife if you prefer. Then pinch a little bit with your fingers and dip it into the cheese or lardons, or both!</p>
