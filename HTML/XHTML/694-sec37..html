<p class="nonindent">Lomo en adobo, pork loin in adobo, is served throughout Spain. But I live in the American South, where barbecue ribs rule. More specifically, I’m in North Carolina, home to vinegary barbecue sauces, my favorite type. Given my upbringing in Carolina-style barbecue, my adobo finds a welcome balance of smoke, spice, sourness, and sweetness and is slathered on ribs. The instructions below call for the oven so that you can cook these year round. If you have a smoker and know how to use it, do. If you don’t eat pork, but want to try the sauce, smear it all over chicken and roast or grill it.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup pimentón (sweet smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoon dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon plus 1½ teaspoons ground coriander</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup plus 1 tablespoon reserve sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup honey</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 piquillo peppers</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 (3½-pound) racks St. Louis-style pork spare ribs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 250°F. LINE A HALF-SHEET</span> pan with foil and fit with a wire rack.</p>
<p class="indent">Puree the pimentón, thyme, coriander, cumin, garlic, vinegar, honey, piquillos, oil, and 1 tablespoon salt in a blender until smooth, scraping the bowl if needed. Transfer one-third of the adobo sauce to an airtight container and reserve.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sprinkle the ribs on all sides with 4 teaspoons salt and season with pepper. Rub the remaining adobo sauce all over the ribs and place side by side, meat sides up, on the rack in the pan.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake for 2 hours. Brush the reserved adobo sauce all over the ribs and arrange on the rack meat side up again. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the ribs, then cover with foil. Bake until the meat is very tender and pulls away from the ends of the bones, about 2 hours longer.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Remove the ribs from the oven, uncover, and carefully turn bone side up. Position a rack 6 inches from the broiler heat source and adjust the oven heat to broil.</p>
<p class="indent">When the broiler is hot, broil the ribs until brown and crackly, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the ribs meat side up and broil until the sauce is caramelized and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut into ribs and serve.</p>
