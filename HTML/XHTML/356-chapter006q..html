<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">A rich mixture of meats, vegetables, and beans simmered together for hours, cassoulet is perhaps the best consolation in cold weather. This hearty, one-pot dish is perfect for a party, especially since not only can you make it the day before, but it’s also better if you do. Note that the beans have to be soaked overnight before cooking, so be sure to plan ahead.</p></div>

<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Heat the olive</strong> oil in a very large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the ribs, sausages, and bacon lardons to the pot and season aggressively with salt and pepper. Cook the meats, turning them occasionally, until browned on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes altogether. A lot of liquid will release from the meats while they’re cooking—you want to let them do that and then be patient while the liquid evaporates and they turn a lovely, dark brown. This is where so much of the amazing flavor will come from in the final dish, so hang in there even if it feels like it’s taking a while.</p>
<p>Add all of the vegetables to the pot along with the thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are beginning to soften and the tomatoes have released much of their liquid, about 10 minutes. Add the drained beans to the pot and cover the mixture with water (it will take 3 or 4 cups depending on the depth of your pot). Stir in a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the beans are tender and much of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 hours. While the cassoulet is cooking, be sure to skim off any foam that rises to the surface.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to serve, preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p>Place the duck legs on a rack set over a baking sheet and roast in the oven until the meat is warm and the skin crisps, about 20 minutes. Set the duck legs aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, top the cassoulet with the bread crumbs, transfer the uncovered pot to the oven, and bake until the bread crumbs are toasted and crisp, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Serve the cassoulet in deep bowls, and tuck a crispy duck leg into each portion.</p></div>
