<p class="nonindent">If you go to a really classic tapas bar, you’ll see this dish on display, along with croquetas and tortilla. Waiters grab a spoon and drop small mounds as they’re ordered. In traditional tapas service, customers can then order a full portion if they’ve enjoyed their small taste. Even if you’re going to dole this out in smaller portions as an appetizer or as part of a larger meal, you’re going to want a glass of Albariño wine with it.</p>
<p class="indent">It goes without saying that you should find the freshest seafood possible. If it’s stone crab season in Florida, you should track down some of those succulent claws. They’re my favorite. Otherwise, king crab is nice because of its mild sweetness, or Dungeness with its sea saltiness. Whichever variety you choose, you can easily remove the meat by cutting through the shell with kitchen shears.</p>

<p class="nonindent">F<span class="small">ILL A LARGE BOWL WITH</span> 2 <span class="small"> CUPS ICE,</span> 1 cup <span class="small">COLD</span> water, and 2 tablespoons salt. Set a colander in the bowl. Combine the bay leaf, peppercorns, smashed garlic, 2 tablespoons salt, and 8 cups water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer. Add the scallops and cook for 1 minute, then transfer to the colander in the ice bath. Bring the water back to a simmer, add the shrimp, and cook for 30 seconds. Transfer to the colander in the ice bath. When the scallops and shrimp are cold, lift out the colander and let the seafood drain. Reserve the poaching liquid.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Whisk the vinegar in a medium bowl. While whisking, add the oil in a slow, steady stream, then whisk in ¼ cup of the poaching liquid and ½ teaspoon salt. Stir in the red and green peppers, onion, and minced garlic. Taste and add more salt if you’d like.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Combine the scallops, shrimp, crab, and vinaigrette in a large bowl. Gently toss until well-mixed. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Gently toss again and serve.</p>
