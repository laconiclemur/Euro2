<p class="nonindent">Rom cremat comes from the fishermen villages of the Costa Brava. It started as a warming drink for fishermen deep at sea, then made its way on to land, where it became a staple of village celebrations. At the festivities that commemorate the villages, rom cremat burns in pots throughout the old streets while everyone dances and sings habaneras. The tradition extends only as far as the civil war, when many Spaniards immigrated to Cuba and developed a taste for rum and the swaying songs of the island. When they returned, they brought this drink with them. The dramatic flames not only convey good times but also burn off much of the alcohol and distill the rum’s full-bodied flavor. A bottle of rum for 4 to 6 people may sound like a lot, but most of it disappears before it’s divvied up.</p>
<p class="indent">If the idea of setting a pot of liquor on fire sounds a little dangerous, it’s because it is. Be sure to follow the instructions here and keep in mind that you’re making this drink at your own risk.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 750-ml bottle gold rum, such as Bacardi</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons coffee beans</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 lemon, zest removed with a vegetable peeler</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cinnamon stick</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">STIR THE RUM, SUGAR, COFFEE BEANS, LEMON</span> zest, and cinnamon stick in a large Dutch oven. Set on the grate of an outdoor kettle grill without any charcoal or anything else that can ignite. Make sure the grill is far from any trees, shrubs, or other flammable objects. With a long lighter, ignite the rum. Let the flame burn for 10 minutes, then extinguish by putting on the lid to snuff out the fire.</p>
<p class="indent">After the flame completely dies out, immediately divide among small cups, leaving the coffee beans, zest, and cinnamon behind. Serve hot.</p>
