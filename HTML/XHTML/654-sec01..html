<p class="nonindent">In Catalonia, every Spanish meal starts with pan con tomate: toast with olive oil, garlic, and, of course, tomato. It can be eaten alone with a glass of wine or served as part of an appetizer board that includes charcuterie, anchovies, and cheese.</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="" src="images/22-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO MAKE IT IS SIMPLE</span>. All you have to do is set out toasted split ciabattas or baguettes, halved ripe tomatoes, halved peeled garlic cloves, good extra-virgin olive oil, and salt (a nice, flaky one such as Maldon or fleur de sel, if you have it). Instruct your guests to lightly rub the cut sides of the garlic on the bread (be careful, you can overdo it), then rub and squeeze the cut sides of the tomatoes on the toasted bread hard enough to get a coating of the seeds, juice, and pulp. Drizzle with the oil, sprinkle with salt, and eat! A few people can make it for the whole table or each person can put together her own. The key is to eat it as soon as it’s done so the bread stays crisp and the tomatoes juicy.</p>
<p class="nonindent">If you’re cooking for a group of eight or more people, this technique can be kind of a pain. A good dinner party trick is the one we use in the restaurant. Make a batch of the Grated Fresh Tomatoes (<a href="sec24.xhtml#page86">here</a>) the night before. When you’re ready to serve, preheat the broiler to high. Slice a large ciabatta loaf in half, splitting it as you would if you were turning it into a sandwich. Place it cut sides up on a half-sheet pan and broil until well-toasted. Flip over and toast the crust sides as well. Flip again and transfer to a cutting board. Immediately spoon the tomato mixture on top, spreading to the very edges of the loaf. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Cut into pieces and serve.</p>
<p class="nonindent">If you happen to be grilling, you definitely should grill the bread instead of broiling. Pan con tomate goes great with grilled foods or as the accompaniment to any dish. You can even use it as the base for sandwiches (<a href="sec76.xhtml#page223">here</a>). You can’t mess up this recipe. The only thing you can do to make it even better is to use the best ingredients you can find.</p>
