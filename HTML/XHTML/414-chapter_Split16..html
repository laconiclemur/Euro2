<p class="tx2"><b>Let me shout a big "merci" to all of those without whom this cookbook would have been nothing but a distant project: Chetna, Stuart, Céline, Emily, Dan, Wendy, Becks, Becci, Alex and everyone at Quadrille.</b></p>
<p class="tx2"><b>A special mention to Jamie Oliver, Donal Skehan and Jacques Pépin for those (very) kind words.</b></p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Legit credits to all my family for being so supportive, cheerful when I need it, always there for me.</b></p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Lovely hug to my wife and a final cheeky high five to Sacha, my man.</b></p>
