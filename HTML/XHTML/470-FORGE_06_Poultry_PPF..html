			<p class="QuotePara">“I grew up in Berkeley, and my grandparents raised chickens nearby in Cotati, California. Our farm was surrounded by turkey farmers, ranchers raising sheep, and other livestock. I was weaned on chickens, so to speak. I attended cooking school in Paris and while there I ate delicious poultry—goose, mallards, poussin, and so on. It was in England a couple of years later where I developed an affinity to game birds. In-season grouse, woodcock, pheasant, and the like would appear on menus. It was a taste that I loved. Later at Michael’s in Santa Monica, I was lucky to have purveyors that delivered me delicious quail, pigeons, and ducks. But the chickens we received were not in the same league. It was only when I moved to New York and Marc’s dad introduced me to a superior bird that I found chicken nirvana. These chickens were magnificent: They were healthy and extremely tasty. I believed these chickens were truly the equal to the poulet de Bresse I had eaten in France, maybe better. So by the sourcing of these fine birds, and with the amazing assistance of Larry Forgione, I was able to serve a nice charcoal-grilled chicken, which caught New York by surprise. New Yorkers pride themselves on the best of all things, and my JW Chicken at Jams, at $23 (1984 prices) seemed to captivate them; and so solidified my reputation.”</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This was one of the dishes that came out of the <span class="ital">Next Iron Chef</span> finale. When I found out the theme of the battle was Thanksgiving, I immediately decided to cook a meal using those ingredients that appeared at the very first Thanksgiving in 1621. This duck sausage dish was a hit with the judges: Donatella Arpaia actually called it “one of those perfect bites”! However, during the actual cooking segment, we were nervous that the sausage part might have gone horribly awry. My sous-chef, Barry, is quoted in his television debut as saying, “Chef, I think we might have a problem.” When he removed the sausage from the water, he thought that the sausage hadn’t set. This, as you can imagine, would have been catastrophic for the season finale. Good for all of us (but mostly him), there was no problem and the sausage had set beautifully. This is a great recipe to try your hand at if you don’t have an immersion circulator, but are fascinated with the process. You can poach the sausage in simmering water for ten minutes; in order to keep the temperature constant, keep a bowl of ice cubes by the stove.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck Sausage</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium bowl, combine the duck with the garlic, salt, and Pierre Poivre. Pass the mixture through a meat grinder. (If you don’t own a meat grinder, you can ask your butcher to coarsely grind the duck and mix it with minced garlic, salt, and the Pierre Poivre.) Combine the duck mixture with the sriracha and maple syrup. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat an immersion circulator filled with water until the water temperature registers 190ºF. Shape 4 sausages out of the ground duck mixture and wrap each sausage tightly in plastic wrap. Place each sausage into a small vacuum-seal bag and seal the bags.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page201"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Poach the duck sausage in the immersion circulator for 10 minutes. (Alternatively, you can place the sausages in 4 resealable bags, squeeze out as much air as possible, seal the bags, and poach for 10 minutes in a pot of 190ºF water. Monitor the water temperature throughout the cooking time and keep a bowl of ice cubes nearby in case you need to lower the water temperature.) Transfer the bag(s) to an ice bath, and chill until the sausage is set, 10 to 15 minutes. You can make the sausage up to 2 days ahead and refrigerate it until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Currant Reduction</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a small, nonreactive saucepan, combine the port, currants, mint, and pepper over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat to medium, and reduce until the liquid resembles thick syrup, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Do not refrigerate.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cornbread</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place a piece of buttered parchment paper, butter side down, in a 9 x 13 x 1-inch baking pan and lightly butter the top of the parchment. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt until thoroughly combined. In a small saucepan set over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Do not let the butter boil. In a medium bowl set over a towel, whisk together the milk and eggs until well combined. Slowly drizzle the melted butter into the milk-egg mixture, whisking continuously until emulsified. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix to incorporate, until you get a thick batter. Pour the batter into the baking pan and smooth out the top with an offset spatula. Gently tap the pan against the counter a couple of times to remove any air bubbles. Bake the cornbread for 10 to 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Transfer the cornbread to a cooling rack (keep the oven at 350ºF) and let cool to room temperature. Using a 2-inch ring cutter, cut the cornbread into discs. You need 12 cornbread discs; you will get about 24. Transfer the cornbread discs to an airtight container.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck Skin Cracklins</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Using the back of a knife, scrape off any excess fat from the duck skin. Place the skin on a Silpat or parchment paper–lined baking sheet. Place another Silpat or piece of parchment paper over the skin and top with another sheet pan of the same size. Bake at 350ºF until the skin is crispy, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Keep in mind that the fat will render and will be in between the baking pans. Transfer the duck skin to a cooling rack set over a baking pan; leave the oven on. Strain the rendered duck fat and reserve it for another use (you can use it in place of butter or oil, and whatever you cook in duck fat will be that much more delicious).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>While the duck skin is in the oven, in a small pot, combine the honey and soy sauce and bring to a boil over medium heat. Immediately remove from the heat and set aside. Brush the crispy duck skin with the honey-soy mixture, and let cool in a dry place.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Swiss Chard</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the chard leaves in the boiling water for 10 seconds. Immediately drain the leaves and transfer them to an ice bath. Let cool, and squeeze out any excess water. Lay the leaves flat on the counter or a flat surface.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Squeeze the duck sausages out of the plastic bags and distribute them among the chard leaves, placing them in the center of the leaves. Roll the leaves around the sausages like a spring roll. Transfer the wrapped sausages to a shallow baking pan and warm in the oven until heated through, about 8 minutes. Transfer the sausages to a cutting board and slice each sausage into 3 pieces.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>In a large sauté pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat until it foams. Add 12 cornbread discs and cook until lightly browned on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side (you may need to do this in batches). Divide the cornbread discs among 4 warmed plates. Top each cornbread disc with a piece of sausage. Sprinkle some flaky sea salt over the sausages, and drizzle the Currant Reduction on top. Top with micro watercress, if desired, radishes, Duck Skin Cracklins, and a drizzle of the reserved duck fat.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>One year, I found myself in San Juan over Christmas, and it was the first time I had been away from my family during the holiday. Despite being alone, I didn’t want the holiday to be any less special—I was on a gorgeous island, surrounded by incredible ingredients. So I decided to make something festive and a little decadent: a truffle-stuffed chicken!</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">This is a perfect meal to make when you just want to celebrate life and are full of joy. It’s both comforting and exotic—which makes it perfect for a Christmas dinner. A beautiful, succulent bird, luxurious truffles, and flavorful jus—what else do you we need in life except, maybe, someone to share the chicken with?</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">You can choose one of the many sides in this book to serve with this chicken; we recommend the Basic Potato Puree and the Mustard Greens, but feel free to play around and find the sides you like the best.</p>

			<li class="il">1 black truffle</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chicken Jus</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Cook the Small Game Jus over medium-high heat until it has reduced to about 2 cups, 30 to 45 minutes. Set aside until ready to use. (If using stock instead, see <a href="#makeitfaster">“Make It Faster,”</a> below.)</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the chicken Stuffing</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large bowl, mix together the Mushroom Duxelles, butter, panko, shallot, truffle, rosemary, and salt to taste until well combined. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chicken</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Preheat the oven to 450ºF; position the rack in the middle. Using a sharp carving knife, remove the wishbone and wings from the chicken (you can reserve these parts to make Small Game Jus). Thoroughly pat the chicken dry inside and out with paper towels. Season the inside with salt, pepper, and a few drops of the truffle oil. Using your fingers, gently separate the skin from the breast (make sure you do this for the whole breast), creating one big air pocket between the skin and breast (be careful not to rip the skin). Place some of the Chicken Stuffing in between the skin and breast and press down on the skin to evenly distribute the stuffing—you want to wind up with about a ¼-inch-thick coat of the stuffing all around the breast. Stuff the sage, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and garlic inside the bird. Truss the chicken and season the outside with salt and pepper, and let the chicken sit at room temperature for at least 25 and up to 40 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page206"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and place the chicken on top of the bread. Roast the chicken for 20 minutes or until the breast skin is beginning to get golden brown and blister slightly. Reduce the oven temperature to 350ºF and roast for an additional 20 to 30 minutes or until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced under the thigh or until the internal thigh temperature registers 190ºF on a meat thermometer. You can also test the doneness by trying to twist the drumstick. When it gives easily, the chicken is done.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest at least 15 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, warm the Chicken Jus over medium-low heat until just simmering. Take the leftover juices in the pan from the chicken and add them to the jus. Carve the chicken, and serve with the Basic Potato Puree and Mustard Greens  or your favorite sides for roasted chicken. Shave some of the black truffle on top and serve with the jus.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="makeitfaster"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you definitely want a jus of sorts but don’t have time to start with the Small Game Jus, find a store-bought chicken stock you like, and reduce it by half to get a concentrated flavor.</p>

We decided to lightly pickle them and pair them with duck—and it worked beautifully. For the pickled peaches, you want a slightly underripe (read: firm) peach in order for it to hold its form. This would also work well with Honeycrisp apples. And here’s a tip for the candied bacon: It will keep for a few days, so when you make it, I recommend making more than what you need.</p>

			<li class="il">Kosher salt</li>
			<li class="il">1 ounce (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
			<li class="il">Smoked flaky sea salt or regular flaky sea salt (Maldon makes both)</li>
			<li class="il"><a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Herb">Basil oil</a> or your best extra-virgin olive oil</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Candied Bacon</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 180ºF; position the rack in the middle. In a small saucepot set over high heat, combine the sugar and sriracha with 1 cup of water and bring to a boil. Remove the syrup from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Using a pastry brush, brush the bacon slices with the syrup on both sides. Place a baking rack over a baking sheet and spray both with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer the bacon slices to the rack. Bake for 4 hours or until the bacon is crispy and glazed—it should look almost like glass. Transfer to a cooling rack set in a dry place and let the bacon cool for 1 hour. Set aside until needed. Raise the oven temperature to 200ºF.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the braised Almonds</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a medium ovenproof saucepot, combine the almonds, stock, barbecue sauce, thyme, bay leaf, and salt with 1 cup of water. Cover and transfer the pot to the oven. Braise for about 4 hours or until the almonds are soft. Drain and transfer the almonds to a cooling rack and allow them to cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, toss with the mustard greens, and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pickled Peaches</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Quarter and pit the peach. Slice into thin half-moon slices. Transfer the slices to a nonreactive container.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a small, dry pan, toast the coriander, cumin, and peppercorns over low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer the toasted spices to a piece of double-plied cheesecloth, add the thyme and bay leaf, and tie the edges of the cheesecloth together to form a sachet.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page209"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, turmeric, salt, and spice sachet with ½ cup of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Pour the pickling liquid over the peach slices, add the jalapeño, and let sit for 4 hours at room temperature.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a medium, deep saucepot set over medium-high heat, combine the Duck Glaze, honey, soy sauce, rosemary, and ginger. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and set aside. Be careful: As honey heats up, it rises.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom and set it over high heat. Season the duck with salt and pepper. Just before the oil starts to smoke, place the duck breasts (do not crowd the pan), skin side down, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Continuously drain and reserve the fat from the pan to ensure searing while the fat is rendering. Cook the duck for about 8 minutes or until the skin is crispy and the fat renders out. Add the glaze to the pan along with ¼ cup of the reserved fat and cook for 1 minute. (If you are working in batches, portion out your glaze accordingly.) Flip the duck and baste with the glaze and fat for 1 minute more. Transfer the duck to a plate, skin side up, and pour the contents of the pan over the meat. </p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>In a small saucepot, warm 16 peach slices with 1 cup of their pickling liquid over medium heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peaches to the bowl with the reserved almonds and mustard greens, toss together, and season with salt. Divide among 4 warmed plates. Reserve the warmed pickling liquid.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Add the butter to the reserved pickling liquid and whisk to emulsify. Drizzle the emulsion around the peaches, almonds, and mustard greens. Slice the duck breasts and plate the slices on top. Place one or two pieces of the Candied Bacon over each duck breast, and finish with a pinch of the smoked flaky sea salt, basil oil, and a little glaze from the duck.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Joe Jurgielewicz &amp; Son, Ltd.</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Joey Jurgielewicz</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Joey calls himself the International Duck Promoter—and it is his goal to get more people to eat duck. And with Jurgielewicz duck, he will most definitely succeed. It is, by far, the best duck I’ve ever tasted.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Twenty-six years ago, Joey’s father, a Cornell veterinary school graduate, started raising white Pekin duck. Decades prior, Joey’s grandfather had a duck farm under the same name, but it had been sold years earlier. While working at a veterinary practice, Joey’s father missed raising ducks. “It was always the ducks, the ducks, the ducks,” Joey laughs. So after being a practicing veterinarian for a few years, Joey’s father decided to return to his family trade—and start a duck farm, Joe Jurgielewicz &amp; Son.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">He found the perfect farm space in the Blue Mountains in Pennsylvania, Because it’s a small, family-run farm, Joey and his family take care of everything: from picking up the eggs at five in the morning, to hatching them in their own hatchery, to raising, processing and distributing them throughout North America. There is work, real work, every single day.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">“Just because it’s Christmas,” says Joey, “doesn’t mean that the ducks will stop laying eggs. They don’t take days off, and neither do we.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Pekin duck is an American duck that is actually the same breed of duck that has been raised and eaten in China for over 2,000 years. It just happens to be the best breed of duck for the North American environment. It is also moist, tender, and flavorful. When people turn up their noses at the thought of duck, they are thinking of gamy, poor-quality duck—most definitely not Jurgielewicz bird.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">If you treat the animal right, if you feed it the best food, you will get an amazing product. And when you bring it into the kitchen, magic will happen. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Even before he started to work on his father’s farm, while still in college, Joey had a quart of rendered duck fat in his mini fridge in his dorm room. At first, his roommates thought it was disgusting, but pretty soon Joey realized that they were quietly raiding his duck fat supply to roast vegetables or fry eggs. Without even trying, he had quietly started a duck revolution that has now become his life's mission.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 2  </span>This chicken is a perfect example of what happens when there aren’t enough cooks in the kitchen and you need to make do with what you have. In 2009, we were short-staffed, going through a recession, and just trying to survive. I wore many hats—the butcher, the meat cook, just to name a few—and didn’t have time to season the chickens when the orders were coming in during dinnertime. To manage, I started to season the skin in the mornings when I got in, and the chickens would sit in the fridge all day, curing in the salt. This act of pure necessity turned our chicken into one of the most ordered dishes—and something we’ve become known for. I also learned that this was the very trick Zuni Café had used in creating their famed roasted chicken (which happens to be the best chicken I’ve ever had). By sitting in the fridge all day, the salt penetrates the skin, seasoning it, and the dry refrigerator air allows the skin to dry. Dry chicken skin combined with a hot pan gives you the tastiest, crispiest chicken skin you can possibly imagine.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Prepare the Chicken:</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>The day before cooking, separate the drumsticks from the chicken and reserve in the refrigerator, covered. <a href="FORGE_06_Poultry_PPF.xhtml#debone">Debone the chicken</a> (or have your local butcher do this for you), remove the wings, and fillet the breast and thigh meat, leaving the two intact.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Thoroughly dry the breast and thigh meat. Season the chicken skin side with salt. Season the flesh side with salt and pepper. Using a Microplane grater, finely zest 1 lemon, so that the zest falls directly on the chicken flesh (that way the oils from the peels are not wasted and land directly on the chicken). Refrigerate the seasoned breast and thigh meat, uncovered, overnight or up to 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page215"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Peel the other lemon without getting any of the pith. In a medium pot set over medium heat, combine the stock, rosemary, and lemon peel, and bring to a simmer. Add the reserved drumsticks, and gently poach in the simmering chicken stock for 30 minutes. Transfer the drumsticks to a dish and cover with the poaching liquid. Allow to sit at room temperature for 45 minutes, and place in the refrigerator and allow the drumsticks to cool overnight in the poaching liquid.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Rosemary Potatoes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Before you start cooking the chicken on day 2, using kitchen twine, tie the thyme and bay leaf together. Set aside. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover generously with cold water. Add the garlic, the herb bundle, and a healthy pinch of salt. Place the pot over medium-high heat and cook the potatoes until fork-tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the water and let cool to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut each potato in half lengthwise and gently smash each one—they should look like little pancakes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>While the chicken is in the oven, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to coat the bottom of the pan. Heat over high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the potatoes, lower the heat to medium, and cook the potatoes until a nice crust begins to form on the bottom. Add the butter and toss it with the potatoes. Once the butter begins to brown and the potatoes are golden brown all over, add the parsley and rosemary, and season to taste with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Transfer the potatoes to a warmed plate.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Cook the Chicken</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Remove the drumsticks from the poaching liquid and thoroughly pat them dry. Season the drumsticks with salt and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Preheat the oven to 425ºF; position the rack in the middle. Remove the cured breast and thigh meat from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for at least 15 minutes prior to cooking.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>To an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the whole chicken, add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Set the pan over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the chicken (minus the drumsticks), skin side down, and shake the pan to prevent sticking. Immediately reduce the heat to medium. Place a brick on top of the chicken so that it is pushing down on all sides. Once the edges begin to brown, transfer the chicken to the oven and roast for 15 to 18 minutes. The chicken skin should look golden brown and begin to crisp up.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Transfer the chicken back to the stovetop and add the drumsticks to the pan. Raise the heat to medium, remove the brick, and cook the chicken until the skin is crispy, about 5 minutes.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Crispy Shallots</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Prepare the <a href="FORGE_03_Shellfish_PPF.xhtml#crispyshallots">Crispy Shallots as directed</a>.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Spicy Broccoli Rabe</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>While the chicken is in the oven, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Trim the stems and discard the wilted outer leaves. Blanch the broccoli rabe in the boiling water for 10 seconds. Transfer the broccoli rabe to a large plate and let cool to room temperature. Set aside. When ready to serve, add enough olive oil to a skillet to cover the bottom of the pan and warm it over medium heat. Add the broccoli rabe and cook until warmed through. Season with salt and the red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">finish the chicken</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Place the chicken on top of the Rosemary Potatoes, skin side up, and add the drumsticks to either side.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span>Add the butter, capers, and shallots to the pan that the chicken was cooked in and cook until the solids begin to brown. Stir in the parsley and red pepper flakes.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">15.	</span>Place the Spicy Broccoli Rabe on top of the chicken. Pour the caper butter over the contents of the plate and serve immediately. Top with crispy shallots. </p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>While the Balsamic Reduction cooks, in a small saucepot, warm the oil over low heat until shimmering. Add the curry paste and cook for 2 minutes, to wake up the spices. Add the beer, molasses, peanut butter, lemon juice, vinegar, chili powder, garlic, mustard, cayenne, and bay leaf, and bring the liquid to a gentle simmer. Cook at a gentle simmer for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf, and using an immersion blender, puree the mixture until smooth. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page218">Make the Cashew Crumble</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>While the Balsamic Reduction and Peanut Sauce cook, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Toss the cashews with the curry powder and just enough Blended Oil to coat, and transfer the nuts to a shallow baking sheet. Bake for about 8 minutes or until the cashews are toasted and fragrant. Transfer the nuts to a small bowl and let cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Place the cooled cashews in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, and process the nuts for 5 seconds. Transfer them to a paper towel–lined tray, and set aside in a dry place until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Squab</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Cut off the squab breasts (see <a href="#note1">Note</a>) and gently separate the skin from the flesh with either your pinky or the back of a small spoon, being careful not to tear the skin. Place a layer of the foie gras terrine underneath the skin on the flesh and season the breasts with salt.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Cooking Instructions</span> (see <a href="#step8">step 8</a> for Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions): Preheat an immersion circulator filled with water until the water temperature registers 140ºF. Place the breasts, skin-side up, in a single layer into a medium-size vacuum-seal bag. Seal the bag and poach in the immersion circulator for 30 minutes. Remove the bag from the water and let sit for 4 minutes before removing the squab breasts from the bag. Reserve the cooking liquid that pools inside the bag.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Add enough oil to a sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil begins to smoke, add the squab breasts, skin side down. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the skin is browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes, basting the breasts with the pan juices as the squab cook. Set the squab breasts aside. (Proceed to step 9.)</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="step8"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions: </span>Preheat the oven to 375ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add enough oil to an ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil begins to smoke, add the squab breasts. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the breasts until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake the squab breasts until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the squab breasts to rest while you prepare the rest of the dish.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Place the brioche slices in a sauté pan, set over medium heat, and toast on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Set the toasted brioche slices aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Strawberry Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Soak the baby fennel in ice water for 30 minutes, drain, and pat dry. In a nonreactive bowl, combine the fennel, strawberries, mint, and basil. Right before serving, drizzle the salad with some oil and vinegar, and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Drizzle a little Balsamic Reduction over 4 plates and spoon some of the Peanut Sauce in the center of each. On each plate, layer a slice of toasted brioche, followed by the Strawberry Salad, and top with the squab breasts. Finish with the Cashew Crumble and basil flowers, if using, and sprinkle with the fennel fronds and flaky sea salt.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note1"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Make the squab in the oven and serve it with the Peanut Sauce and Strawberry Salad.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note2"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>You will have the rest of the squab left over—no need for it to go to waste. Remove the legs and confit them for another use, maybe <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page182">Tortellini d’Avanzi</a>. You can also make a jus (see <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Small">Small Game Jus</a>) from the bones and keep it in the freezer to flavor sauces or make rich gravy.</p>
