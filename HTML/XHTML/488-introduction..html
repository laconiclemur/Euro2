			<p class="FMTX1">When I worked at Jamie Oliver’s restaurant Fifteen on Old Street in London, he nicknamed me “Frenchie” because I was the only French person in the kitchen. The nickname stuck (new members of the staff never even learned my real name), and that’s how it came to pass that my restaurant in Paris is called Frenchie.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">At Fifteen, every year we’d hire fifteen kids from disadvantaged backgrounds and train them in the kitchen. I identified with these young apprentices, having had my own share of troubled times. I’d started to cook when I was fifteen, in the orphanage where I grew up, in Nantes.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">The chef was off on weekends, and I was more than happy to volunteer to cook: it gave me a break from the craziness of the orphanage courtyard. The first dish I ever made was <em>escalope normande</em>, veal with mushrooms and cream. Although it was probably poorly executed, the joy it generated in the other kids was enough to persuade me to enroll in cooking school. To this day, pleasing people, seeing the smiles on their faces when they take their first bite of a dish I have made, fills me with pleasure.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">I entered cooking school in Brittany at sixteen, sporting long hair, a skull ring, and a Metallica patch on my jean jacket—I thought I looked so cool! But the teachers didn’t agree. I was quickly dispatched to the barber and then to buy a couple of cheap suits, some black socks, and a pair of black shoes. My love affair with hard rock went the way of the long hair.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">I had a lot to sort out in my life back then. That I got through my studies was nothing short of a miracle, but I did graduate, having learned the basics of French cuisine, restaurant health and sanitation rules, and the ins and outs of the hospitality business. With good luck, I soon landed a job in London with David Nicholls at the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge. It was my first experience working as part of a large brigade with very high standards. I realize now that my passion for cooking was born then and there: it was the first time in my life that I felt part of something—a clan, a posse, a family, all centered on cooking. I was happy to get up and go to work, and I learned something new every day. That was my best cooking school ever. And I loved the energy of London, the curries served on Brick Lane and the full English breakfast at the greasy spoon where we would go on our days off, after a night of drinking.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">When the restaurant closed for renovation, I got myself transferred to the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong, where I worked at Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s Vong. The menu was a perfect fusion of French and Asian cooking, foie gras and mango, duck and tamarind, and all kinds of crazy things I had never seen before. I had a blast in Hong Kong, but I had to return to London to be part of the reopening team there. We had a brand-new kitchen with a wok, a tandoori oven, and a wood-fired oven. It was awesome: I was cooking new dishes and discovering new ingredients every day. But I didn’t get on very well with the new head chef. One day he verbally abused me so badly that I packed up my knives, handed him my apron, and left.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Years of London weather had left me yearning for the sun, so I flew off to Andalusia and worked on the beach in a <em>chiringuito</em> (beach bar), making fresh fish <em>a la plancha</em>, octopus <em>a la gallega</em>, tortillas, and all sorts of tapas. Cooking barefoot in the sand felt good, but I needed more of a challenge. That test came in the person of Arthur Potts Dawson, previously a sous chef at The River Café in London, who was opening a restaurant in Marbella. I became his sous chef, and the food we did there was inspired by The Café: simple regional Italian cuisine made with great fresh ingredients. It was my first real exposure to Italian cooking. We even had a wood-burning oven and turned out great pizza. What a year!</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Then Arthur was offered a good position in London, where I followed him. That’s when I landed at Fifteen, where I eventually became head chef. It’s difficult enough to run a restaurant with a team of dedicated chefs—imagine having a team of kids struggling with the simple idea of having to work every day! But we did very well, and when I see that most of them are now professional chefs, spread out around the world, it makes me proud. I also learned respect for ingredients from Jamie’s “less is more” approach, and I learned how to keep a business afloat and manage a staff—all with the thought of opening my own place one day. But I wasn’t ready, and New York beckoned.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Once I arrived in New York City, I tried out at a few restaurants, and when Michael Anthony, the newly appointed chef at Gramercy Tavern, offered me a job, I jumped at the chance to work there. My girlfriend (and soon-to-be wife), Marie, and I found a nice little apartment in Greenpoint, a Polish neighborhood in Brooklyn. When I came out of the subway, I felt as if I were in Warsaw, with everybody speaking Polish and delis selling Polish charcuterie and other specialties. I immersed myself in New York’s rich melting-pot culture. Japan, Korea, Italy, and Mexico, to name a few, were all less than a forty-minute subway ride away, and it was a great inspiration to have products from all over the world so readily available.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">On my days off, Marie and I would try different restaurants, from three-stars to little Chinese joints, from newly opened places to established older restaurants. Traveling farther afield, we ate our way through Chicago, San Francisco and the Napa Valley, Florida, and upstate New York. All these experiences gave me more and more ideas about what my own place could be like. Everywhere I went, I took notes in my little Moleskine book about what I found great in each place, from menu holders to the lighting to food, of course, as well as the organization of the dining rooms and menus. </p>
			<p class="FMTX">My time in Spain was an advantage in the Gramercy Tavern kitchen. Although my Spanish was basic, I knew enough to be able to carry on a conversation with the many Hispanic staff members, which made my work easier. Working at the Tavern was a transformative experience. My food is still inspired by Michael’s farm-to-table style, and my sense of hospitality is totally informed by the genius of Danny Meyer.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">After a year, however, Marie learned she was pregnant. I was very excited about being a dad, but it happened much faster than we’d planned. And we didn’t have good health insurance, my visa was going to expire, and Marie had had trouble finding a suitable job. Yet I also felt ready: it was time to go home, after more than ten years on the road. I sadly handed in my notice, and we packed our stuff and flew back to Paris.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">When we arrived there, in September 2008, we were jobless and almost penniless. We rented a tiny apartment in Montmartre and I applied for unemployment. I knew I had very little time to launch my project, as cash was running out and Marie was due in December. After exploring several different neighborhoods, I found a spot I really liked on an improbable, deserted cobblestoned street called rue du Nil, tucked away in the garment district. My friends thought I was crazy, but I loved the location. We were a few steps from the busy rue Montorgueil and Les Halles, the historic area known as “the belly of Paris,” home until 1971 of the great wholesale marketplace through which all the foods served in Parisian restaurants passed. It made perfect sense.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Yet it was 2008, and the economic crisis was at its worst: I couldn’t persuade any bankers to go along with my project, so I got a loan from a friend who, perhaps ironically, was an investment broker. Within two short weeks, we’d scraped the ugly paint from the walls, replaced the bar, and brought in some secondhand furniture. On April Fool’s Day 2009, Frenchie opened.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">I really had no idea what was happening on the Paris scene, what was hot and what was not: all I wanted to do was to create a place that was the sum of all my best experiences. I wanted to serve simple yet inventive food, using high-quality ingredients, in a laid-back bistro setting, with affordable prices, a menu that changed daily, and a short but exciting wine list. I guess I was in the right place at the right time: the Paris “bistronomy” trend was just starting, and the type of food and ambience I had in mind seemed to be exactly what people were craving. Frenchie quickly received great praise from the public as well as the critics. The phone started to ring nonstop, and the reservation book was filled a month ahead. To this day, I still don’t understand how it all happened so quickly.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Two years after opening Frenchie, I took over the lease of a minuscule shop across the street and turned it, after another few months of intense renovations, into Frenchie Bar à Vins. The idea was to offer small plates to go along with great wines on a first-come, first-served basis. The only equipment we had was a fridge, a small grill, and a blowtorch. We designed a clever little menu with that in mind: braised pig’s head, hot-smoked trout, seasonal salads, homemade terrines, charcuterie, cheese, and grandma-style tarts. It was an instant hit.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">When the shop next door to the bar freed up, we were able to extend the space, which meant more hard construction work. We launched the Wine Bar V2 in July 2012.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">At the same time, two of my favorite produce suppliers, Samuel Nahon and Alexandre Drouard of Terroirs d’Avenir, were looking for a space out of which to sell their fantastic fruits and vegetables, fish, and meat to the public (they had been supplying only chefs). I told them about a space two doors away from the restaurant, and soon enough, Terroirs d’Avenir opened a fruit and vegetable store, as well as a butcher shop and a fish market, all on my little street. If you can’t go to your suppliers, make them come to you, I say. Imagine being able to go to work every morning and create your menu with what looks best on the shelves that day. No more worries about running out of something when most of the ingredients I use are available right next door!</p>
			<p class="FMTX">In the middle of all that, I was offered a book contract. I was super-busy and almost declined the offer, but so many customers had asked me how I did this and how I cooked that. What a great opportunity to fulfill my guests’ requests! So, after careful consideration and planning, I agreed to do a book for the home cook. I would take recipes from the restaurant and strip them down to the essentials. After <em>La Cuisine du Frenchie at Home</em> was published, in 2012, the opportunity to do an English version arose; I didn’t hesitate for a second.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">As I write these lines, the latest kid on the block, Frenchie to Go, has just opened its doors. It’s my version of a take-out counter, inspired by my time in New York and London, with everything homemade, from pastrami to hot dogs, maple-syrup bacon to pulled pork, ginger beer to even doughnuts—all made with carefully selected ingredients and rare-breed animals. It’s a fun, lively place, where one can come for great coffee and great food all day long, the type of joint where, when I lived abroad, I loved to hang out on my days off. Rue du Nil is now buzzing with all sorts of great food, and we are dedicated to making the best of it. So please, if you are in Paris, come and visit us.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">I hope you will enjoy these simple but inventive dishes. They are full of the flavors I came to love in the culinary encounters I had cooking around the world. But I didn’t write this book to show you what I could do: I wanted to show you what <em>you</em> can do.</p>

			<h2 class="FMA">about the recipes</h2>
			<p class="FMTX2">Happily, you’ll find lots of dishes in these pages that come together very quickly, such as the <a href="spring.xhtml#p028">Roasted Carrot, Orange, and Avocado Salad</a> or the <a href="fall.xhtml#p078">Spanish Ham, Corn, Bell Peppers, and Kaffir Lime</a>. Others have long cooking times, like the <a href="fall.xhtml#p094">Pork Braised in Milk with Marinated Fennel</a>, but I think you’ll agree that the time is well spent.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">In all the recipes, I strive for the excitement you get from contrast, whether it’s the smokiness and acidity of the <a href="summer.xhtml#p058">smoked trout</a>, the bitterness and sweetness of the <a href="winter.xhtml#p108">bitter greens salad</a>, or the creaminess and crunchiness of the <a href="fall.xhtml#p086">risotto</a>. Throughout, you may note my fondness for a zing of citrus, for pickles (whether radish, ginger, mustard seed, or other), for the earthiness of mushrooms and nuts, and for the chutneys I fell in love with when I was working in England.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Although the recipes are divided by season and are loosely arranged from starters to desserts, any of the savory dishes could easily serve as a meal. In my cooking, the distinction between starter and main course is more about portion size than anything else—just double the recipe and a salad becomes a meal. Cheese is traditionally served before dessert or as a dessert, especially when married to sweet flavors, such as the <a href="spring.xhtml#p042">Blue Cheese, Lemon Zest and Amarena Cherries</a>. But I also like to serve it as a salad appetizer or a stand-alone dish, especially the <a href="summer.xhtml#p070">Fresh Peaches, Smoked Mozzarella, and Aged Balsamic</a> or the <a href="fall.xhtml#p102">Pear, Turnip, and Pecorino Pepato Salad</a>. While many people imagine the French still eat three-course meals every day, we tend more and more to appreciate a single course or little plates to share, such as those served at Wine Bar.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">At Frenchie, we are very attached to the wines we serve. We work closely with our winemakers, and our sommeliers, Laura and Aurélien, have paired each recipe in this book with a specific wine that we offer at the restaurant. For most of these choices, we have indicated the type of grape and the name of the winemaker. We’ve also provided a list of wine merchants who may sell these wonderful wines in your part of the world (see <a href="sources.xhtml#p137">Sources</a>).</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Lastly, you may note that we rounded off measurements for ingredients, so volume and ounce measures don’t always correspond exactly to the metric measurements provided. The recipes will work fine no matter which measurements you use, but I encourage you to buy a digital scale and try your hand at cooking metric—it’s so much easier.</p>
			<p class="FMTX">Now off to the kitchen to get your hands dirty!</p>
