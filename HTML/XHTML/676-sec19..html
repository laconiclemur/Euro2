<p class="nonindent">Tins of mejillones en escabeche, essentially pickled mussels, line store shelves all over Spain. When Félix served in Spain’s army, his go-to cheap eat to avoid mess hall food was a can of this stuff spooned onto a baguette. After he got out of the army, he still ate that combo on lazy Sunday afternoons while watching soccer. I learned this when we were first dating and living in Roses. Because our relationship was relatively new, I enjoyed both the snack and the soccer. Now that we’ve been married for a while, I can confess that I’m not that crazy about either.</p>
<p class="indent">But I knew there could be a delicious version of mussels with a tangy sauce. I liked the idea of a cooked vinaigrette, browning the garlic, onion, and tomato to get a deep richness that wouldn’t diminish when cold. The resulting sauce elevates freshly cooked mussels into a great party-worthy cold appetizer.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 very small ripe tomato</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large garlic clove, smashed and peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup thinly sliced onion</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ teaspoon dried rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2½ teaspoons reserve sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 pounds mussels</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE ESCABECHE VINAIGRETTE, CUT THE</span> tomato in half and grate the cut side of one half over a bowl using the large holes of a box grater; discard the tomato skin. you need 2 tablespoons pulp and juice. if you don’t have enough, grate the other half. if you have too much, save the remaining for another use.</p>
<p class="indent">Combine the garlic and 1½ tablespoons oil in a small skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the garlic is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the grated tomato, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining 1½ tablespoons oil, then stir in ⅓ cup water. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat to simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and ¼ teaspoon salt. Transfer to a blender to puree until very smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To clean the mussels, run them under cold water. If their beards stick out from the shells, pull them off and discard. Throw out any mussels with broken shells or ones that will not close when firmly tapped.</p>
<p class="indent">Fill a large bowl with 8 cups ice, 4 cups cold water, and ½ cup salt and stir well. Fill a large saucepot with 12 cups water and ½ cup salt. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat and add the mussels. As each mussel pops opens, wait about thirty seconds before completely submerging it in the ice bath. After all the mussels have cooked and cooled, drain and twist off the top shells and discard them. At this point, the mussels can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Arrange the mussels on a platter and spoon enough escabeche vinaigrette over each to coat the meat. You want enough vinaigrette to cover the mussel, but not so much that it flows out of the shell.</p>
