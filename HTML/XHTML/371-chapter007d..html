<p class="noindent">When the madeleines are ready at Buvette, a little chalkboard appears in the window advertising them. They are dusted with powdered sugar and kept warm between folded napkins on small white plates and are usually served with tea.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES A DOZEN MADELEINES (OR 3 DOZEN MINIATURE ONES)]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, plus more for pan</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ vanilla pod and its seeds, scraped out (or substitute 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract)</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient"><span class="font1">⅓</span> cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour, sifted, plus more for pan</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Zest of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="ingredient">Powdered sugar, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Combine the butter,</strong> the scraped vanilla pod, and the vanilla seeds in a small skillet and set it over medium-high heat. (If you’re using vanilla extract instead of the vanilla pod, add the vanilla extract later as instructed.) Cook the butter until it froths, then gets quiet and turns a dark brown color and smells wonderfully nutty, about 3 minutes. Be sure to keep an eye on the butter as it’s cooking, so that it doesn’t burn and turn black. Once it’s browned, set it aside to cool and then remove and discard the vanilla pod, if you used one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, put the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the mixture thickens significantly and turns pale in color. Alternatively, you could use an electric handheld mixer or just a whisk and a lot of elbow grease.</p>
<p>Thoroughly whisk the flour and the salt into the egg mixture. Whisk in the lemon zest and the reserved browned butter, being sure to get all the vanilla seeds into the mixture. If you’re using vanilla extract instead, now’s the time to add it. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula to make sure there are no pockets of flour or egg hiding anywhere.</p>
<p>Transfer the batter to a container, or simply cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days before baking. Resting the batter will help the madeleines puff up in the oven and ultimately have a wonderfully light texture.</p>
<p>Once the batter has chilled, preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter and flour a madeleine tray (even if it’s nonstick). Divide the batter evenly among the molds, filling each one three-quarters of the way up. Tap the tray on the countertop to deflate any air bubbles, then transfer the tray to the oven.</p>
<p>Bake the madeleines until they are just firm to the touch and ever so lightly golden brown, about 12 minutes. While still warm, remove the madeleines from the tray (tapping its edge firmly on your kitchen countertop makes easy work of this), and dust them generously with powdered sugar. Serve them warm, in a basket lined with a napkin.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>I am skeptical of any processed ingredient, even vanilla extract. I prefer scraping the seeds from a whole vanilla bean and then saving the pod to infuse brown butter or flavor a canister of sugar.</em></p>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">On Flouring Your Pan</span></h1>
<p class="noindent"><em>When you are flouring any pan, especially a madeleine pan with all of its small and particular crevices, a small shaker fitted with a wire mesh top filled with flour is your best friend. You can find these at any kitchen or restaurant supply store (note that they are normally sold as “sugar shakers”). With one of these in hand, a controlled, even layer of flour becomes an easy achievement rather than a big mess.</em></p>
