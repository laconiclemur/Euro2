<p class="nonindent">This is my interpretation of a beloved dessert from Madrid and Asturias, arroz con leche. I make a crème anglaise with the rice and the spices normally cooked into a pudding. That creamy sauce becomes the base for floating island poached meringues. You get all the soulful comfort of rice pudding in light-as-air bites. To make this for a dinner party, do the crème anglaise days ahead, then whip and poach the meringues right before serving.</p>

<p class="head1">ARROZ CON LECHE CRÈME ANGLAISE</p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup long-grain white rice</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>5 cinnamon sticks, snapped in half, plus 1 for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2½ cups heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2½ cups milk</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 lemon</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="head1">MERINGUES</p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 large egg whites</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup superfine sugar</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE CRÈME ANGLAISE, COMBINE THE</span> rice and cinnamon sticks in a large saucepan and toast over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 15 minutes. Add the cream and milk. Using a vegetable peeler, remove strips of lemon peel from half the lemon and add to the saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and heat, vigorously stirring often to prevent sticking, until an instant-read thermometer registers 185°F. The mixture will be hot to the touch; do not heat too quickly or let the temperature exceed 185°F. Remove from the heat and let stand, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Strain the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into a 1-quart liquid measuring cup, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. You should have 4 cups liquid. If not, add equal parts milk and cream to bring the volume up to 4 cups. Return to the saucepan and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat.</p>
<p class="indent">While the liquid heats, whisk the granulated sugar and egg yolks in a large bowl. Continue whisking while adding the hot liquid in a slow, steady stream. Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-low heat, stirring continuously, until the mixture is just thick enough to coat the spatula and an instant-read thermometer registers 185°F. Do not heat the mixture past this temperature or it will curdle. Transfer to a bowl and set in a larger bowl of ice and water to cool. Stir occasionally until cold. When cold, divide among 8 serving bowls. The chilled crème anglaise can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, make the meringues. Using the whisk attachment of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until foamy. While whisking, add the superfine sugar in a steady stream. Beat until the whites are glossy and hold soft peaks.</p>
<p class="indent">Fill a large, deep skillet with water to a depth of 1½ inches. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a bare simmer. Using a large spoon, dollop half of the meringue mixture in 4 mounds into the simmering water. The water should not boil. If it’s bubbling too hard, lower the heat. Cook until just set on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Gently flip the meringues and cook for 2 minutes longer. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to half of the serving dishes with crème anglaise. Repeat with the remaining meringue mixture. Zest the cinnamon stick and remaining lemon half all over the tops and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>ARROZ CON LECHE ICE CREAM:</strong> Make only the Arroz con Leche Crème Anglaise and refrigerate overnight. Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serve immediately or freeze in airtight containers until firm.</p>
