<p class="nonindent">At Cúrate, we make this traditional Basque Country specialty with a premium desalted bacalao, which is fresh cod that has been salted and dried, then rehydrated and desalinated. It’s not available for retail, so making your own salt cod is really important for this dish. While it takes a few days and advanced planning, the steps are simple and the payoff is huge. The salt cod sold in boxes or as stiff planks tends to have a much drier texture, which leads to a grainier brandada. If you make your own bacalao, you end up with a delicious, silky smooth spread that doesn’t have an overwhelming fishy flavor. Brandada comes from Basque Country, so bright, crisp Txakoli wine is the ideal pairing. It’s bone-dry and lightly carbonated, perfect for cutting through brandada’s richness.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound skinless cod fillet</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup kosher salt, plus more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large Idaho potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch chunks (1½ cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>7 tablespoons blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>12 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 baguette, cut into ¼-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">CUT THE COD INTO 4 EVEN PIECES AND PLACE IN</span> a container or dish that fits them snugly. Cover with the salt, then cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 48 hours. Rinse the salt off the cod with cold water, rinse the container, and return the cod to the container. Cover the cod with cold water, then cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 36 hours and up to 48 hours, changing the water at least 3 times during this process.</p>
<p class="nonindent1">Drain the cod well and cut into thin slices. Using your fingertips, shred the slices into small bits and reserve in a bowl.</p>
<p class="indent">Place the cut potato in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and reserve.</p>
<p class="indent">Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, heat the blended oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, just until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add the reserved salt cod, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring often, until the flavors have melded, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer to a food processor and add the drained potatoes. Pulse until well-blended, scraping the bowl occasionally. The brandada mixture should be the consistency of soft mashed potatoes. If it’s too thick, add a tablespoon or two of water and pulse again. Taste and add salt if needed. It shouldn’t need any more salt, but it may, depending on how much salt remains in the cod after it has been cured and soaked. Transfer to a heatproof shallow dish and spread evenly.</p>
<p class="nonindent1">Place the baguette slices on a half-sheet pan in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil. Broil until golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute, then flip the slices and broil again, about 30 seconds. The bread goes from golden to burnt in seconds, so check on it often. Cool on the pan.</p>
<p class="indent">While the bread cools, broil the brandada in the dish until browned on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot with the baguette toasts.</p>
