<p class="tni">Although Italian regional cuisines offer some delicious cakes, pies, cookies, pastries, and <span class="epub-i">dolci al cucchiaio</span> (desserts eaten with a spoon), the favorite Italian way to finish a meal is with fresh fruit in season.</p>
<p class="tx">This section contains a few Italian desserts that are all based on rice.</p>
<p class="tx">If you wish to serve wine with these desserts, we recommend Martini &amp; Rossi Asti Spumante.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">This is not like any rice pudding I’ve ever tasted. It is sumptuously delicious and pleasing to the palate. But it must be made at least four hours in advance. I was visiting the beautiful city of Vicenza and stopped in a confectionery shop to pick up a dessert for my hosts. This pudding caught my eye and I looked no further. My hosts were pleased with my little gift. But when espresso was served, a servant brought out an identical pudding my hostess had made. This is Signora deAngelis’ recipe.</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">1½ quarts whole milk</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">½ cup sugar</span></p>
<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">Zest of 2 lemons</span></p>

<p class="ri"><span class="epub-b">10 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted in ¼ cup milk on low heat in double boiler pot</span></p>
<p class="rt1">Before starting the budino, put an empty pudding mold on ice. Boil milk in a saucepan. Add sugar, lemon zest, and rice. Stir on low heat until rice has absorbed all the milk. Remove from heat and stir in butter vigorously. Allow to cool. Whip cream until very stiff. Fold whipped cream into rice pudding. Add cognac and sultana raisins. Stir well. Refrigerate for half hour, then spoon into a very cold pudding mold. Refrigerate for three hours. Unmold onto a serving dish and pour melted hot chocolate over it. Serve immediately.</p>
