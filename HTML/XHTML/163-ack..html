<p class="nonindent">This book wouldn’t have come to fruition if our editor, Will Schwalbe, hadn’t come in to eat at Cúrate. I owe it to Will for planting the idea of a cookbook in my head. I am forever grateful to our publisher, Bob Miller, for wholeheartedly agreeing with Will and taking on this project. I’m also grateful to Kara Rota for her wonderful insight and direction throughout the process and to Bryn Clark, Kimberly Escobar, Molly Fonseca, and Marlena Bittner. Thanks to Shubhani Sarkar for designing all of the pages so beautifully. And thank you to the entire staff at Flatiron Books for being such a wonderful and supportive company and for guiding me through my first book!</p>
<p class="indent">Lisa Abend connected me to David Black, our literary agent. I can’t thank her enough for directing us to someone so dedicated to making this book, my restaurants, and me a success. Thank you David for always being there, no matter what hour of the day, whenever I needed advice; I know that this is the beginning of a long friendship.</p>
<p class="indent">Genevieve Ko, our writer, took our mishmash of ideas and magically made them flow eloquently on the pages. Genevieve is both a wonderful writer and a fantastic, precise recipe tester. She was a pleasure to work with on this project.</p>
<p class="indent">While I was busy recipe testing for this book, my staff at both of my restaurants, Cúrate and Nightbell, ran things seamlessly without me.</p>
<p class="indent">The amount that we have accomplished in the past five years has been incredible. I can’t wait to see what the next five will bring.</p>
<p class="indent">Allegra Grant made the days of recipe testing in my home fly by with her attention to detail and passion for cooking. Meanwhile, Ana Myers, our nanny, cared for our most precious package, our daughter Gisela, during the cookbook process.</p>
<p class="indent">A special thank-you goes out to Frank Muller and Carmen Vaquera for working long, hard days to prepare all of the dishes for the photo shoot. And thanks to our manager Nathan Lanham for ensuring Cúrate operated smoothly and for guest bartending at the shoot. I still can’t believe how much we accomplished in that short amount of time. Evan Sung, our photographer, made all of our dishes come to life. Without his agreement to work on this project with us, the final product would never have been the same. Kira Corbin, the prop stylist, made the food more beautiful than we ever could have imagined. Ron Basil and AVL Luxury Vacation Rentals allowed us to use one of their homes. The bear and lynxes that came to visit us during the photo shoot provided us with a little excitement and a lot of comic relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to all of the farmers and producers in Asheville and in Spain, who have dedicated their lives to creating products that we use in our restaurants and that inspired the dishes for this cookbook. We’re also grateful to the Asheville artisans who supplied the surfaces we shot on for this book’s photography. A big thank you to Antique Hardwood &amp; Beams, Dynamic Metalwork, and Mountain Marble.</p>
<p class="indent">I’m grateful to Liz Pierson and Lissie Chappell of Becca PR for spreading the news about this book. Thank you to my mentors, José Andrés, Ferran Adrià, and Albert Adrià, for giving me the opportunity to work for you. José, <a id="page280"/>you came to the opening of Cúrate and provided support when we needed it most, and since then you have continued to give me opportunities in this career. Ferran and Albert, I wouldn’t be the chef I am today had I not stepped foot in elBulli. You and your team taught me professionalism, organization, and the belief that I can achieve as much as I want to in this life and as a chef. I also want to thank Johnny Iuzzini for inviting me into his kitchen for my first professional cooking position.</p>
<p class="indent">My parents, Liz and Ted Button, have believed in me and have been there every step of the way, as family and as business partners. My mother, Liz, inspired me to become a chef by cooking with me when I was little and by pursuing and growing her own professional culinary career. My father, Ted, has always been there, supporting every decision I make. He took the biggest plunge when he decided to support this business venture together. It is an honor and a privilege to work beside my parents, getting to know them better than I ever would have been able to otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">My brother, Shane Liddell, handles the branding and Web presence for both of our restaurants and for this book. Thanks for partnering with us over the years.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to my own mother’s impact, I am fortunate to have been influenced by many generations of amazing female cooks. My grandmother, Ann, and her mother created the backdrop of food culture that became my reference for delicious home-cooked meals. And my mother-in-law, Pepa, and her family introduced me to the unique traditions of Spanish cuisine. You will see throughout which cookbook recipes were influenced by Pepa’s cooking.</p>
<p class="indent">I am sincerely grateful to my husband Félix. Without him, none of this would be possible. He is strong in every way that I am weak. He introduced me to the amazing culture in Spain, which I am proud to be a part of as a chef and as his wife. Every decision, every ingredient, every preparation, every dish was made in collaboration with him.</p>
<p class="indent">I want to dedicate this book to our greatest joint achievement: our daughter Gisela Meana. She was in the womb during the planning process for the cookbook and then was welcomed into the world in the midst of the recipe testing, photo shoot, and culmination of the project. I am a better person and a better chef because of her.</p>
<p class="center1a"><span class="small">GENEVIEVE KO</span></p>
<p class="nonindent">Thank you to Katie for so graciously welcoming me into her home, her restaurants, and her life. I’m also grateful to Félix for his warm hospitality and insight into Spanish food and life. Gisela is lucky to have two such talented and kind parents, and I’m lucky to have enjoyed her company during our cookbook sessions. Liz Button, Ted Button, Carmen Vaquera, Allegra Grant, Jacob Nygaard, and the whole Heirloom Hospitality Group helped with this book in so many ways. Evan Sung and his team complemented the recipes and stories with stunning photographs. Will Schwalbe, Kara Rota, and Bryn Clark made this book even better with their smart and thoughtful editing. Many thanks to George Mendes for introducing me to Katie, and to my agent Leslie Stoker for connecting us through David Black.</p>
<p class="indent">A big thanks to my family for your constant support and love.</p>
