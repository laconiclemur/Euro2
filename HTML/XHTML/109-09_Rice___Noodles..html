<p class="C3625"><strong><span id="page_136">RICE</span> &amp; NOODLES</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">No Spanish dish captures the imagination more than paella. If you are not from Spain, everything about the dish feels exotic: the wide, shallow pan; the saffron-laced rice; the head-on shrimp, clams, and mussels. But to a Spaniard it’s comfort food, a communal dish to be shared at family gatherings.</p>
<p class="C3609">Although the dish has its roots in Valencia, where natural wetlands were first converted to rice paddies in the eighth century, variations on the classic paella and other rice dishes cooked using the same technique are as diverse as Spaniards themselves.</p>
<p class="C3609">Mountainous regions give us rice dishes built with foraged mushrooms and wild game, while seaside towns might mix in squid ink for a black rice, rich with salty sea flavor. Along the Catalan coast, where tradesmen arrived long ago with pasta-making traditions from Italy, small fideo noodles often stand in for rice in a paella, a regional favorite known as fideuà.</p>
<p class="C3609">At Boqueria we recommend one of our paellas to almost every table. A meal that starts with a few tapas and ends with a big satisfying pan of paella is hard to beat. When one of these showstoppers arrives at the table, everyone grabs their phones to get a picture. The dishes in this section will do the same for your guests. They taste even better than they look and make the perfect grande finale for your Spanish feast.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_94">Shrimp,</span> Clams, Cuttlefish, and Fideo Noodles with Squid Ink</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">This squid ink and toasted noodle paella is one of our all-time favorites. Try it and you’ll understand why.</p>
<p class="C3609">Once on the table you’ll want to grab a spoon, crack through the crispy top and mix the allioli evenly throughout the inky paella until it’s as creamy as a risotto. Scrape up the crunchy base, getting plenty of the gooey center’s sweet seafood and tender noodles.</p>
<p class="C3609">It’s easy to recreate this addictive dish at home. If you already have stock, sofrito, and picada, it comes together fast. You’ll know it’s ready when the short, thin noodles on top curl and rise like they’re dancing.</p>

<p class="C3639"><strong><span id="page_139">2</span> cups fideo #1 noodles</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 cups <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#page_269">Lobster Stock</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons squid ink</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil, as needed for frying and drizzling</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>12 large shrimp, peeled and deveined</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>12 manila clams, cleaned well</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>6 ounces cuttlefish, cut into ½-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ cup <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#id_7">Sofrito</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 tablespoons <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#page_274">Picada</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>flat-leaf parsley leaves, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong><a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#page_273">Allioli</a>, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat to 400°F.</p>
<p class="C3636">Spread the noodles on a half sheet pan. Bake on the center rack, stirring once or twice, until golden brown, about 5–6 minutes. Reserve.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile, mix the stock and squid ink in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer.</p>
<p class="C3636">While the stock comes to a simmer, coat a 16–18-inch paella pan with oil. Heat over high heat until the oil is almost smoking. Season the shrimp with salt and add in a single layer. Cook only until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Quickly and immediately transfer to a plate. You just want to leave some shrimp flavor in the pan; you don’t want to risk overcooking the shrimp.</p>
<p class="C3636">Turn heat to medium-high; coat the pan with oil again, add the clams, and season them with salt. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until they start to gape open a little (discard any that fail to open), about 2 minutes. Immediately transfer to a bowl.</p>
<p class="C3636">Coat the pan with oil again. Season the cuttlefish with salt and add to the hot oil in a single layer. Cook, turning occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. You want the cuttlefish to caramelize a bit in the pan; add more oil if any pieces stick. Add the sofrito and picada and stir until well mixed. Add the toasted noodles and stir until well combined. Add the simmering stock-squid ink mixture. It should boil immediately. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3636">Boil the mixture over high heat for 5 minutes, then lower the heat to simmer for 5 minutes more.</p>
<p class="C3636">Scatter the shrimp and clams and all their reserved juices on top of the cuttlefish and noodles. Cook over a low heat until the mixture is dry, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Turn the heat to high. Cook until you can hear the noodles crackling and creating the soccarat crust on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Top with parsley, drizzle with olive oil, and serve immediately with allioli.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>Squid ink is available in specialty stores and seafood markets.</em></p>

</div>
<p class="C3607"><span id="page_140">Fideuà</span></p>
<p class="C3601">Catalonia has always stood at a crossroads for trade. Over the centuries influences from across the Mediterranean have crept into the Catalan culture and pantry. One of the most easily recognized of these influences is pasta. Catalans have long incorporated it into their cuisine. Everyone makes canelones (cannelloni), pasta sheets stuffed with ground meat and baked in béchamel, and short, thin noodles often stand in for rice in paella.</p>
<p class="C3677">To make fideuà, the popular pasta version of paella, the short vermicelli-like strands are toasted to a golden brown, then simmered in a paella pan with seafood and stock. The dish is usually served with a hefty dollop of allioli. This is stirred into the noodles before plating, mixing with any remaining stock to create a creamy sauce that sticks to the al dente pasta.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_95">Chicken</span> and Seafood Paella</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">This “mixta” style of paella—cooking both meat and seafood into rice—is what most people outside of Spain know and love because it’s delicious, homey, and incredibly satisfying. Below is a winning combination that we created after a trip to our local market. Stick to it or swap in similar ingredients; that’s the spirit of “mixta.” It’s not just that cooks everywhere have their own versions, but they have different versions every time they make it based on whatever looks good at the market.</p>

<p class="C3636">Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to keep just warm until ready to use.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 16-inch paella pan over high heat. Season the chicken and pork with salt and pepper and put into the hot oil in a single layer. Reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until well-browned, about 7 minutes. Add the cuttlefish and raise the heat to high. Cook, stirring, until browned, about 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until tender and browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds, then add the peppers and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the artichokes, season with salt, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Add the tomato and cook, stirring, until the pan is dry, about 3 minutes. Add the green beans and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the hot chicken stock. Bring to a boil over high heat and season to taste with salt. Sprinkle the rice evenly in the pan. Stir it a little to make sure it’s evenly distributed and submerged in the liquid, but then don’t touch it again. You don’t want to activate the starches and make the mixture creamy like a risotto. You want the grains to cook separately from each other. Scatter the broccoli on top. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil vigorously for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Simmer until the rice is al dente, about 10 minutes. Tuck the mussels into the rice. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon oil over the rice and raise the heat to high. Cook until all of the liquid evaporates and the rice forms the soccarat crust on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rest for about 5 minutes. Uncover and serve directly from the pan, discarding any mussels that haven’t opened.</p>

<p class="C3675">Crackling top and bottom, succulent goodness in the center: that’s our seafood paella. We do it Catalan-style, adding both sofrito and picada for a more robust flavor. The former brings the earthy sweetness of caramelized tomatoes, onions, and garlic; the latter delivers the fresh bite of parsley in a saffron-scented olive oil. Lobster stock deepens the from-the-sea juiciness of cuttlefish, squid, mussels, clams, and cod. A lot of our diners tell us it’s the best paella they’ve ever had anywhere in the world. Follow this simple formula and you’ll hear the same when you serve it at home.</p>

<p class="C3607"><span id="page_147">Paella</span></p>
<p class="C3601">Over a thousand years ago, the Romans set up a rudimentary system of irrigation in the wetlands of Valencia. Three hundred years later, the Moors refined the system and introduced rice. Since then, Valencia’s marshlands have supplied the country with the grain. And just as rice spread from its Valencian home, so did paella, eventually becoming the national dish.</p>
<p class="C3677">And as with all of the country’s most popular dishes, a heated debate persists about paella.</p>
<p class="C3677">“Yes, it should have onions!”</p>
<p class="C3677">“No, never chorizo!”</p>
<p class="C3677">“Your mother adds the rice when?!”</p>
<p class="C3677">“What type of rice?!”</p>
<p class="C3677">Engaged couples have even been known to fight over which of Spain’s two principal types of rice to throw at their wedding. Bomba or calasparra?</p>
<p class="C3677">Yes, the great paella dispute can leave Spaniards simmering. But the grain of truth revealed by this ongoing debate is that everyone feels extremely passionate about paella. That includes us.</p>
<p class="C3607">Paellera</p>
<p class="C3601">To make a proper paella, you need a paella pan. We recommend the traditional carbon steel <em>paellera</em>, which conducts heat quickly and evenly and produces the perfect <em>socorrat</em>, the badge-of-honor caramelized base that distinguishes a perfectly executed paella. You will need to season your paella pan with oil after washing to prevent rust.</p>
<p class="C3677">We put paella pans to all sorts of uses in the restaurant. We use them to roast whole fish or large cuts of meat and have even filled them with crushed ice to be used as impromptu platters for crudités or oysters.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_97">Quail</span> and Porcini Mushroom Rice with Artichokes</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">This is our favorite winter paella. We love the creaminess of the rice against the umami of porcini mushrooms, the gaminess of quail, and the fresh bite of artichokes and peppers.</p>
<p class="C3609">Marc created this dish from his memories of cooking at Can Jubany restaurant. West of the Mediterranean and south of the Pyrennes, Can Jabuny sits on the plains of the tiny town of Vic. Chef Jubany likes to put the surrounding fields on the plate, which means lots of wild game, foraged mushrooms, and homegrown vegetables. This paella sums up that delicious philosophy.</p>

Cook until the skin is browned, about 3 minutes. Flip each piece and cook until the meat is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the artichokes to the hot pan in a single layer, season with salt, and stir well. If the pan is dry, add another tablespoon oil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, turning the artichokes occasionally, until caramelized, about 8 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the quail.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and add the porcini. Season with salt, raise the heat to high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until dark brown and caramelized, about 4 minutes.
