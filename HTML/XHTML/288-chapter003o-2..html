<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Bibonade</em> is a word I coined for a refreshing combination of fruit and wine served over ice that can be made even lighter and more effervescent when topped off with sparkling wine or water. I first learned about it when I lived and worked in Italy and we had wine mixed with water every day at lunch. I rediscovered it when I visited France and learned that rosé is always served over ice during the summertime. While some would think these combinations would dilute the wine or make it lose its integrity, I would suggest just thinking about it as a whole other thing altogether. My favorite bibonade combinations include sliced apricots in Muscadet, halved green grapes in Riesling, sliced black plums in rosé, and sliced yellow plums in white wine.</p>
