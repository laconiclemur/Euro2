			<h3 class="FMB">My deepest thanks to the following people:</h3>
			<p class="FMTX2">Marie, my wife and business associate, for her patience and constant support.</p>
			<p class="FMTX2">Ann Bramson, for her amazing kindness and wisdom, and the Artisan team; Judith Sutton, for her great recipe testing and editing of the recipes; and Camille Labro, for her translating and rewriting work.</p>
			<p class="FMTX2">In addition, I owe an enormous amount of gratitude to Djamel Dine Zitout, for his great photographs, as well as for his amazing capacity to adapt to the demands of my job, to listen, and to reassure me in moments of doubt.</p>
			<p class="FMTX2">Thanks to Alexandre Drouard and Samuel Nahon of Terroirs d’Avenir, for always finding exceptional products, and for enlivening the street with their three shops; to Stéphane Meyer, the forager, for his beautiful wild plants; to Yves-Marie Le Bourdonnec and Sarah and Tim Wilson from Ginger Pig, for their amazing meats; to Pierre André, for his great hams and for his passion; to baker Christophe Vasseur, for his wonderful bread; to Neil’s Yard Dairy, for their incredible British cheese; and to all my other suppliers.</p>
			<p class="FMTX2">Finally, my sincere appreciation goes to the three chefs who inspired me and gave me a chance: Arthur Potts Dawson, Jamie Oliver, and Michael Anthony; and to restaurateurs Nick Jones and Danny Meyer, for sharing their vision of hospitality with me.</p>
