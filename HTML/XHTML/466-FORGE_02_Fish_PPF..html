			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This dish came about in the summer of 2011 after I did <span class="ital">Next Iron Chef</span>. Chef Celina Tio made a chowchow for one of the battles when we were all competing, and it was incredible. Believe it or not, that was the first time I had ever eaten chowchow and I totally loved it. The combination of flavors got stuck in my head, and I knew that I’d be playing with the recipe when I got back to New York.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">One Saturday when I went to the greenmarket, I saw corn and bell peppers, and was instantly reminded of Chef Tio’s chowchow, and I knew it was what I was going to make that night.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">It’s important to have truly great corn when making this chowchow, as it takes center stage. We get our corn from the wonderful people at Lebak Farms who sell at the Tribeca greenmarket. Their summer corn is bursting with sweetness and is absolutely perfect for this recipe.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">Keep in mind that it gets a bit smoky when you’re blackening the tuna, so either do this indoors with a very strong fan or wide-open windows, or take that step outdoors and cook on the grill.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page49">Make the Pickled Corn Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Place the corn in a nonreactive container.

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chili Oil</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small saucepot, warm the Blended Oil and chili powder over medium-high heat until the oil registers 200ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Stir, and transfer the pot to a cooling rack. Let stand at room temperature for 3 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer lined with a coffee filter into a bowl and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Bread Crackers</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Lay the bread slices out on a baking sheet.

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tuna</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Spread out the Amber in a shallow dish. Pat the fillets dry, drizzle them with olive oil, and season with salt.

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Right before serving, strain the corn, discarding the marinade. Add the olive oil and lime juice to the corn. Let sit for 5 minutes, and then add the bell peppers, shallot, tarragon, parsley, and Amber.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Divide the Pickled Corn Salad among 4 plates. Top each serving with the tuna and add a Bread Cracker on the side.

			<p class="FeatureHead">Blue Moon Fish</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Alex and Stephanie Villani</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">I first met Alex and Stephanie Villani of Blue Moon Fish at the Tribeca greenmarket, where Alex presides over their stall every Saturday (during the fishing season), selling his catch with a smile on his face and a kind word for each customer. A blackboard announces what is sold on any given day—the selection varies, but rest assured, it is some of the freshest fish you’ll ever get your hands on. If you’re a regular, Alex will recognize you and chat for a few minutes. He has an uncanny ability to remember what fish you like, and will make suggestions based on what he has in stock that day.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Born in New York and raised in Chelsea, Alex was drawn to the docks from an early age and started fishing in 1972, which tells you he’s seen a thing or two while out at sea. After fishing on Long Island for a few years, he moved offshore in 1977, and then a little later bought his own boat, Duffy, which he renamed Blue Moon. And thus, his company was born.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">In 1988, Alex started coming to the New York greenmarket scene. Tribeca was his original spot, and he still has a fondness for the location, coming every Saturday, rain or shine. These days, Blue Moon Fish also sells at Grand Army Plaza (where Alex met his wife, Stephanie, who still mans the stand there), as well as at the Union Square greenmarket. When not selling fish to hungry Brooklynites, Stephanie keeps an ever-vigilant eye on the company’s books—she’s the brains of the operations, as Alex says.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Alex fishes mostly solo—everything he sells is line-caught and must pass his meticulous inspection. Whenever I stop by the greenmarket to pick up fish, I find Alex always smiling—this is a man who clearly loves his trade.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Because Blue Moon Fish sells some of the freshest fish available, it has become an indelible institution on the New York greenmarket scene, supplying fish to top restaurants as well as hungry greenmarket goers. It’s comforting to know that the fish you’ll be serving your patrons or cooking for your dinner that night has never been frozen—that quality is what gets Blue Moon Fish the most loyal customers around.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Fish, just like produce, has its seasons. In the spring, fluke is abundant on Long Island, and we get ours from Alex Villani, the man behind Blue Moon Fish. This dish always gets rave reviews from our patrons, and we wanted to share it with you. In the spring, we pair fluke with ramps and morels, celebrating another growing season that’s about to start. It’s a light, springtime dish that makes for a nice reprieve after the heavier winter fare. The bracing lemon vinegar offers a nice bright finishing note, leaving you wanting another bite.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lemon Vinegar</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a 2-quart nonreactive pot, combine the vinegar, turmeric, and lemon peels and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Add the thyme and bay leaf and transfer to a nonreactive container. Wrap the container tightly in plastic wrap and let the accumulated moisture gather on the inside so it looks like it is raining inside the container. This allows the herbs to infuse the vinegar. Let stand for 1 hour.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Ramp Pesto</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small dry skillet, toast the pine nuts over low heat, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning, until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pine nuts to a plate to cool.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Bring a 4-quart pot filled with salted water to a boil. Blanch the ramp greens in the boiling water for 1 minute and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Let cool, squeeze out all of the excess water, and then freeze the ramp greens for about 30 minutes. Place the toasted pine nuts, ramp greens, and olive oil in a blender and blend on high power for 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a bowl set over an ice bath and fold in the cheese, red pepper flakes, and some salt. Allow the mixture to cool, and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page52">Make the Asparagus</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a large bowl, toss the asparagus with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the asparagus over medium-high heat for 2 minutes, or until well-marked and slightly charred, turning once. Alternatively, preheat a broiler, and place the asparagus on a baking sheet. Broil the asparagus for 1 minute or until slightly charred. Cut the asparagus into 6-inch pieces and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Morels</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Slice the mushrooms into ¼-inch rings. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to coat the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add one-third of the mushrooms to the pan in an even layer. Reduce the heat to medium and add one-third (about 1½ tablespoons) of the shallots. Once the mushrooms release their liquid and begin to brown, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, 1 sprig of the thyme, and 1 bay leaf, and cook until the butter and mushrooms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Add one-third of the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until the pan is dry. Transfer to a parchment paper–lined tray. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms, shallots, butter, thyme, bay leaves, and wine.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Fluke</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Pat the fish dry and season with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to coat the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add 2 fluke fillets to the pan. It’s important that you do not overcrowd the pan, so make sure you select a pan that’s large enough for both fillets. Cook for 1 minute, add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the pan, and cook for 1 minute more. Flip the fish and baste with the butter in the pan for 1 minute. Remove the fillet from the pan and keep it warm on a parchment–lined plate. Repeat with the remaining fillets and butter. Wipe the pan between batches. (You can speed up the process by using 2 pans.)</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Divide the Ramp Pesto among 4 plates. Divide the sorrel evenly among the plates, placing it on top of the pesto. Place a piece of fluke over the sorrel on each plate and spoon some of the morels around. Divide the asparagus among the plates. Stir the parsley into the Lemon Vinegar and drizzle it over the fish and around the plate, along with some extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle with some smoked salt before serving.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Niçoise salad, made famous in the United States by the late, great Julia Child, is a traditional French mixed vegetable salad topped with tuna and anchovies. In keeping with tradition, the salad components are arranged on a bed of lettuce set on a large plate. The tuna typically used in a niçoise salad is a quality tuna packed in oil. Obviously, the better the quality of your tuna, the tastier your salad will be. While the traditional version uses no cooked vegetables (such as potatoes), more and more restaurants will serve niçoise with boiled potatoes and blanched haricots verts. Our version features  seared tuna steaks, <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Preserved">Preserved Meyer Lemons</a> and oil-cured white anchovies.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page54">Make the Olive Tapenade</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse the olives, anchovy, lemon juice, and garlic until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until incorporated. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tuna Steaks</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Rinse the fish and pat it dry. Make a 1-inch slit in the center of each tuna fillet and stuff about 1 tablespoon of the Olive Tapenade into each cavity. Set aside the remaining tapenade. In a medium bowl, mix together the parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil. Brush the tuna with olive oil and coat it in the herb mixture on both sides. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>When ready to serve, add enough canola oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the tuna and sear for 20 seconds on each side. Transfer to a parchment paper–lined tray.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Wax Bean Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Trim the wax beans and haricots verts, and bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the beans in the boiling water for 1 minute and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Let cool to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Cut the beans in half lengthwise and toss with the Pickled Red Onions, Preserved Meyer Lemons, and parsley. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, lemon juice, and piment d’espelette. Drizzle the dressing over the vegetables and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Silver Dollar Potatoes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Preheat the oven to 400ºF; position the rack in the middle. Cut the potatoes in half widthwise, and using a 2-inch ring mold, punch out uniform cylinders; you should wind up with 6 cylinders. Using an adjustable mandoline, slice the cylinders into ⅛-inch-thick slices. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the potato slices in the boiling water for 1 minute. Transfer the potatoes to a baking sheet and brush them generously with clarified butter. Line 6 (4-ounce) ramekins in foil and fill each ramekin with potato slices. Pour enough of the clarified butter to come to ¼ inch from the top of the ramekin. Bake the potatoes for about 1 hour or until the edges are crispy. Transfer the potatoes out of the ramekins and set aside. Reserve any remaining clarified butter for another use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Divide the Wax Bean Salad among 4 plates, and scatter the Silver Dollar Potatoes around. Slice the Tuna Steaks and place them on top of the bean salad. Top with the halved anchovies. Drizzle some of the bean salad dressing from the bottom of the bowl around the plate, dot with bits of the Olive Tapenade, and finish with some Upland cress, if using, and flaky sea salt. Serve with the radishes.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Instead of making the Silver Dollar Potatoes, go a bit more traditional route: Boil some fingerling potatoes in salted water and serve alongside the salad.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Often, pretty commonplace things inspire me in the kitchen. One day, I was eating a Zucker’s king salmon everything bagel with cream cheese, marveling at how good it tasted. Zucker’s Bagels, lucky for me, is just a block away from the restaurant, and is one of the few places that actually offers different types of quality smoked and cured salmon. I find that flavor combination to be pretty inspirational.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">These croquettes are something we came up with for Battle Cream Cheese in the kitchen stadium during one of the Iron Chef<span class="ital"> </span>competitions. It was a play on my favorite kind of bagel, the “everything” bagel, with smoked salmon and cream cheese. I loved the result so much that we added it to our menu to share with our guests.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pick the bones out of the salmon and rub it with the absinthe. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small dry skillet, toast the fennel, coriander, and peppercorns over low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, dill, and the cooled toasted spices. Spoon some of the cure over a piece of plastic wrap set out on the counter. Place the salmon over the cure and pack more cure around and over the salmon. Wrap the fish tightly and transfer it to a dish deep enough to hold any juices that might leak out. Refrigerate for 7 to 10 hours. Rinse the fish under cold, running water, pat dry, and slice it into 12 paper-thin slices. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Croquettes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a 2-quart pot, bring the cream and cream cheese to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the cream cheese. While the mixture warms, bloom the gelatin in ⅓ cup of water­—let it stand for 5 minutes. Whisk the bloomed gelatin into the warm dairy mixture until dissolved, but do not let the liquid come to a boil or you will wind up with a grainy texture and will need to start over. Pass the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer, and season to taste with salt and Pierre Poivre. Cover and transfer the liquid to a freezer for 6 hours or overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Let the custard thaw until it is soft enough to be scooped out. Meanwhile, set out a breading station by placing the flour, bread crumbs, and eggs in 3 separate shallow containers. Using a small cookie scoop, scoop out ½-ounce balls of custard and roll each in the flour, then the eggs, and finally the bread crumbs. Repeat process on each ball. Place the croquettes back in the freezer for 30 minutes. You will need 12 croquettes for this recipe—the rest can be frozen for later use.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>When ready to serve, heat 2 inches of oil in a Dutch oven or a deep skillet set over medium-high heat, until it registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Gently add the croquettes, directly from the freezer, to the hot oil and fry for 30 seconds or until golden brown. Transfer the croquettes to a paper towel–lined tray and season with salt.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Everything Brioche Crackers</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Using a pasta machine, and moving from the highest setting to the lowest, carefully roll the bread slices through the machine without tearing the bread. Transfer the pressed bread to a shallow baking pan, drizzle with the eggs, and season with the Everything Bagel Spice. Bake for 3 minutes or until the bread is crispy. Transfer to a rack and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tomato Salad</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, and capers. Right before serving, season the vegetables with salt, and drizzle with the lemon juice and olive oil.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Cover each plate with 3 pieces of the Cured Salmon. Divide the Croquettes among the plates, placing them over the salmon. Spoon some Tomato Salad around and top with the micro borage, if using. Drizzle some olive oil over the salmon and squeeze a few drops of the lemon juice. Drizzle the mustard and chive oils around the plate and finish with smoked salt and a caper berry. Serve with the Everything Brioche Crackers.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This appetizer has been on our menu from the very beginning, and is one of our most popular dishes—it’s on our tasting menu. Despite the long list of ingredients, it’s actually very easy to make, and I guarantee that if you serve this at your next dinner party, it’ll be the dish everyone will be talking about. It not only looks impressive—it tastes absolutely incredible, too. I remember playing around with different flavors and textures while I was creating this dish, and while I loved what I was getting as a result, but it still wasn’t quite perfect on my palate. One day, while looking for something to finish the dish, I noticed a small mound of leftover toasted pine nuts lying around. And me being me, I just thought, <span class="ital">Why not</span>? I threw the nuts in and tried it—it tasted absolutely perfect. Exactly the missing piece I was looking for. The smokiness from the toasting, the sweetness that pine nuts are known for, and their fattiness were all perfect complements for the fish, avocado, and spicy lime sauce.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl" id="headnote">This fish began as Kona Kampachi, a type of yellowtail raised off the coasts of Hawaii. The company we work with has since moved to Mexico and the fish is now just plain kampachi.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">We serve this dish with a spoon that contains a small bud called a Szechuan button, which at first might seem like theatrics. We tell you to place it on your tongue and move it around your mouth and wait for it to start to “pop,” meaning that the button will create a tingling sensation in your mouth, making your palate more ready for all the flavors you’re about to experience.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a medium bowl, combine the fish, olive oil, cucumber, and salt to taste. In another bowl, combine the diced avocado, lime juice (to keep it from oxidizing), and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Place a quarter of the diced avocado on the bottom of a 2-inch ring mold. Fill the mold three-quarters of the way with the fish, packing the fish tightly. Repeat with the remaining avocado and tartare—you should fill 4 molds. Transfer the ring molds to a tray and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>When ready to serve, in a small dry skillet, toast the pine nuts over low heat, periodically shaking the pan to prevent the nuts from burning, until golden and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let the nuts cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Unmold the Tartare into chilled bowls by inverting the molds over the bowls. You will have the tartare on the bottom and diced avocado on top. Pour enough of the Sauce to come a quarter of the way up the molded tartare.

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I’ve always liked smoked salmon, but wanted to experiment with the flavors of salt and smoke, and play a trick on those taste buds. So instead of smoking the salmon, I made a smoked potato puree. Tasting the smoke kind of gets your brain going in the direction of the familiar flavors embodied in combining smoke and salmon, but instead of the salmon, it’s the potatoes that get the smoked flavor. It’s a bit unexpected and a lot of fun.</p>

Add the blanched lemon zest, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Transfer the saucepan to a cooling rack and let the zest and syrup cool to room temperature.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cockle Broth</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a medium stockpot, combine the cockles, white wine, chicken stock, shallots, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf with 1 cup of water and bring to a simmer over high heat.

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page72">Make the Black Sea Bass</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Rinse and pat the fish dry. Place 3 slices of the prosciutto, overlapping one another, on top of a piece of plastic wrap. Place the sea bass, skin side down, on the prosciutto.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a medium bowl, mix together the olives, 1 cup of the Candied Lemon Zest, and the parsley. Spoon one-quarter of the mixture down the center of the fish. Roll the fish around the filling into a tight cylinder, wrap it tightly in the plastic wrap, and twist the ends. Repeat with the remaining prosciutto, fish, and olive-lemon-herb mixture. Place the rolled up fish in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or up to 6 hours, before cooking.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Remove and discard the plastic wrap from the fish. Add enough oil to a large skillet to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter. Just before the oil starts to smoke, place the fish in the skillet, prosciutto seam side down, and sear for 1 minute. It is important to sear the fish seam side down, because cooking it on the other side first will cause the prosciutto to shrink and unwrap. Gently flip the fish over and sear for another minute. Transfer to a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined half-sheet baking pan. Pour the oil and butter from the skillet on top of the fish. Repeat with the remaining fish and butter. Let the fish sit out for 5 minutes together so it is all roughly the same temperature when it goes into the oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until a cake tester comes out without force and is warm to the touch. Transfer the fish to a paper towel–lined tray and let it rest for 1 minute. Trim off the ends of the roulade and slice each roulade crosswise into 3 even slices.</p>

			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>Sea beans have become increasingly prominent at farmers’ markets and specialty stores. Sea beans grow on salt marshes and beaches, have a crunchy texture and a briny flavor, and have an aftertaste slightly reminiscent of asparagus. Often, they are eaten raw, but because of their high sodium content, they are blanched to remove some of their saltiness.</p>

Lay the skins out flat on the lined baking sheet. Cover them with another Silpat or more parchment paper and place another baking sheet on top. Bake the skins for 10 minutes or until crispy.

			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Making the crispy skin guarantees a dramatic presentation. However, you can skip making the crispy skin, and just cook the fish as indicated above, and serve it with polenta. If you’re pressed for time, you can also skip the emulsion, since it’s mainly used for a dramatic presentation at the restaurant. If you do make the emulsion, keep in mind the role of the lecithin: It helps to keep things smooth. If you choose to skip it, you will not affect the taste of the dish.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I picked up this curry sauce from Chef Kazuto Matsusaka and his wife, Vicky, while working at Above, where he was executive chef. I learned a lot from Chef Matsusaka; every day I was introduced to an ingredient I’d never worked with before. There was mirin, miso, ponzu, white soy sauce, uni—just to name a few. The simplicity in what Matsusaka did and the flavors he could extract from just three ingredients helped me to understand that sometimes you don’t need forty ingredients and six techniques on one plate. Just let the few elegant ingredients shine. If you look at my food today, Chef Matsusaka’s influence is very evident.</p>

Add the coconut milk and cook until the liquid has reduced by one-third, about 20 minutes. Transfer the curry to a bain marie (see <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page240">Technique</a>) or a nonreactive container and add the kaffir lime leaves. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let infuse for 1 hour. The accumulated moisture that will gather on the inside of the plastic wrap will look like it is raining.</p>

Using an immersion blender, puree the liquid until smooth and strain it through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Season to taste with salt and set aside. You will need 4 cups of the curry for this recipe; freeze the remainder for use another time (it makes a terrific soup).</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the basmati Rice Cakes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a medium bowl, stir together the heavy cream and cornstarch. Add the rice and scallions, cover, and refrigerate the batter for at least 2 hours.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is as greenmarket driven as a dish can get. On Saturday mornings, we go to the Tribeca greenmarket and always stop by Blue Moon Fish. In the summer, we get their line-caught fluke before we walk around the rest of the greenmarket and see what else is available. And then we compose a dish based on what’s in season. When we first opened, we would do a Saturday night fish special with the fish we’d gotten at the market a few hours before. If you look at the components of this dish, after I picked up the fish, I probably went to the next stand and picked up some corn, and then to the next stand to get some green tomatoes, and so on. And when I got back to the restaurant, I threw it all together and it came out beautifully. This is proof positive that when you have fresh, ripe, in-season ingredients, you get delicious, inspiring results.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>The native people of our shores would cook fish tied to cedar planks that were kept around the fire. My father adapted the idea and became famous for his cedar-planked salmon. In a nod to my old man and the Native Americans, here is my take on cedar-planked fish—I like to use Quinault Tribe steelhead trout, which comes directly from the Quinault Indian Reservation and has a very limited season. We pair the trout with a staple in Native American cooking—heirloom hominy from Anson Mills. It takes a while to prepare and you need culinary lime (see <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#note1">Note</a>), but once you try heirloom hominy, there’s no turning back.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pour the water into a medium enamel- or porcelain-coated pot. Add the culinary lime and stir with a wooden spoon until the lime has dissolved. Bring the lime water to a rolling boil over high heat. As soon as the water comes to a boil, turn off the heat and let the pot stand until the lime water has cooled and cleared, 4 to 5 hours. The water will form a thin, crisp lime skin on its surface, and the liquid beneath will be clear. At the bottom, there will be a layer of cloudy lime solids.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Set a fine-mesh strainer over a 4- to 7-quart glass mixing bowl. Gently lift and tilt the pot with lime water and pour the liquid through the strainer, leaving the cloudy solids in the bowl (the lime skin will remain in the strainer). Allow the solids to settle again, then decant more lime water into the bowl, repeating the process until only about a cup of cloudy solids and water remain at the bottom of the pot. Pour the lime skin and solids down the drain and rinse the pot and sink thoroughly. Return the decanted lime water to the pot. Add the hominy. Let everything settle; skim off and discard any floating kernels. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover and turn off the heat. Let the hominy stand in the lime water at room temperature overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page80"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>The following day, turn the pot on high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook at a gentle simmer until the kernels are soft and chewy and have shed their skins, about 3 hours. To check for doneness, use a wooden spoon to lift a few kernels out of the water, rinse them under cold running water, and taste. If done, the kernels will be soft and slightly chewy. If you taste a hard, starchy center, give the hominy more time, and taste again.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Transfer the pot to a sink and run the hominy under hot water to flush out any bits of pericarp (the cellophane-like skin that encases the kernels when they’re raw), stirring with a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Drain the hominy and rinse it under hot running water, rubbing the kernels between your palms. Cool the hominy, transfer it to an airtight container, and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 1 week, or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>When ready to serve, lay the hominy out on a paper towel–lined tray until the kernels are completely dry. Add enough oil to a 4-quart saucepot to come 3 inches up the sides. Heat the oil over medium heat until it registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Add the hominy to the Dutch oven and fry for 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the hominy to a paper towel–lined tray. Season to taste with the Ararat and salt. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Trout</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Soak the cedar shims in cold water for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours—you can do this at the same time as you make the lime water for the hominy.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>About 10 minutes before serving, preheat a broiler to high and place the shims under the broiler (reserve the soaking water), just until they begin to smoke and take on a little color. Return the shims to the soaking water for 5 minutes. Remove and pat dry. Reduce the broiler heat to medium. Brush the “fat” part of the shims with some of the softened butter and sprinkle some salt on top. Brush the fillets with the softened butter and season the bone side with salt. Place the fillet, skin side down, on a shim and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of mustard powder on each fillet. Broil the fish until cooked through, about 3 minutes for medium-rare.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Old-Fashioned Egg Sauce</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a saucepot. Add the eggs and 3 tablespoons of the vinegar. Reduce the heat enough to maintain a slow, gentle simmer and simmer the eggs for 9 minutes. Immediately transfer the pot to the sink, pour off the hot water, and run the eggs under cold water for 3 minutes. Peel the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Using the finest side of a box grater, grate the yolks and whites into separate bowls and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>In a nonreactive saucepot, combine the wine, the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, peppercorns, thyme, shallot, and bay leaf and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the pan is dry, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the cream and cook, stirring, until the liquid has reduced by about one-third. Strain the mixture and return it to the pan. Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, waiting for each piece of butter to be fully emulsified before adding the next. Add salt to taste and whisk in the lemon juice. Remove from the eat and keep warm.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Right before serving, whisk the parsley, tarragon, grated egg whites, and grated egg yolks into the sauce.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chanterelles</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Add enough oil to a large skillet to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the mushrooms in one even layer, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the mushrooms begin to brown on the edges, about 3 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Add the butter, garlic halves, and thyme, and cook, stirring, until both the butter and mushrooms are browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the wine, and cook until the wine has been absorbed and the pan is nearly dry. Add the stock and cook until it has been absorbed and the pan is nearly dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper, discard the garlic and thyme, and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Remove the fish from the broiler and transfer the still-smoking planks (along with the fish) to 4 plates large enough to hold the planks. Ladle the egg sauce over the fish and spoon the chanterelles and Fried Heirloom Hominy around.</p>
			<p class="RecipeFootnote" id="note1"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>Lime is a caustic substance and should not come into prolonged contact with your skin. If you touch culinary lime in either dry or liquid form, rinse the exposed area with cold water. Make sure to carefully and thoroughly rinse all the utensils and pots, as well any surfaces (sink, counters) that came in contact with culinary lime.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Andrea Anjera Jr.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When my restaurant was struggling financially, Andrea Anjera Jr., of Community Catch, was one of the few purveyors to extend a line of credit to us and patiently wait until we had money to pay it back. He showed kindness to us that went beyond a business relationship–something I’m particularly grateful for and humbled by.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Andrea also happens to be the guy who procured baby halibut for me–a dish that was so incredibly popular at the restaurant that we served it until the farm raising the fish lost funding and went out of business. It was an amazing product, and I still miss it.</p>
			
			<p class="FeaturePara">But Andrea and I continue to work together on unique fish that is sustainably sourced and whose origins we can trace, or there is a local connection. That’s Andrea’s specialty.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">While Community Catch, formerly Litchfield Farms, was originally a meat-sourcing business founded by Andrea’s grandfather in 1939, when Andrea took over in 2000, he got the company to focus solely on organic and pasture-raised meat.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The decision to move from meat to fish was originally prompted by a conversation Andrea had with his children one day when he was lamenting about how they were the last generation who would be able to eat certain fish. It looked to be a bleak picture for some sea populations.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">After doing some research, Andrea located organic fish producers in the UK and Ireland in 2004, and started to bring in organic salmon, trout, and halibut. A few years later, Community Catch stopped dealing with meat altogether and switched over to only fish.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Today, Andrea works with his extensive network of farmers and harvesters, focuses on traceability and sustainability, sourcing unique, hard-to-find fish. It’s a hands-on approach that works well for me and my chefs, as we look at seafood sustainability in the exact same way. We, too, want our children, and their children, and their children to enjoy the same seafood that we do. And it’s working with people like Andrea that makes a difference. Every little bit counts.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Sauce Proposal</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Make the brown butter: Add 4 tablespoons of the butter to a sauté pan set over medium heat and cook until the solids brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately transfer the brown butter to an ice bath, whisking to cool down the butter. This step is important because if the brown butter is not whisked while being cooled, it will separate. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Toast the hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan for 10 to 12 minutes or until fragrant. Remove the skins by rubbing the hazelnuts with a kitchen towel. Cool the nuts, then place them in a plastic bag. Using a mallet or a rolling pin, pound the nuts until they are crushed. Set aside 2 tablespoons; reserve the rest for another use (or eat them!).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Add enough olive oil to a sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring from time to time, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, transfer the onions to a plate, and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Return the pan to the stovetop. Add enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add enough cauli-flower and Romanesco florets to cover the bottom of the pan in one layer, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Once the florets begin to brown slightly, add 3 tablespoons of the butter. Let the butter melt, gently shake the pan, season with salt, and transfer the florets to a plate lined with a paper towel. Set the cooked florets aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page84"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a 2-quart saucepan, bring the lime juice and soy sauce to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until well incorporated and emulsified. Whisk in the reserved brown butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Remove from the heat and blend with an immersion blender or in a stand blender. Keep the sauce warm.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Right before serving, stir in the cooked florets, raisins, capers, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cauliflower Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a saucepot, combine the cauliflower, cream, and a pinch of salt and cook over medium heat until the cauliflower is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Reserve the cooking liquid. Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor fitted with a blade, or a blender, and pulse a few times. Add the cooking liquid, a couple of tablespoons at a time, until the mixture is smooth and light. If you add too much cooking liquid too fast, your blender might explode, so be sure to add it slowly. Keep warm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Halibut en Croute</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Rinse and pat the fish dry. Brush one side of the fillets with the egg white. Sprinkle the parsley and red pepper flakes over the egg white side. Lay the bread slices out and place the fillets over the bread, herb-side down. Trim the bread to fit the filets, and gently flip the fish over so that the bread is on top.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Add enough oil to a large skillet to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over medium heat. Season two of the fillets with salt and pepper and add them to the pan, bread-side down. Carefully watch the fish, and once the edges begin to brown, transfer the fish to a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined baking pan, bread side up. Pour the oil from the pan on top of the fish. Repeat with the remaining fillets. Let the fillets sit out for 5 minutes together so they are all roughly the same temperature when they goes into the oven. Bake the fish for about 4 minutes or until a cake tester, when inserted into the fish, comes out without any force.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Divide the fish among 4 warmed plates. Spoon the Cauliflower Puree on the side and liberally drizzle the Sauce Proposal over the fish.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>The blue-eyed cod, also commonly known as blue-eyed trevalla, is a fish commonly found in Australian waters. This mild-tasting fish has deep blue eyes with a golden ring around them, and has a texture, when cooked, somewhere between soft white fish and firmer fish like salmon. To get the blue-eyed trevalla, I work with Sea to Table, a fish distributor that partners with sustainably managed and harvested wild fisheries across the world to deliver fish to restaurants in the United States. I feel good working with a company that wants to ensure that our children and their children might have the opportunity to eat the same fish we did, and that theirs is a thoughtful approach to harvesting the ever-fluctuating fish populations.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Basil Pesto</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Bring a 4-quart pot of water to a boil. Blanch the basil in the boiling water for 1 minute, drain, and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Allow the basil to cool, then drain and squeeze out excess water.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Transfer the basil to a blender, add the garlic and olive oil, and puree for about 20 seconds. You may need to add a little more oil to get it to go, but do not add a lot or your pesto will not stay green. Immediately transfer the puree to a bowl set over an ice bath and stir until cold. Fold in the cheese and red pepper flakes. Transfer the pesto to an airtight container and refrigerate until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cuttlefish Angel Hair</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Butterfly the cuttlefish so that their bodies are open flat and trim each cuttlefish into a square. Roll the cuttlefish squares into tight cylinders and wrap the cylinders in plastic, twisting both ends to secure. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Using an adjustable mandoline, slice the frozen cuttlefish cylinders crosswise into ⅛-inch-thick slices. (If you don’t have a mandoline, skip the freezing process and slice the fish with a knife as thinly as you can.)</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page88"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>A few minutes before serving, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Add the garlic. Watch the garlic carefully, and as soon as it is toasted, turn off the heat and add the cuttlefish, tomatoes, and olives to the pan. Toss well to combine. Add the wine and lemon juice and return the pan to the stovetop over medium heat. Cook the cuttlefish for 30 seconds, scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Remove the pan from the heat and fold in the red pepper flakes, parsley, and salt to taste.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Tentacles and Fennel</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>About 10 minutes before serving, light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Lightly brush the grill with oil. Grill the reserved cuttlefish tentacles over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, turning once, until slightly charred. Alternatively, broil the tentacles on high for about 2 minutes or until slightly charred.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>A few minutes before serving, warm about 1 inch of oil in a pan set over medium-high heat. Fry the fennel fronds until crispy, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and season with salt.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cod</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>About 10 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 450ºF; position the rack in the middle. Thoroughly pat the fillets dry. Add enough oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the cod, skin side down, and reduce the heat to medium. Using a fish spatula, very gently press down on the fish so the skin is flush against the bottom of the pan. This cod is a very delicate fish, so be extra-gentle. Cook until the edges begin to brown slightly, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 3 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and a small piece cut off the fillet reveals flaky, opaque flesh. Remove from the oven, and using a spatula, carefully flip the fish onto the other side. Baste the fish once or twice with the oil in the pan and remove from the heat.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Divide the pesto among 4 plates and top with the “angel hair” and a piece of cod. Place the fennel and tentacles on the side, and squeeze a bit of the lemon over each plate. Finish everything with a drizzle of olive oil and serve.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Sydney Schwarz</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Sea to Table was born out of  a family vacation the Dimin family took in 1996 to Tobago, where the family fell in love with the daily fresh-caught fish, as well as their sustainable, traditional fishing methods used for many generations.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The Dimin family immediately realized that by providing a direct connection between the fishermen and chefs, something wonderful would happen. The business grew steadily, and today, Sea to Table employs eleven workers full-time who work with various docks throughout the United States: from Alaska to the Gulf Coast, from Florida to Montauk. Depending on the season, as well as the catch, Sea to Table works with about one hundred individual fishermen, each of whom the company knows by name. They feel that this kind of personal approach ensures higher quality of the catch and a better, more conscious sea-harvesting.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">As you’d expect, Sea to Table provides full transparency to its chefs: from who is producing the food they serve, down to the fisherman who caught the fish. Within 24 (for long boats, 48) hours, the catch is delivered to the restaurant—the fish, gently packed in ice, is never frozen.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When I first learned of the concept of getting fish from the dock (any dock!) and into my kitchen, I jumped at the opportunity to work with Sea to Table. Sydney, our sales rep, takes great care to make sure that we are as happy as the fish she sources for us. And with their commitment to sustainability and traceability, Sea to Table works to make sure that future generations will be able to enjoy the same seafood that we do.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil and Shabazi. Place the swordfish steaks in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 12.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>About 45 minutes before serving, remove the fish from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>When ready to assemble the dish, season the swordfish with salt. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the fish over medium-high heat, turning once, until a tester inserted into the fish comes out easily and is warm to the touch, about 6 minutes. Alternatively, broil the fish on high until golden brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes. To test for doneness, insert a cake tester in the center of the fish for 10 seconds, and bring it to your bottom lip. If it is warm to the touch, the fish is done.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Anchovy Maître d’ Butter</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>While the swordfish is marinating, place the butter, anchovies, parsley, shallots, chives, garlic, lemon zest, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on high speed for 30 seconds. Separate the mixture into 4 equal parts, and using plastic wrap to help mold and smooth the butter, shape the butter into logs. You will only need 1 log (about 4 tablespoons) of butter for this recipe. Freeze the rest for later use. You can use the butter any time you make a steak–it’s delicious.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page90">Make the Eggplant caponata</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>While the swordfish is marinating, cover the currants in the Sancerre and let sit. Preheat the oven to 425ºF; position the rack in the middle. Toss the red and yellow peppers in some olive oil and place them on a shallow baking pan. Roast the peppers for 25 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skins are almost black and the peppers are soft when pierced with a knife. Transfer the peppers to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow the peppers to sit for 1½ hours at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>While the peppers are resting, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the eggplant and reduce the heat to medium. Season the eggplant with salt and pepper; the eggplant will act as a sponge, so you will need to keep adding olive oil to the pan in small amounts. Cook the eggplant until soft and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Peel, seed, and cut the roasted peppers into medium dice. Transfer the cooled eggplant and peppers to a large bowl and add the chickpeas, tomatoes, and Balsamic Pearl Onions. Right before serving, fold in the basil and mint. Drizzle in the olive oil and ¼ cup of the onions’ cooking liquid. Drain the currants and add them to the mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>While the fish is coming to room temperature, bring a 2-quart saucepot of unsalted water to a boil and blanch the beans in the boiling water for 10 seconds. Immediately transfer them to an ice bath. Once cool, drain and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Plate the fish on 4 warmed plates. Dab some Anchovy Maître d’ Butter on top while the fish is still hot—you want the butter to melt—and spoon some of the caponata on the side, using the liquid as a sauce for the fish. Sprinkle the sea beans, if using, on top and serve.</p>

Living across the street from Saigon Bakery has made me slightly addicted to the “Spicy #1,” which is the café’s pork <span class="ital">bánh mì</span>. I have to eat at least one a week, or I start to get the shakes. I always wanted to do something with those flavors, and was curious about how they would work with fish. And since I’m sharing this recipe here with you, it’s probably clear: The snapper <span class="ital">bánh mì </span>gives the Spicy #1 a good run for its money. The pickled vegetables in this recipe are great to have on hand; they will spruce up any regular sandwich.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Luke Meyers</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">One of the folks we work with on sourcing the freshest, sustainably caught fish is Browne Trading Company. We’re lucky to have Luke Meyers, one of their salesmen, working with us on not only sourcing the freshest fish for the restaurant, but also in helping us plan some of our meals. We’re always asking questions: Where is the fish coming from? Who is catching it? How is it being caught? So Luke, my chefs, and I are constantly talking about what boat caught which fish and how it was caught. Because tracing the source and sustainability are important to us, Browne Trading is a great partner in helping us adhere to our principles. Their <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#page89">swordfish</a>, caught by a day boat and which we serve during swordfish season, is by far the most delicious and freshest I’ve ever had! Even people who don’t like swordfish change their mind upon tasting the Browne Trading catch!</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Established in 1991, Browne Trading places a heavy emphasis on day boat fish that are caught using low-impact fishing methods, such as line fishing, and has minimal impact on non-targeted species. They are deeply committed to sustainable fishing in the Gulf of Maine in order to preserve and protect the long-term viability of local seafood. Their overseas buyers also focus on procuring day boat fish under Browne Trading’s conditional agreement. Traceability is a key aspect of the company’s focus: from fishing ground, catch method, vessel, location, and how and when it is transported to Browne Trading facility.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The company employs a handful of salespeople who are deeply knowledgeable not only about the fish that’s currently being offered, but also of the preferences of the chefs who they work with.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro para-style-override-34"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>When I was apprenticing in Europe, I spent two weeks in Spain at a friend’s house, and his family made amazing paella in a giant paella pan in their backyard. They added everything to it: seafood, chicken, clams, mussels, chorizo, cod—you name it. Here, I wanted to pay homage to that paella but with my own twist. Instead of chicken, I use only chicken skin, which we wrap the monkfish in. It’s all the components of paella but arranged slightly differently. The chorizo becomes a chorizo emulsion, and the rice is brightened up by some preserved lemon rind.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Add enough olive oil to a sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over medium heat. Warm the oil until it shimmers. Add the chorizo and cook until it releases its spices and aromatics—the oil will turn red—2 to 3 minutes. You will see some brown bits (<span class="ital">fond</span>) form at the bottom of the pan.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Add the onion, red bell pepper, poblano pepper, and garlic, and deglaze the pan with the vegetables, stirring, letting them sweat until soft, about 5 minutes. Do not let the vegetables pick up color—you might want to reduce the heat to medium-low, depending on the intensity of your burners. Stir in the paprika and cook for about 1 minute. Add the wine and simmer until the pan is dry, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the stock, oregano, and basil, and simmer until the broth tastes distinctly of chorizo, about 40 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page98"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Strain the broth and discard the solids. Return the broth to the stovetop, skim any foam from the surface, and simmer the broth over medium-low heat until it has reduced to about 1 cup.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add the butter, lemon juice, and 2 or 3 dashes of smoked paprika to the broth, and using an immersion blender, whip the liquid until it forms a smooth and uniform emulsion.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Monkfish and Valencia Bomba Rice</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Lay out a piece of the chicken skin on a piece of plastic wrap and place a monkfish fillet toward the bottom edge of the skin. Season both sides with salt and place on a paper towel–lined tray. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken skin and monkfish fillets. Refrigerate overnight, uncovered. Remove the tray from the fridge. Sprinkle a little Activa all over the skin and fish, roll the skin around the fish, and then tightly wrap the fish in plastic wrap, twisting the ends to secure and shape the roll. Repeat with the remaining chicken skin and monkfish. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours to set the Activa.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>About 25 to 30 minutes before serving, in a large sauté pan (or a paella pan, if you have one), warm the oil over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the onion and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the onion, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the tomato paste and pimentón. Cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more. Add the stock, saffron, and a pinch of salt. Add the rice, spreading it in a nice, even layer. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook for 4 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds or so. Add the olives, Roasted Peppers, and Lemon Confit, and reduce the heat to low. Cook, without disturbing the pan, for 8 minutes. Add the mussels and clams, cover the pan, and cook for about 3 minutes or until the mussels and clams open. Discard any shellfish that do not open. Remove from the heat and drizzle olive oil over the rice. Using a fine zester, zest the lemon right over the pan. Stir in the parsley, set aside, and keep warm.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>About 20 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add enough oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the fish to the pan, seam side down, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook, without moving the fish, until the chicken skin is browned, about 2 minutes. Flip the fish, transfer the pan to the oven, and cook the fish for 4 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the fish comes out easily and is warm to the touch. While the fish is in the oven, return the emulsion to the stovetop and warm over medium-low heat. Transfer the fish back to the stovetop and flip the fish back to sear side. Turn the heat up to medium and add the butter, garlic, and thyme, and baste the fish for 3 to 4 minutes in the brown butter. Transfer the fish to a plate and allow the fish to rest for 1 minute. Cut each filet into 3 pieces.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Right before serving, add the monkfish slices to the paella pan, sprinkle with the micro limone, and pour the warm Chorizo Emulsion over the paella.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Instead of wrapping the monkfish in the chicken skin, you can go the more traditional route and add pieces of chicken to the paella. The Chorizo Emulsion can be made a day ahead, or you can skip it all together, and the rest of the meal should come together pretty fast the following day.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I love making this dish and think you should absolutely give this a go, but it will make a lot of smoke indoors. So, if you are making this at home, it’s best made outside on the grill where the smoke won’t set off your smoke alarm. At the restaurant we cook it indoors, but we are equipped to deal with a lot of smoke. Next time you host a cookout in your backyard, consider making it for your guests. It’ll be a welcome change to hot dogs and burgers and your friends will be impressed. The squash pickles, on their own, are a great accompaniment to anything grilled: fish, steak, or a burger.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Squash Pickles</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium nonreactive bowl, combine the squashes, beets, celery root, apples, and shallot.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small nonreactive saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, chile, and a pinch of salt with ½ cup of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately pour the marinade over the vegetables. Let cool slightly, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Right before serving, remove the pickled vegetables from the marinade and combine them with the parsley, red pepper flakes, and some olive oil. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Apple Tea</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>If you have fresh-pressed the juice, let the juice settle for 1 hour and skim off any foam on the surface. Add the apple juice, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, rosemary, and mint to a 2-quart nonreactive pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and allow the liquid to infuse for 20 minutes, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter into a bowl and set it aside. If making a day in advance, refrigerate until needed. Right before serving, warm the Apple Tea over medium heat until hot.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page102">Make the Arctic Char</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Using the back of a spoon, scrape all the meat off the fish skin. Line a half-sheet baking pan with a Silpat or parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Lay the salmon skins out flat. Cover them with another Silpat or sheet of parchment paper and place another half-sheet baking pan on top. Bake for 7 minutes or until the skin is crispy. Transfer to a cooling rack and remove the top pan.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>While the char skin chips are baking, soak the applewood chips in a bowl of water for 20 minutes. Line the bottom of a 4-inch deep casserole dish with foil. Place the soaked wood chips into a sauté pan and heat until smoking, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chips to the casserole dish, and make a “basket” out of foil to hang over the edges of the pot so that when you place the fish in it, it will be suspended over the chips. Poke 10 to 12 holes in the “basket” using a paring knife. Pat the fillets dry and season with olive oil and salt. Gently place the fish on top of the perforated foil. Cover the casserole, remove it from the heat, and smoke the fish for about 4 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>About 30 minutes before serving, remove the char from the refrigerator and allow it to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the fillets, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the bottom of the fish is browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the fillets and cook until a cake tester, inserted in the fillet, comes out easily and is warm to the touch, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Celery Root Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>While the fish is cooling to room temperature, in a medium pot, combine the celery root, cream, stock, and a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, so that the cream is gently simmering. Cook until the celery root is fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid, and transfer the celery root to a blender.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Cook until the solids turn brown and the butter smells nutty. Add the brown butter to the blender with the celery root along with a little bit of the reserved celery root cooking liquid, and puree, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to high, until the mixture is light and smooth, about 2 minutes. Pass the puree through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, and add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and rosemary. Wrap the bowl tightly in plastic wrap and let the puree infuse for 1 hour. Discard the aromatics.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Divide the fish among 4 warmed large bowls. Serve with the Pickled Squash and Celery Root Puree. Garnish with the char skin chips. At the table, pour the hot Apple Tea into the bowls and serve.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>For a slightly faster preparation, skip the arctic char skin chip and smoke the fish with the skin on.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is a play on my dad’s signature dish, <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#page79">Cedar-Planked Salmon</a>, which I have also adapted). But here, I wanted to do something that was perfect for the summer months: nice, light, and fresh. So instead of cooking the fish through <span class="ital">on</span> a cedar plank, the plank is actually used to warm the raw fish and impart a little smoke <span class="ital">from</span> the wood itself. It’s a great easy-to-make, simple appetizer that always reminds me of building a fire on the beach and grilling fresh seafood. Life doesn’t get better than that.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Lemon Pickles</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Lemon Pickles</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Thoroughly rinse the lemons and cut them in half crosswise. Using a mandoline, slice the lemon halves into 1/16-inch-thick slices and transfer them to a nonreactive container. Discard the seeds.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Slice the hamachi into 12 slices, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>When ready to serve, preheat the broiler and season the planks with some extra-virgin olive oil and salt. Place the planks back in under the broiler until smoking; watch the planks carefully because at this point they could catch fire if left under the broiler for too long. As soon as the planks start to smoke, take them out from under the broiler and squeeze some lemon juice over the planks. Divide the hamachi evenly among the planks and garnish with some caviar, basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of flaky sea salt. Dice the Lemon Pickles and serve on the side.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Believe it or not, I got the idea for the chicken skin jus from the excellent cookbook <span class="ital">The Art of Living According to Joe Beef</span>. At the time, we were making John Dory with the sweetbreads, and needed a savory jus to pull it all together. We were already making <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#page97">monkfish</a> with the chicken skin, one of my favorite snacks to eat, so we decided to give chicken skin jus a whirl and it came out great—so flavorful!

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page106">Make the Sweetbreads</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Soak the sweetbreads in a bowl of water in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, changing the water at least 2 times. Remove and thoroughly pat the sweetbreads dry.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small nonreactive saucepot, combine the vinegar and a pinch of salt with 1½ cups of water and bring to a boil. Add the sweetbreads and simmer for 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the sweetbreads to an ice bath and soak for 5 minutes or until cooled. Remove the sweetbreads from the ice bath, pat dry, and transfer to a work surface.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Using a paring knife, peel off the outer membranes and any excess fat from the sweetbreads. Set the sweetbreads aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, season the sweetbreads with salt and add them to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and do not move the pan until the bottom of the sweetbreads has browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Flip the sweetbreads over and add the bacon to the pan. Cook until the second side of the sweetbreads is browned. Add 1½ tablespoons of the butter. Continue to cook until the butter browns, about 2 minutes, baste sweetbreads with the butter for 1 minute, and transfer to a medium (3- to 4-quart) Dutch oven.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Drain the excess fat from the pan, and add the carrot, onion, and celery, scraping any brown bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken and veal stocks, 2 sprigs of the thyme, and the bay leaf. Bring the liquid to a boil and pour it over the sweetbreads. Refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>The next day, remove the sweetbreads from the liquid and trim them into 4 (2-ounce) pieces. Set aside. Discard the cooking liquid.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Right before serving, add enough Blended Oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the sweetbreads and sear for 1 minute on each side. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, remaining 2 sprigs thyme, and garlic, and baste the sweetbreads in the butter for about 1 minute. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chicken Skin Jus</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>While the sweetbreads are soaking, preheat the oven to 375ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add enough oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the chicken skin, garlic, carrot, onion, celery, and peppercorns. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chicken skin is slightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook, occasionally straining out the fat that collects in the pan, for about 30 minutes or until the skin is crispy.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Return the pan to the stovetop. Reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF. Turn the stovetop heat to medium, and using a wooden spoon, scrape off any bits that may be sticking to the pan. Once the skins begin to sizzle, add the wine and continue to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Cook until the wine has reduced by half. Add the stock and scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Transfer the contents of the pan to a narrow ovenproof saucepot. Add the thyme, bay leaf, and salt to taste; cover and braise in the oven for 1½ hours.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Strain the jus through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the solids. Pour the jus back into the pot, return it to the stovetop, and bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, so the jus is actively simmering, and skim off any fat that rises to the surface. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Stir in the vinegar and sugar. Strain the jus again and set aside. You should have about 2 cups of jus; you will need 1 cup for this recipe. The remaining jus can be frozen and used for anything from a hearty salad dressing to a sauce for a roasted chicken.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page107">Make the Chicken Skin Chips</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Scrape the excess fat off the skin using a spoon or the back of a knife. Season the skins with salt and transfer them to a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined shallow baking tray. Place another Silpat or piece of parchment paper over the skins and place another shallow baking tray on top. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until the skins are crispy (start to check on them after 25 minutes). Set the crisped skins on a cooling rack in a dry place and place a paper towel underneath to catch any dripping fat.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Radishes</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Using different sized melon ballers, scoop out black, red, and daikon radishes into assorted size spheres. Keep the radishes separate. Quarter the icicle radishes.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>In a large sauté pan, add the black radish with 2 tablespoons of the butter and melt the butter over medium heat. When the butter is melted and the pan is heated through, add about ¼ cup of the chicken stock and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Slowly let the stock reduce and the sugar glaze the radishes until they are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and set aside. Repeat the same process for the remaining radishes—because the radishes are of different sizes, the cooking times will vary. Set aside and rewarm slightly over low heat right before serving.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Chard</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span>Remove the stems from the chard leaves and cut the leaves into ½-inch ribbons. Peel the stems and cut them on the bias (they will have slanted diamond shapes).</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">15.	</span>When ready to serve, in a large pan set over medium heat, heat the butter and garlic, and once the garlic is beginning to toast, add the chard stems and leaves with 1 cup of water, and stir together. Season with salt and cover. Cook for about 2 minutes or until the leaves are wilted. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the John Dory</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">16.	</span>Pat the fish dry and season with kosher salt. In a large sauté pan, heat the butter and oil over medium-high heat. As soon as the butter begins to brown, add the fish and thyme. Shake the pan to prevent sticking, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Watch the butter: If it starts to get too dark, add a little bit more oil.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">17.	</span>Remove from the heat and divide the fish among 4 warmed plates. Add the Radishes, the Swiss Chard, and the Sweetbreads around the fish. Ladle a little bit of the Chicken Skin Jus over the fish and season with the flaky sea salt. Scatter the radish sprouts, if using, over the fish and top with a Chicken Skin Chip.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>Make the radishes using just one size melon baller and cook them all together instead of separately. Then make the chard and John Dory; skip the sweetbreads. You can make a large batch of Chicken Skin Chips ahead of time, freeze them, and just defrost what you need.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page110">Make the Sorrento Oil Emulsion</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small pot, bring the Sorrento lemon oil, butter, lemon juice, and stock to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat and emulsify with an immersion blender until smooth. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Marinated Cherry Tomatoes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small skillet over medium heat, toast the coriander seeds until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and pestle and crack. Let cool.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Using a paring knife, make a small X incision at the bottom of each cherry tomato. Blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water for 1 minute and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Let the tomatoes cool, then peel the skins off.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In a medium bowl, mix together the cracked coriander, peeled tomatoes, onion, olive oil, ginger juice, basil, mint, vinegar, and garlic. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and allow the tomato mixture to sit at room temperature for 4 hours.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Basil Crust</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a small dry skillet, toast the pine nuts over low heat for about 3 minutes or until golden brown and fragrant. Transfer to a bowl to cool and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Blanch the basil for 1 minute, drain, and immediately transfer the basil to an ice bath. Allow the basil to cool, then drain and squeeze out excess moisture.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Place the toasted pine nuts, basil, bread crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, butter, chives, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor fitted with a blade. Pulse until the ingredients form a fine green puree. Transfer the puree to a half-sheet-pan-size piece of parchment paper, cover the puree with another piece of parchment paper, and using a rolling pin, roll the puree out so it’s ⅛ inch thick. If the crust comes out on the sides, scoop it back up, put it back in the center, and roll again. Transfer the crust to a half-sheet baking pan and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until the butter sets. Once set, cut the crust into pieces corresponding to the fillet shapes and return the cut-out pieces to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or, preferably, overnight. Freeze the rest of the crust in an airtight container for another use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page111">Make the Basil Pesto</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Blanch the basil in the boiling water for 1 minute, drain, and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Let cool, then drain the basil and squeeze out excess moisture.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>In a food processor fitted with a blade, puree the blanched basil, olive oil, and garlic for about 20 seconds. You might need to add a tiny bit more oil if the mixture is too thick, but add a little bit at a time, because if you add too much, your pesto will not remain bright green. Immediately transfer the pesto to a medium bowl set over a larger bowl of ice water (an ice bath) and stir until cold. Fold in the cheese and red pepper flakes. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Halibut</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Rinse and pat the fillets dry. Place the basil stems on a baking sheet. Season the fillets with salt on both sides, and place the fish on top of the basil. Drizzle the wine and olive oil over the fish and transfer to the oven. Check the fillets after 8 minutes by inserting a cake tester, and if it comes out without force, the fish is cooked through. Transfer the fish to a cooling rack.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Right before serving, preheat the broiler; position the rack in the middle. Place the fish on a baking sheet. Place a piece of the crust on top of each fillet. Broil the fish for about 30 seconds or until the crust is set and is bright green. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>While the fish is baking, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Make a small X incision on the bottom of each tomato. Blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water for 1 minute and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Let the tomatoes cool and, gently, using a paring knife, peel back the skins of the tomatoes three-quarters of the way. You will have 4 peeled cherry tomatoes on the vine with the peeled skin still on, like petals on a flower. Set the peeled tomatoes aside. (This can be done ahead.)</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Divide the Marinated Cherry Tomatoes among 4 bowls. Place the halibut on top and spoon some Sorrento Oil Emulsion around. Drizzle the Basil Pesto over the tomatoes and sprinkle flaky sea salt on top. Dip the peeled tomatoes on the vine in the pesto and flaky sea salt, and serve them on the side of the fish. Sprinkle with more flaky sea salt to finish and serve with the remaining emulsion on the side.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNotePara"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>This is a beautiful but involved restaurant recipe—at home you might want to make things simpler. Just make the Marinated Cherry Tomatoes ahead of time, and when ready, make the Halibut and maybe skip the Sorrento Oil Emulsion and Basil Crust. If you do make the crust, double or triple your batch, and freeze the extra, so you can re-create the dish in no time. If you don’t have time to make your own pesto, or the available basil looks lackluster, find a quality premade pesto and use it instead. Any leftover tomatoes and pesto can be tossed with your pasta the following day for a superb, simple dinner.</p>
