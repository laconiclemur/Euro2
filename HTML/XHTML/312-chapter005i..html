<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">All over France you find tartines or in Italy you find crostini—both are wonderful open-faced sandwiches. At Buvette, I serve tartinettes, which are smaller versions of the same. A vehicle for just about anything, tartinettes or crostini invite improvisation. They are a miraculous way to use up all sorts of leftover bits of cheese, pickled vegetables, meats, pestos, and more. They can be sweet—say, ricotta and good honey or roasted fruit—and can be served for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or with drinks. They are my most favorite way of taking a dish I love and reducing it down to a single bite—oxtail marmalade, for example. Below you’ll find three of my favorites to have alongside a cocktail or glass of wine, a promise of the meal to come.</p></div>

<p class="ingredient">8 small pieces toasted country bread</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Use this nutty pesto as a thick spread on crunchy grilled toast. Food critic Frank Bruni called this pesto “adult peanut butter” in a <em>New York Times</em> review. That was a compliment, I think.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 1 CUP PESTO; ENOUGH FOR 6 TARTINETTES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">

<p class="ingredient">1 small garlic clove, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes (either packed in oil or softened in hot water for 10 minutes; either way, be sure to drain them)</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Remember, big dishes can be small dishes. This deeply concentrated version of braised oxtails is a lot of heft in a small package. Not only can you make this in advance, but it’s actually better if you do. Oxtails can be purchased in most grocery stores, or from ethnic or specialty butchers.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 3 CUPS; ENOUGH FOR 6 TO 8 PEOPLE AS AN APPETIZER]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">3 pounds oxtails, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 yellow onion, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large carrot, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large celery stalk, diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 juniper berries, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Two 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredient">Zest of ½ orange, removed in large strips with a vegetable peeler</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup water</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon honey</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup golden raisins</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup raw walnuts, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredient">Warm toast, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 350°F.</p>
<p>Season the oxtail pieces aggressively with salt and pepper on all sides. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat and sear the oxtails until browned all over, about 5 minutes a side. Transfer the browned oxtails to a plate. Remove and discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pot.</p>
<p>Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to the remaining fat in the pot and cook, stirring now and again, until the vegetables are just beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Add the white wine to the pot, increase the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook until the wine has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chocolate, bay leaf, juniper, rosemary, orange zest, and water to the pot and return the browned oxtails to the mixture.</p>
<p>Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and braise until the meat is incredibly tender, about 2½ hours.</p>
<p>Remove the oxtails from the oven and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove all of the meat from the bones and set it aside on a plate. Discard the bones as well as the rosemary sprigs, bay leaf, and strips of orange zest.</p>
<p>Set the pot with the cooking liquid and vegetables over high heat and bring it to a boil. Cook until the mixture is wonderfully thick and reduced, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the reserved oxtail meat, the vinegar, honey, raisins, and walnuts. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Serve warm on toast.</p>
