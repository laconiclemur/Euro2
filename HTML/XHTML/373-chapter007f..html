<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Sometimes I see beautiful <em>galettes</em> in the windows of bakeries with painstakingly thin slices of perfect apples, all arranged in concentric circles, the whole thing a pale shade of gold. Just gorgeous. And all I can think is <em>why would you have that when you could have a tarte Tatin?</em></p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 6 TO 8]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">9 apples (see Recipe Note <a href="chapter007f.xhtml#page-244r">here</a>), peeled, halved, and cored</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 sheet prepared puff pastry (usually 7 to 9 ounces)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Crème fraîche, for serving</p>
<p class="ingredient">Caramel Glaze (optional) (see <a href="chapter007f.xhtml#page-244c1">here</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</p>
<p>Pour the sugar into a heavy, ovenproof 8-inch skillet and place over medium heat. Give the pan one quick shake so that the sugar is in an even layer. Let the heat and the sugar do the work. It needs no stirring or swirling until the sugar caramelizes, about 8 minutes. Do not walk away while the caramel is forming because it can burn very quickly! When the caramel is dark amber in color, immediately turn off the burner and remove the skillet from the heat. If you do not have a heavy, 8-inch skillet, you can make the caramel in a small pot and then pour it in an even layer into an 8- or 10-inch cake pan and go from there.</p>
<p>Once the caramel has cooled down a bit (it doesn’t have to be room temperature, but you don’t want it to be boiling hot), arrange the apples in the skillet by placing each one on its side and snugly tucking each consecutive one as closely together as possible to form tight, concentric circles. Really pack in the apples and pile any extras on top. It will seem like too many, but they will shrink as they cook and release a lot of liquid.</p>
<p>Cover the apples tightly with aluminum foil, being sure to seal the edges. This will hold in the steam, which will help the apples to cook evenly and thoroughly. Place the skillet on the foil-covered baking sheet (to catch any juice that might come out) and bake in the oven until the apples are wonderfully soft and collapsed, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>Remove the skillet from the oven and discard the foil. Rearrange the apples, if necessary, as some may have shrunk. (See Caramel Glaze directions on the next page.) Set the pan over high heat and cook until the juices are completely reduced and sticky and, when you shake the pan, all of the apples start to move as a single layer, just 3 or 4 minutes. Be careful not to burn the apples and the caramel. Once the juices have reduced, remove the skillet from the heat and carefully <a id="page-244"/>place the puff pastry over the apples, trimming it so it fits the skillet. Place the skillet back on the baking sheet, return it to the oven, and bake until the puff pastry is really nicely browned, 35 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the tart from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes. Place a large plate over the puff pastry and <em>very carefully</em> invert the tart, being very cautious not to burn yourself (caramel is hot, dangerous stuff). Let the skillet sit, upside down, over the plate for a minute or two so that gravity begins to do its job, and the apples release from the bottom of the pan. Without shaking the pan, slowly lift it up and away as the tart remains on the plate. If a few of the apples stick to the pan, simply help them out with a spoon—no big deal and no one will know!</p>
<p>Cut the tarte Tatin into slices and serve hot, or at room temperature, with plenty of crème fraîche and caramel glaze (see below), if you like.</p></div>

<h1 class="procedure-title" id="page-244c1"><span class="dotted">CARAMEL GLAZE</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">If you don’t mind an extra step and a small pot to wash, you can easily make a shiny, thick glaze to cover the tarte Tatin. When you take the apples out of the oven after they’ve cooked, instead of reducing the liquid on the stovetop, carefully pour the liquid off into a small saucepan, being sure not to disrupt your apple arrangement. The easiest way to do this is to cover the pan with a pot lid and tip the pan into the saucepan so that the lid catches any apples that threaten to escape. Cover the drained apples with the pastry and tuck it into the oven as instructed. Meanwhile, boil the strained liquid until it is dark golden brown and quite thick and set it aside. Once you’ve inverted your tarte Tatin, use a spoon to evenly cover the apples with the glaze.</p></div>

<h1 class="simplesect-title">On Choosing the Right Fruit</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">I use Gala apples for tarte Tatin, but you can use other types if you’d like, including Golden Delicious or Honeycrisp. Be sure, no matter which type you use, that your apples are all the same size so that they cook evenly.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><em>Steal the caramelized apples from the tarte Tatin to make an exceptional applesauce, especially good for topping Potato Pancakes (<a href="chapter006m.xhtml#page-184">here</a>). To make it, once the apples are done baking, but before they are topped with puff pastry, mash them with a fork, season to taste with salt, and eat hot, at room temperature, or cold.</em></p>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-245"/><span class="violet1"><span class="dotted">Peaches Roasted in Amaretto</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Amaretto is a sweet Italian liqueur made from apricot and almond pits, which has a round, nutty flavor. Pouring it over ripe summer peaches and sending the combination into the broiler to caramelize yields a delicious and memorable dessert that could not be easier to make. As with all simple things, the results depend entirely on the quality of your ingredients so only make this when you have great peaches on hand.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 peaches</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup amaretto</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">Crème fraîche or Fior di Latte Gelato (<a href="chapter007i.xhtml#page-250f">here</a>), for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the broiler</strong> to high.</p>
<p>Halve the peaches and remove and discard the pits.</p>
<p>Place the peach halves in a skillet that will hold them in a single layer. Pour the amaretto over the peaches and sprinkle with the sugar. Place the skillet on the stovetop over high heat to burn off the alcohol, about 3 minutes. Pay attention when the amaretto cooks off its alcohol, taking care not to burn the mixture. Transfer the pan to the broiler and broil until the peaches are browned and the liquid has reduced to a honeylike consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve the peaches hot, warm, at room temperature, or even cold. These are just perfect by themselves or with a bit of crème fraîche or Fior di Latte Gelato.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-titleh"><span class="dotted">Digestifs</span></h1>
<p class="noindent"><em>A glass of cognac, Calvados, or Armagnac is very nice following a meal. Known as</em> digestifs, <em>the liquors contribute to what I consider the art of the digestif, which is the ritual following dinner that marries gastronomy and conviviality, and aids digestion. I like to drop off a tray of cognac and glasses at the table and let my guests help themselves. Arcane etiquette: digestifs are always passed to the left and poured by oneself.</em></p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Bosc pears are better suited for roasting than Bartletts or Fiorellos. They can be enjoyed warm or cold on their own as a winter dessert, or served alongside a wedge of blue cheese.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 medium Bosc pears</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups red wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cinnamon stick, if you have one</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Place the whole pears, <em>au naturel,</em> in a small ovenproof skillet standing upright side by side. Pour the red wine over the pears and sprinkle with sugar. Add the cinnamon stick and bake for 45 minutes, until fork-tender and a sweet glaze has formed. More wine or water may be added if the liquid is reducing too fast.</p></div>
