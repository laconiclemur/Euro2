			<p class="FMTX2">Greg Marchand’s passion for cooking began in the kitchen of the French orphanage where he was raised. At 20, after putting himself through cooking school, Marchand began a journey that would take him to London, Hong Kong, Spain, and New York. While cooking at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen, he earned the nickname Frenchie, an appellation that stuck. After 10 years cooking abroad, he returned home to open Frenchie the restaurant, and soon thereafter, a wine bar and a take-out food shop called Frenchie to Go—all on rue du Nil, which is now the most exciting food street in Paris.</p>
