		<p class="pf page_break_before" id="p228"><span class="PF-lead-in"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">ABOUT A WEEK</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> after we moved to St Yzans, sometime in early January, Oddur, Mia, and Þórir went out for a walk with some of our dogs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">By then we had realized that though the house at No 1 rue de Loudenne was the home of our dreams, the setup wasn’t equally dreamy for the army of primarily hunting dogs we had assembled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">They were used to roaming the forests on their own, digging for moles and snakes and rats, tearing up any plants they felt like, chewing on anything they could find. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">A much smaller, manicured courtyard with rosebushes and olive trees and sensitive elderly ladies occasionally passing by was never going to be anything but a poor substitute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.5">For a few days after our move it seemed that Oddur would never do anything else for the rest of his life other than walk the dogs.</span></p>
		<p class="p"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">On that particular day in January, he and the kids unexpectedly found at least a partial solution to the dog dilemma and in the process also paved the way for a fruitful summer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Just down the street from our house, about two hundred yards from our front door, they found a rusty gate and behind it a secret garden heavy with a mixture of unwanted shrubs and weeds and wonderful fruit trees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">They ventured inside uninvited and discovered another garden behind the first one, complete with an old barn, a dilapidated woodshed, and a view of the vineyards.</span></p>
		<p class="p"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">When they returned they gushed about their find: This garden was apparently the answer to all of our problems, from where to let the dogs play, to where to have outside dinner, to where to plant vegetables, and even to where to put the swimming pool (not that we ever planned to build one). </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Nobody seemed to be using this land—but surely someone, somewhere, had to own it?</span></p>
		<p class="p"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Had we not been new to St Yzans, the answer would have been immediately clear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">A place like this could only ever belong to one man, Mr. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">Monopoly himself, the man who collects questionable property the way other people collect, well, dogs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">Monsieur Teyssier seems to own half of St Yzans yet drives around in a beat-up little car, dresses simply, and arrives without much fanfare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.5">Someone described him perfectly as the ideal spy, a man who can fit in anywhere and whom no one really notices. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.6">Through Mr. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.7">Ladra, who sold us the house, we tracked down Mr. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.8">Teyssier, and he took the whole family on a tour of the secret garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.9">He wouldn’t sell us the land (he never really sells anything), but he could see the benefit of our using it, for a small fee, especially if we put some order to the place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.10">Regarding the fruit trees he would appreciate if he could still have some access to them: Perhaps some participation program could be arranged? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.11">In the end, an invisible contract was written and signed: We would take care of the place and manage it, and he could still enjoy it from time to time.</span></p>
		<p class="p" id="p231"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">In March we fixed the old fences and built new ones. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">We fought and won our battle with the thorn forest and its allies, the stinging nettles and weeds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">We decided where to build our vegetable garden, and Tim, our then resident gardener and musician from Cambridge, prepared the soil, and his girlfriend, Annie, sowed the seeds that would later become the foundation of our very successful summer garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">We planted the fava beans late—too late, in fact, so that our entire crop consisted of a handful of mediocre beans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.5">But we had great success with the zucchini, whose flowers gave us great joy in May and early June. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.6">The Swiss chard had a part to play, as did the lettuces, radishes, and a couple of rows of spring onions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.7">Thanks to my husband’s impatience, the tomato seedlings went into the ground so early that Monsieur Teyssier thought we were mad (a continuing trend throughout the summer), but by mid-July we had our first crates of glorious tomatoes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.8">The kale, which is rather a novelty in French cuisine and gardens, was one of the success stories of the summer: It grew with unabashed arrogance, taller than anyone could ever have expected, almost as tall as Gunnhildur, who took over the garden with aplomb when Tim returned to the UK. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.9">When I would walk by with our younger kids, I would sometimes see Monsieur Teyssier giving her a lecture on how to plant leeks or how to maintain tomato plants—or how to conjugate an irregular verb. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.10">Gunnsy’s French grammar blossomed as much as the garden did that summer.</span></p>
