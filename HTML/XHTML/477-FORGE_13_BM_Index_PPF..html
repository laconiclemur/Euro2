			<p class="CustomHead" id="Blender">Blender</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">At the restaurant, we use a Vitamix and find it indispensable. While it is very expensive, its ability to make silky smooth soups and sauces cannot be matched. I think that a Vitamix blender is worth saving up for; it will last a lifetime and outperform any other blender. Plus, it’s the blender<span class="ital">Cook’s Illustrated</span>magazine recommends above all others.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Butcher">Butcher’s Twine</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Indispensable for tying bouquets garnis or trussing chicken.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Cast">Cast Iron Pan</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">This might be the cheapest lifetime investment for your batterie de cuisine. A 10-inch cast iron skillet costs less than $20, and with proper care (i.e., not cleaning it with soap or leaving it to soak overnight), it is guaranteed to last you a lifetime.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Cutting">Cutting Boards</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">I find that this is the number one thing lacking in people’s kitchens. Get a few good cutting boards and take care of them. One should be for meat—I’d recommend sticking with plastic on that one. For vegetables and other foods, a good butcher’s block will last you many years. And if you don’t want your fruit to have any hints of garlic taste to it, a small dedicated fruit cutting board is in order.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Digital">Digital Kitchen Scale</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">In some of our recipes, precision is incredibly important, so gram weights are given. In these cases, a kitchen scale will be indispensable. Most are very affordable, and the more you use a scale, you might find that measuring by weight instead of volume is not only more precise, but a time saver as well.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Dutch">Dutch Oven</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Depending on who you’re cooking for— just yourself and another person, or a crowd—you might want either a 5- or 8-quart Dutch oven. Possibly even both. Le Creuset and Staub make excellent ones, and while they are a financial investment (and heavy) they are unmatched at conducting, and retaining, heat. The oval ones are slightly more versatile than the round ones (such as for fitting awkwardly shaped chicken parts)—Julia Child thought so, too.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Fine">Fine-Mesh Strainer</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Straining is an essential part to cooking, and not just in this book. When making ice creams and custards, or a reduction that requires a perfectly smooth texture, straining is something you will do over and over. A good fine-mesh strainer is going to be something you can’t do without. A good-quality one is inexpensive and will last forever.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Fish">Fish Spatula</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Fish spatulas are not only essential for lifting and flipping delicate fish, but are also the best tool for lifting cookies off a baking sheet.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Food">Food Processor</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">A food processor is one of the main workhorses in the kitchen. It can make pie dough; chop, shred, and puree vegetables; and aerate dry ingredients for baking. While it can be an investment, a quality food processor should last you for many years.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Half">Half-Sheet (13x18-inch) and Quarter-Sheet (13x9-inch) Baking Pans </p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">These are very useful pans, almost without limits. You can use them to roast vegetables, bake cookies, toast nuts, make sheet cake, and so on. Look for light-colored pans made out of sturdy, thick metal. A thick, sturdy sheet will last you a long time, whereas a cheap, flimsy one will not only buckle under intense heat, but will aid in burning your food.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="page401">Heavy-bottomed Skillets and Pots</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Having a basic set of pots of varied sizes will get you started on the right foot. A few quality pots will last you a lifetime and will cook your food better than cheap, lightweight pots, which you will need to replace every few years. In the long run, getting a few good pots will be cheaper than having to replace them all the time. At the restaurant, we like to use All-Clad. Amazon.com also has a great selection of pots and offers decent prices.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Immersion">Immersion Blender</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">An immersion blender is essential for quick jobs. At the restaurant, we use an immersion blender to emulsify sauces right in the pan. For a home cook with a small kitchen, an immersion blender is a must, as it takes up little room, reduces the number of dishes dirtied when cooking, and is easily stored.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="ImmersionCirculator">Immersion Circulator and Vacuum Sealer</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">An immersion circulator is not a commonplace tool in most home kitchens, but it is one that is finding its way into many fine restaurants across the world. The immersion circulator allows you to cook food sous-vide (meaning “under pressure”) in a vacuum-sealed bag while immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath. The result is something that cannot be replicated by any other cooking techniques—meat becomes meltingly tender as it cooks in its own juices aided by delicate, steady heat; eggs are silky smooth, almost custardlike; fish is flaky, moist, and perfect each and every time. While an immersion circulator is expensive, takes up a lot of room, and sounds unapproachable, I guarantee that if you ever treat yourself to one, you will not only not regret it, you will try to convince all your friends that they need one, too. Trust me.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Japanese">Japanese Mandoline</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Japanese mandolines tend to be flatter and easier to store than other types. They also tend to be easier to clean and easier to adjust (meaning you can manipulate the thickness or thinness of the cut easily). They are, however, incredibly sharp, so please be very alert and careful while using them.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Kitchen">Kitchen Shears</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Perfect for snipping herbs, cutting through chicken, and many other tasks, kitchen shears are versatile and will make your life easier.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Knives">Knives: Chef’s, Paring, Cleaver, Bread, Boning, Filleting</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">You do not need to purchase a knife block set to properly outfit your kitchen. But you <span class="ital">do </span>need a few good knives to be most efficient and effective while cooking. A good chef’s knife (8 or 10 inches) will be your most used knife. Pick a knife with a good heft to it, and make sure that the handle feels comfortable in your hand. A paring knife is a must, but contrary to intuition, this is where you don’t need to spend a lot of money. You can get a very good paring knife for about $5, and it will last a very long time. A cleaver is very useful, especially if you plan on separating hunks of meat and chopping through bone. A good bread knife is not only essential in getting clean slices of bread but is also very useful for slicing ripe tomatoes; the serrated edge of the knife helps catch the tomatoes’ soft, delicate skin. If you’re ever planning on breaking down a chicken, a boning knife is something you must have. Choose a quality knife with a long, curved blade and a comfortable handle. And finally, if you plan on filleting fish, a filleting knife will be a good addition to your arsenal. But if you just want the bare minimum, having good chef’s, paring, and bread knives on hand is the way to go.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Measuring">Measuring Spoons, Dry Measuring Cups, Liquid Measuring Cups</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Proper measuring equipment is a must for every kitchen, home or professionals, whether for cooking or baking. It’s helpful to have a couple of sets of each so you don’t wind up having to constantly wash your measuring cups while cooking.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Microplane">Microplane Grater</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">A rasp grater is essential for grating cheese, citrus zest, chocolate, or spices, and the Microplane brand grater cannot be matched. It is sharper than its competition, works better and lasts longer than any other grater. It is also very affordable.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="page402">Oyster Knife</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Cheap and sturdy, oyster knives are essential for shucking oysters. Be careful when doing so, and be steady with your knife. </p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Heat">Heat-Resistant Rubber Spatulas</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Rubber spatulas are great for mixing and folding ingredients and for scraping that last bit of cake batter into the pan. I recommend having a few of various shapes and sizes on hand. They are easy to clean, inexpensive, and are much better at stirring than wooden or metal spoons. A heat-resistant rubber spatula can do everything a cold one can do, so this is the best overall investment.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Salad">Salad Spinner</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">The fastest and most effective way to dry your lettuces and herbs is a salad spinner. Aside from the fact that no one likes soggy lettuce, dry lettuce is essential if you want the dressing to coat and adhere to the greens. Water creates a barrier between the greens and the dressing, which results in your salad dressing collecting at the bottom of the bowl while your leaves sit undressed. </p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Silpat">Silpat</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Buying a couple of Silpats, the nonstick, silicone baking mats used by professional bakers all over the world, will save you from having to buy parchment paper ever again. Silpats are easy to clean, last a very long time and, while they require a bit of an initial investment, are better for the environment—and your wallet—in the long run.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Stand">Stand Mixer</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">A stand mixer, such as a KitchenAid mixer, is another indispensable item. Even though it takes up a considerable amount of counter space and is heavy, it will get regular use and will last for well over a decade, maybe even well over <span class="ital">two</span>decades. Like a food processor, a stand mixer is a workhorse, whipping up egg whites, mixing batters, kneading bread doughs, and more. If you invest in any of the stand mixer attachments, such as a meat grinder (below), pasta roller, or ice cream attachment, you extend the usefulness and versatility of your stand mixer even further.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Meat">Meat Grinder Stand Mixer Attachment</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">While, generally, I do not recommend buying a kitchen item that will only do one thing, a meat-grinding attachment for your stand mixer is an exception to the rule. Once you have your own meat grinder, you will never buy pre-ground meat again. It will allow you to better control the quality of the ground meat and sausage you use in your cooking.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Stockpot">Stockpot</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">If you plan on making your own stocks and soups, or just want to cook some pasta, a good stockpot is essential. In a home kitchen, an 8-quart stockpot will be the perfect size.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Tamis">Tamis</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">Even though a tamis, or drum sieve, is not commonly present in most home cooks’ kitchens, it should be. Used to create fine purees or textures in many dishes, it also sifts flour and cornstarch. Instead of awkwardly pushing purees through a cone-shaped chinois, the flat bottom of a tamis allows a cook to easily push the food through.</p>
			<p class="CustomHead" id="Vegetable">Vegetable Peeler</p>
			<p class="ParaNoIndent">A good-quality vegetable peeler is affordable, so you can easily replace it when it gets dull. The ones we buy for the restaurant cost about $2.50 at restaurant supply stores. I prefer Y-shaped peelers and find them a bit more efficient and effective than straight peelers.</p>
