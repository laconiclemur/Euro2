<p class="nonindent">From start to finish, this weeknight meal takes about 30 minutes. But that’s enough time for the mushrooms to deepen their natural flavor with a sear in olive oil, then a simmer in sherry. This is a typical quick dish found in homes throughout Spain, but it originated in Jerez, where sherry is made. This simple meal can be made with boneless pork loin chops instead of chicken as well.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 (8-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 pound mushrooms, preferably a mix of wild mushrooms, cut into bite-size pieces</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup dry sherry wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 thyme sprig</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup <a href="sec40.xhtml#page136">Chicken Stock</a> or store-bought unsalted chicken stock</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup heavy cream</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">CUT THE CHICKEN BREAST HALVES THROUGH</span> their equators to create thinner cutlets. You should now have 4 pieces that are the same shape as the original, but ½ to ¾-inch thick. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt all over the chicken, then season with pepper.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until smoking hot. Add 2 chicken pieces and sear, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with another tablespoon oil and the remaining chicken.</p>
<p class="indent">Add another tablespoon oil, then add the mushrooms. Stir well, then spread in an even layer. Cook, stirring once or twice, until the mushrooms are nicely browned and tender, about 7 minutes. Push them to one side of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the other side of the skillet. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until just golden, about 1 minute. Stir into the mushrooms, then add the sherry, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, then simmer until reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Add the cream and ½ teaspoon salt. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Return the chicken to the skillet and turn to coat with the sauce and heat through. Simmer until the chicken just loses its pinkness throughout, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
