<p class="nonindent">Almonds are the nut of Spain. In Málaga, almonds are blended into a creamy white soup. To draw out the almonds’ flavor even further for this soup, I break them up with water first, then I soak them to get as much juice as possible out of them. The two-step process makes a big difference in the end result. After that, I just make sure the rest of the seasonings are really well-balanced. The crab and grapes on top turn this into a very satisfying sophisticated first course, but the soup can be drunk on its own, too. In fact, even the almond milk alone is very drinkable. It’s far better than any store-bought variety. I tried making this soup with the highest-quality supermarket almond milk I could find and it really didn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">The soup, whether served as an appetizer or a light lunch, tastes even better with a glass of wine. A dry Muscatel would be nice, but for the more adventurous, an Amontillado would be even nicer.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PULSE THE ALMONDS IN A FOOD PROCESSOR UNTIL</span> finely chopped, but not finely ground into a powder. Transfer to a large airtight container and stir in 7 cups cold water. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent1">Use a measuring cup to scoop 4 cups almond mixture from the bottom of the container into a blender. You want to scoop enough water along with the almonds to get the blender going. Puree until very smooth. A vortex will form in the center and then disappear as the almonds are ground and the mixture thickens. At that point, add more of the water and puree again until very, very smooth, about 2 minutes. It needs the time to get smooth. Repeat with the remaining almonds in 2 more batches.</p>
<p class="indent">Pour through a fine-mesh sieve in batches. Stir the mixture in the sieve to help it pass through. You don’t want to keep pressing the solids through. When most of the liquid has passed through and the mixture in the sieve looks pasty, discard the solids. You should have 6 cups almond milk. If you have extra, save it for another use. If you don’t have enough, add water to make 6 cups.</p>
<p class="nonindent1">You need to work in batches to puree this soup in standard home blenders: Combine about half of the almond milk, bread, and garlic with 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender. Process until smooth. With the machine running, add half of the oil in a steady stream. Continue blending until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve the way you did the almond milk into a large bowl, stirring to let the liquids pass through, but not pressing on the solids. You want to discard the solids while they’re still quite wet and pasty to get a very smooth soup without any grainy bits. Repeat with the remaining almond milk, bread, garlic, vinegar, salt, and olive oil, straining into the same bowl. Cover tightly and refrigerate until very cold, at least 4 hours and up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="nonindent1">Before serving, whisk well and season with ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon vinegar. Taste and add more salt and vinegar if you’d like. Divide among serving bowls and top with the crab and grapes.</p>
