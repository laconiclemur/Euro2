<p class="nonindent">Brazo de Gitano translates to “arm of a gypsy,” possibly because of its long shape. Like a French roulade or Swiss roll, this dessert is a spiral of tender cake and filling. All over Spain, the fillings range from jams to caramel to chocolate to flavored cream. I thought sugary white chocolate and earthy saffron could work well in a pastry cream filling. But it took me a little while to strike the right balance because they complement each other but can overpower each other, too.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE PASTRY CREAM, BRING THE MILK</span> and saffron to a boil in a large saucepan. While the milk heats, whisk the egg yolks, all-purpose flour, and ½ cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Continue whisking while adding the hot milk in a slow, steady stream. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking continuously, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens, about 5 minutes. Boil the mixture, whisking continuously, for 1 minute. The mixture should be a very thick paste so that when mixed with whipped cream it won’t become too thin and run out of the rolled cake. If it isn’t very thick, keep cooking and whisking.</p>
<p class="indent">Press through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and add the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly against the surface and refrigerate until cold.</p>
<p class="nonindent">While the pastry cream chills, make the cake. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 450°F. Coat a half-sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray, line the bottom with parchment paper, and spray again.</p>
<p class="indent">Whisk the cake flour and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk the egg yolks, whole eggs, and ½ cup superfine sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until thick, fluffy, and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium and beat in the salt. Transfer to another large bowl. Clean the mixer bowl and whisk attachment thoroughly.</p>
<p class="indent">Sift half the flour mixture over the beaten egg mixture and gently fold in until almost all of the flour has disappeared. Repeat with remaining flour.</p>
<p class="indent">Whisk the egg whites with the clean electric mixer on medium speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue whisking until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, add the remaining 1 tablespoon superfine sugar. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the other egg mixture until well blended, but try not to deflate the egg whites. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with an offset spatula.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until barely golden brown on top, 6 to 8 minutes. The cake should spring back when <a id="page234"/>lightly pressed in the center, but be sure to avoid overbaking. The cake is more moist and tender when it’s baked just until done.</p>
<p class="indent">Run an offset spatula around the edges of the cake if they’re stuck to the sides. Center a clean sheet of parchment paper, then a wire rack, over the cake. Wearing oven mitts, hold the rack and pan together and invert. Lift off the pan and peel off the parchment paper stuck to the cake. Dust the surface of the cake with confectioners’ sugar. With a long side of the cake facing you, roll it up along with the clean sheet of parchment. Cool completely, in its rolled form with the parchment, on the rack.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When the cake is cool, finish the filling. Whisk the cream with the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Add the pastry cream and change to the paddle attachment. Beat on low speed until the pastry cream is incorporated, then gradually raise the speed as needed to fully blend the pastry cream and whipped cream until smooth.</p>
<p class="indent">Gently unroll the cake and spread the filling on top using an offset spatula, leaving a ½-inch rim along one long side. With the other long side facing you, roll the cake away from you, gently pressing after each roll and peeling off the parchment as you go. Transfer to a serving plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days. It’s best after 1 day.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When ready to serve, uncover and dust with confectioners’ sugar before slicing.</p>
