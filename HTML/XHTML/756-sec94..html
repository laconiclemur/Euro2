<p class="nonindent1">We do a unique sangría at Cúrate. In Spain, sangría is usually mixed with fruit and ice early and doled out by the glass all day long. At Cúrate, we make sangría the way we mix cocktails: right before serving so that it tastes extra fresh. This technique still works well for entertaining because all the components can—and should—be chilled far ahead of time. The final mixing takes seconds. One modern Spanish tradition we’ve upheld is the use of Sprite. I’ve tried homemade syrups and sodas, but they don’t replicate the same lemon-lime fizz found in Spanish sangrías.</p>
<p class="indent">Both of the refreshing drinks here are easy to put together and form a blank canvas for the best herbs and fruit of the season. Nearly any combination of fruit and herbs works well. Some of my favorites are peaches and blackberries, watermelon, and strawberries, and any mix of citrus. Classic herbs like mint taste great, as do aromatics such as lemon verbena.</p>
