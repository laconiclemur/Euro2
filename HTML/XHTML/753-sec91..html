<p class="nonindent">Rosemary is one of my favorite herbs, so I don’t restrict my use of it to savory dishes. That being said, I decided to add a pinch of salt to this ice cream to accentuate rosemary’s piney fragrance. This dessert is especially delicious served with bits of dark chocolate and drizzled with olive oil.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ cups heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup packed rosemary sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ cup granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">BRING THE MILK, CREAM, AND ROSEMARY TO A</span> boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until smooth. Whisk in the strained hot cream in a slow, steady stream. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring continuously, until thickened slightly and an instant-read thermometer registers 175°F. Avoid overcooking the mixture so that it doesn’t curdle. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl and stir in the salt. Set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice and water to quickly cool to room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Churn the chilled mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serve immediately or freeze in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
