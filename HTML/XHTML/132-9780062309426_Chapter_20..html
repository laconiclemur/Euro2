<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth David, the famously opinionated British food documentarian of the postwar era, had little patience for Nouvelle Cuisine. In the third edition of <i>Provincial French Cooking</i>, she called that culinary movement—which in the 1970s became France’s herb-flecked answer to rich béchamel sauces and heavy things cooked in aspic—an “affectation.” She went on to say: “Everyone who has experienced it in restaurants where it is practised . . . has his or her own story of the five green beans sitting lonely on one side of a huge white plate, three tepid chicken livers <i>avec quelques feuilles de salade</i> nine inches distant on the opposite edge.” Presumably to David’s dismay, Nouvelle Cuisine eventually went mainstream, becoming the model for posh restaurant food the world over, and for more-radical culinary experimentation yet to come.</p>
<p class="indent">The principles of Nouvelle Cuisine—smaller portions, lighter <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216" title="216"/>sauces, faster and more-direct cooking methods, artfully deracinated presentations—would appear to be patently un-Gascon. And yet Gascons are quick to claim as their own one of the movement’s founding fathers. I feel obligated to point out that this chef, Michel Guérard, is not a Gascon, at least not by birth. He hails from the vicinity of Paris, and earned his stripes there at a restaurant, long gone, called Le Pot au Feu. But since the 1970s he has made his home, and sealed his reputation as one of France’s best-loved culinary <i>personnages</i>, in a village in the Landes called Eugénie-les-Bains.</p>
<p class="indent">Guérard has the dual advantage of being a naturally great cook and also having married well. Guérard’s father-in-law was Adrien Barthélémy, the founder of an immensely successful chain of thermal spas. Barthélémy’s daughter and heir, Christine, helped Guérard transform Eugénie-les-Bains—formerly a run-down spa station once frequented by Napoléon III’s wife, the Empress Eugénie—into a culinary and wellness empire.</p>
<p class="indent">Though Eugénie-les-Bains lies only forty minutes or so from where we lived, it is the anti-Plaisance: a showpiece of impeccably restored buildings lining immaculate sidewalks decorated with ceramic planters. An old convent and handsome stone farm buildings, painstakingly renovated, have been put into service as guesthouses and restaurants for spa-goers. Guérard’s fief also includes a culinary institute devoted to the chef’s trademarked Cuisine Minceur (slimming cuisine), which is an even lighter offshoot of Nouvelle Cuisine, designed specifically for the kinds of Parisians who routinely travel hundreds of miles for a mud bath and a massage. Cuisine Minceur begat a line of popular cookbooks during the 1980s and earned Guérard a feature in <i>Time</i> magazine.</p>
<p class="indent">The jewel of Guérard’s realm is Les Prés d’Eugénie, a fancy restaurant—certainly the fanciest in all of Gascony—that received its third Michelin star in 1977 and, in an impressive feat of staying <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217" title="217"/>power, has hung on to it ever since. From what I’d gleaned, the restaurant—Nouvelle Cuisine’s daintier aspects notwithstanding—was an haute-cuisine temple of the unabashedly decadent kind. (Though a “slimming menu,” I’d been told, was available on request.) Among my Gascon friends, the place was talked about in terms of degrees of separation—so-and-so knew someone who knew someone who ate there—but the reports that trickled down were never less than ecstatic: truffled this-or-that, opulent <i>déclinaisons</i> of foie gras, an ambiance of unparalleled refinement. Invariably, such secondhand accounts would wrap up with that reliable cautionary coda: <i>C’est très cher.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Personally, I didn’t have much interest in eating at Les Prés d’Eugénie. For one thing, it was way out of our price range. For another, though Gascons welcomed the cachet it had brought to the region, the restaurant didn’t seem to have an organic connection to Gascony. And anyhow, high-end dining didn’t really agree with me. I almost always seemed to get seated next to someone unpleasant, and there’s something about fancy restaurants that makes me self-conscious.</p>
<p class="indent">But sometimes one is called upon to put aside one’s prejudices.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>ANDRÉ DUBOSC LAUGHED AWKWARDLY WHEN</small>, under the totally legitimate pretext of not being able to afford it, I declined his invitation to have lunch with him and a colleague at Les Prés d’Eugénie.</p>
<p class="indent">“Ah, but you misunderstand,” he said over the phone. “<i>Je vous invite</i>. You will be our guests.”</p>
<p class="indent">I said I couldn’t allow it.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc took a conspiratorial tone, explaining that Guérard was an old friend, and that the wine cooperative was seeking new business with him.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" title="218"/>“It will look more sociable,” he said, “if we go <i>à quatre</i>.” Of course, he added, it was expected that I’d bring Michele.</p>
<p class="indent">He went so far as to offer his wife’s babysitting services. She had already dined <i>chez Guérard</i>, he said, and had volunteered to watch Charlotte before he’d even asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“You see,” said Dubosc, “all of our grandchildren are boys.”</p>
<p class="indent">I told him I’d check with Michele. When I did, she stared at me with an expression of flabbergasted disbelief that I’d hesitated to accept.</p>
<p class="indent">And so, that Saturday, she and I put on our nicest clothes and dropped Charlotte off at Dubosc’s house. His wife, Françoise, wrapped Charlotte in her arms as if the two were already fast friends. Then she gave Charlotte a chocolate and stroked her hair appraisingly, in a sign that some serious braiding might be in their future. When it comes to spoiling other people’s children, Gascons are not to be outdone.</p>
<p class="indent">We arrived at the restaurant at half past eleven and were waved past a gatehouse by a uniformed guard. We parked at the edge of an expanse of topiary-hemmed gardens laced with trim, bowered paths. The restaurant’s lobby, which doubled as the reception area of the adjoining hotel-spa, was a placid sanctuary of white plaster moldings and classical statuary. As we waited for Dubosc’s colleague, a couple of svelte women in flowy outfits swished past us, heading toward the spa and trailing a scent of roses. A telephone trilled softly somewhere down the hall. We’d entered a distant, un-Gascon universe.</p>
<p class="indent">Our fourth arrived. Olivier Bourdet-Pées was Dubosc’s young successor at the co-op. The new <i>directeur</i> had a tennis-player’s build, a receding hairline, black-rimmed glasses, a French-guy scarf—Dubosc a quarter-century ago. If I hadn’t known otherwise, I’d have pegged him for Dubosc’s own son. This impression was enhanced by the fact that Dubosc’s body language around Olivier was <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219" title="219"/>that of a jocular mentor. In lieu of the gentle arm touches Dubosc reserved for me and Michele, it was shoulder-drapings and back slaps for Olivier—to which the younger man reacted like someone listening politely to a stale joke.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc had arranged to meet with Guérard before lunch to discuss a few matters of business, so after announcing our arrival to a willowy hostess in a chic black dress, we installed ourselves on two Empire-style settees beneath an immense crystal chandelier in an extra-tranquil corner of the lobby. A black-tied server, unbidden, brought coffee and candied fruit on a silver tray.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc, holding his demitasse decorously over its saucer, glanced behind him and then leaned forward slightly so that he might speak to Michele and me in confidence. “Guérard’s wife designed every inch of this place,” he said. “She treats it like the Louvre—you’re not even allowed to take photos.”</p>
<p class="indent">This made me very badly want to pull out my phone and start doing just that.</p>
<p class="indent">Before I could act on the impulse, Guérard appeared. I hadn’t noticed him walking over, but now suddenly here he was, standing before us.</p>
<p class="indent">We stood up to shake his hand. Guérard was close to a foot shorter than me. Dubosc introduced us and mentioned that my wife and I were from Chicago.</p>
<p class="indent">Guérard beamed. It was the unflappable smile of someone who’s been photographed a lot. “Ah, the Obamas’ hometown,” he said. “I’ve extended an invitation to the First Lady to come visit the <i>institut</i>. She and I share much the same mission.”</p>
<p class="indent">We retook our seats, and Guérard went on to lament, albeit in the most diplomatic language, the global spread of McDonald’s and its offspring, <i>le fast food</i> being a perennially popular punching bag of French chefs. In my experience, when the topic came up, the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220" title="220"/>American in the room was cast, willingly or no, in the role of fast-food apologist so that the Frenchmen in the room might have a ready target to assail. But Guérard made the gentlemanly gesture of changing the subject.</p>
<p class="indent">For a short while, he reminisced about being a child in northern France during the war. “I have lived through hunger and fear,” he said. “I am grateful for this.”</p>
<p class="indent">Then he changed the subject again, speaking nostalgically of the decline in the hallowed tradition of culinary <i>apprentissage</i>. “Today,” he said, “young chefs seek celebrity before they seek wisdom.”</p>
<p class="indent">Guérard spoke a mannered Parisian French, his talk devoid of rugby and bullfighting metaphors. He closed his eyes as if trying to remember something, then quoted several verses from a Paul Valéry poem. They had something to do with a master and his protégé.</p>
<p class="indent">Conversation turned to more pressing affairs. The three men discussed hectoliters and wholesale prices for a while, Olivier doing most of the talking, leaving Dubosc to contribute the occasional droll remark.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, business having been concluded, Guérard brushed a bit of lint from his trousers and rose from his chair. He extended his hand to each of us. “Now I must leave you,” he said. “I’m needed at the stoves.”</p>
<p class="indent">As suddenly as he’d appeared, he was gone.</p>
<p class="indent">We were led by the willowy hostess to the restaurant’s salon: a baroque fantasia of a sitting room with three crackling fireplaces, deep leather couches, and gilt-framed oil paintings, including a softly lit and nearly life-size portrait of Eugénie herself. We were seated at a burnished-wood coffee table and served pre-lunch snacks of tiny house-made white boudins skewered on toothpicks. For an aperitif, we drank a copper-colored 1973 Jurançon that Olivier had brought from his own cellar. It was decanted and poured by a bird-<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" title="221"/>faced sommelier in a waistcoat and lavender tie, and tasted of chestnuts and candied fruit.</p>
<p class="indent">At twelve forty-five, we sat down to lunch. The dining room was airy and flooded with light. Our table, covered in fresh white linen, could have comfortably accommodated eight people. With the exception of a few well-polished silver serving carts, no functional elements of a working restaurant, right down to electrical outlets, were anywhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="indent">We placed our order with a young captain who evinced a carefully calibrated mixture of warmth and fawning and, like Henri, never once during the meal gave the appearance of haste or exertion. The sommelier returned and engaged Olivier, who had been half hidden for some time behind a thick, hardbound wine list, in negotiations. Moments later, a Chablis Grand Cru was brought to the table. It was crisp and vivacious and spurred the appetite. A silky, dried-blood–colored Saumur Champigny soon followed.</p>
<p class="indent">What did we eat? A staggering amount of food, even by Gascon standards. And it couldn’t have been remotely slimming. I remember black Périgord truffle—that most coveted and expensive of fungi—shaved onto a vichyssoise; more slices of that truffle, delicately white-veined and tasting of damp earth, strewn over the top of some kind of blini; morels in an ethereal emulsion that tasted like the essence of a million freshly foraged mushrooms concentrated into a small pillow of foam; a soft-cooked egg with a top hat of caviar, each spoonful a surge of salty, creamy richness; oysters concealed under different-colored citrus foams; tender pieces of some cosseted breed of chicken served in a ragoût made with cockscomb and <i>rognons de coq</i>, which, Dubosc explained with a mischievous smile, were rooster testicles; and a square of crisp-skinned sea bass, alone on the plate in nothing but its own cooking juices. There were scallops, too—grilled, as I recall—served on a slick of melted sea <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222" title="222"/>salt butter. After that: a halved lobster tail smoked in a stone hearth with candied onions, then a rare-cooked medallion of beef wrapped in a leaf. I know there were cheeses, but I regret to say I can’t call to mind what they were. By the time they’d shown up, we’d been at the table for a couple of hours, and I was nearly overcome with the urge to dash out for air. But I resisted it and held on through dessert—mille-feuille, rhubarb ice cream, peach melba—and then through coffee and digestifs.</p>
<p class="indent">By four thirty or so, it was done. Dusk was preparing its advance across the sky. Guérard came to the table and basked in our praise for a minute or two. My faculties dulled by the excesses of the meal, I found myself unable to summon anything more poetic than “<i>C’était très, très, très bon</i>.” Guérard smiled his practiced smile, shook our hands, and took his leave.</p>
<p class="indent">The meal had indeed been very, very, very good, and an interesting hybrid, too. Many of the hallmarks of Nouvelle Cuisine—none of them <i>nouvelle</i> anymore—had been in evidence: the hearth-cooked dishes, the spare presentations, the elegant sauces. Showy flourishes of more recent vintage had found their way into the lineup, too—the foams, the leaf—as had luxe touches from the classical era: the caviar, the black truffle, the blini. There’d even been a nod to rustic Gascon food: namely the ragoût with its rooster testicles.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall my memory of the lunch is a fine one, not least of all because Dubosc seemed so pleased to have exposed me and Michele to the glow of Gascony’s beacon of three-star luxury. Oddly enough, though, what I remember most vividly about the day is the funny sensation of returning to the mill after all that fancy treatment. The living room was damp and dark and smelled of cold ashes. I built a fire and recall sitting with our backs to it, eating leftover soup for dinner, and, in spite of it all, feeling happy to be home.</p>
