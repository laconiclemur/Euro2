			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_4099.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">6 to 8 servings / Wine pairing: Vouvray demi-sec (Chenin Blanc); Vincent Carême</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This technique for making <em>foie gras au torchon</em> (foie gras cooked in a dish towel) allows you to easily achieve this high-end restaurant dish at home. Letting the foie gras age at least three days is very important, as it only gets better over time. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">Equipment</h4>
			<p class="RI">An instant-read thermometer</p>
			<p class="RI">Kitchen string</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the foie gras</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 vacuum-packed Grade A foie gras (about 1 pound/454 grams), preferably already deveined</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel </p>
			<p class="RI">Crushed black pepper</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the cherry chutney</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 small onion </p>
			<p class="RI">2 shallots</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove</p>
			<p class="RI">2½ pounds (1.2 kg.) Bing cherries</p>
			<p class="RI">5½ tablespoons red wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">3 tablespoons sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI2">1 tablespoon chopped chives</p>
			<p class="RI">Red wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="RI">Extra virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel </p>
			<p class="RI">Crushed black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">12 to 16 brandied cherries</p>
			<p class="RI">A handful of baby greens</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The foie gras</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Fill a large pot with water and bring it to 160°F. Add the foie gras, in its sous-vide bag, and cook for 20 minutes, checking the thermometer to make sure the temperature stays at 160°F. Transfer the foie gras to a plate and let cool to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="RP">Remove the foie gras from the bag and, if necessary, carefully remove the veins with a small knife. Season with fleur de sel and crushed pepper.</p>
			<p class="RP">Place the foie gras on three 20-inch-long sheets of plastic wrap stacked on top of each other. Pressing and rolling, form the foie gras into a 2-inch-thick log. Tie the ends with kitchen string: the log should be very tight and firm. With a toothpick, poke the wrap all over to remove any air bubbles. Roll up the log in another sheet of plastic wrap and tie it tightly with string. Refrigerate for at least 3 days or, ideally, for 1 week.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The cherry chutney</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion, shallots, and garlic. Pit the cherries.</p>
			<p class="RP">Bring the vinegar and sugar to a boil in a pot over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the onion, shallots, garlic, and ginger. Season with ¼ teaspoon salt and cook over low heat for about 2 minutes, just until slightly softened. Add the cherries and simmer gently, mashing the cherries a bit with the back of a wooden spoon to help release their juices, for 10 minutes, or until the mixture is the consistency of a chunky chutney. Taste and add salt if necessary. Transfer to a jar and let cool. (The chutney can be refrigerated for several months; it makes a great condiment for cheese.)</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put 6 tablespoons of the chutney in a small bowl and stir in the chives, a dash of red wine vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with fleur de sel.</p>
			<p class="RP">Dip the blade of a sharp knife into very hot water, wipe it dry, and cut the foie gras into 1-inch-thick slices, reheating the knife as necessary. Remove the plastic wrap from each slice and glisten each one with a drop of olive oil. Season with a pinch each of fleur de sel and crushed pepper.</p>
			<p class="RP">Place a slice of foie gras, a spoonful of chutney, and 2 cherries on each plate. Lightly season the baby greens with olive oil, lemon juice, and fleur de sel and arrange on the plates.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_9608.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Touraine white (Sauvignon Blanc); Jean-François Mérieau</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is a dish I could eat every day. Simple, quick, and delicious, it combines the crunchiness and sweetness of carrots, the zing of orange, and the meaty texture of avocado.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the roasted carrots</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 bunches (about 1 pound/454 grams) baby carrots</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ teaspoon coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the salad</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 to 3 navel oranges</p>
			<p class="RI">2 avocados</p>
			<p class="RI">3 cilantro sprigs</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of 1 lime, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The roasted carrots</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="RP">Trim the carrots and put them in a bowl. </p>
			<p class="RP">Toast the coriander and fennel seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes; take care not to burn them. Let cool, then coarsely crush the seeds with a mortar and pestle or under a heavy skillet. </p>
			<p class="RP">Add the toasted spices to the carrots, along with the thyme, garlic, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt, and toss well with your hands. Transfer the carrots to a baking dish and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until tender and lightly browned. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The salad</h3>
			<p class="RP1">With a sharp knife, peel the oranges down to the flesh, removing all the bitter white pith, then slice into ¼-inch-thick rounds; you need 16 slices. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, peel, and cut lengthwise into thick slices. Remove the cilantro leaves from the stems.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine the carrots, oranges, and avocados in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with the cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, fleur de sel, and a pinch of piment d’Espelette and toss gently. Arrange on salad plates and serve.</p>

			<h2 class="RH" id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-1"/>Wild Garlic Broth with Fresh Crabmeat</h2>
			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_9982.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Savoie white (Altesse); Adrien Berlioz</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This starter combines the subtle bitterness of fragrant citrons with the sweetness of crabmeat and the delicacy of blanched wild garlic leaves. Wild garlic is a broad-leaved plant that grows all over Europe, particularly England; for me, it is the symbol of springtime. Ramps, available in North America in farmers’ markets and gourmet shops in the spring, make a good substitute.</p>
			<p class="RHN">At Frenchie’s, we prepare this soup using live snow crabs, and if you can get fresh Dungeness, blue, or other crabs (about 1⅓ pounds in the shell), do try their meat in the broth.</p>
			<p class="RI2">7 ounces (200 grams) crabmeat, preferably jumbo lump</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the wild garlic broth</h4>
			<p class="RI">8 ounces (225 grams) wild garlic leaves or ramps</p>
			<p class="RI">A generous handful (about 1 cup) of baby spinach leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 large slices sourdough bread</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ tablespoons (21 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">12 kalamata olives</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small citron or lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">1 spring onion</p>
			<p class="RI">A handful of dill, chervil, and tarragon leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Extra virgin olive oil </p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The crab</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Remove any bits of shell or cartilage from the crabmeat, taking care to leave it in large pieces; refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The wild garlic broth </h3>
			<p class="RP1">Bring a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Add the wild garlic leaves, bring back to a boil, and cook for 30 seconds, then add the spinach and cook for 10 more seconds. Drain in a strainer set over a bowl, then immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool. Reserve about 2 cups of the cooking liquid.</p>
			<p class="RP">Drain the greens and gently squeeze the leaves to remove as much liquid as possible. Transfer to a blender and puree, adding about 1½ cups of the reserved cooking liquid, or enough to achieve a broth consistency. Season with salt and piment d’Espelette. Refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Dice the bread into ½-inch cubes. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the thyme, garlic, and bread and sauté until the croutons are just golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel.</p>
			<p class="RP">Halve and pit the olives. Finely dice the citron, discarding the seeds (or grate the zest of the lemon). Peel and trim the spring onion and cut it lengthwise into very thin slices.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Roughly chop the dill, chervil, and tarragon leaves. Bring the broth to a simmer in a saucepan. Toss the crabmeat with the lemon juice in another small saucepan, add a drizzle of olive oil, and heat gently. Add the herbs and season to taste with fleur de sel.</p>
			<p class="RP">Pour the broth into four bowls, add a spoonful of crabmeat to each one, and garnish with the croutons, olives, diced citron (or zest), and onion slices.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_7592.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Côtes du Jura (Savagnin); Jean-François Ganevat</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Vin jaune, from the Jura, is a dry oxidized wine with notes of walnut, apple, and curry. Here the walnut pesto echoes those notes, resulting in a powerful marriage that carries the delicate flavors of the fish and the asparagus. If necessary, vin jaune can be replaced by a fino sherry to good effect.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the vin jaune sauce</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="RI">2 shallots</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Pinch of curry powder</p>
			<p class="RI">Small pinch of saffron threads</p>
			<p class="RI">Generous ½ cup (150 ml.) vin jaune (Savagnin) or fino sherry</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lime, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Walnut oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the walnut pesto</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ cup (50 grams) walnut halves</p>
			<p class="RI">Sunflower oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">Fine sea salt</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the asparagus</h4>
			<p class="RI">12 ounces (340 grams) asparagus</p>
			<p class="RI">Coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the pollock</h4>
			<p class="RI">4 skin-on pollock (or hake or haddock) fillets, about 4 ounces (120 grams) each</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1½ tablespoons (21 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">1 thyme sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI2">½ bunch chives, finely chopped</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The vin jaune sauce</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Peel and finely chop the garlic and shallots. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small saucepan over low heat (keep the remaining butter refrigerated). Add the garlic and shallots and cook, without browning, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the curry and saffron and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine, bring to a boil, and reduce by about one-third.</p>
			<p class="RP">Transfer to a blender and blend until pureed, then add the lime juice, the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut into small cubes, and a drizzle of walnut oil. Season with a pinch of salt and more lime juice and/or walnut oil and set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The walnut pesto</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Put the walnuts in a blender and grind them, drizzling in about 2 tablespoons sunflower oil, to a coarse puree. Season with the lemon juice and fine salt. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The asparagus</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut off the woody bottoms of the asparagus on a diagonal.</p>
			<p class="RP">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus, bring back to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Drain well, transfer to a sauté pan, and drizzle with olive oil. Set aside.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The pollock</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Season the fish with salt. Heat a large nonstick frying pan over high heat. Add a drop of olive oil and place the fish skin side down in the hot pan. Cook over medium heat for 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, until you can see the sides of the fillets beginning to turn opaque. Add the butter, thyme, and crushed garlic clove and foam the butter, then turn the fish over (the skin should be nicely brown and crispy) and cook, basting the fillets with the butter, for 1 to 2 minutes, until just cooked through. Drain on a paper towel.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Add the chives to the vin jaune sauce and gently reheat the sauce, without letting it boil. Gently warm the asparagus as well.</p>
			<p class="RP">Place a spoonful of walnut pesto in the center of each of four shallow bowls or deep plates and arrange the asparagus on top. Spoon the sauce over and top with the pollock. Serve immediately.</p>

			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_7266.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Burgundy white <em>vieilles vignes</em> (chardonnay); Jean-Philippe Fichet</p>
			<p class="RHN1">Mackerel is one of my favorite fish. It’s healthful and sustainable, but it’s an oily fish that must be super-fresh and very lightly cooked to be at its best. Farro is an ancient cereal grain with earthy flavors, but when it’s mixed with the cauliflower puree here, it looks like risotto. The gremolata-style garnish of citrus zest adds brightness to the dish.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the farrotto</h4>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (about 5 ounces/140 grams) farro, rinsed</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the cauliflower puree</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ cauliflower</p>
			<p class="RI">2 cups (500 ml.) whole milk, or as needed</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small bay leaf</p>
			<p class="RI">Juice of ¼ lemon, or to taste</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ bunch chervil (or substitute chives), chopped</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the mackerel</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 large or 4 small skin-on mackerel fillets (about 1¼ pounds/570 grams total)</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI2">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lime</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 orange</p>
			<p class="RI">1 tablespoon trout roe</p>
			<p class="RI">A handful of baby arugula</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The farrotto</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the farro and bring back to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, skimming off any foam, until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain in a colander and cool under cold water. Transfer the farro to a bowl and toss with 1½ teaspoons olive oil. Set aside in the refrigerator.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The cauliflower puree</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Remove the core and cut the cauliflower into big chunks. Reserve 2 florets for the garnish. Put the remaining cauliflower in a medium pot and add enough milk to cover. Add a pinch of salt and the bay leaf, bring to a simmer, and cook until the cauliflower can be mashed easily between two fingers, about 20 minutes. Drain the cauliflower in a sieve set over a bowl; reserve the cooking liquid. Remove the bay leaf.</p>
			<p class="RP">Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor and process, adding enough of the cooking liquid (about ⅓ cup) to obtain a smooth, creamy puree. Season with the lemon juice and salt. Set aside. Reserve the remaining cooking liquid.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The mackerel</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Fire up an outdoor grill or heat a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat. Lightly massage the skin side of the mackerel fillets with olive oil. Season with fleur de sel and place them skin side down on the hot grill or pan. Cook for about 2 minutes, just until the fillets have started to turn opaque, then turn them, cook for about 5 seconds, just until cooked through, and remove from the heat.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, combine the farro and cauliflower puree in a large saucepan and heat gently over low heat until hot, adding more of the reserved cooking liquid if necessary. Season to taste with salt and a dash more lemon juice and stir in the chervil.</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide the farrotto among four plates. Arrange the mackerel fillets on top and sprinkle with fleur de sel, the citrus zests, and the trout roe. Garnish with the arugula, lightly tossed with olive oil, and, finally, grate the reserved raw cauliflower florets over the plates.</p>

			<h2 class="RH" id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-22"/>Grilled Baby Lamb with Fava Beans, Sweet Peas, and Mint Chutney</h2>
			<div class="image">
				<img alt="" src="image/_MG_9842.jpg" width="70%"/>
			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Crozes-Hermitage red (Syrah); David Reynaud</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is a reminder of my time at The Savoy Grill in London, where we cooked all sorts of typical British dishes. I love mint with lamb, but I am not crazy about the traditional mint sauce, which is both too sweet and too acidic for my taste. With the help of my Indian apprentice Gaurav, who shared his chutney recipe with me, I revisited and personalized this British classic.</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the lamb</h4>
			<p class="RI">1 rosemary sprig</p>
			<p class="RI">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">1 teaspoon crushed black pepper</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">4 pieces boneless lamb leg or loin (about 8 ounces/225 grams each)</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the vegetable garnish</h4>
			<p class="RI">16 tiny new potatoes</p>
			<p class="RI">Coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">1¼ pounds (600 grams) sweet peas in the pod (about 1 cup/160 grams shelled peas)</p>
			<p class="RI">1¼ pounds (600 grams) fava beans in the pod (about 1 cup/160 grams shelled favas)</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the mint chutney</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
			<p class="RI">1 small green mango</p>
			<p class="RI">1 bunch mint</p>
			<p class="RI">½ bunch cilantro</p>
			<p class="RI">Extra virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI2">2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="RI">Piment d’Espelette </p>
			<p class="RI">Salt</p>
			<p class="RI">Fleur de sel</p>
			<p class="RI">Crushed black pepper</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The lamb marinade</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Combine the rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, crushed pepper, and olive oil in a baking dish. Add the lamb, turning to coat and rubbing the marinade into the meat. Cover and marinate for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The vegetable garnish</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a large pot of cold salted water, bring to a boil, and cook for about 15 minutes, until tender: the tip of a knife should enter the flesh without resistance. Drain the potatoes thoroughly, transfer to a bowl, and add a drizzle of olive oil. Set aside at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="RP">Shell the peas and refrigerate. Shell the fava beans.</p>
			<p class="RP">Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the fava beans in the boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain and immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool. Drain again and peel off the outer skin. Refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The mint chutney</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Toast the cumin seeds in a dry skillet over low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes; be careful not to burn them.</p>
			<p class="RP">Peel and pit the mango and cut enough of the flesh into ½-inch dice to make ⅓ cup (the green mango will bring acidity to the chutney without darkening its bright green color); reserve the remaining mango for another use. Remove the leaves from the mint and cilantro stems.</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the cumin, mango, and herbs in a blender and blend until finely chopped, while drizzling in about 2½ tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Cooking the lamb</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Remove the lamb from the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking. Fire up an outdoor grill.</p>
			<p class="RP">Season the lamb with salt and pepper and grill it for about 5 minutes or so on each side, depending on the thickness: when blood starts to bead up on the surface, the lamb will be cooked to medium-rare. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">Finishing touches</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add the peas and cook for 1 minute, then add the potatoes and favas and heat, stirring and tossing the vegetables, until the potatoes are warmed through. Remove from the heat and toss with 1 tablespoon of the chutney. Add a pinch of piment d’Espelette and season with salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="RP">For the most tender meat, slice the lamb crosswise against the grain (see the photo opposite).</p>
			<p class="RP">Divide the vegetables among four plates and add a spoonful of mint chutney to each plate. Arrange the meat alongside and season it with fleur de sel and crushed black pepper.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Canadian ice cider (apple ice wine)</p>
			<p class="RHN1">This is one of our signature “cheese dessert” plates. Amarena cherries are small dark Italian sour cherries that are sold preserved in syrup. Sweet and fragrant, they are most often used in desserts, but they are wonderful with a strong blue cheese, rounding it out and adding both softness and tartness.</p>
			<p class="RI2">About 12 ounces (340 grams) blue cheese, such as bleu des Causses, Fourme d’Ambert, Gorgonzola, or Stilton</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="RI">A handful of tiny basil leaves</p>
			<p class="RI">24 to 30 jarred Amarena cherries</p>
			<p class="RP">Take the cheese out of the refrigerator at least 2 hours before serving to bring it to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="RP">Break the cheese into large chunks and divide among four salad plates or small wooden boards. Sprinkle with the lemon zest and basil leaves. Serve with the cherries.</p>

			<p class="Y">4 servings / Wine pairing: Bugey-Cerdon sparkling rosé (Poulsard, Gamay); Philippe Balivet</p>
			<p class="RHN1">In France, I use small, sweet, and fragrant Gariguette strawberries. In the States, look for Tristar strawberries or other ripe, sweet berries at the farmers’ market. A whipped cream canister will help make the cream extra light and fluffy, but it is not required. </p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the shortbread cookies</h4>
			<p class="RI">1¾ cups (255 grams) pastry or cake flour </p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup plus 2 tablespoons (85 grams) fine semolina</p>
			<p class="RI">1 vanilla bean</p>
			<p class="RI">½ cup plus 1 tablespoon (115 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">½ pound (2 sticks/225 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature</p>
			<p class="RI">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the poached rhubarb</h4>
			<p class="RI">2 red rhubarb stalks</p>
			<p class="RI">¾ cup (150 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="RI">⅔ cup (150 ml.) water</p>
			<p class="RI">½ vanilla bean</p>
			<p class="RI">4 verbena leaves or 1 tablespoon dried verbena (or substitute the grated zest of 1 lemon)</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the strawberries</h4>
			<p class="RI">8 ounces (230 grams) small ripe strawberries</p>
			<p class="RI">¼ cup (50 grams) granulated sugar</p>
			<h4 class="RIH">For the whipped cream</h4>
			<p class="RI">½ vanilla bean</p>
			<p class="RI">1 cup (200 ml.) very cold heavy cream</p>
			<p class="RI">2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The shortbread cookies</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Whisk together the flour and semolina in a bowl. With the tip of a sharp paring knife, split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds (reserve the pod for another use).</p>
			<p class="RP">Combine the sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla seeds and lemon zest. On low speed, beat in the flour mixture, in 2 additions, just until incorporated; do not overwork.</p>
			<p class="RP">Turn the dough out, form it into a thick disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="RP">Preheat the oven to 300°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="RP">On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to ½ inch thick. Prick it all over with a fork. With a cookie cutter, cut the dough into 1½-inch rounds and place them 1 inch apart on the lined sheets. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Let cool on the pans for at least 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. </p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The poached rhubarb</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Cut the rhubarb into 1½-inch-long sections. Combine the sugar, water, split vanilla bean, and verbena in a small pot and bring to a boil. Add the rhubarb. As soon as the liquid returns to a boil, transfer the rhubarb and its cooking syrup to a bowl or other container; make sure the rhubarb is completely submerged. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The strawberries</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Wash and hull the strawberries, cut them lengthwise in half, and transfer to a bowl. Add the sugar, toss gently, and set aside to macerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">The whipped cream</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Meanwhile, split the vanilla bean and remove the seeds. Whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla seeds in a bowl just to soft peaks. Cover and refrigerate.</p>
			<h3 class="RPH">To serve</h3>
			<p class="RP1">Spoon the rhubarb, with its syrup, into shallow bowls. Using a slotted spoon, add the strawberries, and top with the whipped cream. Finish with a drizzle of strawberry syrup and serve with the shortbread cookies.</p>
