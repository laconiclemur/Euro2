<p class="intro">Scandinavia is a huge place, so what defines an ingredient as ‘local’ varies from hilly Norway to flat Denmark - there’s a 2,500 km/1,500 mile distance between them. However, we all share a love of lots of similar products, so here is a brief guide to some of the products you will need for Nordic baking. We’ve put this together based on things we get asked for at the café, and we often help people source specific ingredients or find local replacements to use instead. You will find a more comprehensive list at <a href="http://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/">www.scandikitchen.co.uk.</a></p>
<p class="subhead">Popular spices</p>
<p class="subhead_1">Caraway/kommen/kummin/karve</p>
<p class="noindent">In Scandinavia, caraway is known as <i>kommen</i>, which sounds similar to ‘cumin’ so it is often translated incorrectly in recipes. (Cumin is called <i>spidskommen</i>.) We use caraway seeds a lot in breads as well as cheeses. In this book it is suggested as a flavouring for crispbread (see <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#page_167">page 167</a>).</p>
<p class="subhead1">Cardamom/karemumme/kardemumma</p>
<p class="noindent">It was actually the Vikings who first sampled this spice during their raids on Constantinople. While we mostly use cardamom in sweet baking and breads, it does occasionally sneak into savoury food (a pinch is used in some regional meatball recipes). It is also sometimes used as a flavouring in strong alcohols.</p>
<p class="noindent1">We use the ground variety, which you can buy in larger supermarkets and Asian speciality shops. I favour using freshly ground cardamom, though, because it is one of those spices that lose potency very quickly when pre-ground. If you use freshly ground, watch the quantity, as it is strong and if you are not used to the punchy flavour, hold back a bit.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make ground cardamom at home, either buy cardamom seeds online and finely grind in a spice grinder or pestle and mortar, or open the pods (Scandinavians prefer the green pods) and scoop out the seeds to grind (remove the little woody bits of husk inside the pod and only grind the seeds).</p>
<p class="subhead1">Cinnamon/kanel</p>
<p class="noindent">Where would the Nordic people be without their beloved cinnamon buns? We use cinnamon in a lot of our baking, from biscuits to cakes and breads. There are different grades of cinnamon – go for good-quality ground cinnamon.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Cloves/nelliker/kryddnejlika/nellik</p>
<p class="noindent">We use both whole cloves and ground cloves in our baking, especially at Christmas, when whole cloves are used in mulled wine and ground cloves are essential in ginger cookies.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Fennel seeds/fennikel frø/fänkålsfrön</p>
<p class="noindent">We use fennel seeds mainly in bread – both for loaves and as a flavouring for crispbread.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Ginger/ingefær/ingefära</p>
<p class="noindent">Ground ginger is commonly used in ginger cookies and soft ginger cake, but also in some other cakes. Whole dried ginger is essential in mulled wine.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Liquorice/lakrids/lakrits</p>
<p class="noindent">While we have a long history full of love for liquorice, it is only in recent years we have started to bake with it. This is largely due to great brands of purist liquorice coming to the market, such as Lakrids by Bülow from Denmark and Lakritsfabrikken in Sweden. Either the powder or liquorice syrup is used in most sweet recipes. In some Swedish recipes it can be referred to as Hockey Pulver.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Salt</p>
<p class="noindent">The Nordics have been preserving food in salt for centuries and we love salty foods, both <a id="page_9"/>savoury and sweet. We add salt to many cookies and cakes and we love salty liquorice. We use ammonium chloride for flavouring our liquorice, also known as <i>salmiakki</i>. It is an acquired taste – but once you get the taste for things such as salty liquorice, a life-long addiction usually starts. You have been warned.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Saffron/safran/saffran</p>
<p class="noindent">People In Sweden and Norway use saffron during the month of December in traditional Lucia buns. We commonly use ground saffron, which you can buy in specialist shops (ask behind the counter, as they are usually kept behind the till). If you are using strands, grind these before use. To intensify the colour, soak in warm liquid before using.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Seville orange peel/pomerans</p>
<p class="noindent">We use this in our mulled wine and dried in some Christmas breads and biscuits. You can substitute with normal dried orange peel, but the flavour will not be as subtle or bitter.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Vanilla/vanilje/vanilj</p>
<p class="noindent">Scandinavian recipes often call for vanilla sugar, which is a quick and easy substitute for whole vanilla pod/beans. You can make your own at home by adding 250 g/1 cup of icing/ confectioners’ sugar to a food processor or spice grinder with two vanilla pods/beans – dried out hard ones are fine – a great way to use these up. Pulse until pulverized, then sift out the large pieces of peel. You can buy vanilla sugar in any Scandinavian food shops, too – Tørsleff is a great brand. You can, of course, also always substitute with vanilla extract or real vanilla pods/beans.</p>
<p class="subhead">Berries</p>
<p class="subhead_1">Cloudberries/multebær/hjortron</p>
<p class="noindent">Fresh cloudberries are rare. They grow wild near the Arctic Circle and their season lasts around three weeks in July and August. They are hard to cultivate and foragers don’t tend to part with information freely! Frozen cloudberries are easier to get hold of but they are expensive. A little goes a long way; this is a gourmet berry, even to the Scandinavians. Most Scandinavian shops will stock cloudberry jam, which can be used in most of our baking recipes. The cloudberry is very tart and the jam/jelly is not used as a spread for toast, as it is far too expensive. Use it with strong cheese or in desserts (it’s particularly great heated up and poured over vanilla ice cream). To replace this flavour in recipes is hard.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Lingonberries/tyttebær/lingon</p>
<p class="noindent">Norwegians, Finns and Swedes will have lingonberries in their freezers throughout the year; fresh ones are picked in August. We also have lingonberry jam/jelly and compotes in our store cupboards. You can use the frozen or fresh berries for baking, and you can also use the jam for some cakes or cookies. If you cannot get hold of lingonberries, substitute with cranberries or raspberries, depending on the recipe. Many Scandinavian shops sell the frozen berries.</p>
<p class="subhead">Grains and flours</p>
<p class="subhead_1">Oats/havregryn</p>
<p class="noindent">Used in porridge, granola, muesli and baking. We also eat raw oats with milk for breakfast. Oat flakes (jumbo oats) or cut oats are favoured.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Potato flour/kartoffelmel/potatismjöl/potetmel</p>
<p class="noindent">You can buy this in speciality stores. Once potato starch is added, the dish should not boil (especially in fruit-based sauces as these will go cloudy after boiling).</p>
<p class="subhead1">Rye flour rugmel/rågmjöl</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two kinds of rye flour sold in supermarkets. Wholegrain dark rye and light (sifted) rye. Light rye flour is often called Type 997. It is, basically, sifted wholegrain rye flour, so if you are pushed, you can sift the dark rye flour before using in a recipe.</p>
<p class="subhead1"><a id="page_10"/>Rye flour mix/sigtemel/rågsikt</p>
<p class="noindent">In Sweden and Denmark, rågsikt (sigtemel in Danish) is very common. It’s 60% white wheat flour and 40% light rye (type 997), sifted. You can make this at home by mixing the same quantities.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Rye flakes/rugflager/rågflingor</p>
<p class="noindent">I love using rye flakes in granola, flapjacks and porridge (mixed with normal oats) for their nutty flavour and good bite. Available in health-food stores, they take longer to cook and are quite chewy. If you are using oats in a recipe, consider mixing part oats, part rye flakes.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Semolina/semuljegryn/mannagryn/semulegryn</p>
<p class="noindent">Used for some desserts and also as a porridge.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Spelt flour/speltmel/dinkelmjöl</p>
<p class="noindent">This is an older type of wheat grain and less refined. You can get both white and wholegrain spelt flour – we use both in this book. Spelt contains less gluten than other wheat flours.</p>
<p class="subhead">Yeast and leaveners</p>
<p class="subhead_1">Baker’s ammonia/hartshorn powder/hjortetakssalt/hjorthornssalt</p>
<p class="noindent">Used in old Nordic recipes to ensure cookies rise and get crispy at lower temperatures, baker’s ammonia gives off a very strong ammonia smell as you bake, but this disappears as soon as the cookies cool.</p>
<p class="noindent1">You can buy it online or at some pharmacies, as well as in many Scandinavian food shops. It was traditionally made from the ground antlers of young stags, but nowadays it’s all chemical. When using baker’s ammonia, don’t eat the raw dough. Substitute with baking powder, although the result will not be as crispy.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Dry active yeast</p>
<p class="noindent">Little yeast granules you have to activate in lukewarm water before using. This is the next best thing to fresh yeast. Activate and leave for 15 minutes in the finger-warm liquid to go frothy and bubbly – then use in the recipe as normal.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Fresh yeast</p>
<p class="noindent">25 g/1 oz. of fresh yeast (also known as compressed yeast) is the equivalent to 13 g/ <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. of dry active yeast. It usually comes in packs of 50 g/2 oz. and looks a bit like clay. Take care not to kill fresh yeast with hot liquid or by adding salt to the yeast before the flour.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If you use heavier flours, such as rye, the yeast takes a long time to lift it and you will have denser breads. Consider mixing lighter flours with the darker ones if you want fluffy loaves.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Instant dried yeast</p>
<p class="noindent">If you have no option but to use instant dry yeast (a fine powder sold in sachets), skip the adding to liquid step and add to the dry ingredients. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for equivalent measures.</p>
<p class="subhead">Other stuff</p>
<p class="subhead_1">Marzipan/marsipan</p>
<p class="noindent">We use ready-made marzipan in a lot of our baking recipes and have included an easy recipe to make your own 50/50 marzipan (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>). In the UK and America, marzipan is commonly only 25% almonds.</p>
<p class="noindent1">You can bind marzipan with water instead of egg white if you are worried about eating raw egg, but I think egg whites make it smooth and easier to work with. However, leftover marzipan bound with water will keep in the fridge a little longer.</p>
<p class="subhead1">Punch</p>
<p class="noindent">A type of Swedish rum liqueur often used to flavour rum truffle treats such as Romkugler (see <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#page_56">page 56</a>) – you can substitute with good concentrated rum flavourings for baked treats if you prefer.</p>
