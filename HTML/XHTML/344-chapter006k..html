<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-179"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Ratatouille</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Ratatouille is a traditional vegetable stew from Provence, which is great on its own and also as a filling for sandwiches and omelettes. In fact, one of my favorite sandwiches is a heaping spoonful of ratatouille with sliced, roasted lamb on toast that has been slathered with Aioli (<a href="chapter008d.xhtml#page-264">here</a>). In the summertime, add a handful of Niçoise olives and roughly torn fresh basil leaves.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 small yellow onion, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 plum tomatoes, diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 bell pepper (any color!), stemmed, seeded, and cut into ½-inch dice</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large eggplant, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 zucchini, trimmed and cut into ½-inch dice</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence (<a href="chapter008b.xhtml#page-261h">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 teaspoons sherry vinegar</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the olive</strong> oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onion, tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Make sure the heat is high enough to keep everything cooking, but not so high that the vegetables color; you want them to sweat, not brown. Add the eggplant along with another pinch of salt and cook until the eggplant begins to soften, another 10 minutes. Lastly, add the zucchini, along with the chili flakes and herbes de Provence. If the mixture is looking a little dry, add another tablespoon of olive oil. Stir and cook for a final 15 minutes, or until all of the vegetables are wonderfully soft and yielding. Stir in the vinegar and season with more salt, if needed.</p>
<p>Serve warm, at room temperature, or even cold. Ratatouille only gets better the longer it sits, and it keeps for up to a week in a sealed container in the refrigerator.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-180"/><span class="gold2h"><span class="dotted">Grilled Escarole</span></span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This is spectacularly easy, quite mouthwatering, and works as both a first course before an entrée or as a side dish. Escarole is part of the chicory family and has a pleasant bitterness to it. Note that while the outer leaves of the escarole are not used in this preparation, they should not be discarded. Some particularly good uses include Poached Eggs over Scafata (<a href="chapter001h.xhtml#page-13">here</a>) or Soupe au Pistou (<a href="chapter003u.xhtml#page-104">here</a>).</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 head escarole, outer leaves removed and saved, thoroughly washed</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup pitted, crushed green olives</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Get your grill</strong> going. If you’re using charcoal, you’re looking for a not-too-hot fire (I like to think of the coals as being “soft,” which is to say they should be halfway through burning). If you’re using a gas grill, set the heat to medium. If you’re using a grill pan indoors, set it over medium-low heat.</p>
<p>Shake the escarole dry. Cut it lengthwise straight through the core into 4 wedges. Drizzle each wedge with plenty of olive oil, about 1½ tablespoons per wedge, and season aggressively with salt. Grill the wedges, turning only once, until wilted and charred in spots, about 10 minutes altogether.</p>
<p>Transfer the escarole to a serving platter, give it a healthy drizzle of olive oil, and scatter the olives over the top. Serve immediately.</p>
