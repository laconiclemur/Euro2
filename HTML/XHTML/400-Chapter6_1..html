<p class="intro">As a child, I could often be found outside the local bakery with my little nose pressed firmly up against the window, trying to catch a glimpse of all the fancy cream cakes. I swear I could almost taste them through the glass. For those days when ordinary cake just won’t do, here’s a selection of some special cakes to make at home.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_94"/>Vaniljhjärtan</p>
<p class="head1">CUSTARD TARTS</p>
<p class="intro">From Portugal’s <i>pastel de nata</i> to England’s custard tart, most countries have their own version of a pastry cream tart. It’s not hard to understand why: firstly, it uses up any leftover pastry cream, and secondly, they are the perfect small bite to accompany a cup of coffee. In Sweden, custard tarts are baked in heart-shaped cases, known as <i>vaniljhjärtan</i> – vanilla hearts. In Denmark, they are known as <i>linser</i> and baked in round cases.</p>

<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 12–14 VANILLA HEARTS OR 1 YORKSHIRE PUDDING/MUFFIN TRAYFUL (15–18)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out half the sweet shortcrust pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. You want a thickness of around 2–3 mm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch. Use a pastry/cookie cutter or glass to stamp out the closest size rounds for the pan(s) you have chosen. Line the greased pan(s) neatly with the pastry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pour the prepared pastry cream into the pastry bases to fill <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the way up.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the other half of the pastry and cut out lids for the tarts – you will need a very slightly larger sized cutter for this. Dampen the edges of the pastry lids with a little water and add to the tarts, sealing them well. Make sure that the lids fit firmly on the cakes or the pastry cream will seep out during baking. Trim away any leftover pastry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 20–22 minutes for smaller tarts and 22 mins + for larger shapes, or until they start to turn brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the pans before carefully lifting out.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Dust with icing/confectioners’ sugar before serving.</p>

<p class="head1"><a id="page_97"/>NAPOLEON HATS</p>
<p class="intro">During the 1850s in Denmark, coffee and cake was high fashion – and many of the traditional konditor cakes stem from that time. During that era, we also named a lot of cakes after Napoleon – and his hat is still one of the most iconic and popular Danish cakes today. Every baker worth his salt is likely to have these displayed proudly in their shop window.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to around 2–3 mm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>inch in thickness. Using the pastry/cookie cutter, stamp out 15 circles.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a stand mixer or using a wooden spoon and mixing bowl, combine the grated marzipan with the egg white and caster/granulated sugar to form a sticky mass. Roll the mixture into balls weighing around 20 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> oz. each.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Place a round ball of marzipan in the middle of each pastry circle, then press three of the sides up at the same time to form what looks like Napoleon’s hat. Place on the lined baking sheet.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 10–11 minutes or until the pastry turns golden brown. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Coat the base of the cooled ‘hats’ in a thin layer of tempered chocolate and allow to dry upside down on greaseproof paper.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Note:</b> If you are unsure of how to temper chocolate, use this cheat’s method: chop the chocolate and melt half in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water. When the chocolate is completely melted, remove from the heat and immediately add the other half. Stir together until everything is melted. Your chocolate is now ready to use.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_98"/>Fragilité</p>
<p class="head1">HAZELNUT AND MOCHA SQUARE</p>
<p class="intro">This delightful Danish invention evolved at the beginning of the 1900s, back when the Danes were influenced by anything fanciful and French. It’s made with meringue – hence the ‘fragile’ name. You can make the bases with ground hazelnuts or almonds, and you can vary the buttercream filling too. Not into coffee? Omit it and add cocoa to make an intensely chocolatey buttercream. Want a more summery version? Add fresh berries and vanilla buttercream.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MERINGUE BASE:</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingrd">5 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd1">BUTTERCREAM:</p>
<p class="ingrd">170 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup plus 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">3 tabespoons strong espresso coffee, cooled</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter, softened</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd">50 g/2 oz. dark/bittersweet chocolate, melted</p>
<p class="ingrd">a little extra melted butter, to grease baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd">icing/confectioners’ sugar, to dust</p>
<p class="ingrd2">35 x 25-cm/14 x 9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-inch rectangular baking pan, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">SERVES 5–6</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F) Gas 2. Brush a little melted butter onto the baking parchment to help with the release of the meringue.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a food processor, grind the hazelnuts to a relatively fine and even consistency, making sure no big pieces remain.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat the egg whites until stiff in a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk. Add the icing/confectioners’ sugar, bit by bit, and whisk until stiff. Fold in the ground hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spoon the mixture out evenly into the baking pan and level the surface. Pop into the preheated oven to bake for about 45 minutes. It should be baked through but not brown.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Meanwhile, prepare the buttercream. Add the caster/granulated sugar and 100 ml/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon water to a saucepan set over medium-high heat, and bring to a bubbly boil. Add the strong espresso coffee and remove from the heat. Leave to cool until just finger-warm.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Combine the softened butter, lukewarm coffee mixture and egg yolk in a bowl and mix together until they start to bind. This may take several minutes, especially if your coffee mixture has gone a bit too cold. Stir in the melted chocolate to form a smooth buttercream.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Once the meringue base has baked and cooled down, remove it from the pan and peel away the baking parchment. Very carefully cut the sides even, then cut into 3 equal rectangles.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To assemble the cake, take the first meringue rectangle and place on your serving plate. Spread over a layer of buttercream. Put the second layer on top, then add another layer of buttercream. Add the top cake layer. Ensure all sides are lined up and even. Dust the top liberally with icing/confectioners’ sugar. Leave for at least an hour to soften before very carefully slicing with a serrated knife into 5–6 squares. Any pressure and the filling comes out, so be careful.</p>

<p class="head1">LIQUORICE MERINGUE KISSES</p>
<p class="intro">These little meringue kisses are perfect for people who love salty liquorice (most Nordic folk, then). You can get hold of liquorice powder online or in specialist shops – but always go for the good-quality stuff; it really does make a difference. If you are not a fan of liquorice, freeze-dried raspberry powder works as a substitute.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">3 egg whites</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/superfine sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon cornflour/cornstarch</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon raw liquorice powder plus 1 teaspoon for decoration</p>
<p class="ingrd">black food colouring, for piping (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a disposable piping/pastry bag</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 40</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 100°C (215°F) <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> Gas.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat the egg whites on high speed in the clean bowl of a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk. Once the whites begin to stiffen, start to add the sugar, bit by bit. Keep whisking for several minutes until the sugar is fully incorporated and the mixture has formed very stiff peaks.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the cornflour/cornstarch and lemon juice and whisk again. Lastly, fold in the liquorice powder.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Paint the inside of the disposable piping/pastry bag with streaks of black food colouring using a pastry brush, reaching right down the length of the bag. Spoon in the meringue mixture and snip the end off the piping/pastry bag.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pipe mini meringues onto the lined baking sheets (around 2.5 cm/1 inch in diameter). The black food colouring will make a pretty stripy pattern on your meringues.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sprinkle a little liquorice powder on top of each ‘kiss’, then bake in the preheated oven for around 40–45 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to cool down inside the oven for a few minutes before removing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Eat the kisses on their own or on top of vanilla ice cream, with extra liquorice syrup.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_102"/>Flødeboller</p>
<p class="head1">MALLOW FLUFF CAKES</p>
<p class="intro">One of the things that homesick Danes ask for the most at the café are these lovely little soft mallow cakes. Back in Denmark, <i>flødeboller</i> have a welcome place at kids’ birthday parties, on top of ice cream and as a special treat with an afternoon cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/7 oz. store-bought marzipan with 50% almond content (or see basic recipe on <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MALLOW FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup liquid glucose</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/superfine sugar plus 1 extra tablespoon</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingrd">seeds from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> vanilla pod/bean OR 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingrd">100 g/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. egg whites (do weigh them)</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingrd1">CHOCOLATE COATING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/7 oz. dark/bittersweet chocolate, broken into pieces (I use 70% Valrhona, but a milk chocolate will also give a lovely light result</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vegetable oil (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd">freeze-dried raspberries, sprinkles or desiccated/dried shredded coconut, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 4-cm/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch round pastry/cookie cutter</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a sugar thermometer</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a large piping/pastry bag, fitted with a plain nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 18–20</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the marzipan to 3 mm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thickness and stamp out 18–20 small, even thin discs with the pastry/cookie cutter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 10 minutes or until golden. Leave to cool completely. They will remain soft in the middle.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the mallow filling, combine the liquid glucose, 150 g/<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup caster/superfine sugar, lemon juice and vanilla pod/bean seeds with 50 ml/3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil and, using a sugar thermometer, keep heating until you reach 117–118°C/244–245°F. Be aware that if your syrup does not reach this temperature, the mallow will not set correctly. Remove from the heat with care.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Meanwhile, beat the egg whites with the salt until on low–medium speed until they start to combine and froth, using a stand mixer or a hand-held electric whisk. Add the remaining tablespoon of sugar and keep whisking. Increase the speed to high and add the warm syrup in a very thin stream. Once combined, beat for a further for 8–10 minutes. It does take this long to get the thick, stiff peaky mallow.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Add the mallow filling to the piping/pastry bag and carefully pipe a swirl of mallow onto each marzipan base, leaving a bit of the edge free. Aim to have a good high top on each mallow (approx. 4–5 cm/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches). Leave to set for an hour at room temperature or speed up the process by refrigerating.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Temper the chocolate in your usual manner. If you are unsure of how to temper chocolate, see the note on <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#page_97">page 97</a>. Add an optional drop of vegetable oil to the warm tempered chocolate for an extra-thin finish.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To coat, place a mallow bun on a wire rack, resting over a bowl. Spoon over the tempered chocolate, then transfer with a spatula to a different tray to dry. Repeat until you have completed the batch. You may have to pour excess chocolate back from the drip bowl to use again. Decorate with freeze-dried raspberries, sprinkles or desiccated/dried shredded coconut. Leave to cool and set before eating.</p>

<p class="head2"><a id="page_104"/>Fancy fika</p>
<p class="intro">Scandinavian baking in general is quite wholesome and largely focused around the home. There is another side though – the pastries and fancy cakes, admired in bakery windows across Scandinavia. My eight-year-old self found it impossible to pass by a bakery without ensuring the mark of my squashed nose was left against the polished glass window. These are the types of cake we tend not to attempt at home, but I want to show you that actually they are not as difficult as people think, and so worth a little bit of extra effort.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At ScandiKitchen, we love combining the idea of wholesome fika (meeting up for a coffee or tea and a bite of something sweet to eat, see <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#page_74">pages 74</a>–<a href="Chapter5.xhtml#page_75">75</a> for a full description) with the traditional idea of English afternoon tea (well, when in London...). We also love to marry the idea of the fancier afternoon fika with sturdy buns and breads to ensure there is always a bit of what you fancy when you drop by.</p>
<p class="noindent1">During the 1700s many foreign bakers brought new spices and recipes across to Scandinavia, which in turn influenced our baking style. Later, with the rise of unions in Denmark, it became law that a proportion of bakers needed to be Danish and outside influence on our traditional recipes stopped for a while. During the 1850s there was a strike in Denmark by all bakery workers, which meant the master bakers had to import help from as far away as Austria. When this overseas help arrived, they brought with them a wealth of diverse knowledge and skills, most notably the Viennese method of making pastry. Suddenly, the most delicate pastries in Denmark were redefined by new <i>plundergebäcken</i> methods (dough wrapped in butter and rolled 27 times to form paper-thin layers of buttery puffed pastry). When the Austrian bakers went home, the Danes continued to develop this new breed of pastry – eventually resulting in what is now known all over the world as ‘Danish pastry’.</p>
<p class="image-center"><a id="page_105"/><img alt="img" src="images/C6-F7.jpg"/></p>
<p class="image-center"><img alt="img" src="images/C6-F8.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">In Scandinavia, this type of pastry is now known as <i>Wienerbrød</i> (Vienna bread). You can find our delicious Danish pastry recipes in the Breads &amp; Batters chapter <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#page_142">pages 142</a> and <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#page_145">145</a> as well as the giant Danish pastry Kringle on <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#page_126">page 126</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Along with the influence of the Austrian bakers in Denmark at that time, meeting up at cake houses for coffee and tea became ever more popular in fancy circles, and so the need for more elaborate cakes arose. It was the height of fashion to meet up and eat delicate pastries and cream cakes such as Sarah Bernhardt cakes on <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#page_113">page 113</a> (the famous actress had this cake named after her on her visit to Copenhagen), and the Napoleon’s Hat cakes on <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#page_97">page 97</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">An obsession with fancy eclairs and indulgent cream-based cakes took hold and became very much the ‘in thing’ to eat at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although quite a few of these recipes originated in Denmark, they spread across Scandinavia and other parts of Europe. Many of the cakes originally made famous or invented in Denmark are available throughout Scandinavia today, although sometimes with slightly different names and regional variations. The Sarah Bernhardt cakes, for example, are called <i>Biskvier</i> in Sweden and have a slightly different filling, but the original idea and shape are the same.</p>
<p class="noindent1">People often ask me why Scandinavians are considered so healthy when we have such a sweet tooth. It is all about balance. You won’t find many Danes who eat a pastry every morning, because that wouldn’t be <i>tilpasseligt</i> (or <i>lagom –</i> just enough, not too much or too little). Instead, they’ll have them for breakfast on a Sunday or a special occasion.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_106"/>Kartoffelkager</p>
<p class="head1">POTATO CAKES</p>
<p class="intro">Let’s get one thing straight: there are no hidden potatoes in these cakes. The name stems from their look, not the ingredients. This type of cream cake originated in Denmark, where it first made an appearance in the early 1900s. There are two varieties – one has a sponge base and the other is choux pastry. For me, the choux pastry wins every time for the lightness.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">CHOUX BUNS:</p>
<p class="ingrd">170 g/scant 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups white strong/bread flour</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon baker’s ammonia (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#page_36">page 36</a> for further information; these will still work without, it just makes the pastry extra crisp)</p>
<p class="ingrd">125 g/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> sticks butter</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon caster/granulated sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">4–5 eggs, mixed together and placed in a small jug/pitcher</p>
<p class="ingrd1">FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">250 ml/1 cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> portion of Pastry Cream (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">TOPPING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">300–400 g/10–14 oz. store-bought marzipan with 50% almond content (or see basic recipe on <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">icing/confectioners’ sugar and cocoa powder, for dusting</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a large piping/pastry bag fitted with large plain nozzle/tip (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 5 cm/2 inch round pastry/cookie cutter</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 25</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°C) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sift together the flour, salt and baker’s ammonia (if using).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put the butter and sugar into a saucepan with 275 ml/1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups water and melt together over a low heat. Add the flour and stir with a spatula until incorporated and the mixture lets go of the sides of the pan. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Start to add the eggs a little at a time to the cooled dough, beating well between each addition until well combined. You may not need all the eggs. You want to end up with a smooth mixture that still holds if piped, but drops from the spoon in about 3–4 seconds. Be patient and keep mixing after each egg addition to see if you need more.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spoon or pipe out around 25 buns of equal generous size onto the prepared baking sheets. They will rise and puff up slightly, so space them well apart. I usually don’t pipe the choux pastry because I like a rustic finish, but it is up to you, of course.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pop in the preheated oven and immediately reduce the heat to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4. Bake for 20–25 minutes until well risen and golden brown. Try not to open the door to the oven during the baking time. To make sure the buns are cooked, take one out and see if it collapses. If it sinks, bake the buns for a few more minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove from the oven and poke a small hole in each bun to let the steam escape. Leave to cool down completely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">No more than two hours before serving, whip the cream to stiff peaks, then fold in the pastry cream. Cut each bun open and pipe in a generous amount of filling to taste.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the marzipan on a surface lightly dusted with icing/confectioners’ sugar. Stamp out shapes to fit over the top of the choux pastry balls using the round cutter. Add the marzipan circles to the top of the potato cakes and dust with cocoa powder before serving.</p>

<p class="intro">I used to eat these on the way home from school when I was a kid. I’d save up the leftover change from lunch money and buy <i>hindbærsnitter</i> as often as I could afford to. My kids, Astrid and Elsa, love these too and they are always a welcome addition to the school cake sale table. Show me the child who doesn’t love frosting, jam/jelly and biscuit – it’s the sweet and simple things that please the little ones the most.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">1 portion of Sweet Shortcrust Pastry Dough (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">200 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup good-quality raspberry jam/jelly</p>
<p class="ingrd">300 g/2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">1–3 tablespoons hot water</p>
<p class="ingrd">sprinkles, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd2">2 baking sheets, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 12–16</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Split the sweet shortcrust pastry dough into two equal portions and roll into 2 evenly sized squares, around 3 mm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick. Each one should be around 30 x 30 cm/11 x 11 inches. Ensure the shapes are the same size as you will be layering them later.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put the pastry squares on the prepared baking sheets. Prick the surfaces with a fork to prevent air bubbles forming as they bake. Pop in the preheated oven to bake for about 10–12 minutes or until slightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="noindent1">On one of the cooled pastry sheets, spread a generous, even layer of the raspberry jam/jelly. Very carefully, slide the other piece of pastry on top so that it sits exactly on top of the base. Handle delicately, as the pastry can break quite easily.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mix the icing/confectioners’ sugar with hot water to form a smooth paste. The amount of water you will need varies depending on your sugar. If the paste is too thick, add a few drops more water. Too thin, add a bit more icing/confectioners’ sugar. Aim for the consistency of runny honey. Spread the icing/frosting on top of the pastry to evenly cover. Top with sprinkles and leave to dry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a very sharp knife, cut the edges off the pastry to make straight sides. Cut into 12 large or 16 small equal pieces to serve.</p>

I remember my grandmother loved having her friends over to play cards on a Friday afternoon and sometimes, if it was someone’s birthday, they’d stop by the baker’s and bring little fancy cakes. All the ladies would sit around in the lounge in the big old house and <i>hygge</i>, laugh loudly, play cards and eat cake.There were always leftovers. What kid can resist sweet biscuit cakes with whipped cream? Not me.</p>
<p class="ingrd1"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> portion of Sweet Shortcrust Pastry Dough (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> portion of Pastry Cream (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_14">page 14</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 ml/<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 tablespoon icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">a pinch of vanilla sugar or a drop of vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingrd1">FROSTING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">60 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">15 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. cocoa powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">sprinkles and/or small berries, to garnish</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a 7–8-cm/2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>–3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch round pastry/cookie cutter</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a baking sheet, greased and lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag fitted with a star nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 10-12</p>
<p class="noindent1">Remove the sweet shortcrust pastry from the refrigerator a while before using.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) Gas 6.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 2–3 mm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>–<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch thick. Cut out 24 circles using the round pastry/cookie cutter and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake for about 6–8 minutes in the preheated oven or until just a little bit browned. Leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Beat the whipping cream with the icing/confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until stiff. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the frosting, mix the icing/confectioners’ sugar with the cocoa powder, then add 2–3 tablespoons hot water and stir. You may need to add more water, but do so slowly so that it does not get too runny. You want a thick yet spreadable frosting.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Spread around a teaspoon each of frosting on top of half of the pastry circles. Use the back of the spoon to neatly spread toward the edges. Before the frosting sets, add the sprinkles.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put a large teaspoon of pastry cream in the middle of each remaining bare pastry circle. Spoon the whipped cream into the piping/pastry bag and pipe a neat circle of whipped cream around the pastry cream. Add the iced top layer and garnish with another swirl of whipped cream and small fresh berries, if desired. Serve chilled and eat with a pastry fork.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Tip:</b> Add a delicious fruity edge by combining a bit of puréed raspberry with the whipping cream.</p>

<p class="head1">SARAH BERNHARDT CAKES</p>
<p class="intro">Back in the day it was all the rage to name cakes after famous people, so when French actress Sarah Bernhardt visited Denmark in 1911, a local Copenhagen <i>konditor</i> created a new cake and named it after her. Then the Swedes came along and decided to make it slightly differently and called it <i>biskvier</i> instead. This recipe is a middle-ground between the two versions; it tastes great and just happens to be gluten-free, too. Plus, now I won’t offend either country. There is raw yolk in the filling, but you can replace this with a dash of milk if you prefer.</p>
<p class="ingrd1">200 g/7 oz. store-bought marzipan with 50% almond content (or see basic recipe on <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">70 g/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> egg white</p>
<p class="ingrd1">FILLING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">120 g/1 cup icing/confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="ingrd">150 g/1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> sticks butter, at room temperature</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon vanilla sugar, extract OR use the seeds seeds from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> vanilla pod/bean</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingrd">75 g/3 oz. 70% dark/bittersweet chocolate, melted</p>
<p class="ingrd">1 teaspoon cocoa powder</p>
<p class="ingrd">a few teaspoons cold, strong espresso coffee (optional)</p>
<p class="ingrd1">COATING:</p>
<p class="ingrd">125 g/4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> oz. 70% dark/bittersweet chocolate, tempered (see <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#page_97">page 97</a>)</p>
<p class="ingrd">freeze-dried raspberries or popping candy, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a baking sheet, lined with baking parchment</p>
<p class="ingrd2">a piping/pastry bag fitted with a plain nozzle/tip</p>
<p class="ingrd1">MAKES 15</p>
<p class="noindent1">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas 4.</p>
<p class="noindent1">First, make the bases. Mix the marzipan with the icing/confectioners’ sugar and add the half an egg white. Mix into a pliable dough.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using damp hands, separate and mould the dough into 15 little round balls of around 20 g/1 oz. each. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet and press down slightly to flatten each one to around <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cm/<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch in height.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bake in the preheated oven for around 10–12 minutes or until golden around the edges. Leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Meanwhile, make the filling. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or using a hand-held electric whisk), beat the icing/confectioners’ sugar, butter and vanilla on high speed until fully incorporated. Add the egg yolk and whisk again. Finally, beat in the melted dark/bittersweet chocolate and cocoa powder. Continue to beat until you have a light, fluffy mixture. Fold in the espresso coffee now, if using.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a spatula, cover each cooled marzipan disc with the filling. Traditionally, the filling is added with a knife and shaped a bit like a spinning top, but if you prefer a rounder and neater topping, you can use a piping/pastry bag. Chill the cakes in the refrigerator for 20–30 minutes. When you take them out, use a smooth knife edge to level any messy toppings, so that the chocolate coating will go on smoothly.</p>
<p class="noindent1">When you are ready to cover the biskvier, temper the chocolate to your usual method or see <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#page_97">page 97</a> for instructions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Dip each <i>biskvier</i> in the tempered chocolate and ensure all the filling is covered in a thin layer. Hold the <i>biski</i> up to allow excess chocolate to drip away – you don’t want it too thick. Decorate with freeze-dried raspberries or popping candy before allowing to dry.</p>
