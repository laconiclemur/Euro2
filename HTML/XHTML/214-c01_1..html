		<p class="altpf"><span class="dropcaps2line_alt"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">I</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> had passed the gray, grand old house at No 1 rue de Loudenne on several occasions since moving to Médoc, but I had never thought that it would ever have anything to do with me.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">We had left our Parisian lives a few years earlier and had settled in a farmhouse in the northern part of Médoc, right in the middle of the dense pine forests and close to the beautiful white beaches of the Atlantic coast. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">We had entered a mysterious new world of winemakers, hunters, vegetable growers, and local gourmands whose way of life seemed in many ways more content, simpler, and perhaps fuller than we had any right to expect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">We were, in a word, happy! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Our growing family felt at home in the countryside, and as the years passed we realized that we would probably never leave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">We thought about buying a farmhouse to call our own, maybe something closer to the vineyards we love. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.6">It had to be special; it had to suit us.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Our friend Fabien, a local winemaker with a huge appetite and appreciation for life and all it has to offer, took matters into his own hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">He said, “You should live closer to us,” probably because he had one eye on popping in for lunch now and then when he’d tire of working the tractor in his vineyards. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">A few days later, on a sunny, warm, late-January Monday, Oddur and I were driving around with Fabien’s childhood friend, Stéphane, a local real estate agent who knows the twisted back roads of Médoc as well as anyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">He had three properties shortlisted for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">While they were all pretty enough, none was love at first sight, and it had to be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6">He was a little disappointed, and we seemed, I imagine, difficult to please.</span></p>
		<p class="altp" id="p14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">On the way back home the car was silent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">I realized that though I hadn’t really gotten my hopes up, now that nothing had appealed to me, I felt a little let down; I had been so sure we’d easily find something we’d like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">Halfway back home, Stéphane started saying something, then stopped. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">Moments later he hesitantly continued, “There is one house that is absolutely not what you are looking for, but something tells me you might like it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">I don’t have the keys, but do you mind if we go back and take a quick look?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.6">He told us the house was in the village of St Yzans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.7">Since we have always liked that part of Médoc, the wine country close to St Estèphe, we felt we had nothing to lose.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Ten minutes later we entered through the rusty, rambling gates of No 1 rue de Loudenne and found ourselves amongst the weeds and poorly maintained rosebushes that lined the walls of the house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Stéphane explained to us that the building was empty and gave us a brief version of the history of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Originally a winemaking château, it was once a hotel and restaurant and finally a family home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">He told us that it had been lived in for years by a tough old lady who had died the year before, and now the estate was in the hands of her only son. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5">He offered to call the owner who lived nearby if we wanted to look inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.6">Oddur hesitated; it just seemed like too much house, too farfetched (and he never thinks </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">anything</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> is farfetched)—we had been looking for a farmhouse, not a former château in the middle of a quiet village—but I just </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">needed</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> to see this house.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">As we waited patiently in the garden, an elderly man, walking so slowly that he didn’t really seem to be moving, advanced alongside the house up the street that leads to the cemetery. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">He stopped right in front of the gate, adjusted his sailor’s cap, and stared at me for about a minute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">He didn’t gesture for me to come closer; he didn’t seem to want to enter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">He just seemed to be assessing the situation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.5">Our eyes met and he gave me the faintest smile, as if to say, “I’m the past of St Yzans, and if you want to be the future, you have my blessing.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.6">Then he turned without saying a word and continued his stroll.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Monsieur Ladra, the very pleasant, slightly plump, and always well-dressed owner of the house, arrived minutes later with a big smile on his kind, teddy bear face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Within minutes he had disclosed his family’s whole history, the account of how, through his great-grandmother’s dalliance, the house had become family property. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">Then he gave us the grand tour. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">The big, faded, blue-green door that opens up into the central staircase seemed stuck, perhaps a last attempt by this old dame of a building to keep her independence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.5">But she relented and, once inside, as I gazed up the staircase, I knew I would live here, forever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.6">The tiles beneath my feet were so pretty, the staircase right out of a fairy tale with faded, peeling wallpaper, and a bright blue light piercing through the window shutters on the second-floor landing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.7">The house seemed much bigger from inside than it had from the courtyard, the corridors so wide, the ceilings so high. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.8">Stéphane led us up a dodgy ladder to the terrace on the roof—which he called “</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">la cerise sur le gâteau,</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">” the cherry on the cake—with wonderful views of the vineyards and even, on a clear day, of the Gironde estuary.</span></p>
		<p class="altp" id="p15"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">But for me, what sealed the deal was the kitchen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">So much history buried in the cupboards and in the old tiles peeking out from under a modern linoleum flooring. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">A fireplace so large and inviting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">What food I could make here! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.5">Where Stéphane saw great value and renovating possibilities, where Oddur saw beauty and flawless light, I saw nothing but steaks and duck breasts grilling in the fireplace; pots simmering on a stove; baskets filled with onions, parsnips, and potatoes; garlic and hams hanging from the ceilings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.6">I saw myself cooking feasts in that kitchen.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Monsieur Ladra spoke lovingly of his mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, Plantia, all of whom had been passionate, accomplished cooks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Plantia had run a hotel and restaurant and, according to him, the food had been legendary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">He took us to the part of the house where the guest rooms had been, the numbers still on the doors, each one equipped with a porcelain sink. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">Some of the furniture was even still there, in all its termite-eaten glory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.5">He enjoyed telling us tales of big shots from Bordeaux who used to come up north for the hunting season, unaccompanied by their wives. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.6">These gentlemen spent their mornings hunting, their lunches feasting on Plantia’s food, and the evenings enjoying the fine wines of the region and, of course, the company of the ladies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.7">He told us the house had been occupied by the Germans in the war, that at one time they’d had palm trees in the garden and a big sign on the side of the house that said “Hôtel de France.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.8">By the end of our tour, Monsieur Ladra told us we could keep any furniture we liked and offered to lend us a key so we could take a look whenever we wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.9">As one last sales pitch, he casually added, “I have many of the old photographs from the good old days, and maybe I can even find some of my great-grandmother’s recipes.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.10">The last bit caught my attention.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">That night there was no discussion of “Should we?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Our fate was already sealed.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Very soon after we offered on the property, Monsieur Ladra, true to his word, gave us the keys. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">He added, “You’re not really supposed to, but if you want to start work on it, just go ahead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">This house is yours now; do with it what you want.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4">It became a favorite pastime to visit the house, drive through the vineyards that lead to St Yzans, imagine what if would feel like to drive that road when we’d actually be on our way home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.5">Many Sunday afternoons were spent having “picnics” in the “Salle des Vendanges”—the harvest room, where years ago the women of the Ladra family cooked for sweaty and hungry harvesters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.6">Next to the harvest rooms they had showers for the workers, and we decided early on that we’d keep at least one booth intact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.7">It has a nice ring to it: lunch and a shower.</span></p>

		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">While the bat ruled inside, a black cat had taken to guarding the front door. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">She was always there when we arrived, and when she saw us she would slip elegantly into the basement, through the slightly open shutters that lead to the wine cellar. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">I started calling her Plantia, imagining that the former mistress of the house was checking in on the new owners.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Sometime in late summer the bat was gone, and though the rest of the family was relieved, I realized I missed her; somehow she added a touch of derelict glamour that only bats and ghosts can provide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">At least Plantia had taken up residence in our vegetable garden and didn’t seem to be going anywhere.</span></p>

		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">One early summer’s day I finally encountered the old man from that first time we had toured the house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">His name was Monsieur Gilet, and he had lived all his life in the village. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">Madame Ladra, the one who had just passed away, had been his teacher at school, and later he had installed all the electricity in the house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.4">He spoke fondly of the food that he had enjoyed there, especially the fava bean soup. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.5">“Everybody knew that Madame Pautard was an excellent cook,” he said, talking about Plantia and her daughter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.6">Mostly he spoke about his deceased wife, who was now resting in the cemetery down the road where he went twice every day despite his walking difficulties and where he spent a good deal of time before slowly heading back.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">A friend introduced me to the town’s mayor, Monsieur Segundo Cimbrone, one of the last communists in the region, who welcomed me with open arms. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">His wife, Conchita, had worked in the vineyards when she was younger, only, she said, “to be able to attend the harvest lunches at 1 rue de Loudenne.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Little by little, week by week, I slowly met everybody, and most of them had something to say about our future home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">Mr. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.5">Souslikoff, the mustachioed mechanic who loves old Citroëns, remembered how 1 rue de Loudenne was the only house with a telephone and how he’d been allowed to go there on two occasions with his parents to place important calls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.6">Monsieur Teyssier, who owns half the basements and barns in St Yzans and knows all the secrets, remembered everything best, but then he knows everything about everybody.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Everyone had a story about the meals they had had in the Ladra/Pautard house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Some had old photographs to share. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">I quickly got inspired to re-create some of those dishes.</span></p>

		<p class="altp" id="p21"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Come November, Sasha’s beautiful work in the kitchen was done, and I started using the room immediately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">We’d sometimes come to the house on the weekends and I’d cook all day as if we lived there already. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Then we’d pack up all the food and head back home to the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">But a large family, no matter how much we love cooking, needs more than just a semifunctional kitchen, and Sasha’s pace left me wondering if we’d ever move in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">One day, Oddur drafted the men who were planting the olive trees outside to paint a few rooms so we could at least move in before Christmas.</span></p>
		<p class="altp"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Which is what we did, right on Christmas Eve. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Oddur drove the move; no matter what, he was going to spend Christmas in the new house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">So he dragged us and the dogs kicking and screaming in several car rides filled with presents and sheets and food until we had just enough stuff at No 1 rue de Loudenne to celebrate the holidays. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">You could call it adventurous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">It was definitely hectic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.6">I wasn’t really up for it, but I allowed it to happen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.7">And it was the best Christmas of my life.</span></p>
