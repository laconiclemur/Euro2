<p class="nonindent">Mel i mató translates to “honey and cheese” and refers to a local fresh cow’s or goat’s milk cheese. The dessert, originally from Catalonia, is nothing more than a round of that cheese with local honey drizzled on top. When both those products are perfect, the dessert is, too.</p>
<p class="indent">To capture the spirit of the unadulterated original in a more modern dessert, I turn goat cheese into panna cotta. Catalonia’s mató is nearly as soft and creamy as panna cotta, so it’s almost like making the cheese at home. While the custards and honey need nothing more, they do taste great with brandied peaches (<a href="sec84.xhtml#page245">here</a>).</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1¼ cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon powdered unsweetened gelatin</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3¼ cups heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup tightly packed fresh mint leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>10 ounces goat cheese, such as Capricho de Cabra</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅓ cup honey, plus more for drizzling</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅛ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">POUR THE MILK INTO A MEDIUM SAUCEPAN, THEN</span> sprinkle the gelatin evenly on top. Let stand for 10 minutes at room temperature to hydrate the gelatin. Fill a large bowl with ice and water.</p>
<p class="indent">Bring the cream and mint to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Remove and discard the mint leaves. Meanwhile, crumble the goat cheese into a large bowl.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat the milk and gelatin mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously to dissolve the gelatin. As soon as the gelatin dissolves, remove from the heat and stir in the honey and salt. Continue stirring while adding the warm minted cream in a steady stream. Pour the cream-milk mixture over the goat cheese and whisk until very smooth. Set over the bowl of ice and water and stir often until the mixture has thickened and an instant-read thermometer registers 50°F.</p>
<p class="indent">Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup or a bowl with a spout. Divide among eight 4-ounce ramekins. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When ready to serve, fill a small bowl with boiling water. Hold a ramekin in the water for 5 seconds, then lift out the ramekin and wipe the outside dry. Center a serving plate over the ramekin and invert the plate and ramekin together. Slowly lift off the ramekin. The panna cotta should slide out. If it doesn’t, loosen the edges by lightly tugging the edges in toward the center with damp fingers. Repeat with the remaining ramekins. Serve with the Brandied Peaches (<a href="sec84.xhtml#page245">here</a>, optional) and drizzle with honey.</p>
