<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">V</span>irtually every farmed duck in Gascony is a moulard, also variously known as a mullard, a mulard, or a mule duck. This sterile hybrid breed is not to be confused with the mallard, which is a wild waterfowl, the one with the iridescent green head. By contrast the moulard, a cross between a Pekin duck and a Muscovy duck, is usually white-feathered. Also, it has a knack for putting on weight quickly, making it ideal for gavage. These <i>canards gras</i> (fat ducks) have more of everything: more fat, more flesh, and—at least when compared with other kinds of domesticated ducks I’ve tasted—more flavor.</p>
<p class="indent">The magret, or breast, of a Gascon moulard, as I had already discovered firsthand, is an imposing specimen. (The word <i>magret</i>, somewhat deceivingly, comes from <i>maigre</i>, for lean or thin.) In addition to being topped with a prodigiously thick layer of fatty skin, the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44" title="44"/>moulard breast is roughly twice as big as that of a standard American Pekin, and thicker than a porterhouse. Its flesh is firm and deep red.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the tough legs, which must be slow-roasted, braised, or confited, the tender magret of a moulard takes beautifully to fast, high-heat cooking, as André Daguin so boldly demonstrated to his countrymen and to the world. What makes searing or grilling a moulard breast trickier than searing or grilling, say, a steak or a chop is—as might be guessed—the fat. Not only does it have a tendency to catch fire when the magret is laid over hot coals, but, when the breast is cooked in a skillet, the fat must be given time to gently render out. If a cook sears the skin side too quickly, not enough of that subcutaneous fat will liquefy and the skin will come out tough and chewy. Conversely, if the cook sears the magret too long, the skin will blacken and burn. When faced with this delicate proposition, and occasionally owing to matters of taste, some people strip away and discard the skin altogether before cooking. This, I put to you, is heresy. When a magret is cooked right, that crisp, thin, savory apron of skin is the dish’s raison d’être.</p>
<p class="indent">I took all these things into consideration as I prepared to welcome our very first dinner guest with a main course of pan-seared duck breasts in a port wine reduction. Our honored invitee? Nadine Cauzette, the widow from Viella whose home-cooking had fanned the flames of my Gascony-love a year and a half before. It had taken some cajoling to convince her to let me cook for her instead of the other way around, but I’d finally won her over. Michele, on learning that Nadine was coming for dinner, pointed out that a native-born Gascon with duck fat for blood who made her own confit and rillettes was perhaps not the ideal candidate on whom to test out a Gascon duck recipe. But the die was cast.</p>
<p class="indent">The magret preparation I’d chosen was from Wolfert’s book, which, given the dearth of clearly written, user-friendly Gascon <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45" title="45"/>cookbooks out there, I’d come to regard as something of a sacred text. I’d decided on the magret in port wine after much deliberation, having ultimately dispensed with the notion of making anything that required standing vigil over a three-day braise or pickling a calf’s tongue or deboning a pig’s foot. I’d flirted with the idea of doing a garbure, but Wolfert’s recipe for that elementary Gascon dish ran to three pages, was portioned for eight people, and called for more than twenty ingredients. The recipe for duck breasts called for seven. Salt and pepper were two of them. That was more my speed. I’d tackle a garbure soon enough, but magret would do nicely for now.</p>
<p class="indent">After mulling over the menu for a few days, I decided that to accompany the duck, I’d go for something just as straightforwardly Gascon: a <i>salade Gersoise</i>. This was the dish, also sometimes known more generically as a <i>salade Gasconne</i>, I’d been served on my first trip to Gascony years earlier: the one with the lettuce leaves topped with preserved duck products. It probably won’t come as a surprise that Gascons and North Americans have somewhat different expectations when they hear the word <i>salad</i>. It’s not that a Gascon wouldn’t recognize a plate of lettuce, sliced cucumbers, and tomato wedges as a salad—that genre of light side dish isn’t unknown in Gascony. It’s just that he’d probably be disappointed by it. For a Gascon, the word <i>salade</i> holds a certain promise. Within the wide salad rubric is the potential for many savory and often meaty things mingled together atop a layer of greenery. I had a cheap and delicious restaurant meal on my second Gascony trip that included a dish the menu referred to as a “<i>salade saison</i>.” The requisite bed of lettuce was almost completely obscured by tender hunks of brisket and boiled potatoes that had been bathed in broth. When I asked the proprietor what was seasonal about the salad, she told me the beef and potatoes were left over from the previous night’s special: pot-au-feu. Pot-au-feu is a winter dish. It was winter. <i>Voilà</i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46" title="46"/>The morning of the dinner with Nadine, I returned to the duck farm where I’d bought those first, ill-fated magrets. Ferme Tomasella sat at the end of an unpaved, tree-canopied road outside a neighboring village called Aignan. It was a typical Gascon farmstead: a cluster of prim, tile-roofed buildings gathered around a gravel courtyard. Some moulards were waddling about a grassy enclosure behind the main house. Next to the house was a tiny shop selling canned duck confit, jars of foie gras, and, in a cold case by the door, freshly butchered duck parts. As I’d done the first time, I rang a bell, and just as before, the woman in the blood-smeared smock emerged from behind the farmhouse to ring up my order. When I realized my wallet was empty—I’d forgotten to stop by the bank—she just made a note on a chit, handed it to me, and said I could pay on my next visit.</p>
<p class="spacebreak"><small>WE’D SAID SEVEN O’CLOCK; NADINE</small> arrived at a quarter to eight, not an excessive degree of tardiness for an evening engagement in Gascony. Nadine was unchanged since the last time I’d seen her: petite and broad-beamed, with a dimpled smile and sparkling eyes. She had the typical short, Gascon-lady hairdo, but her glasses were more old-fashioned than mod, with a cat-eye shape.</p>
<p class="indent">In keeping with what I would soon discover to be standard Gascon practice, Nadine had brought gifts. Lots of them. So many, in fact, that I had to help retrieve them from her car and then enlist Michele to create a sort of bucket brigade in the foyer, with Nadine handing a gift to me and me handing it to Michele to set down somewhere: a very tall potted orchid, a bottle of <i>vin de liqueur</i>, custom-made T-shirts emblazoned with the number 32, which is the postal code prefix for the Gers. For Charlotte she’d brought a French activity book, a bracelet-making kit, and a towering Styrofoam-core gum<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47" title="47"/>drop tree wrapped in cellophane and tied at the top with a pink ribbon.</p>
<p class="indent">“You really shouldn’t have,” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine flashed me the same bewildered look she’d given me the first time I’d told her that.</p>
<p class="indent">We went out on the balcony. I opened the vin de liqueur. As we sipped our <i>apéro</i>, Nadine talked at length about an old widow in Viella whom she’d been taking care of.</p>
<p class="indent">“She lived all alone, <i>la pauvre</i>,” said Nadine. “Her children were just waiting for her to die so they could sell the house. It’s been quite an ordeal.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s awful,” Michele said.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Bof</i>,” said Nadine with a flip of her hand. “Things are back to normal now.” She cleared her throat. “Well, not for her, <i>certainement</i>. She’s dead.”</p>
<p class="indent">I excused myself to start cooking the duck breasts, leaving Michele to manage as best she could with Nadine, who didn’t speak a word of English. Charlotte was busy inside making rubber bracelets.</p>
<p class="indent">The salads were already made, and they were a handsome sight: On each plate, I’d fanned out six fat-rimmed slices of cured duck breast on a bed of lettuce garnished with a quartered hard-boiled farm egg and tomato wedges. Then I’d scattered nubbins of foie gras on top and added pieces of duck gizzard, which I’d cut up and sautéed until they were crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. Duck gizzards, by the way, are a wonderful food, justly prized by the Gascons. The lobed gastric muscle is typically confited, often in the same kettle or crock as the other duck parts; confit duck gizzards are dense and smooth-textured, with a deep iron-oxide color and an even deeper, meaty flavor. One might characterize them as a sort of entry-level organ meat for novitiates.</p>
<p class="indent">I’d also prepped the magrets ahead of time, scoring the skin—<span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" title="48"/>crucial for hastening the fat-rendering—and seasoning the breasts with salt and pepper. Now I put them in a cold skillet, skin side down, and brought up the heat. Clear liquid fat began to accumulate around the breasts as they started to pop and sizzle. The fat began to rise up the sides of the pan. My God, there was so <i>much</i> of it. Not that I should have been surprised, but still, it was impressive. I flipped the breasts to cook the flesh side. Then I transferred the breasts to a cutting board, covered them, poured off the fat from the skillet, and made the sauce, which entailed reducing the port to a glaze, adding the juice of an orange, some stock, then some cream, and cooking it all down to a nice sheen—a by-the-book French pan reduction.</p>
<p class="indent">I let the duck rest some more while we ate our salads. Then I returned to the kitchen, sliced the magrets, and lay the slices on a platter. The flesh was reddish-pink and juicy-looking. The skin was golden. I strained the lustrous sauce over the duck and brought the platter to the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine clasped her hands together and said, “<i>Que c’est beau!</i>” I took a bite. The flesh was succulent, with a deep, beef-like flavor. The sauce was rich, concentrated, and tart-sweet, the way a duck-accompanying sauce should be. But the skin was a disappointment. It was thick and slightly rubbery instead of thin, crisp, and melting, an overcoat when a light jacket was called for. Michele and Charlotte were peeling it off and pushing it to the side of their plates. Though I’d followed the recipe to the letter, perhaps I had heated the pan too quickly, causing the skin to brown too fast, which in turn must have prompted me to flip the breast before enough of that abundant fat had liquefied. This, alas, was exactly the kind of mistake I was prone to making in the kitchen. I was impatient. I favored speed and high heat over gentle tending. I hadn’t managed the fat.</p>
<p class="indent">If Nadine was bothered by the chewy skin, she didn’t let on. She devoured her magret, fat and all, and served herself a second helping.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49" title="49"/>While Michele read Charlotte bedtime stories upstairs, Nadine told me about her late husband, a winegrower. I remembered seeing the vine rows behind Nadine’s house and, in her living room, a photo of a beaming man whom I presumed to be Monsieur Cauzette.</p>
<p class="indent">“During the <i>vendanges</i>,” she said, wiping some crumbs from the table into the palm of her hand, “I cooked for him and all his workers, lunch and dinner, every day, until the last grape was picked. <i>Mon dieu</i>, how those men could eat!”</p>
<p class="indent">She laughed, but she had tears in her eyes. This struck me as a peculiarly Gascon disposition: bemusement mingling comfortably with sadness.</p>
<p class="indent">“It was his work that killed him. In those days, they sprayed the vines with <i>n’importe quoi</i>. He came home every evening smelling of chemicals.”</p>
<p class="indent">She dusted the crumbs off her palm into her napkin. “But enough about all that.”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked if she lived alone.</p>
<p class="indent">“Hardly,” she said, her voice chirpy again. “My daughter and grandchildren are right next door, and I have a—well, a boarder, you could say. Jenny was in the state home where I used to work—with <i>les handicapés mentaux</i>—but I took her in. She helps me with the house and the cooking. She’s part of the family now.”</p>
<p class="indent">I poured us each a little more wine.</p>
<p class="indent">Nadine smiled and raised her glass.</p>
<p class="indent">I told Nadine how fondly I remembered the meal she’d cooked. Then I confessed to her my frustration with magret, explaining how I’d stuck to the recipe and still ended up with too much fatty skin. Nadine reached over and touched my hand—the best home cooking, she insisted, is not learned from a book.</p>
