<p class="nonindent">The gin and tonic is the cocktail of Spain. Spaniards take the G&amp;T very seriously. They’re always debating which tonic pairs best with which types of gin and how to garnish the drink. I’m not so fussy as to insist that you garnish with cucumber if you’re pouring Hendricks. I think you should use whichever gin you enjoy drinking most. (Félix and I like Plymouth or Millers.) As for the tonic, I suggest you look for Fever Tree, which has just the right balance of bitter and sweet. Once you gather your ingredients—ice, lemon, gin, and tonic—the real work begins. A good gin and tonic is all about execution. Here’s how Félix does it.</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.</strong> Chill the glass by filling it to the brim with ice and letting it sit until cold. We like to use a large balloon-shaped glass, such as a brandy glass.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>2.</strong> Remove a 6-inch strip of lemon peel with a sharp paring knife or vegetable peeler, curving around the fruit as needed to get it in a single strip. If there’s any white pith left on the back of the peel, shave it off with the knife.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>3.</strong> Toss out the ice in the glass.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>4.</strong> Squeeze the lemon peel over the glass so that the citrus oils spray into the glass, then run the peel around the rim.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>5.</strong> Fill the glass halfway with ice, preferably with 4 or 5 large cocktail ice cubes. Add the gin, then pour in chilled tonic over a spoon, so that it doesn’t foam up. (We use 1½ ounces gin to 4 ounces tonic, then adjust to taste.) Stir once or twice, but don’t over-stir or you’ll lose the bubbles and the aromatics.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>6.</strong> Drop the lemon peel in the glass and enjoy!</p>
