<p class="h2">Serves 4</p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>pinch of sea [kosher] salt flakes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 bunch of fresh basil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50g [½ cup] grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 carrot</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 courgette [zucchini]</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 red tomatoes (want to use yellow ones? Sounds a super idea to me)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 sprigs of fresh thyme</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 bay leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>about 2L [8½ cups] vegetable stock or water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100g [3½oz] frozen green beans</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100g [½ cup] frozen peas</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>400g (14oz) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</b></p>
<p class="tx2">To make the <i>pistou</i> (which is actually just pesto without any nuts), peel 1 of the garlic cloves, place it in a pestle and mortar or small food processor and add the salt. Crush the garlic and then add the basil leaves a few at a time, grinding them until you have a paste. Mix in the olive oil a little at a time until evenly combined, as if you were making mayonnaise, and finally add the grated cheese.</p>
<p class="tx2">Slice the remaining garlic clove. Cut the carrot, courgette and tomatoes into equal-sized small cubes, measuring less than 1cm [<img alt="images" src="images/three-eight.jpg"/>in].</p>
<p class="tx2">Put the carrot, sliced garlic, thyme and bay leaves in a large saucepan and pour in the vegetable stock or water. Leave to simmer over a medium heat until the stock or water has reduced by one third.</p>
<p class="tx2">After 10 minutes add the courgette, green beans and peas. After 20 minutes add the tomatoes and after 30 minutes the drained cannellini beans. Simmer until the beans are heated through. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</p>
<p class="tx2">A little piece of advice: avoid stirring as the vegetables will become mushy and you risk the soup becoming very cloudy. Also avoid adding seasoning too early – in other words before the cooking liquid has reduced – as the finished soup risks being much too salty.</p>
<p class="tx2">Spoon a good ladleful into each soup bowl and add a generous spoonful of <i>pistou</i> in the centre. Leave diners to swirl the two together as then they’ll feel they’ve had a hand in making the soup (which, between ourselves, isn’t the case as you’re the chef).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc2"><b>And finally</b></p>
<p class="txc"><b>By adding some small pasta shapes to the soup (orzo, elbow, etc), you can turn it into a complete meal.</b></p>

<p class="h2">Serves 4</p> 
<p class="h3"><span class="un">For the bouillon</span></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 large yellow or white onions, unpeeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5-cm [2-in] piece of root ginger, unpeeled and roughly sliced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp oil</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>2 beef marrow bones (if unavailable, a chicken carcass would work)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 beef stock cube, crumbled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 leek, trimmed and cut into 5-cm [2-in] lengths</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>3 large pinches of five-spice powder (or, if you’re feeling adventurous, roast 4 whole cloves with 2 star anise, 2 cinnamon sticks and 2 tsp coriander seeds and grind together to make your own)</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>2 carrots</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 celery stick</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 vermicelli rice noodle nests</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>400g [14oz] beef carpaccio or, if you’re looking for a challenge, a piece of steak cut into wafer-thin slices (the freezer is your friend here as, if the steak is really cold, it will be easier to slice very finely)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Thai basil or ordinary basil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Coriander [cilantro]</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Cut the onions in half and grill [broil] them, cut side down, with the ginger, until nicely charred but not completely black – grilling the onions and ginger will add colour to the stock. If you have a gas cooker you can do this over a flame on the hob. But beware: flames + fingers = problems, somewhere I don’t want to go.</p>
<p class="tx2">Heat the oil in a large, deep saucepan, season the minced beef with salt and pepper and sear it over a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the marrow bones (or chicken carcass), the stock cube, onion halves, ginger, leeks, fish sauce, thyme and bay leaves.</p>
<p class="tx2">Pour in 3 litres [3 quarts] of water, bring to the boil, lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx2">To serve, use a speed [swivel] peeler to shave the carrots and celery into thin strips and then cut these into fine matchsticks (about 10cm [4in] long).</p>
<p class="tx2">Put a vermicelli nest in each serving bowl and strain the bouillon into the bowls. If you’ve used beef bones, scoop out the marrow from the bones into the bowls and add the leeks as well.</p>
<p class="tx2">Garnish with slices of raw beef and the carrot and celery shavings. Finish with the basil and coriander – and slurp.</p>

<p class="txc"><b>Pot-au-feu is a richly flavoured clear bouillon in which different vegetables and chunks of meltingly tender beef gently float.

<div class="ser"><img alt="images" src="images/img-29-1.jpg"/></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc"><b>I have a confession to make: I just love instant ramen. I know that sounds terrible, especially coming from someone who tells people what – and what not – to eat and who tries (not always successfully, though) to set an example. The truth is, I can’t help it. I just enjoy the savoury kick I get every time I split open a pack of noodles.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tx2">For the ultimate experience, it is necessary to follow the five successive Japanese gates called torii. Torii, <img alt="images" class="middle" src="images/img-29-2.jpg"/>, literally means a dwelling place for birds and is pronounced <i>to.ri.i</i> in Japanese. This traditional gate is most commonly found at the entrance to a Shinto shrine, or within it, where it symbolizes the transition from the mundane to the sacred.</p> 
<p class="h2">The gate of the Broth – the foundation</p>
<p class="tx2">Packed with umami, it can be rich or light, cloudy or clear, and pork-, chicken- or seafood-based, or even made with a combination of them. It’s often combined with dashi, a broth made from dried, smoked bonito flakes and sea kelp.</p> 
<p class="h2">The gate of the Noodles – the structure</p>
<p class="tx2">Without noodles, it’s not ramen. They are alkaline noodles, or to be more precise, often made from wheat flour with a low hydration content.</p> 
<p class="h2">The gate of the Toppings – the texture</p>
<p class="tx2"><i>Chasu</i> braised pork, marinated soft-boiled egg (<i>ajitsuke tamago)</i>, spring onions [scallions], nori seaweed, <i>menma</i> fermented bamboo shoots and even sweet corn. They bring colour and different textures to the soup.</p> 
<p class="h2">The gate of <i>Tare</i> – the salt</p>
<p class="tx2">The flavouring base which is usually one of the following: <i>shio</i> (salt), <i>shoyu</i> (soy sauce) or <i>miso</i> (fermented soya bean paste).</p> 
<p class="h2">The gate of Aroma Oil – the fat</p>
<p class="tx2">This is picked up by the noodles as you slurp them. Common varieties of infused oil are black garlic oil, sesame oil, onion oil… Butter also works very well (I am French, so what do you expect…?).</p>
<p class="tx2">Once you’ve mastered the theory, you must practise and there is no better way to do this than to get out there and eat some really good ramen. I’d suggest you at least try:</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Tokyo ramen</b> – pork and chicken broth + dashi + curly noodles. Classic.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Sapporo miso ramen</b> – thick noodles + <i>akamiso</i> + cabbage, sweet corn and minced pork. Butter is the icing on its cake.</p>
<p class="tx2"><b>Hakata <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen</b> – cloudy and fatty broth made from pork bones, sesame and black garlic oil. Intensely flavoured.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>2 sticks of celery</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>chopped fresh dill or thyme leaves</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Blitz the bread in a food processor until turned into fine crumbs – you will need 125g [12/3 cups]. Set aside.</p>
<p class="tx2">Heat the oil over a medium-low heat in a frying pan [skillet], add the chopped onion and the chicken bones and skin and fry gently for 10–15 minutes, stirring from time to time. Pass the contents of the pan through a fine strainer to separate the oil from the other ingredients, reserving the oil.</p>
<p class="tx2">Put the eggs, breadcrumbs, baking powder, the drained oil infused with the onion and chicken and 4 tablespoons of the chicken stock into a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and mix everything together thoroughly. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>100–150g [1–1½ cups] grated hard cheese (Comté, strong Cheddar)</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Put a large, heavy-based saucepan over a medium-low heat, add the butter and oil and then the onions. Season with salt and add the sugar. Leave to cook for 30 minutes, stirring from time to time – the onions must be golden brown.</p>
<p class="tx2">Pour in the wine, then the cognac, and flambé (watch out for the flames when doing this). When the flames have died down, scrape the bottom of the saucepan with a wooden spoon to incorporate all the cooking juices sticking to it. Stir in the flour – this will give the soup a rich, syrupy consistency.</p>

<p class="tx2">Grill [broil] until the cheese bubbles and turns a nice golden brown before placing the dish triumphantly in the centre of the table. The heat and steam are fierce enough to burn the table cloth, which admittedly would add considerably to the drama, but if you’re attached to the cloth, put a trivet or pot stand on the table first.</p>
