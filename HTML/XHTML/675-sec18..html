<p class="nonindent">Sidrerías, cider bars, can be found all over the Asturias region, where dry hard apple cider is produced. I love sitting at the bar and watching the servers lift the cider high to pour, intentionally letting it spill all over the floor. That traditional decanting is as fascinating as the unique fruity, funky taste of the cider. In Asturias, it’s cooked into a chorizo dish, which I took a step further with the addition of clams and apples. Clams bring a sea-saltiness to the broth, while apples become infused with the cider and add a crunchy sweetness to each bite.</p>
<p class="indent">Be sure to use a dry cider with natural carbonation, not the sparkly sweet stuff we’re used to in America. I like the Spanish brands Trabanco and Castañon, but what I really love is the surge in craft hard cider in Asheville and all across the United States. Experiment with local dry ciders and buy an extra bottle or two to sip with this dish.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>50 littleneck clams (about 7½ pounds)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup dry Spanish hard cider</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup finely diced peeled sweet-tart apple, preferably Honeycrisp</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 ounces Spanish chorizo, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>minced shallot</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 thyme sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">CLEAN THE CLAMS WELL BY RINSING AND</span> scrubbing them under cold water. throw out any with open, broken, or cracked shells.</p>
<p class="indent">Bring the cider to a simmer in a small saucepan, remove from the heat, and add the apple to the hot cider.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat the oil in a large lidded saucepot over medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring, until it begins to turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the shallot, thyme, cinnamon, and bay leaf. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute more. Add the butter and clams to the pot, then strain the cider into the pot, reserving the apple in the strainer.</p>
<p class="indent">Raise the heat to medium-high, cover, and bring to a boil. Stir well and reduce the heat to maintain a strong simmer. After 2 minutes, check for any open clams. Pull any that have opened with tongs and place in serving bowls. Stir, and cover again. Keep checking every minute or so, pulling the clams immediately after they open; this will prevent overcooking them.</p>
<p class="indent">Once all the clams are in the serving bowls, raise the heat to high and boil the sauce for 1 minute to allow the flavors to develop. Stir in the parsley. There is no salt in this recipe because the natural saltiness of the clams, chorizo, and cider eliminates the need for it. Taste the sauce and add a little salt if you feel it needs it. Discard the thyme, cinnamon, bay leaf, and any clams that don’t open.</p>
<p class="indent">Pour the sauce over the clams, evenly scraping the chorizo and parsley over all of them. Top with the reserved apple and serve immediately with crusty toasted bread.</p>
