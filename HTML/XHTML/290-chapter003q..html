<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Artichokes are my favorite vegetable in the entire world, and not everyone knows that you can eat them raw. A lesson in simplicity, this salad is emblematic of the phrase “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.” Here, thinly sliced artichokes are dressed only with olive oil and fresh lemon juice and adorned with Parmigiano-Reggiano and nothing else. It’s simple and perfect.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">8 small artichokes</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 lemons</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 ounces shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Working with one</strong> artichoke at a time, hold on to the stem of the artichoke and remove the dark green outer leaves, one by one, to reveal the tender yellow leaves. Turn the artichoke around and, while holding on to the yellow leaves, use a potato peeler to clean away the tough, dark green skin from the stem. Halve one of the lemons and rub each of the artichokes with the cut side of one of the lemon halves. Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in the remaining juice from the lemon half as well as the juice from the other lemon half. You can drop the squeezed lemon halves right into the water too.</p>
<p>Cut each artichoke in half lengthwise and, using a teaspoon, remove and discard the hairy choke. Slice each cleaned artichoke lengthwise as thinly as possible using a mandoline or a very sharp chef’s knife. Transfer the sliced artichokes to the bowl of water with lemon. The artichokes can be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to eat, pat the artichoke slices dry on paper towels and place them in a salad bowl. Dress them with a healthy pour of olive oil (3 or 4 tablespoons) and squeeze over the juice from the remaining lemon, discarding the seeds. Season the artichokes to taste with a healthy pinch of salt and scatter over the shaved cheese. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">The most understated dish in the world.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 large artichokes</p>
<p class="ingredient">Mayonnaise (<a href="chapter008d.xhtml#page-264m">here</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Using a pair</strong> of scissors, trim the sharp thorn from the tip of each leaf on each artichoke. Using a serrated knife, remove 2 inches from the crown. If needed, trim the stem back so each artichoke can balance in a serving bowl.</p>
<p>Place the artichokes in a steamer, cover, and cook until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. The artichokes may also be boiled in a large covered pot with ample salted water to cover them until done. Remove with a slotted spoon.</p>
<p>Serve the artichokes warm or chilled and enjoy with plenty of homemade mayonnaise. Dip each leaf into a bowl of the mayonnaise and scrape the flesh off the leaf with your teeth, creating a tall pile of spent leaves on a side plate as you go. When you reach the center of the artichoke, discard the fibrous choke and enjoy the incomparable heart. Remember to provide extra plates for the discarded leaves.</p></div>
