<p class="nonindent">Flan is the classic Spanish dessert found all over the country. This recipe is unadulterated because I love the pure, simple flavor of eggs with milk and sugar. I add just a bit of lemon peel to give the custard more complexity and a bright citrus note.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>2½ cups granulated sugar, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 strips lemon zest, removed with a vegetable peeler</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>⅛ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large egg yolks</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325°F. PLACE A 9- BY 5- BY</span> 4-inch loaf pan inside a 9- by 13-inch baking dish or pan. Bring a large kettle or pot of water to a boil.</p>
<p class="indent">Stir 1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until well combined. Cook without stirring, but brush any sugar crystals off the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Swirl the pan occasionally to caramelize evenly and cook until deep amber in color. Immediately pour into the loaf pan and tilt the pan to evenly coat the bottom and a few inches up the sides.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bring the milk, lemon zest, salt, and ¾ cup sugar to a simmer in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and yolks with the remaining ¾ cup sugar in a large bowl. Continue whisking while adding the hot milk mixture in a slow, steady stream. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup or bowl with a spout. Skim any foam on the surface. Pour into the caramel-lined loaf pan. The mixture will come all the way to the top. Very carefully place the full pan inside the empty baking dish in the oven, then carefully pour the boiling water into the baking dish so that it comes halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until just set, but still slightly wobbly in the center, about 1 hour and 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Carefully remove the flan from the water and cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate uncovered until cold and set, at least 8 hours or up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To unmold, run a sharp knife around the edges. Center a serving plate on top of the pan and carefully and quickly flip the pan and plate together. Lift off the pan and let the caramel run all over the top.</p>
