<p class="nonindent">At tapas bars all over Spain, cold wedges of this tart are served with chilled lager. The secret to the tart’s richness is using the oil from the filling’s sofrito in the dough. Yes, it is a lot of oil, but it infuses the dough with sweetness and keeps it tender. It also makes the dough easy to roll and shape. You don’t even have to worry about crimping the edges prettily. The golden hue from baking compensates for any imperfections.</p>
<p class="indent">This tart makes for an impressive make-ahead lunch. You want to serve it at room temperature, not hot, and it tastes even richer after it’s sat in the refrigerator overnight. Just bring it back to room temperature before serving with a salad or <a href="sec06.xhtml#page39">Gazpacho</a>.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large onion, very thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and very thinly sliced</strong></p>

<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup canned crushed San Marzano tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 (6-ounce) jar tuna packed in olive oil, drained and shredded (1 cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons thinly sliced pitted Kalamata olives</strong></p>

<p class="side-text"><strong>3 cups all-purpose flour</strong></p>

<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon heavy cream</strong></p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE FILLING, START BY MAKING THE</span> sofrito. Combine the oil and onion in a large skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is glassy, about 10 minutes. Add the bell pepper and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are very soft, about 20 minutes. If the vegetables start to brown, lower the heat. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a liquid measuring cup and pour the vegetables into the strainer. Let sit until the oil and juices drain out, then return the vegetables to the pan and reserve the oil.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the tomatoes to the onion mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, but the mixture isn’t dry, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tuna, olives, and 1½ teaspoons salt. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the dough, see if you have ¾ cup sofrito oil in your measuring cup. If not, add enough olive oil to make up the difference. Pulse the flour, yeast, and 2¼ teaspoons salt in a food processor until well-mixed. Add the sofrito oil and ½ cup water. Process until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a work surface, knead a couple of times, then roll it into a ball. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, fill a small bowl with ice and water. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add 1 egg and cook for 12 minutes. Transfer to the ice bath. When cool, peel and dice. Beat the remaining egg with the cream in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Divide the dough in half and roll each on a sheet of parchment paper into a 13-inch round (⅛-inch thick). Slide one round of dough on the parchment onto a rimless cookie sheet. Spread the sofrito filling evenly over the dough, leaving a ¾-inch rim. Sprinkle the hard-boiled egg <a id="page220"/>evenly on top. Pat the egg into the filling to make sure there are no air pockets in the filling. Lift the other dough round using the parchment paper and flip it over the filling, aligning its edges with the bottom dough. Peel off the top parchment. Press the edges together, then seal by holding a section of the top and bottom edges together between your thumb and forefinger and folding it over so the bottom comes up over the top. Press the folded-over edge to seal. Repeat around the rest of the rim.</p>
<p class="indent">Brush the beaten egg all over the top of the empanada. Use a sharp knife to cut a 1-inch X in the center of the empanada, then cut three 1-inch long air vents around the center. Firmly press down the dough to remove any air pockets. Cut the air vents open again if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool on the pan on a wire rack to serve warm or room temperature.</p>
<p class="nonindent">A completely cooled empanada can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight. Let stand at room temperature to take the chill off before serving.</p>
