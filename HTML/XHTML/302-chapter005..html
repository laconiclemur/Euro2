<p class="center"><em>L’heure de l’apéro</em> is a local tradition in France as well as the States. We call it happy hour, the most relaxing part of the day. When your day is done and you look forward to a pleasurable meal, you will find <em>l’apéritif</em> a refreshing interlude.</p>
<p class="center1">Venice, Italy, is one of my favorite places to enjoy an <em>aperitivo</em> whether I am standing at the workingman’s Scavone, or seated at the bar in the elegant Gritti Palace on the Grand Canal. Both are equally delicious and delightful. The bar at the Gritti is only four feet long, but I consider it the cocktail altar. I worshiped each evening with a negroni. I was presented with <em>salatini,</em> little salty snacks, like cheesy <em>gougères,</em> savory chicken liver toasts, and generous bowls of macadamia nuts. I appreciated the detail it took to serve a simple Campari and soda, from silver trays to folded napkins. <em>Aperitivo</em> translates to “appetite stimulant,” and even though the snacks were intended as a prelude to dinner, we’d make a meal out of them and toast our handsome drinks.</p>
<p class="center1">To this day, the feeling I had there—a combination of feeling taken care of, of the atmosphere being so warm that it’s easy to connect with whomever you’re with, of feeling like simple things can be terrifically special—is what I try to re-create every evening at Buvette.</p>
<p class="center1">During the interim long after lunch, but just before dinner, when the day needs its edge taken off and you’re beginning to get hungry, a cocktail and a small amount of food is in order. The following pages include not only my favorite drinks, but also ideas and advice for setting up a bar and recipes for my most beloved “bar snacks,” including homemade potato chips, all sorts of <em>tartinettes</em> using easy walnut pesto, and classic charcuterie like country-style pâté that can be made ahead and served on toast alongside a bowl of cornichons. Cheers!</p>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">I used to sit at the counter between lunch and dinner service when I lived in Italy, and turn the pages of old cookbooks, coveting all of the traditional dishes. <em>Bagna cauda,</em> or “warm bath,” is a classic preparation of three prized ingredients: olive oil, garlic, and anchovies. While it’s great for any crunchy vegetable, including sliced fennel and scallions, the most classic accompaniment is spicy radishes. I like thin, white-tipped French breakfast radishes for this, but normal ones are perfect too.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES ½ CUP BAGNA CAUDA; ENOUGH FOR RADISHES FOR 4 PEOPLE]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 large bunch breakfast radishes, cut in half lengthwise</p>
<p class="ingredient">6 garlic cloves, crushed (don’t even bother to peel them)</p>
<p class="ingredient">A dozen high-quality, fat anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place the radishes</strong> in ice-cold water while you prepare the bagna cauda. This will help them be as crisp as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, place the garlic, anchovies, salt, and olive oil in a small saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring every so often, until the anchovies have dissolved into the oil and the garlic is a little bit softened, about 10 minutes. Be sure to keep the heat low enough that the garlic does not threaten to burn. Remove the bagna cauda from the heat.</p>
<p>Drain and dry the radishes and serve drizzled generously with the bagna cauda.</p></div>
