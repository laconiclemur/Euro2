<p class="C3608">We cook meat. We braise it and roast it and grill it. We simmer juicy pork meatballs and sweet red shrimp together into a succulent surf and turf. We slather big Basque-style ribeyes with smoky pimentón butter and stew tender pork cheeks with earthy chanterelles. Pork belly gets rolled up into a meaty roast and browned to a glassy crisp. Chicken and prunes are stewed to sticky fall-off-the-bone satisfaction. Our Spanish culinary heritage provides endless inspiration for hearty and homey meat and poultry dishes. We can’t bring Ribera del Duero’s milk-fed lamb or Segovia’s suckling pig to Manhattan, but we can work with the same passion for product and careful attention to preparation that made those classics legendary.</p>

<p class="C3675">Silky mushrooms are draped over tender meatballs alongside succulent giant red shrimp in this hearty stew that celebrates Catalonia’s <em>mar i muntanya</em> (sea and mountain) tradition. The Catalonian coast is only an hour’s drive away from some of the highest peaks in the Pyrenees, so it’s no wonder that the geographic proximity of the two is reflected in a culinary tradition that marries mountain and sea. This stew is arguably one of the most deeply satisfying examples of Catalonian “surf ’n’ turf.”</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4 to 6</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">2 hours</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">2½ hours</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1½ cups ½ inch-cubes of country bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1½ pounds ground pork (20 percent fat)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped and kept separately</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>canola or blended canola-olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>12 carabineiros shrimp or other jumbo head-on shrimp or crayfish (1 pound)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 quarts <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#page_268">Chicken Stock</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ ounce dried black trumpet mushrooms or equivalent of other wild mushrooms</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 cups boiling water</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ white onion, very finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 small carrots, peeled and diced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>¼ cup canned tomato sauce</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#page_274">Picada</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">To make the meatballs, put the bread in a large bowl and pour the milk over it to soak. Let stand until very soft. Mash the bread with a fork until it’s in bits. Pour out any excess milk. Add the pork, 2 of the chopped garlic cloves, and the parsley, egg, and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until everything is evenly distributed, but avoid overworking or compacting the mixture too much.</p>
<p class="C3636">Put the flour in a shallow dish. Lightly wet or oil your hands and pinch off enough of the meat mixture to roll into a 2-inch ball. Roll this in the flour to coat and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture and flour, wetting or oiling your hands as necessary to roll smooth balls. You should have about 18–20 pork meatballs.</p>
<p class="C3636">Fill a large saucepan with canola oil to a depth of ½ inch. Heat over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Add just enough balls to fit in a single layer without crowding. Cook, carefully turning occasionally when a golden brown crust forms, about 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining meatballs. Pour out the oil and reserve for another use; reserve the saucepan.</p>
<p class="C3636">To make the shrimp stock, separate the shrimp heads from the tails and peel and devein the tails. Reserve all the heads and shells. Refrigerate 6 heads to reserve for serving; refrigerate the prepared shrimp tails until you’re ready to cook them.</p>
<p class="C3636">Using the saucepan previously used for cooking the meatballs, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat. Add the shrimp heads and shells and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring and smashing the heads and shells with a slotted spoon to release their juices, until caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 5 minutes, then reduce it further to low heat to keep the mixture just warm.</p>
<p class="C3636">Put the dried mushrooms in a medium bowl. Pour enough boiling water over them to cover. Let stand until softened, about 15 minutes, then drain.</p>
<p class="C3636"><span id="page_197">Meanwhile,</span> combine the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and remaining chopped garlic in a Dutch oven or large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-low heat until the garlic is golden and softened, about 1 minute. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until just softened, about 4 minutes. Add the carrots, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are caramelized, about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the tomato sauce and cook, stirring often, until it is reduced to a thick paste and is caramelized brown, about 6 minutes. Add the wine and bring to the boil. Boil until the sauce is thick and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Add the meatballs and any accumulated juices. Strain the hot shrimp stock into the Dutch oven to cover the meatballs, pressing on the shells to extract as much liquid as possible. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Drain the mushrooms and stir into the mixture. Season to taste with salt. Gently fold in the picada until well mixed. Season the reserved shrimp tails and heads and tuck them into the mixture. Remove from the heat and let stand until the residual heat gently cooks through the shrimp tails and heads, about 4 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_113">Roasted</span> Pork Belly with Swiss Chard and Raisin Sauce</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">You’ll get “oohs” and “aahs” for both the presentation and succulent flavor of this rolled pork belly roast. The skin on the outside crisps into a <em>chicharrón</em> crunch that conceals an interior of juicy marbled meat. We temper the delicate richness of it all with pickled chard stems, lemony raisin sauce, and wilted greens. Get it all in one perfect bite—heaven.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">12 to 14</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4 hours, plus curing and pickling</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>3 bunches Swiss chard, each about ¾ pound, leaves cut off stems</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong><a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#id_6">Pickling Liquid</a></strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 cups kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 cups sugar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup sweet paprika (not smoked)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ whole boneless skin-on pork belly (7–8 pounds)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 cup golden raisins</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Cut the Swiss chard stems crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices. Place in a jar or other airtight container. Bring the pickling liquid to a boil. Pour over the stems and seal the jar. Refrigerate overnight. Slice the Swiss chard leaves and refrigerate them separately as well.</p>
<p class="C3636">Mix the salt, sugar, and paprika in a small bowl to make a cure. Sprinkle half in the bottom of a container that will fit the pork belly snugly. Place the meat on top, then cover with the remaining cure mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.</p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 325ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Rinse the cure off the pork and pat the pork dry. Use a sharp knife to score the meat side (i.e. not the fat side) of the pork with lines ½-inch deep and 2 inches apart going the long way on the belly.</p>
<p class="C3636">With a long edge of the belly facing you, roll the meat up tightly. Tie the roll with kitchen twine every ½ inch. Place on a wire rack fitted into a half sheet pan.</p>
<p class="C3636">Bake until the fat renders and the skin is brown, about 2½ hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 145ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Raise the oven temperature to 500ºF. Roast until the skin is dark brown, dry, and crisp, about 30 minutes, checking at 15-minute intervals. Remove from the oven and let rest for at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">While the pork rests, make the sauce and greens. Bring 1 cup water to the boil in a small saucepan. Put the raisins in a blender and pour the boiling water over them. Purée until very smooth. Add the lemon juice and purée again. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="C3636">Combine the oil and garlic in a large skillet. Cook over high heat, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant and golden, about 1 minute. Add the Swiss chard leaves and season with salt. Cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the sherry vinegar and mix well, then remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="C3636">Snip the kitchen twine off the pork and discard. Cut the pork into 1-inch chunks and divide among serving plates. Drain the Swiss chard stems. Serve the pork with the raisin sauce, pickled Swiss chard stems, and wilted Swiss chard greens.</p>

<p class="C3675">We love serving big platters for parties to share. When family and friends are all scooping out of a communal dish, they lean in a little more, share more openly, laugh louder, and have more fun. This stew is a favorite for just that reason. The pork cheeks braise to a melt-in-your-mouth silkiness alongside cabbage and chanterelles that wilt to just-tender in the mustard wine sauce. It’s the perfect hearty dish to get people talking at winter holiday gatherings.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4 to 6</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">20 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">3 hours</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 pound pork cheeks, fat trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 small onion, quartered</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large carrot, cut into 4 pieces</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large celery stalk, cut into 4 pieces</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 unpeeled garlic cloves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>5 ounces chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3 sprigs of tarragon</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons wholegrain mustard</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 375ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Season the pork generously with salt and pepper. Put the pork cheeks, onion, carrot, celery, garlic, wine, and 3 cups water in a wide, shallow pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, transfer to the oven, and bake for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="C3636">When the cheeks are almost done, heat a grill to high or turn a burner on a gas range to high. Put the cabbage on a rack over the flame and cook, turning, until nicely charred, about 5 minutes. Cut the cabbage in half.</p>
<p class="C3636">Remove the pot from the oven. Transfer the cheeks to a dish. Strain the pan juices through a fine-mesh sieve; discard the solids. Return the cheeks and strained sauce to the pot. Add the cabbage, chanterelles, and tarragon. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="C3636">Top with the mustard and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_115">Lamb</span> Loin Roast with Spring Vegetables and Mint</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">Two Catalan classics—roasted lamb and braised fava beans—come together in this spring feast. We’ve taken a fresh approach to the traditional pairing, combining French technique with New York farm-to-table sensibilities. Garlic-herb butter rolled into a caramelized lamb roast infuses the meat with flavor from the inside out, while asparagus and favas take a quick turn in hot skillet to stay fresh and crisp.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4 to 6</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">2¾ hours, plus overnight marinating</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1½ cups shucked fava beans (or use snow peas, English [garden] peas, or green beans)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 whole lamb loin, excess fat and bone removed (2 pounds)</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 garlic cloves, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 sprig of rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 sprig of thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>8 scallions, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 bunch of asparagus, trimmed and cut into 3-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 lemon, zest and juice</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 ounce spreadable sheep’s milk cheese, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Fill a medium bowl with ice and water. Add the fava beans to the boiling water and cook until bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain and immediately transfer to the ice water. When cool, drain again, peel off the skins and discard.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and put skin-side down in the skillet. Sear until the skin is deeply caramelized, about 5 minutes. Turn the lamb over and cook for 3–4 minutes more. Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. Use a spoon to continually baste the lamb with the butter mixture for 4 minutes. Transfer the lamb to a rack and let rest for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat a grill to high, or turn a burner on a gas range to high. Put the scallions on a rack over the flame and cook, turning, until nicely charred, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat. Add the asparagus, season with salt, and cook, stirring, until bright green and crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add the fava beans, stir well, and remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then toss with ½ teaspoon lemon juice, charred scallions, and mint leaves.</p>
<p class="C3636">After the lamb has rested, cut into slices and divide among serving plates, along with the vegetables. Scatter the cheese on top and garnish with mint leaves. Sprinkle the lemon zest on top and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tip:</em></strong> <em>To trim asparagus—removing the lower, fibrous part of the stalk—hold the stalk near the base with one hand, then use the other hand to bend the stalk over; it will snap naturally about 3 inches above the base, which can then be discarded.</em></p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_116">Seared</span> Hanger Steak with “Mojo Verde”</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">Spain’s Canary Islands sit just west of Africa in the path of the heavy trade winds that shape Morocco’s western Sahara. The proximity of North Africa shows in the cuisine of the volcanic islands where local marinades, “mojos,” laced with heady spices, flavor meats and stews. The garlicky green version we use here can bring any meat dish to life but goes particularly well with a classic combination of seared steak, potatoes, and peppers (we, of course, use shishitos for an extra bite).</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">1 or 2</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">45 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">1 hour</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 (8-ounce) hanger steak</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 garlic cloves, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 sprigs of rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 sprigs of thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 fingerling potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>10 Padrón or shishito peppers</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ cup Mojo Verde (recipe follows), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Rub a thin coating of oil all over the steak and then rub with half of the crushed garlic and 1 sprig each of rosemary and thyme. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature or refrigerate overnight. If chilled, let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.</p>
<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 500ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Place the potatoes, remaining garlic, rosemary, and thyme in a small saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch and generously salt the water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until a cake tester or knife pierces a potato easily. Drain well; discard the garlic and herbs. When cool enough to handle, halve each potato lengthwise.</p>
<p class="C3636">Scrape the garlic and herbs off the steak and discard. Generously season the steak all over with salt. Let stand for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat a large, heavy ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add the steak and cook until well seared, 3–4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven and roast for 5 minutes for medium-rare. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Coat with oil, then add the potatoes in a single layer cut sides down. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the bottoms are lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Scatter the peppers around the potatoes. Generously drizzle the peppers with oil and season with salt. Cook for 2 minutes, carefully but thoroughly toss everything in the pan, and cook for 2 minutes more. The potatoes should be dark brown and the peppers should be blistered and soft. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</p>
<p class="C3636">Generously season the steak with pepper. Cut into slices and serve with the potatoes, peppers, and mojo verde.</p>
<p class="C3690"><strong><em>Chef’s tips:</em></strong> <em>Hanger steak is an especially juicy cut, but you can also make this with skirt steak if you like.</em></p>
<p class="C3691"><em>Whichever cut you use, you can grill the meat instead of searing and roasting it. Cook the steak on a charcoal or gas grill over medium-high heat for about 6 minutes a side, then let it rest for 5 minutes.</em></p>

<p class="C3675">Our <a class="RED" href="14_Bases.xhtml#id_9">Spiced Butter</a> drizzled over this steak is outstanding. Clarified, so it’s pure savory fat without the sweet cream of dairy, the hot butter sizzles the just-right balance of sweet paprika to hot smoky pimentón. It’s a super-easy five-ingredient finish that takes the Basque classic of grilled ribeye over the top. To turn this meaty main into a one-dish meal, we serve it alongside a potato salad freshened up with tender green beans and crunchy red onion and celery.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_118">Braised</span> Oxtails with Apricots</strong></p>
<p class="C3675">The Moorish influences in the stunning Andalusían city of Cordoba extend beyond the ornate architecture to the cuisine. Beef reigns here. Cattle are raised on ranches in the surrounding countryside. Inspired by Cordoba’s signature braised oxtail and the common use of apricots in Moorish cooking, we created this unctuous stew that combines the two. We braise the oxtails in red wine, tomatoes, and apricots until they collapse at the touch of a fork. The rich red wine and apricot gravy imparts a sweet, fruity tang to the tender meat.</p>

<p class="C3639"><strong>1 cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3½ pounds oxtail, each piece cut 2–3 inches thick</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ large white Spanish onion, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>½ head garlic, sliced crosswise through the “equator”</strong></p>

<p class="C3638"><strong>2 sprigs of thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tomatoes, cut into eighths</strong></p>

<p class="C3636">Preheat the oven to 350ºF.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat the oil in a very large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over high heat until very hot. Generously season the oxtail with salt and pepper.

<p class="C3636">Remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, garlic, celery, carrot, leek, rosemary, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables take on color, about 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the tomatoes and apricots and stir well. Return the oxtail, along with any accumulated juices, to the skillet, tucking the meat into the vegetables. Add the wine, bring to a boil over high heat, and boil until reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and turn the pieces of oxtail over. Continue simmering for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, then cover and transfer to the oven. Bake until the meat is very tender and almost falling off the bone, about 2½–3 hours.</p>
<p class="C3636">Transfer the oxtail to a serving dish. If the sauce is too thin, bring to a boil over medium heat. Simmer until reduced and thickened. Spoon over the oxtail and serve hot.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_119">Wine-</span>Braised Chicken with Prunes and Cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Marc met fellow Catalonian chef Alex Gares when the two cooked together at El Bulli, and they’ve remained close friends across continents and time. When Marc was creating this classic chicken braise for the book, Alex happened to be staying with him on a New York City vacation and helped with the recipe development. At every step of the process, they argued about the “right” way to do it, each drawing from memories of their grandmothers’ versions. They debated how long to brown the chicken, how to cut the onions, whether to leave the garlic peels on, how many prunes to add and at what stage, ditto the wine and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="C3609">That spirit lies at the heart of Spain’s food culture: every dish is worth a fight. Even after years of professional training, the two highly accomplished chefs hold views on how a classic should be done based on their childhood memories. The beauty of this passion is the open give-and-take in the kitchen. Marc let Alex simmer the chicken longer than he would have; Alex conceded to Marc’s adding more prunes than he prefers.</p>
<p class="C3637">The result is a dish even better than the memories. Super simple and comforting, the prunes and caramelized onions melt into the cinnamon-laced wine sauce, perfect for soaking into good bread. And the garlic? The creamy-as-butter cloves end up soft enough to smear onto bread and all over the chicken too.</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Serves</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">4 to 6</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">15 minutes</p>
<p class="C3668"><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p class="C3632">2¾ hours</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>1 whole (3-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 large white Spanish onions, quartered and cut into ½-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>10 large garlic cloves with skins left on</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1¼</strong> <strong>cups pitted prunes</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1½ cups dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 cinnamon sticks</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">Generously season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, skin side down, in a single layer. Cook until the skin is nicely browned and crisp, about 12 minutes. Flip all the pieces and cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.</p>
<p class="C3636">Add the onions and garlic to the hot pan and season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are deeply caramelized and brown, about 20 minutes. Add the prunes, wine, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil, then return the chicken to the pan, skin side up, along with any accumulated juices. Add 1 cup water.</p>
<p class="C3636">Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the chicken is very tender, turning the pieces occasionally, about 50 minutes. The meat should be falling off the bone. Let rest in the pan, covered, for at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">This dish tastes best if made a day ahead and chilled overnight, then reheated.</p>

<p class="C3630"><strong><span id="id_120">Marinated</span> and Confited Rabbit</strong></p>
<p class="C3608">Stop! Don’t turn the page. For many American home cooks, rabbit may be intimidating to source and prepare. But the reward far outweighs the risk, especially with this succulent preparation, a regional specialty that Marc learned to cook while working for a summer in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="C3637">A garlicky-spiced oil marinates the meat and simmers it to succulence, then turns into the finishing sauce, too. Gizzards, seared until just caramelized then blended into the same marinade, give the sauce a silky richness. Combined with the tender confited meat, the sauce delivers a decadence that will make your heart hop for rabbit.</p>

<p class="C3632">2 hours plus marinating</p>
<p class="C3639"><strong>12 dried bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons dried oregano</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons sweet pimentón</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 guindilla peppers or chiles de árbol</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>3⅓</strong> <strong>cups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>1 large rabbit (3 ½ pounds), cut in 8 pieces, plus its kidneys, liver, and gizzards</strong></p>
<p class="C3638"><strong>kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="C3636">To make the marinade: pulse the bay leaves, oregano, thyme, and cumin in a spice grinder (or grind with a mortar and pestle) until finely ground. Transfer to a blender or food processor and add the pimentón, garlic, guindillas, and 1 teaspoon salt. Pulse, scraping the bowl occasionally, until the mixture is blended. Add the wine and vinegar and pulse until the mixture forms a paste. With the machine running, add 1 cup oil in a steady stream.</p>
<p class="C3636">Place the rabbit meat, excluding the offal, in an airtight container and add the marinade. Turn until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a very large skillet over high heat. Generously season the rabbit kidneys, liver, and gizzards with salt. Add to the hot oil and sear, turning to brown evenly, until nearly cooked through, about 4 minutes. They should still be a little raw inside. Remove from the heat and transfer to a mortar. Pound until smashed (you may need to do this in batches). Or pulse in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Reserve the skillet, without washing, for use later.</p>
<p class="C3636">Lift the rabbit pieces out of the marinade. Pour the oil from the marinade into the mortar, or food processor, with the smashed offal and stir until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Add more olive oil if needed to form the paste.</p>
<p class="C3636">Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Season the rabbit pieces with salt and add to the skillet in a single layer. Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan. Cook until the undersides are browned, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook for 1 minute more. Transfer the rabbit to a plate and pour any accumulated pan juices into the mortar, or food processor.</p>
<p class="C3636">Return the rabbit to the skillet and add the remaining 2 cups oil. It should cover almost all of the meat. Add more if needed. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low to simmer, turning the meat occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="C3636">Remove from the heat and stir in the sauce from the mortar, or food processor. Cover and let stand for a few hours. When ready to serve, reheat over medium heat until hot.</p>
