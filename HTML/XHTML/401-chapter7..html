<p class="tni">A rice salad can be served as an appetizer, a main course, a side dish, or as a proper salad. The rice is usually long grained, cooked separately in salted water, drained and served hot, at room temperature or cold.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="epub-i">I tasted a rice salad in Marietta La Bozzetta’s home one day and failed to ask for the recipe. I tried to re-create hers. I couldn’t forget how good it was. When I returned from Italy a week later, I invented this rice salad. Everyone, me included, judged it to be a winner. So, here is Papa Joe’s rice salad. Marietta let me make it the following year—she said, “That’s exactly how I make mine.”</span></p>

The cream can spoil.</span></p>
