<p class="nonindent">In Galicia, octopus is served at celebrations and often cooked outdoors in huge metal drums. At home, you can create the same effect with a stockpot. To make it a la gallega, you simply drizzle it with olive oil and sprinkle it with pimentón just before serving. It’s important that you buy wild octopus from Spain or Portugal because other varieties may not end up as soft and succulent. The tentacles become super tender after a boil with aromatics. You can find cleaned octopus at well-stocked seafood counters and buy it frozen if that’s the only form in which it’s sold. Simply thaw overnight in the refrigerator. This octopus dish tastes best when served with the <a href="sec53.xhtml#page165">Olive Oil Potato Puree</a> but it’s delicious on its own, too.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">FILL A VERY LARGE STOCKPOT WITH 8 QUARTS</span> water. add the salt, bay leaves, and peppercorns and bring to a boil. once the water is at a rolling boil, hold the octopus by its head and dunk its tentacles into the boiling water. holding it by its head, keep the tentacles submerged for 10 seconds. lift out the octopus and hold it above the pot for 10 seconds. repeat this process a total of six times. the dunking prevents the tentacles from curling up tightly, which makes them difficult to slice after cooking.</p>
<p class="indent">After the sixth time, submerge the octopus in the boiling cooking liquid. Reduce the heat to maintain a slow and steady but not rolling boil. Cook until the octopus is very tender, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Carefully remove the octopus from the cooking liquid and place on a large cutting board; reserve the cooking liquid if you’re making this dish ahead of time. When it’s cool enough to handle, remove the head by cutting horizontally across the neck and discard it. Carefully cut the tentacles into individual tentacles.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re making this ahead of time, transfer the tentacles to a large airtight container. Add enough of the cooking liquid to cover. Cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Discard the remaining cooking liquid.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re serving immediately, cut the tentacles into ¼-inch slices. Transfer to serving dishes in a single layer. Drizzle with oil to generously coat. Dust with pimentón and season with a bit of salt. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="nonindent">If you’ve cooked the octopus ahead of time, preheat the broiler when you’re ready to serve.</p>
<p class="indent">Remove the tentacles from the cooking liquid and cut into ¼-inch slices. Pat dry, then transfer to a shallow ovenproof baking or casserole dish and arrange in a single layer. Drizzle with oil to generously coat.</p>
<p class="indent">Broil until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Very carefully remove from the broiler. Dust with pimentón and season with a bit of salt. Serve immediately.</p>
