<p class="nonindent">This variation on the <a href="sec60.xhtml#page180">Rossejat Negro</a> is just as simple, but highlights shrimp instead of squid. When I have time, I make a stock with the shrimp shells as well as the fish bones. When I’m busy, I use store-bought seafood or fish stock. A high-quality one will taste as full-bodied as homemade, and you’ll still get plenty of savory seafood flavor from the shrimp.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE SEAFOOD STOCK, PEEL AND DEVEIN</span> the shrimp. Refrigerate the shrimp for the rossejat. Reserve the shells for the stock. If you’re making the <a href="sec60.xhtml#page180">Rossejat Negro</a> you can omit the shrimp shells.</p>
<p class="indent">Combine the oil, tomato, carrot, pepper, and garlic in a large saucepan. Stir well and set over medium-high heat. When the vegetables start to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the fresh tomato has broken down and is starting to caramelize on the bottom of the pan, about 13 minutes. Add the shrimp shells, raise the heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until the shells are bright pink, about 2 minutes. Add the fish bones, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns, and 5 cups water. The liquid should just cover the fish bones. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a bare simmer and simmer for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a saucepot, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. You should have 4 cups stock. You want it to be really hot when you add it to the noodles, so keep it over low heat.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the rossejat, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 16-inch paella pan or cast-iron pan over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the noodles and immediately stir to evenly coat the noodles with the oil before they start browning. Continue cooking, stirring and tossing frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Alternatively, toss the noodles with 2 tablespoons oil and spread in a half-sheet pan. Bake in a 350°F oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. It’s a matter of whether you’d rather scrape the noodles out of the paella pan or turn on the oven. Both techniques work well.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wipe out the skillet, add 1 teaspoon oil, and turn the heat to medium-high. Add half the reserved shrimp and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, turning and tossing, until just curled and orange, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with another teaspoon oil and the remaining shrimp.</p>
<p class="indent">Wipe out the skillet, add the remaining tablespoon oil, and turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and starting to turn golden but not burn, about 2 minutes. Stir in the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent and soft, about 1 minute. Add<a id="page184"/> the canned tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes turn a dark brick red and start to stick to the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Stir in the noodles, then the hot stock, pimentón, and 2½ teaspoons salt. Stir well and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring continuously. Spread the noodles in an even layer and nestle the shrimp on top of the mixture. Now don’t touch it. You want to cook the noodles until they’re just tender and stick to the bottom of the pan and make a snap, crackle, pop noise, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve with the allioli.</p>
