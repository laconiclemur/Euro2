<p class="noind_blsp"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he year 2007 was a good one for winemakers in the Southwest of France—not because of a memorable harvest or exceptional weather, but because <i>The Red Wine Diet</i> was published that year. In that book, the British scientist Roger Corder, building on what was already a pretty wide global consensus that consuming a little red wine every day was good for you, singled out the Gers and its cherished Madiran for special mention. I can picture the berets of the local <i>vignerons</i> flying into the air when they got to page 79. There, the following summation appears:</p>
<p class="ext">So what is special about living in the Gers? Is this the home of the real French Paradox? Foods high in saturated fats such as foie gras, cassoulet, saucisson, and cheese are regularly eaten here, so what is the protective factor? Could it be the wine? <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52" title="52"/>Is this the French “Red Zone” (the zone of exceptional reds)? Well, after analysis of some wines in my lab the answer seemed to be definitely yes. If there is anywhere where red wine can explain a local improvement in wellbeing, it is here.</p>
<p class="int_tpsp">You can’t buy publicity like that. Corder goes on to identify tannat, the main grape used for Madiran wines, as having especially high levels of procyanidins, a variety of plant chemical that promotes vascular health, and he points out that the traditional, slow-and-steady vinification methods favored by winemakers in the Southwest conserve a maximum of those health-giving compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">The directors of the local winemakers’ cooperative, which goes by the name of Plaimont, were so happy that they held a ceremony later that year at a wine-country château in order to bestow upon Dr. Corder an honorary membership in the Royal Order of Madiran. Also invited, and receiving the same honor, was Serge Renaud, the pioneering French medical researcher known as the “father of the French Paradox.” Pictures of the event suggest that both men had a good time and made no small contribution to their own vascular health.</p>
<p class="indent">Another observation about Madiran that Dr. Corder makes in <i>The Red Wine Diet</i>, and one that probably gets cited less frequently by locals, is this: “The wines can be astringent, almost brutally tannic, and not at all suitable for casual quaffing.”</p>
<p class="indent">The notorious harshness of southwestern France’s tannat is an old challenge for the vignerons of Madiran, an appellation that extends across a tiny swath of hill country at the junction of the Gers, the Hautes-Pyrénées, and the Pyrénées-Atlantiques. (You can drive across the viticultural zone in about fifteen minutes, on curvy roads at that.) In recent decades, a handful of winemakers in the Madiranais, as the area is sometimes called, have been able to make softer, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53" title="53"/>more elegant red wines and sell them at higher prices. The most famous is Alain Brumont, a local winemaker’s son who hit it big with a prestige wine called Château Montus. He is sometimes called “the King of Madiran.” I met Brumont on my first reporting trip to Gascony. He was a hot-tempered man with a penchant for lecturing. After he drove me around in his Mercedes SUV to admire his many vineyard plots, after visiting Montus’s immense, immaculate cellar, accessed via a gleaming elevator, and after a lengthy tutorial, delivered in his office and augmented by a speaker-phone call with a chemist in Montpellier concerning the naturally occurring compounds Brumont coaxes from the grapes to create a signature aroma of truffles in one of his wines, we sat down to lunch. The meal was served in a private dining room at Brumont’s other Madiran estate, Bouscassé. A young chef brought out plates of roasted squab. We tasted many wines, maybe fifteen in all. They were very good. Throughout the meal, Brumont complained bitterly about the paysans, who, he said, begrudged him his success and were mired in superstitions. I was glad to get back in my rental car at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="indent">For the most part, though, Madiran’s winemakers toil in relative obscurity, at least compared to the exalted regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy and the massively productive zones of the Loire, the Rhône Valley, and the Languedoc. About half of Madiran growers belong to the Plaimont co-op, which vinifies their fruit at one of three collective <i>caves</i> and helps them improve their methods for growing and harvesting.</p>
<p class="indent">The person who founded Plaimont in the late 1970s was André Dubosc, the same vigneron who had invited me to Nadine Cauzette’s house a couple of years back. Like Brumont, Dubosc was born into a winemaking family. Their fathers knew each other well. If Brumont was the king in these parts, then Dubosc was the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54" title="54"/><i>éminence grise</i>—a man who, by many accounts, singlehandedly rescued winemaking in the Gers and in the Madiranais, not by creating trophy wines but by teaching paysans to be better farmers.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc was unlike Alain Brumont in every way except one: He liked to talk. At the memorable dinner at Nadine’s, he’d held forth almost without pause, from the first glass of Pacherenc to the last sip of brandy—not just on the subject of wine but on local geography, history, mythology, cuisine, botany, you name it. He was a walking Gascon encyclopedia with a pencil mustache and a black beret. His tone was soft and euphonious, not sharp like Brumont’s. He spoke with a professorial lilt, pausing from time to time to smile or chuckle at something he’d just recounted, evincing a genuine fascination with whatever topic he happened to be expounding upon.</p>
<p class="indent">When I called Dubosc after our arrival in Plaisance, he offered to take me out to lunch. I met Monsieur le Directeur in the parking lot of Plaimont’s retail stand outside of town.</p>
<p class="indent">We got into his car, and he asked if I’d like to take a tour of the <i>vignobles</i> of Madiran and Pacherenc before lunch. I said I’d be happy to, if it wasn’t an imposition.</p>
<p class="indent">He leaned toward me and put a hand gently on my arm. “Not to worry. I’ve been promoted to director emeritus. They’ve kicked me upstairs.”</p>
<p class="indent">He grinned. “I’m a freshly minted retiree.”</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc, I realized, reminded me a little of a provincial French politician, someone whose job it was to please everyone. Except, with Dubosc, there was a hint of Gascon roguishness percolating under the surface. As we pulled out of the parking lot, I noticed a sticker on his dashboard, a cartoon drawing of a mischievous-looking, beret-wearing devil, complete with pointy beard and barbed tail, pilfering grapes from a vine.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55" title="55"/>“Ah!” said Dubosc, “my grandkids put that there. They say it reminded them of me.”</p>
<p class="indent">We drove west from Plaisance, crossed the Adour River, and zipped south for a couple of miles along the western bank of the river on the busy trunk road to Tarbes. Then we turned right onto a route that climbed sinuously through a patch of forest and into the dense range of hills on the far side of the Val d’Adour. We’d left the Gers and entered the slim northern panhandle of the Hautes-Pyrénées. The road brought us out of the trees and delivered us into a lush landscape similar to the one I was familiar with around Plaisance. But this terrain was defined by more-dramatic uplifts and declivities. And with the exception of a few grazing pastures here and there, the land was covered in vines. We were in the Madiranais.</p>
<p class="indent">Retirement had made Dubosc even more loquacious. Incapable of keeping both hands on the wheel for more than a few seconds at a time, he accompanied his flux of words with graceful hand gestures that reminded me of an orchestra conductor’s.</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>Là bas</i>,” he said, gesturing at a vine-covered hillside, “is some of the best soil for tannat grapes in the world. Those are Brumont’s slopes.”</p>
<p class="indent">We overtook an ancient Renault piloted by a wizened farmer. “And over here,” Dubosc said, leaning forward and pointing past me out the passenger window, “is all <i>petit manseng</i>, for one of our late-harvest Pacherencs. Unfortunately, the monsieur who tends that parcel is not very hard-working—look at all that grass sprouting between the vine trunks.”</p>
<p class="indent">I peered out the window, but all I could see was a blur of green leaves.</p>
<p class="indent">As we sped into another valley, Dubosc spoke about rainfall, microclimates, and the various <i>cépages</i> of the region—not just tannat and <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56" title="56"/>petit and gros manseng, the workhorse grapes of the Madiranais, but cultivars I’d only vaguely heard of, if at all: <i>arrufiac</i>, <i>fer servadou</i>, <i>petit courbu</i>, <i>béquignol</i>, <i>Mauzac</i>, <i>Saint-Macaire</i>, <i>valdiguié</i>. Dubosc characterized southwestern France as a wine geek’s dream, the cradle of dozens of indigenous grape varietals that taxonomists were still figuring out how to classify and name. “I’ve got one named after me,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">The road flattened out for a stretch, and we whizzed by a ramshackle farmhouse on our left, causing Dubosc to change the subject. “The old man who lives in that house?” he said, craning his neck to get a better look as the car drifted across the centerline. “He has no electricity or TV. The floor of the kitchen is packed dirt.”</p>
<p class="indent">“A Parisian château owner,” Dubosc continued, “tried to buy the old man out, hoping to tear the place down—it was sullying his view. Pulled out a checkbook and said, ‘Name your price.’”</p>
<p class="indent">“What did the old man say?”</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc broke into another impish grin. “‘<i>Je vous emmerde</i>.’”</p>
<p class="indent">Screw you.</p>
<p class="indent">“The hills around here used to be filled with tough paysans like him.” Dubosc sighed. “But they’re dying out.”</p>
<p class="indent">We turned onto a road that climbed a ridge with vine rows spilling down on either side into the hazy distance.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc said that when he founded the co-op, most of the vignerons in the Southwest were farmers like that stubborn old man, making <i>vin à faire pisser</i>—lousy wine.</p>
<p class="indent">“It was all about yield, yield, yield,” Dubosc said. “We spent many years trying to put an end to that.”</p>
<p class="indent">He laughed. “Do you know how hard it is to convince a Gascon farmer to let some of his grapes drop to the ground so that the best fruit thrives?”</p>
<p class="indent">He rapped a knuckle against his head. “They are hardheaded, those Gascons.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57" title="57"/>“You’re a Gascon, no?” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">“Ah!” Dubosc held up a finger. “I was born in the Béarn!”</p>
<p class="indent">I said I’d read that the Béarn was part of Gascony.</p>
<p class="indent">“Historically, perhaps, but don’t say that to a Béarnais—or to a Gascon, for that matter.”</p>
<p class="indent">We’d pulled up in front of a peach-colored building that looked as if it might have once been a farmhouse. Cars were parked haphazardly around it, some overflowing into a dirt clearing across the road. A sign above the front door read <small>LE RELAIS D’AYDIE—HOTEL-BAR-TABAC-RESTAURANT</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">Inside, a hostess greeted Dubosc by name. She led us across a packed dining room to a linen-covered table by a window with frilly curtains. Dubosc conferred with her quietly about the wine, laying his fingers gently on the woman’s forearm as he spoke, just as he’d done with me earlier. Moments later she returned with a chilled Pacherenc that was honeyed and viscous, but with a stiff acidity.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc tapped the rim of his glass. “The grapes stayed on the vine until December. <i>Tu imagines?</i> Not an easy feat.”</p>
<p class="indent">He put his napkin in his lap and cocked his head slightly in the direction of the other patrons, mostly men. “Everyone in here is a vigneron,” he said. “Times have changed. When I was young, the growers and the field hands never ate at a restaurant. They had lunch with the winemaker’s family. Twenty people <i>à table</i> every day.”</p>
<p class="indent">I mentioned that Nadine had just been telling me the same thing.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc smiled. “How do you think she got to be such a good cook?”</p>
<p class="indent">Soon, the plates starting coming: a bright-red piperade in a cazuela, a wild-mushroom omelet the size of a small throw pillow, a confit-packed garbure, and, for my main course, an <i>axoa de veau</i>, the pepper-studded Basque stew that calls for chopping an entire veal shoulder into pea-size nubbins entirely by hand. (I knew this <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58" title="58"/>because the wrist-numbing task had fallen to me at one of the Coscuella classes, and I’d vowed never to make axoa again, though I was quite content to eat it.)</p>
<p class="indent">The Madiran that arrived with our main courses was gentler than the tannic beasts I’d been consuming in Plaisance—it wasn’t quite a Montus, but it more than met the definition of quaffable. I said so to Dubosc, who wiped his mouth, laid his napkin gently on the table, and raised his point-making finger.</p>
<p class="indent">“It took great effort for our winemakers to achieve a Madiran like this,” he said. “Tannat is the hardest of grapes to tame. It is <i>dur</i>, <i>dur</i>, <i>dur</i>”—“tough, tough, tough.”</p>
<p class="indent">For the better part of the next hour, as we emptied the bottle and worked our way through cheese and dessert, Dubosc spoke reverentially of his <i>sacré</i> tannat. For a while, he strayed deep into technical matters. He talked about how, in 1991, the first experiments in micro-oxygenation—a technique intended to soften and stabilize very tannic wines during fermentation—were conducted in Madiran, with excellent results. The practice soon caught on around the world. Then he started describing soil types. After that, he turned to maceration times. Next, he moved on to procyanidins and other polyphenols.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually, somewhat to my relief, Dubosc drifted into more nostalgic terrain. He talked, and not without fondness, about his vexation with the Gascons, about how they were hardworking farmers but terrible businessmen. He recalled how André Daguin had dared to put a Madiran on the Hôtel de France’s wine list in the 1950s, defying convention in an era when only Bordeaux and Burgundies were deemed fit for fancy dining. He reminisced about Alain Brumont, who had been considered a playboy in his youth and, according to Dubosc, had a chip on his shoulder to this day. And Dubosc spoke of his own father, also a champion of tannat, a <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59" title="59"/>man who carried jugs of wine, not water, into the vine rows to slake his thirst during the harvest.</p>
<p class="indent">The check had arrived.</p>
<p class="indent">“Forgive me,” Dubosc said. “I’ve been going on much too long.”</p>
<p class="indent">I told him I had nowhere to be, which wasn’t exactly true—I’d promised Michele I’d run errands and make dinner.</p>
<p class="indent">“Ah!” said Dubosc. “Then we can make a stop or two on the way back.”</p>
<p class="indent">“By all means.”</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the one-sidedness of our conversation, I found Dubosc to be extremely pleasant company.</p>
<p class="indent">We drove to Madiran, the wine’s namesake village, to see the site of a thousand-year-old abbey where monks had made wine from native grapes. After that, Dusbosc said he wanted to show me a small château nearby called Mascaraàs. We took a wrong turn on the way there, and Dubosc pulled over to ask directions from a woman who happened to be walking on the side of the road. She recognized Dubosc, as had every person we’d encountered that day, and the two chatted for some time about a mutual acquaintance’s cataract surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">At the château, a moldering stone-walled edifice about the size of an average American suburban mansion, we were shown around by the owner, a retired college lecturer. He’d come into possession of the place a few years back and had been persuaded by Dubosc to let the co-op grow grapes on the property and sell the wine under the château’s name.</p>
<p class="indent">“Having a château on the label can be quite good for sales,” Dubosc said to me with another gentle arm-touch as we stepped inside. The professor, whose name was Derluyn, walked with a cane and, though the weather was warm, wore a tattered tweed blazer. He gave off a strong, well-marinated scent. Derluyn didn’t say much <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60" title="60"/>as he showed us around the château’s musty rooms, which contained an extraordinary accretion of relics, engravings, woodcuts, etchings, antique furniture, yellowed manuscripts, and other <i>objets</i>. When we stepped into one of the bedrooms, a startled bird flew out from under the canopy of a four-poster bed and exited through an open window.</p>
<p class="indent">In a cluttered library surveilled by a painted-marble statue of Saint Denis holding his severed head, I noticed a book propped up on a stand. It appeared to be a very old edition of Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras’s <i>Mémoires de M. d’Artagnan</i>, the first, semi-fictionalized account of the life of Gascony’s legendary musketeer, written twenty-seven years after D’Artagnan’s death. In the absence of any actual memoir by D’Artagnan—the Gascon soldier apparently never picked up a quill—this was the book that Alexandre Dumas had culled from while writing <i>The Three Musketeers</i> and the two D’Artagnan romances that followed.</p>
<p class="indent">Derluyn noticed me inspecting the tome. “Ah, yes, our own Charles de Batz-Castlemore,” he said. “A local brat from a moderately well-to-do family who didn’t have anything better to do with his life than join the military.” It was the most Derluyn had said since we’d arrived, and also the first time I’d heard anyone in Gascony cast D’Artagnan in anything less than a heroic light.</p>
<p class="indent">I shared this observation with Dubosc as we walked back to the car.</p>
<p class="indent">“I wouldn’t take his comment to heart,” he said. “Derluyn is Flemish.”</p>
<p class="indent">The day was growing late, but Dubosc wanted to make one final stop before pointing the car back toward the Val d’Adour. We drove in the direction of Viella, turned onto a narrow, shady road that edged a steep incline, and pulled into a gravel drive that led to a modest tile-roofed house.</p>
<p class="indent">“This is where I grew up,” said Dubosc.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62" title="62"/><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61" title="61"/>He pointed to a small brick outbuilding. “You see that shed there? That’s where I had my first drink of wine. I was ten. My father was working in the fields. I found one of his jugs and drank what was left in it. I was sick for a day.”</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc put the car back in gear. “<i>Tu sais?</i> That was the first and last time I ever got drunk.”</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc invited me on many other excursions after that. We paid visits to winegrowers, strolled through a plot of vines that had survived the phylloxera epidemic, toured the co-op’s <i>caves</i>, explored cemeteries and churches, snuck onto the grounds of private châteaux that Dubosc hoped the co-op would one day acquire. Each of these jaunts was as amply narrated as the first. Each included an unhurried meal and a meandering Duboscian foray into the past.</p>
<p class="indent">Over one of our long lunches, I asked Dubosc how much stock he placed in all that business about procyanidins, vascular health, and Dr. Corder’s various studies.</p>
<p class="indent">Dubosc narrowed his eyes and grinned, taking on a more than passing resemblance to the devil on his dashboard sticker. “We are winemakers, not chemists,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">Then he raised his glass, offered a “<i>santé</i>,” and left it at that.</p>
