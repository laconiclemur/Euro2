<p class="nonindent">Rather than claiming some Spanish source for this soup, I’ll just be honest: The real motivation for this soup was 100% American. I cook Spanish, but I can’t escape American traditions to a certain extent. In the fall, Asheville’s beautiful as the trees on the endless Blue Ridge Mountain range change colors. With the crisp air, I naturally think butternut squash and cinnamon. It turns out smoked paprika works especially well with that combination, so this soup ended up being Spain-meets-fall-in-the-U.S. This would be a great soup to start Thanksgiving dinner or any autumn meal.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 whole (2¼-pound) butternut squash, stemmed, cut in half lengthwise, with seeds and pulp scooped out</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 small yellow onions (7 ounces), coarsely chopped (2 cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 large carrots, trimmed, peeled, and coarsely chopped (2 cups)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 cups half-and-half, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon smoked pimentón (smoked sweet paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong><a href="sec08.xhtml#page44">Candied Nuts and Seeds</a> made with pepitas (raw hulled pumpkin seeds), for serving</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350°F. LINE A HALF-SHEET</span> pan with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="indent">Rub the oil on the cut sides of the squash to lightly coat. Place the squash halves, cut sides down, on the prepared pan. Bake until caramelized on the cut sides and the skin looks bubbled and golden brown in spots, about 1 hour 25 minutes. The squash should be dark around the edges where the juices have bubbled over. This slow caramelization is really important; you’re not just cooking the squash, you’re caramelizing it. Let the squash stand until cool enough to handle.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, combine the butter, onions, carrots, and cinnamon stick in a 4-quart saucepan. Set over medium-low heat, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender, but not browned, 35 to 40 minutes. You want the carrots to fall apart when you just gently press down on them. Lower the heat as needed to prevent the vegetables from browning.</p>
<p class="indent">Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh of the squash while it’s still warm into the saucepan with the carrots. Be careful not to get any skin in there, but scrape out as much flesh as you can. Stir well, then add the cream and 3 cups half-and-half. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer, stirring frequently to prevent the dairy from burning, until the mixture is a shade darker in color, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Pour half of the mixture into a blender along the back of a spoon to prevent spattering. Puree until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender occasionally. If the texture isn’t smooth enough for you, pass the soup through a fine-mesh sieve. Repeat with the remaining mixture.</p>
<p class="indent">Return the soup to the saucepan and whisk in the remaining 1 cup half-and-half. Season with 1½ teaspoons salt, then taste and add more if you’d like. Stir in the smoked pimentón. Serve immediately topped with the Candied Pepitas or refrigerate in airtight containers for up to 1 week. Reheat gently before serving. The soup can’t be frozen because pureed soups don’t freeze well; they tend to break.</p>

<p class="nonindent">I sprinkle these on everything, even hot vegetable dishes. Of course, I snack on them alone, too. Rather than coating the nuts or seeds with oil or egg white to get the sugar and salt to stick, I use vinegar. It caramelizes enough to glue on the seasonings, but retains a hint of tartness that makes these taste especially complex.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 cup shelled nuts or seeds, such as pepitas (pumpkin seeds) or pine nuts</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2½ teaspoons white wine, apple cider, or sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ teaspoon kosher salt</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 300°F. LINE A HALF-SHEET</span> pan with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="indent">Toss the nuts or seeds with the vinegar in a medium bowl until coated, then toss with the sugar. Spread in a single even layer on the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown and caramelized, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Sprinkle with the salt and stir well. Spread in an even layer again and cool completely on the pan on a wire rack. Toss to break into individual pieces. The nuts or seeds can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 1 week. In heat and humidity, they won’t keep for even a day.</p>
