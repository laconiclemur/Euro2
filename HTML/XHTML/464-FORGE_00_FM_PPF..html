			<p class="FeatureHead" id="pagevi">The Flat Top</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">To some the flat top may be just a piece of equipment: something you use to heat a pan, or something you have to scrub at the end of the night. Most cooks don’t see this as the heart of the restaurant, but to me, that’s exactly what it is. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">To me, the flat top symbolizes many things that are absolutely necessary in a functioning restaurant: stability, consistency, perseverance, reliability, order, and above all, getting the job done. The flat top is never tired, never in a bad mood, never has a bad day. It is, in every sense of the word, the beating heart of our restaurant. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The day the gas was turned on at Forge in June 2008, we turned the knobs to the left, heard that first flow of flames from underneath, and cooking at the restaurant had begun. And that flat top has been on ever since. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Over the years we have had many, many pieces of our equipment repaired, reworked, and replaced. But not that flat top—it has been a relentless and reliable workhorse—always there when you need it. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Every day starts exactly the same: The flat top gets turned on and the cooking begins. Placed in the center of the kitchen, the flat top is used by all the stations throughout the day for prepping sauces, blanching vegetables, searing meat, making soufflé base, and then once service begins, it sets the pulse for the evening: apps out on one side, and entrées out on the other.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Until I saw its beauty in this picture, I don’t know if I ever realized just how important this graduated-heat flat top is to me. When I look at its stains and scratches, I see the scars of a warrior who’s been through many tough battles and is still fighting hard. The stains from years of brown butter spills as the meat cook bastes the steak to perfection; the hot spots that almost glow by the end of the night; the scratches from the early morning scrubbing where you can almost see the faces of the morning porters, covered in sweat, working to make it look beautiful before the day begins—all these “blemishes” make the flat top more beautiful to me. For the last four years the flat top has been the first thing I see when I walk in the kitchen, and the last thing I check when I shut the kitchen down. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">If the flat top could talk, it would tell tales of all the different nights we’ve had at the restaurant. It would make for a great night to pull up to a bar, pour a glass of good bourbon, and just listen to its stories: the ones who could handle it, and the others who, no matter how hard they tried, just could not work its magic. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">And if I could say anything to the flat top, it would be a resounding “Thank you.” I look forward to spending many more days and many more nights in our restaurant’s heart—there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.</p>

			<p class="Para1st" id="pageix">Where do I start? Marc Forgione—the restaurant, the book, and the person—are all results of the very hard work of many, many people that need to be thanked.</p>
			<p class="Para">As far as the restaurant goes, I would like to thank every single employee who has ever walked through the door. Whether it was an hour of work or five years, I thank you for your time and effort.</p>
			<p class="Para">In particular to Chris Blumlo, my business partner, without your drive to get this place open and keep it open, I wouldn’t be where I am today. To Matt, Cary, Brielle, Mariette, Michael, even though you don’t really “work,” I do thank you.</p>
			<p class="Para">To all my chefs and cooks who have had to endure the many hot nights in our “charming” little kitchen—THANK YOU!! Chris Lim, Phet, Steve, Ian, Barry, Chris, Greg P. To the ladies of pastry: Jenny, Tina, Ashton, Alexandra, you are the sugar in my coffee.</p>
			<p class="Para">All the chefs who have trained me along the way: Rich D’Orazzi, Vicky and Kazuto, Gavin Portsmouth, Patricia Yeo, Pino Maffeo, Laurent Tourondel, Michel Guérard—without each of your influences there would be no restaurant.</p>
			<p class="Para">To all the purveyors, farmers, fishermen, foragers, and butchers who you will read about throughout the book—thank you. I’m humbled by you every day.</p>
			<p class="Para">To my investors, thank you a million times for believing in me; I can never explain my gratitude in words.</p>

Thank you to my beautiful sister Cara; even though you don’t eat meat, it’s cool. My grand-parents: Pop Pop and Granny, Pepe and Gram—thank you for the unconditional love and support. My parents: Paps and Jule—it’s not easy to say thank you for everything because there is so much; not a day goes by when I am not learning about humility, love, passion, creativity, and hard work from the both of you.</p>
			<p class="Para">To my muse and rock, Kristen, thank you for your strength, love, patience and support. You deserve to be canonized. To the Angelilli family, for the countless words of advice and opinions, thank you.</p>

			<p class="Para1st" id="pagex"><span class="ParaIntroLead">The moment you taste Marc Forgione’s food, </span>you know he is an exceptional chef. From his menu descriptions, to ingredient pairings, to how his cooking always manages to surprise you, Marc’s food is a marvel. It doesn’t hurt that at the end of the day, Marc is as humble and as hardworking as they get—and happens to be a nice guy to boot. </p>
			
			<p class="Para">When Marc asked me to write this, I couldn’t have been more honored and delighted. I had the pleasure of working with Marc and watching him grow as a chef while he helped me build the BLT Steak franchise. I’m so proud to see all that he has accomplished.</p>
			<p class="Para">Marc is a chef with a rare combination of a relentless work ethic, insatiable curiosity, a highly developed palate, and strong leadership skills. A deeply inquisitive and inventive chef, Marc never rests on his laurels; he will never feel that he’s accomplished enough and will always be reaching for the next highest peak. While his food and cooking are of the utmost serious level, deeply rooted in French technique, a key quality of his food is a word that might come as a surprise in how an “Iron Chef” is described—whimsical. You can’t help but notice while eating his food that this is a chef who loves to experiment and who has a lot of fun in the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="Para">Marc became one of my sous chefs while I was opening BLT Steak. At the time, he was one of the chefs working at Pazo, the famed Patricia Yeo’s restaurant, in the space that BLT Steak took over. From the moment we met, Marc struck me as incredibly professional, focused, serious, humble, and dedicated. In opening and running BLT Steak, we learned a lot about how to run a steakhouse and about each other. Back then we knew that a steakhouse had a certain look and feel, and that it served steak. But that’s it. Outside of those two things, we learned everything through a lot of trial and error. For example, after we discovered moldy steaks in our aging room, we learned how to keep them bone dry. After experimenting with cooking meat in the wood-fired oven—which is great in theory—we went with Marc’s idea of using the broiler instead. Marc’s instincts with this (as well as other things) were spot on: Using a broiler allowed us to cook and serve our food with far less delay and satisfy a larger volume of orders.</p>
			<p class="Para">Through learning together and observing what a dedicated and talented chef Marc is, I came to trust him with important kitchen and business decisions. Marc was, in fact, so dedicated that he felt he needed to earn his stripes working abroad. I was impressed that he was willing to travel somewhere where he didn’t speak the language; I knew that despite being an excellent chef, Marc was going to struggle—the road ahead was not going to be easy. I was even more impressed that Marc was able to secure a series of positions with Michel Guérard’s restaurants in Eugénie-les-Bains, France, where he wound up working for well over a year, and where he forged an even more meaningful connection to ingredients, sourcing, and techniques.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="pagexi">Marc came back from France a changed man: more serious, more mature, and even more focused on food. His time in France transformed him into a more intellectual and thoughtful chef; it took him to another level of composing his dishes. It was as if he had gained a deeper understanding of himself and it was fueling his execution in the kitchen. He was more passionate about cooking than ever, and he worked even harder to get everything right. In some ways, he reminded me a little of myself when I was younger.</p>
			<p class="Para">So, when I set out to open BLT Prime, I asked Marc to be my chef de cuisine. There was no one else I could trust with that job. He combined some of my (French) ideas with his (American) ones, and the results were excellent. In addition to being a very creative guy, Marc had all the makings of a leader: people liked working with him, and he was an excellent manager and a good mentor for the young line cooks. And he led by example—always the hardest working chef on the line. Shortly thereafter, I asked him to become my corporate chef, helping me to open restaurants all over the country.</p>
			<p class="Para">Perhaps the best precursor to the successes that were to come his way was the time he acted as my sous chef, helping me to compete on an Iron Chef episode against Bobby Flay. I took that competition very seriously—I was not going to lose. Our secret ingredient was goat cheese, and one of the dishes that Marc created for the completion was the goat cheese ravioli, which scored very well with the judges and made it into this book. Throughout the competition, Marc was incredibly focused and dedicated. We trained very hard—and we won. Having Marc on the team was critical to the win.</p>
			<p class="Para">This is, without a doubt, a cookbook for the passionate cook; one who will seek out challenges and relish them. And while the book may <span class="serif-ital">look</span> complicated—its food is, without a doubt, sophisticated—most of these recipes are all meant to be, and are able to be, cooked at home.  They will make you more courageous in the kitchen, and they will meaningfully improve your cooking skills.</p>
			<p class="Para">I have many happy memories of working and cooking with Marc, teasing him about his mohawk, and traveling with him all over the country opening restaurants, but perhaps my favorite memory is of us cooking together for his father, the celebrated chef Larry Forgione, who was in the dining room one night. Marc was brimming with excitement and pride to have his father there honoring his craft. Watching a son cook for his father, displaying as much of his craft as he could, was a beautiful memory, one that will stay with me forever.</p>
			<p class="Para">By the time you will hold this book in your hands, Marc will have opened three more restaurants: Khe-Yo, a Laotian kitchen, and two steakhouses, American Cut, one in Atlantic City and one in New York—all excellent, and all bearing his meticulous attention to detail and bold flavors. I’m excited to see what’s in store for this talented chef. No doubt, he’ll keep reaching for even higher peaks, one delicious dish at a time.</p>

				<p class="H1" id="howtouse" style="page-break-before:always">How to Use This Book</p>
			
			<hr class="orange-line"/>
			<p class="Para1st" id="pagexii"><span class="ParaIntroLead">Do not be put off by the seemingly complicated or long recipes.</span> This book is meant to be cooked from. While there will be some recipes that might sound intimidating, and a few that will require special equipment, most of these recipes can be made at home.</p>
			<p class="Para">If you never cook, this book might look very intimidating, but I don’t want it to be. All the recipes are written to provide as much information as possible, so if you are new to making something, the descriptions in the recipes will guide you. If you’re a beginner cook, I’d like you to focus on a single component of a dish, take things easy, and get used to the process. If you are an advanced home cook, these recipes will help you hone your techniques, stretch your cooking muscle, and challenge how you compose a dish. You might not want to make the entire dish—but then again, you might.</p>
			<p class="Para">Once you start cooking from this book and start getting the techniques, it’ll get a lot easier—you just have to get over the hump. My mother, who was one of the testers, was very intimidated by the first three recipes—she called me and told me they were impossible. By the end of us testing the book, she would call me and ask me for something more difficult . . . she was finding the recipes too easy. </p>
			<p class="Para">Don’t focus on making your dish look just like it looks in the picture—focus on making it so that it tastes good to you. The recipes are foundational: If you learn how to sear a fish from this book, you will know how to sear a fish for the rest of your life. Think of this book not so much as a collection of recipes and dishes but as techniques you can apply to other recipes and dishes you will go on to create.</p>
			<p class="Para">And if you are a chef (or would like to become one), cook these recipes in their entirety (all the components)—or focus on techniques unknown to you.</p>
			<p class="Para">Here are a few notes that I hope are helpful:</p>
			<ul class="ListBulleted">
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">+	</span>The sous-vide technique has become very popular in fine dining restaurants in the last thirty years. <span class="serif-ital">Sous-vide </span>literally means “under vacuum” and requires two pieces of rather pricey equipment: a Cryovac machine (which removes air from the bag holding the food) and an immersion circulator (see <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#page400">Tools</a>), which is a tool that is put into a tub of water and regulates the water temperature, gently (and evenly!) cooking the food. Wherever possible, we have included alternative cooking instructions when sous-vide is called for. Where the alternative cooking instructions are not listed, the sous-vide technique is essential to the dish.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">+	</span>Sometimes, when making reductions, the book will tell you to make two or three times as much sauce as you will need for the recipe. This is because you need a certain amount of liquid in order for the flavors to concentrate and reduce. It’s hard to make a reduction with a small amount of liquid. You can save any leftover sauce and use it in other dishes.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">+	</span>Many of the recipes are finished with <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#sources">micro herbs</a>. When the dish arrives at your table, the micro herbs make for a dramatic presentation. However, the company whose micro herbs we buy, <a href="FORGE_08_Butcher_PPF.xhtml#page301">Koppert Cress</a>, grows micro herbs that contribute as much to the flavor of the dish as they do to the look of the dish. If you do not want to bother with micro herbs, that’s perfectly fine, too.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted" id="pagexiii"><span class="Bullet">+	</span>Throughout the book I use spice blends that I order from an amazing company, <a href="FORGE_03_Shellfish_PPF.xhtml#LaBoite">La Boîte à Épice</a>. I implore you to give these spices a try. Once you do, you will be tempted to use them in everything. Not only are these some of the best quality spices you can get your hands on, but they will also transform your food in noticeable and positive ways.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">+	</span>Throughout the book you will see stories about some of the purveyors that we work with at the restaurant. These are the people who have been good to me, and I’ve come to love certain products. I wanted to tell their story as well, because they, too, are part of the Restaurant Marc Forgione story and are part of the reason that the food at the restaurant tastes the way that it does.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">+	</span>Most important, remember this as you cook: While cooking from this book will enhance your technique, make you a better cook, and make you more fearless in the kitchen, cooking, above all, is supposed to be a <span class="serif-ital">fun</span> and creative process. Take your time. Pace yourself. Enjoy it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Para">Here are some general guidelines that might be helpful to keep in mind throughout the book:</p>
			<ul class="ListBulleted">
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">1.	</span>All pepper is ground fresh.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">2.	</span>All herbs are fresh unless dried is specified.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">3.	</span>All butter is unsalted.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">4.	</span>All salt is kosher unless otherwise indicated. At the restaurant we use the Diamond Crystal brand. The finishing flaky sea salt that we use at the restaurant is Maldon.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">5.	</span>If it doesn’t already specify to do it in the recipe, it’s always better to briefly toast the spices in a clean, dry skillet over a low flame. It awakens their flavors, making your final dish that much more incredible. Spices, for the most part, start out whole, and are ground only after they are toasted.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">6.	</span>All eggs are large and farm-fresh. If you can get farm-fresh eggs, make every effort to do so—it will make an amazing difference in your food.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">7.	</span>Milk is whole and preferably nonhomogenized so the cream rises to the top. Cream is always heavy cream.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">8.	</span>Keep some blended oil on hand as it’s used in many of the recipes here. To make it, combine 3 parts canola oil with 1 part olive oil.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted"><span class="Bullet">9.	</span>Foie gras is grade-A duck (about 2-pound lobes).</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted-double"><span class="Bullet">10.	</span>All sugar is granulated unless otherwise indicated.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted-double"><span class="Bullet">11.	</span>Flour is all-purpose unless otherwise indicated.</li>
				<li class="ListBulleted-double"><span class="Bullet">12.	</span>Some recipes require the minutest precision—cup and spoon measures just won’t do. For those recipes, we’ve indicated the measurements in grams.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="Para1st" id="page1"><span class="ParaIntroLead">A Business Miracle.</span> This is a story of an improbable restaurant miracle. It’s also a cookbook that, if you don’t get intimidated by a handful of sous-vide recipes and odd spice blends, will make you a better cook. It’ll make you feel less daunted by any kind of recipe. It’ll allow you to stay in your comfort zone but also, if you let it, push you further. It’ll make you fearless, if not in life, then definitely in the kitchen. At least that’s my goal. </p>
			<p class="Para">But as important as the recipes are, the story of how my restaurant survived is a great story—a story I want to tell. I think that no matter how seasoned, how experienced you are in the kitchen, you’re never prepared for opening a restaurant (especially your first), much as you’re never fully prepared to become a parent. Inevitably, things will go wrong; there will be plenty of curveballs, and you just need to be prepared for it all to happen.</p>
			<p class="Para">But if, before I opened the restaurant, someone had sat me down and told me how it was all going to happen and the events that would take place, I wouldn’t have believed them. Either that or I would have chickened out of opening my own place.</p>
			<p class="Para">When I tell people about the first few years of the restaurant’s life, they are surprised to hear that I really struggled, that there were some dark, sad times when I questioned myself. I think that because Larry Forgione is my old man, people think that I just woke up one day, and the restaurant appeared before me, fully formed and functional. That it was all just a product of being born into a chef family. That, because of my dad, I sprouted from the kitchen gods and was gently placed in a kitchen where I’ve reigned supreme ever since.</p>
			<p class="Para">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
			<p class="Para">If you look at the story of our restaurant, Hollywood couldn’t have written a better script. Deep in the red, we were on the brink of selling the business. So many things that could have gone wrong did go wrong. There were no guarantees. When the turnaround came, it was fast and incredible—we were all pinching ourselves. The fact that this restaurant survived and is still around is a miracle. A business miracle. But when the going was tough, it was painful.</p>
			<p class="Para">There were more times than I can count when I didn’t know if we were going to make it. We opened with no money, were short-staffed, and got caught in the mother of recessions. We made it through, but now that we’re in the fifth year of the restaurant’s life and finally making money, we’re still paying off debt. It’s been a long journey to get to where we are now. </p>
			<p class="Para">When times were tough, we could’ve changed our menu; we could’ve changed our way of cooking; we could’ve served different food—burgers, maybe—but we didn’t. We kept our heads down, held our breath, and continued to cook the way we felt was right. We listened to our gut and just hung on, hoping for a miracle. And somewhere along the way, people started to notice, and gradually, little by little, our luck began to turn.</p>
			<p class="Para">I was approached to write this book in 2011, and I immediately knew that in addition to the recipes from the restaurant, I wanted to share our story with you. Without these recipes, we wouldn’t have a cookbook; and without our story, we wouldn’t be where we are today and we wouldn’t have these recipes.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page2">I wanted to tell you our story not because I want to be self-indulgent and wax poetic for pages and pages, but because I think our story is a good one to know. Whether you plan on working in a restaurant, running one, or eating in one, the stories of how we get to the place where we are, are important. They provide context; they help to establish an identity. When you read our story, you will know what drives us and what makes us tick.</p>
			<p class="Para">Some of what you’re about to read might come across as the sob story of a chef building a restaurant. I get it—I am not a war veteran, I didn’t go through combat. But at the same time, we all go through trying experiences. And this is <span class="serif-ital">my</span> story; this is <span class="serif-ital">kitchen </span>combat. I wanted to share this story with anyone who has ever thought of running their own place: budding chefs, young people dreaming of cooking for a living. Everyone can write a business plan, but to hear real stories about the trials and tribulations of a real restaurant might be helpful and comforting should anyone meet the challenges along the way. The story of my restaurant is an amazing, hard-to-believe, great story. And to tell you the story of my food is to tell you the story of the restaurant and how we got here.</p>

			<p class="H2">I Thought I Wanted to Be a Forest Ranger and Smoke Pot</p>
			<p class="Para1st">I didn’t always know I was going to be a chef. As a kid, I liked being in the kitchen, but as a teenager, not so much. Some of that was because of what my dad did for a living, and back then there weren’t too many rebellious teenagers who wanted to follow in their fathers’ footsteps. And I was a pretty regular kid who was into everything a typical teenager would be into: I hung out, played sports, and got in trouble—just like most other kids.</p>
			<p class="Para">I was fourteen when I got my first job in the hospitality industry, so to speak. Two buddies and I signed up to be dishwashers in catering halls in Long Island. Within a month, for reasons I can’t still figure out, I was promoted to be a bartender. I couldn’t even drink, but I was mixing drinks for others!</p>
			<p class="Para">I got my first real restaurant job at my father’s restaurant, An American Place, when I was about sixteen. At the time, I didn’t even realize what an amazing restaurant it was and how lucky I was to work there. The ingredients were perfect; the chef, Richie, was amazing; there were three or four specials every day. It was a serious, no-bullshit kitchen, and I was just a kid running around in there. It was really, really cool.</p>
			<p class="Para">On my first day at An American Place, about ten seconds in, one of the cooks gave me a cleaver to chop chives, and, immediately, I chopped the tip of my thumb off. Ten seconds in. Suddenly there was blood everywhere, and I thought I’d be sent home for sure. But the other cooks bandaged me up and ten minutes later I went back on the line. The chef laughed, “If it doesn’t fall off, you don’t go home,”—a line I still use at the restaurant to this day. It felt good to be treated like everyone else, and not get special treatment just because I was the owner’s son. You don’t go home just because you’re hurt—you push through it. Also: Don’t chop chives with a cleaver.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page3">My job was humble—I started out prepping ingredients. Then I moved my way up to salads and to different stations from there. And even though I didn’t know I wanted to be a chef, right from the get-go I was always drawn to the chef lifestyle. While most teenagers don’t look forward to waking up early and working fourteen-hour days, to me it felt exhilarating. I liked being around food, and I felt at home with cooks, listening to their stories and grabbing a drink with them after work. I enjoyed working hard and getting my ass kicked. It was humbling, motivating, and grueling—a culinary boot camp. And I loved every minute.</p>
			<p class="Para">When I got to college, I wasn’t focused. College didn’t really interest me; I wasn’t motivated. Over the first few years, I switched my major several times. My freshman year, I was a psych major. The following year, I was a forestry major—I thought I wanted to be a forest ranger, smoke pot, and wear tie-dye. Then, I switched to business management because I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and business management sounded like something useful. By junior year, I had to pick, and stick with, a major in order to graduate. So I picked hotel and restaurant management. But up to that point, and even afterward, I didn’t seriously think about becoming a chef. It was more of a well-I-don’t-know-nothing-else-interests-me type of a decision. And it turned out that UMass Amherst, where I was enrolled, had one of the best hotel management schools in the country! I took the restaurant management track (at that point, I had about four years of cooking experience under my belt) and wound up doing pretty well. After graduation, I went backpacking through Europe for two months with five of my good buddies.</p>
			<p class="Para">Europe was an eye-opening experience and gave me a sense of recognition of something inside of me. There was this force that kept guiding me toward food, and I was beginning to feel as if this was what I was supposed to do. And so, partly because I needed the money and partly because my dad needed the help, the day after I got off the plane, I started cooking at An American Place. I haven’t stopped cooking since that day.</p>
			<p class="Para">For a while, I was going back and forth between working for my dad and for Patricia Yeo at her famed restaurant AZ. At some point, Patricia felt that I was good enough to be promoted to sous-chef. While the promotion meant a huge honor, I thought I was way too young and too inexperienced to be given that job just yet. Once you become a sous-chef, you’re a sous-chef until you’re an executive chef. And I felt that I had a lot more to learn before I could comfortably wear that title. I might have deserved the promotion because I was the best cook at <span class="serif-ital">that </span>kitchen at <span class="serif-ital">that </span>time, but that didn’t mean I deserved it overall <span class="serif-ital">or </span>should have taken it. I’ve always been competitive (chefs are competitive by nature), but the person I competed with the most—was myself.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page4">I decided that what I really needed was a kick in the ass. I knew I needed to grow up, and I wanted to get away from being “Larry Forgione’s son.” I had incredible respect for my dad’s accomplishments, but I needed to be viewed as a chef in my own right, not as a famous chef’s kid. So I decided to go where no one knew who I was (or gave a shit)—Europe.</p>

			<p class="Para">I compiled a list of chefs I wanted to apprentice under. I felt like it had to be go-big-or-go-home, so I shot for the A-listers: Michel Bras, Paul Bocuse, Pierre Gagnaire, and Michel Guérard, who was my number-one pick. Sometime before, I had found a magazine spread on Chef Guérard and his three-Michelin-star restaurant: There was this beautiful garden where you picked your herbs, in this small, charming village in the middle of nowhere in the southwest of France. Something about that place just called to me. When I showed the list to my dad, he laughed—he thought I put Michel Guérard at the top of my list as a joke. I had no idea that years ago, my father had worked with Chef Guérard and they were friendly. So my dad wrote a letter to Michel, and Michel wrote back. Normally, he wrote, they wouldn’t consider it, but if I came as a <span class="serif-ital">stage</span> (an unpaid apprentice or intern), just to learn, it would be acceptable.</p>
			<p class="H2">Gum for Dinner</p>
			<p class="Para1st">And so, in the summer of 2004, armed with a small bag and little else, I flew to Paris. From there, I took the train down to Eugénie-les-Bains, one of those beautiful places you see in the promotional tourist flyers—except it’s actually that beautiful in real life. But it’s so remote, and so small, that no one there speaks any English. As in zero. <span class="serif-ital">Rien</span>. Not even “hello.” I got off the train, and this guy walked up to me and introduced himself, in French, of course. His name was Monsieur Mootz, and he was there to pick me up and take me to the kitchen to meet the chef. Chef Stéphane Mack, who ran the restaurant kitchen where I was going to be apprenticing, shook my hand and immediately launched into fast-paced, full-on French. I didn’t understand a single word, but I just kept nodding. <span class="serif-ital">Oui, chef. Merci. Merci. Au revoir.</span> That was the extent of my French.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page5">Once the introductions were over and done with, M. Mootz took me to the house where I was going to live. The drive from the restaurant to the house, which was on the edge of the town, took exactly one minute. “<span class="serif-ital">Bonne soirée</span>,” said M. Mootz, and drove away before I could bid him the same.</p>
			<p class="Para">In the house, my room was straight out of that famous Van Gogh painting: a tiny cot, a wooden table with a chair, and a stand-up shower without a shower curtain (though I don’t think Van Gogh had the shower). I put my bag down and looked around me: no phone, no television, no Internet—the room was very spartan and very isolated. At that moment, I felt a tinge of panic: I was by myself in this weird, obscure place, and I didn’t speak the language. What was I doing there?</p>
			<p class="Para">I looked out the window: It was getting late and the sun was just starting to set. Famished, I set out to get something to eat. I left the house and started to walk. I didn’t see anyone on the streets—the whole village was so quiet, it was as if it had been deserted. It took me a few minutes to realize that everything in town had shut down for the night and not even a bakery was open. So I returned to my room, rummaged in my bags, and found a pack of gum. And that’s how I spent my first night in Eugénie-les-Bains—alone, with gum for dinner. I was in France, about to start apprenticing in one of the best restaurants in the world, and I ate gum for dinner.</p>
			<p class="Para">In the morning, before I had to report to work at eight a.m., I found an open <span class="serif-ital">boulangerie</span>, bought a baguette with butter, and watched the sun rise while eating my breakfast. You don’t get much more French than that: French countryside, sunrise, baguette, and butter. And gum for dinner the night before, because in a small town in France, everything shuts down on Sunday night. Lesson learned.</p>

			<p class="H2">Being by Yourself</p>
			<p class="Para1st">At first, being in France was terrible; I hated every minute of it and just wanted to go home. I didn’t speak the language, and because I didn’t speak the language, I couldn’t understand what anyone was saying; and because I couldn’t understand what anyone was saying, I screwed up a lot. And because I couldn’t speak, I was quiet, which made everyone think I was arrogant. Everyone hated me because I made mistakes, and they thought I was stuck up.</p>
			<p class="Para">But little by little, I picked up the language and made fewer and fewer mistakes until, finally, I stopped making them altogether. I stopped hating where I was; I was actually really starting to enjoy every aspect of my job. I got along with the other cooks, and ended up becoming really close with a lot of people at the restaurant. And instead of staying three months, I stayed a year and three months and was asked to return the following year. Eugénie-les-Bains wound up being a truly amazing experience.</p>
			<p class="Para">It was during my apprenticeship in France that, for the first time in my life, I started to feel a visceral connection to food. A huge part of that feeling came from spending my mornings in the garden, trimming herbs and tending plants; plucking feathers from chickens; opening two hundred oysters and cleaning thirty lobsters every day. Whether it was from the ground, the air, or the sea, I dealt with food from start to finish. If it was a fish, I scaled, gutted, and filleted it. If it was a chicken, I plucked it and cut it into pieces. When you work with food where you get to see its life cycle from source to plate, your perception of that ingredient, your understanding and appreciation for it, change with time. And you begin to <span class="serif-ital">feel </span>the food, if you will, not just in your head and your heart, but also in your gut. It becomes a visceral and indelible part of you.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page6">In looking back on my time in France and what I took away from there, it was far more than just technique and skill—cooking was just 60 percent of what I learned there. I took away a deeper sense of self as well. And I think that it’s critical for anyone who is serious about becoming a chef to go abroad to a country where they don’t speak any English. It doesn’t have to be Europe; it can be Asia, or South America, or Africa. But it needs to be a place where you are taken out of your element and are forced to be inside your head <span class="serif-ital">a lot</span>. You really grow up and learn about yourself. And to learn <span class="serif-ital">about </span>yourself you have to <span class="serif-ital">be </span>by yourself. Spend <span class="serif-ital">time </span>with yourself. I learned a lot about myself as a cook, as a brother, as a son, as a friend, as a person.</p>
			<p class="Para">And it was during this experience in France that I really, truly, 100 percent realized that I was going to be a chef. And not only was I going to be a chef, I was going to be a <span class="serif-ital">serious</span><span class="serif-ital"> </span>chef. I remember thinking, about what my high school football coach used to tell me: “Men, we’re gonna throw balls over our shoulders, and go in head first,” as I began to feel this amazing passion for the craft. It was in France that I really decided that someday I was going to open my own restaurant. I started to keep a notebook of ideas, writing thoughts for dishes and concepts, eventually spilling over into another notebook, and another. I’ve kept all those notebooks with me, and it’s amazing to look through them and see how I’ve grown as a chef.</p>

			<p class="H2">The Laurent Tourondel Years</p>
			<p class="Para1st">Before I went off to my apprenticeship in France, I had helped Laurent Tourondel open BLT Steak. Good thing I had already committed to going to France by that time. Otherwise, France might not have happened, because I really liked working with Laurent. But we kept in touch while I was there, and when I came back, he asked me to open BLT Fish with him, and then made me executive chef at BLT Prime. I was about twenty-six years old. None of this made any sense—I should’ve been a sous-chef at most, but instead, he made me the chef de cuisine. Every time I wanted to get my butt kicked, someone was handing me the keys to the car. For whatever reason, there was a pattern of me getting jobs I didn’t think I was ready to take on. But I trusted Laurent’s judgment and took the position. Everyone was loving BLT Prime, the reviews were great, and it was fun to cook there.</p>
			<p class="Para">After a while, Laurent made me his corporate chef, which meant I was responsible for opening up and managing BLT restaurants across the country. I loved doing it, but I began to miss coming into one kitchen and cooking there day in and day out. I was ready to finally have a kitchen of my own.</p>
			<p class="Para">But internally, I struggled with that decision. Even though I was ready to spread my wings, I didn’t want to leave. Laurent’s influence had been incredibly important. If you ask a lot of successful chefs who they look up to, they can usually name one chef who really, truly mentored them, took them under their wing and looked after them. And for me, that was Laurent. In looking back, he was grooming me precisely for the moment when I felt ready to strike out on my own. He showed me what it was like to open a restaurant, bringing me into business meetings just to listen and absorb. Without my time spent with him in that capacity, I don’t think I would have ever been able to attempt to open my own place. Laurent showed me the business side of opening your own place: His incredible attention to detail and care went into every decision, no matter how small. Before Laurent, I never got to see a chef sit down at the table and pick out a napkin or a table setting for the dining room of his new restaurant. Everything mattered to him: menu covers, menu typeface, even the line spacing of the dishes. Watching him pay so much attention to each aspect of running a restaurant carried over to how I work now.</p>

			<p class="H2" id="page7">2008</p>
			<p class="H3">Baptism by Fire</p>
			<p class="Para1st">These days, when I read over our original business plans, it strikes me as funny that my vision for my restaurant was as crystallized as it was from the very beginning. About a year prior to opening the restaurant, as I started to think about a place of my own, I began to keep a journal filled with general thoughts and visions for my future place. One entry read, “Each table should have its own lighting from above, just enough to see the table, but at the same time feel intimate as well as feel part of a busy dining room.” If you walk into the restaurant today, that’s exactly how it looks.</p>
			<p class="Para">Opening your own place is a multifaceted affair. I had the kitchen know-how, but I needed a business partner, someone who understood the financial side of it and who was practical. So my college friend Lou introduced me to his college buddy Chris Blumlo. Blumlo and I went to UMass Amherst at the same time and ran in the same circles, but oddly enough, we didn’t hang out in college. We hit it off right away, meeting several times a week to flesh out our vision for the restaurant. After some time, we put together a business plan and then started to look for a space.</p>
			<p class="Para">The space where we wound up opening the restaurant was the first place I looked at. A friend of a friend had called me and said, “I know this guy in Tribeca who wants to get out of his restaurant. You should come and check out the space.”</p>
			<p class="Para">Tribeca. Strange as it sounds for a guy who grew up in New York, at that time I’d only been to Tribeca twice in my life. It wasn’t a place where a young guy would go to hang out; it was more for families, quiet.</p>
			<p class="Para">So I went down to Tribeca one crisp September night to check it out. I remember everything about that evening; the leaves had just started to change color. As I was turning off Hudson Street onto Reade, I saw this cozy tree-lined street, a beautiful deck with wide open doors, and marble tables with bistro chairs. Everything was quiet and still, and I felt like I had just been transported out of New York into a small town. It’s so rare to see a restaurant with doors that open from floor to ceiling—and it was exactly what I wanted. I remember walking up to the restaurant and thinking, “Please, God, let this be the restaurant that I am coming to look at!” And then I got close enough to see the building’s address—and my heart skipped a beat.</p>

			<p class="Para" id="page8">I knew I wanted the space as soon as I started to talk to the owner. Even without properly seeing the inside, I knew it—suddenly I just had this feeling that this <span class="serif-ital">had </span>to be the place. If you read our original business plans, it says something like “exposed wood, candlelight, natural brick.” When I walked in, the inside was covered in white subway tile. There were these huge mirrors hanging, too. The back room, where there was a giant movie screen, had a big black curtain. I had no idea that behind all that were beautiful wood beams and red brick, but in my gut I felt it was the right place. I asked the guy what was behind the tile and he just rolled his eyes. “Some ugly old red brick.”</p>
			<p class="Para">That feeling in my gut before I even stepped in—just felt right. And all that other stuff, the brick and the iron details that I wanted so much, just happened by chance. Even before I saw the inside, before I knew that the details I wanted even existed, just <span class="serif-ital">walking up </span>to this place gave me goose bumps. I just <span class="serif-ital">knew </span>this was the perfect place.</p>
			<p class="Para">Later, I learned that in its previous life, before it became a restaurant, the space had been a butter and cream holding facility. Butter and cream were stored in the basement, which was a giant refrigerator, and when they needed to be shipped somewhere, they were raised to the ground level via an elevator (where the bar is now) and carried out of the big front doors.</p>
			<p class="Para">So I told the owner I wanted the space. And as a gesture of good faith, I promised him a rather big chunk of money within two weeks. <span class="serif-ital">Two weeks! </span>At the time, Blumlo and I had zero in the bank. We just signed this piece of paper and then immediately thought, <span class="serif-ital">Shit, how are we gonna raise that much money?</span></p>
			<p class="Para">We started cooking private fund-raising dinners at apartments all over the city. I’d arrange to come over to someone’s home, cook him and his guests a multicourse meal, talk about the food, and so on, and then say to the diners, “I’m going to build one of the best restaurants in New York—trust me.” And people did—within a couple of weeks, we had raised enough money for our good-faith deposit and to open the restaurant, but <span class="serif-ital">just </span>enough to scrape by on, no more, no less. Looking back on all this: promising someone a crazy amount of money with nothing in the bank, was utterly, stupidly insane. Maybe that was the kind of insanity we had to have at the time, but in retrospect it was a risky move. The next stage, putting everything together, was rather sobering—we had to budget for everything, and Blumlo, being the numbers guy, had me on a tight leash.</p>

		<p class="Para" id="page9">Back in the day, my vision for opening a proper restaurant included an unlimited budget where you go and pick out whatever equipment you want. The way I saw it, we were building my dream, and you don’t put a price tag on your dreams. But in the real world, dreams have prices, and often steep ones.</p>
			<p class="Para">We went to the Bowery to pick out equipment. And no matter what I pointed to—a Viking stove, an island pass, a sink—I was told it was too expensive and I had to pick out something cheaper. I wanted to cut a hole in the wall of the restaurant so you could look into the kitchen when you walked through the dining room. I wanted a little window in the bathroom that had a one-way mirror letting you see into the kitchen. I wanted all these cool, fun nuances that would make the restaurant a unique place, like a wood-burning oven, for example. And none of it was happening—it was all just too expensive.</p>
			<p class="Para">After that fruitless trip, we went to Madison Avenue to these fancy showrooms to pick out china. The same thing happened—we couldn’t afford anything.</p>
			<p class="Para">Everything I picked out, and I mean <span class="serif-ital">everything</span>, was too expensive; from plates to stoves to you-name-it, I was told I couldn’t have it. So finally, frustrated, I threw my hands up and walked away.</p>
			<p class="Para">A few days later, we returned to the Bowery; I took some time to review my options and think about our finances. We scrapped the idea of the hood for the wood-burning oven—it was just too expensive—and found an antique oven that now stands in the dining room; we use it to warm our bread. I was determined to have my dream restaurant, but I also had to be flexible and adjust to our financial situation.</p>
			<p class="H3">Shopping eBay for Dishes</p>
			<p class="Para1st">So I compromised: I bought everything used—refrigerators, stove, hotel pans—because that was what we could afford. I couldn’t buy fancy china over on Madison Avenue, so I spent several weeks hanging out on eBay trying to find the right plates, glasses, and creamers. Bit by bit, things were coming together.</p>
			<p class="Para">Surprisingly, the hardest things to find were the chairs. We were about two weeks from opening and by then had gone everywhere to look for them: western Massachusetts, upstate New York, every antique shop we could find. Nothing looked right to us. The opening date was looming, and we had no chairs.</p>
			<p class="Para">We wound up finding our chairs at Crate &amp; Barrel, just a few blocks away! We had spent all this time looking far and wide, and the chairs were right under our noses. They weren’t cheap, but they were right.</p>
			<p class="Para">The last piece of the puzzle was the lighting, and it was the one thing I wound up not having to compromise on. We installed the custom lamps I originally envisioned, and they still hang in the restaurant now. Having the right lighting was critical for me.</p>
			<p class="Para">The lack of money was frustrating, but it wasn’t anybody’s fault. And I learned a valuable lesson: Sometimes you have to just figure it out and play the hand you’re dealt. I just wasn’t used to that. I came from An American Place, BLT, Michel Guérard, and I didn’t know how much things really cost. At those restaurants, you got the plates you wanted, and the price didn’t matter; you just got what you wanted.</p>
			<p class="Para">It was a valuable lesson, and something that I want anyone reading this book to understand­—sometimes, to make your dream come true, you have to sacrifice a little bit, or even a lot. If we had borrowed another two hundred thousand dollars from somebody to buy all the things that I wanted, who knows—I might not be sitting here today writing this book because we would’ve crapped out. Because we <span class="serif-ital">really </span>didn’t have enough money. We <span class="serif-ital">just </span>squeaked by with what we had. So I want the young people who might be considering having their own restaurant one day, or young chefs who are thinking about it, to know the story of how we got to where we are. Everybody’s story is different, but if you read about one restaurant’s journey, you get a better idea of what it might take. We didn’t just wake up one day to overnight success, collecting accolades. Each good thing was a result of struggle, persistence, and a strong gut feeling that if we stuck to what we did, we’d eventually get there.</p>

		<p class="Para" id="page10">We had three months to renovate the space and hire kitchen and wait staff. Our first day of training was going to be May 6, 2008. And that’s when I met Matthew Conway, who became our general manager and sommelier. Our meeting was like something out of a gangster movie. He was supposed to meet me in the restaurant, which, at the time, was a preconstruction, closed building. I was sitting in the corner with my leather jacket and fingerless gloves on, and in walked this young, impressionable man, looking a little skittish, like he might be in the wrong place. When he saw me, I motioned over to him, <span class="serif-ital">Godfather </span>style—“Over here, kid”—and we sat there for the next hour talking about everything: food, wine, cocktails, the restaurant business in general, and what he wanted to do. To be 100 percent honest, I wasn’t so sure about him at the beginning of our conversation, but by the end, there was something in his demeanor that struck me the right way, and I knew he was the right guy for the job. At the time, Matthew was working at Café Gray, and a good friend of mine, Jimmy Bradley, who owns The Harrison and The Red Cat in New York, recommended that we talk to him. Believe it or not, Matthew is still with us to this day—one of the few employees who’s been with the restaurant since day one.</p>
			<p class="Para">Hiring the kitchen crew was the easy part. I locked that down early on. At the opening, we had about twenty-five people between the front and back of the house. Everything else took time and a lot of hard work.</p>
			<p class="Para">Before any construction started, we had to get the raw materials for the interior. All the wood that we’re famous for now, every single piece, Blumlo and I hauled with our bare hands. </p>
			<p class="Para">Blumlo’s family owned a sawmill, so one morning, we woke up at 4:30 a.m. and drove to his family’s sawmill in New Bedford, Massachusetts. There was all this wood in the backyard that had been sitting out for more than fifty years. Many pieces had grown gray over time, and remain so to this day. So Blumlo and I packed the wood into our truck, had lunch at his aunt and uncle’s house, and drove back to New York. Then we laid out the wood all over the floor of the restaurant and let it dry for a few days. Only after that could we start construction.</p>
			<p class="Para">We went in with sledgehammers and gutted the basement, the kitchen, and pretty much everything in between. I, myself, knocked off a few pieces of the subway tile, and it felt satisfying. </p>
			<p class="Para">But as the restaurant was coming together, Chris and I were ready to kill each other. A pragmatist who never forgot about the bottom line, Blumlo kept reminding me what we could, and more important, <span class="serif-ital">couldn’t </span>afford. I was the creative one, saying, “But we <span class="serif-ital">need </span>to have this; we <span class="serif-ital">need </span>to have that.” But Blumlo wasn’t having any of it—he was unemotional about our needs and his job was to make sure we didn’t spend ourselves into oblivion. It wasn’t personal, but we were butting heads. The money was tight and tensions were high. We both wanted to make something amazing; we were just looking at it from different vantage points. In any partnership, be it business or personal, it’s most beneficial to have both: the head and the heart. Too much of one and not enough of the other could spell trouble for whatever you want to build. In looking back, thank God I had the voice of reason in Blumlo. Without his pragmatic approach, who knows where we’d all be today?</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page11">And while the restaurant was taking shape, amidst the rubble, there was Craig Bero. Blumlo and I would be sitting in our unheated, dilapidated space going over blueprints, wearing hats and gloves for warmth, and Craig would come over with hot coffee and fresh pastries just to say hello. Often he’d come over with neighborhood people, “Meet Marc and Chris,” he’d say, “they’re going to open a great restaurant here!” In a thoughtful, gentle, neighborly, almost small-town manner, Craig was our introduction to the area and its residents.</p>
			<p class="Para">Blumlo and I met Craig by happenstance—stopping for coffee at the Cosmopolitan Café in Tribeca, which he owns. Later on we learned that Craig happened to have been a server at the River Café in Brooklyn while my father was a chef there years ago. The three of us got to know one another, and while we were going through construction, Craig would just come over to make sure we didn’t freeze. In addition to introducing us to the Tribeca community, he was instrumental in connecting us to different vendors and artisans. As if hot coffee and pastries weren’t generous enough, Craig helped us in ways that went above and beyond: The iron shutter in the back of the restaurant was from Craig. He had also introduced us to the welder to make the original “Forge” sign. From feeding us and literally keeping us warm, to introducing us to the community board, Craig became a huge emotional part of the restaurant’s beginnings. </p>

			<p class="H3">Hospitalized on Opening Day</p>
			<p class="Para1st">The morning of the day the restaurant was supposed to open, I landed in the hospital—and stayed there for a week. I woke up so early that it was still dark out. I got out of bed to get some water, but on my way to the kitchen, I suddenly felt sharp abdominal pain so intense that I fell to the floor. It felt as if someone was stabbing me in the stomach.</p>
			<p class="Para">Back then I was living in Chelsea and the nearest hospital was the now-shuttered St. Vincent’s. I wound up, literally, crawling there at six in the morning.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page12">I checked myself into the hospital, and was told they planned to keep me overnight. While the nurse was giving me painkillers, I grabbed her hands and told her I needed to be at work before five p.m. She looked at me and just laughed—and then told the doctor I was delirious. I was stubborn: I tried to get up and leave, but the hospital personnel held me down. I kept saying, “I have to leave, I have to go!” But they were adamant: “You can’t. We have to run tests on you. You could be very sick.” I just kept repeating, “No, you don’t understand. My restaurant is opening <span class="serif-ital">today</span>, and I have to be the one to open it!”</p>
			<p class="Para">I wound up being admitted with a severe intestinal infection, and I stayed there for the <span class="serif-ital">whole first week </span>of the restaurant’s life! Can you imagine, opening a restaurant and being too sick to be there in person? Or coming into a newly opened restaurant and discovering the chef is nowhere to be seen? Scrambling, I managed to arrange for my father and a few friends to cook that week. But I remember lying in the hospital bed and looking up thinking, “Okay, I get it, it’s <span class="serif-ital">not </span>going to be easy. But give me a fucking break! Throw me a bone here!”</p>
			<p class="Para">A week later when I was getting out of the hospital, I got news that one of my best friends from college suddenly, and unexpectedly, passed away. It was a complete shock; I couldn’t wrap my head around it. That same week, my grandfather passed away as well. As if the hospital wasn’t enough, losing my grandfather and my friend all in the same week felt like being sucker-punched.</p>
			<p class="Para">But I had no time to emotionally fall apart. I had to plunge headfirst into work. And there was a lot of it. I had no butcher or prep cooks because we didn't have the funds for it yet, so we had to make do with what we had. I saw the payroll that Blumlo put together and said, “Okay, I’ll make it happen.” We were doing 110 to 120 covers and I had to get to the restaurant at seven a.m. to prep everything for the day, do all the butchering, and do all the cooking.</p>
			<p class="Para">The second week we were open, our air conditioning broke. I remember looking into the dining room and seeing Gael Greene, formerly of <span class="serif-ital">New York</span> magazine, wiping her forehead with a napkin. My girlfriend’s entire family came in and her mother was fanning herself with a menu—you could see the beads of sweat on her face. I almost died.</p>
			<p class="Para">When the restaurant opened, our bank account had a big, fat zero in it, and every single penny made a difference. We raised twenty thousand dollars the first week, and another twenty thousand dollars a week later. And we were using the first twenty thousand to pay the staff. Blumlo and I were living hand to mouth; we didn’t pay ourselves for I can’t even remember how long. Sometimes, I’d take out some money to buy myself some milk, bread, and water for my house. But that was about it—there was no paycheck coming through. And we didn’t know how long that was going to last.</p>

			<p class="Para" id="page13">Our opening staff displayed amazing grace under pressure. In that uncertain, stressful time, they were asked to do things that I’d never wish upon my worst enemy and I will always be grateful to them for their incredibly hard work. But when you have seven people trying to do a menu that requires twelve people—you can imagine what transpires. On paper, our food was exactly what I wanted, but on the plate, the execution was not close to the concept—it wasn’t consistent. If I took a day off, I was sure to have a mental breakdown—I didn’t feel confident not being in the kitchen. My days off were a blur of sleeping, fighting a hangover, and having a meltdown.</p>
			<p class="Para">I remember coming in to work and just trying to get through the day. On any given day the responsibilities I had ran the gamut: I had to order six steaks knowing I’d need to order twenty more for the weekend. But since we didn’t have any money, and we owed the meat guy two months of balances, how the fuck was I supposed to get that done? Charm him into selling me meat? We were handing out paychecks, but knew that half of them were going to bounce.</p>
			<p class="Para">And the early reviews showed where we were lacking—they weren’t kind to us, and some of it was deserved. We weren’t running the restaurant I had originally envisioned. Don’t get me wrong—we were making great food and I was proud of it. But I wanted us to do even better, and with so few cooks on the line and me being the butcher, the meat cook, and everything in between, we were a few hands short to be truly outstanding. Maybe I should’ve just sucked it up budgetwise and hired another prep cook—that probably would have helped us out a great deal. But hindsight is twenty-twenty.</p>
			<p class="Para">What we lacked was consistency, and in an excellent restaurant, every dish has to be made as if a <span class="serif-ital">New York Times</span> dining critic is asking for it. When I cooked food for the staff, they loved it—it was amazing. But it’s easy to make a dish once. An executive chef is expected to make a dish once, give it to his staff, and have them replicate it over and over and over and over, and execute it perfectly each and every time. And that just wasn’t happening.</p>
			<p class="Para">So 2008 was baptism by fire. We got some loyal clientele, and I learned a lot during those few months, but it was a humbling, grounding experience. And as we were on our way to doing better, the recession hit everyone fast and furious, turning 2009 into another year of uphill battles. It was the year we really had to hang on for dear life.</p>
		
			<p class="H2">2009</p>
			<p class="H3">Things Fall Apart</p>
			<p class="Para1st">I turned thirty right before the New Year—it was a raucous night. The coming year wasn’t anywhere on my mind, but it probably should’ve been. The weight of the impending recession loomed even in late 2008, but we just weren’t paying as close attention as we should have been.</p>
			<p class="Para">When 2009 rolled in, talk of recession increased, and the markets were tanking, but we didn’t understand just how bad it was about to get. Things really fell apart around February. Many of our patrons lost their jobs, and suddenly, people were staying at home instead of going out to eat. The restaurant attendance dried out almost overnight. Empty tables and chairs made things more dire for us, financially, and we had to take out more loans.</p>
			<p class="Para">To throw another wrench in the works, in February, we had to change the restaurant’s name. Our name used to be Forge, my nickname, and we thought it fit us perfectly. A few months prior, a restaurant based in Miami by the same name, Forge, threatened us with a lawsuit if we didn’t change our name, claiming it was causing brand confusion and affecting their clientele. I have no idea how you could wind up dining at Forge in New York while trying to dine at Forge in Miami, but we decided not to fight them on it and changed our name to Marc Forgione. We had a “funeral” party for the old name and invited some media for the renaming.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page14">Then in March, I got invited to the Maldives on a cooking trip. I remember, about a week into being there, I got the numbers from Blumlo—and I thought they were missing a zero. We were averaging fifteen to twenty covers a night and I thought I was going to come back to a shut down restaurant. Immediately  after that email, I gave an interview where I was asked what it was like to be a successful restaurateur in New York, and all I could do was think, “I might be going back to an empty dining room. I might be done. This could be it.” It wasn’t what I thought success would feel like.</p>
			<p class="Para">When I came back, the restaurant was continuing to do fifteen to twenty covers a night – barely slogging along. My sous-chef wound up leaving—it just wasn’t a good place to be. I understood that it was time for him to go, but I knew that things were going to get harder with even fewer hands on deck. By then, it was just me and three cooks in the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="Para1st">As a result of having so few hands in the kitchen, some of our best dishes that year were products of sheer necessity. I was working fourteen-hour days, six days a week; and when you’re constantly short-staffed, in order to survive, you have to become more inventive. If we hadn’t managed to adjust, we wouldn’t have made it. If I had just thrown up my arms and said, “I can’t cook like that,” we would’ve died. I had to put my ego aside and say, “Okay, <span class="serif-ital">this </span>is how we’re going to make this work.”</p>
			<p class="Para">Our <a href="FORGE_06_Poultry_PPF.xhtml#page213">Chicken Under a Brick</a> was a happy accident. Because I didn’t have time to season the chickens when the orders were coming in, I started to season the skin in the mornings and would let the salt penetrate the chicken over the course of the day. This move turned out to be the secret to making the crispiest, most delicious chicken skin ever. At the celebrated Zuni Café in San Francisco, they do an even longer cure, and their chicken is one of my favorites.</p>
			<p class="Para">Another hit that came out of that short-staffed year was a breaded, deep-fried pork chop. With so few hands in the kitchen, deep-frying was easier than pan-frying. But if you had told me a few months earlier that I was going to be deep-frying a pork chop, I would’ve said that you were crazy—who deep-fries a pork chop? Well, we did. </p>
			<p class="Para">Cooking meat was another example of stretching our dollars: I couldn’t get the twenty-eight-day dry aged steaks; instead I was getting flatirons. And we were making those steaks taste like a million bucks. </p>
			<p class="Para"><a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page179">Lobster ravioli</a> was another example of kitchen ingenuity, though this was a display of stretching our already-empty wallet. A pricey appetizer, it allowed us to be creative with our ingredients and make them go a long way. People loved it—in the middle of recession, ordering lobster, even if it was a few pieces tucked into a few ravioli, felt luxurious and comforting. We added some white asparagus and a mix of morels and white button mushrooms, and, since lobster and corn were a natural fit, plated it over a corn-polenta puree. The liquid we cooked the lobster in was saved and would become <a href="FORGE_12_Bones_PPF.xhtml#Lobster">lobster stock</a> for other dishes.</p>
			<p class="Para">In the end, patrons were coming in and leaving very happy with their food. But I wanted to do even more; I just had to ride it out through this recession—I had to hang on.</p>

		</div>
			
			<p class="H3">It’s Not Personal—It’s Business</p>
			<p class="Para1st">We took out more loans, constantly trying to figure out how to pay people, how to order food while having to explain to purveyors that we didn’t have the money to pay them back, but that we would—in the future.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page15">Some purveyors, like <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#page403">Dairyland</a>, <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page249">LaFrieda</a>, and a guy named Andrea from this place called Litchfield Farms (now <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#page82">Community Catch</a>), trusted me and didn’t pull their business even though, for a while, I owed them a <span class="serif-ital">lot </span>of money. Others weren’t as understanding or had less flexible balance sheets and pulled their business. A few even tried to sue me.</p>
			<p class="Para">The purveyors who stuck with me said, “Look, even though you owe me money, I am still going to deliver you meat.” “I know you owe us, but we’ll still drop the fish off for you.” Those who trusted me and didn’t pull their business are still the purveyors I use to this day, and I plan to be with them until the very end. I don’t hold a grudge against those vendors that had to stop dealing with us: It’s not personal—it’s business. But at the same time, I am particularly grateful to those who stayed and trusted us. At the end of the day, it’s people dealing with other people, and it’s really all about relationships. The purveyors who stuck by me treated me like a human being first and a client second. They showed a great deal of grace and humanity and I will forever be grateful to them. I can’t ever properly tell them just how much their actions meant to me.</p>
			<p class="H3">A Turning Tide</p>
			<p class="Para1st">We got to the summer of 2009 and things were just dead; the restaurant was practically empty in August. It was costing us more to open the doors for a dishwasher, a waiter, and myself than to keep them closed. My cooks were in a tight spot: They needed the money but couldn’t get another job because no one was hiring in the wake of the recession. At the same time, they were pulling <span class="serif-ital">some </span>kind of a salary, while I was not paying myself anything. When you’re running a business, <span class="serif-ital">especially </span>if you’re losing money, you’re the last person to get paid.</p>
			<p class="Para">Finally, in September, Blumlo and I sat down to have a tough conversation. We were looking at our numbers, and they were horrible—we owed a lot of money, and that amount was getting bigger and bigger. With tears in our eyes, we both came to the conclusion that it was probably best to sell the restaurant. I felt like I had failed—my dream was dying.</p>
			<p class="Para">Around the same time, Danny Abrams had started coming in for dinner and finally approached me with an offer to do a restaurant swap. I was to take one of his restaurants in the West Village and he was going to take my space on Reade Street. We met up to discuss this several times, and everyone, including Blumlo, agreed that it was the best possible outcome. On the night of October 4, 2009, I sat down at home, wrote an informal offer letter, and went to bed.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page16">I woke up the next day to find a voicemail on my cell phone. A man speaking in heavily French-accented English said, “Bonjour, Monsieur Forgione! I wanted to personally congratulate you and welcome you to the Michelin club. Your restaurant was awarded a star. Congratulations! We’d love for you to join us tonight for a celebratory glass of Champagne.”</p>
			<p class="Para">I replayed that voicemail several times—I simply couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a prank and even called my old boss Laurent to make sure it wasn’t him. “Hey man, was that you on the voicemail?” Laurent laughed, “No way! Congratulations! Go check the list—but that wasn’t me!”</p>
			<p class="Para">As soon as I realized that the voicemail, and therefore the Michelin star, was real, I knew my luck was changing. The tide was turning. Someone had noticed what we were doing and liked it enough to give us a star. I was on cloud nine.</p>
			<p class="Para">As soon as I came to my senses, I immediately ripped up the offer I had typed the night before. I didn’t want to go down in history as the only chef who got a Michelin star and sold his restaurant on the same day. I called Danny right away and explained the situation. And though he was disappointed that the swap wasn’t happening but was happy for me. We ended our conversation on good terms; he understood where I was coming from and said he would’ve done the same thing had he been in my shoes.</p>
			<p class="Para">That Michelin star was more than just a reward or a lifeline for me. It carried an important lesson: Stick to doing what you do best, don’t deviate from the plan, and someone will notice. The Michelin critics did.</p>
			<p class="Para">Right off the bat, we started doing ten more covers a day and there was more interest in the restaurant. And while we were still losing money, we were losing less of it.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page17">It also felt a little gratifying to have the star: While everyone was telling me to change my menu, to “give the people what they want,” to adapt the food to the difficult times, I stood my ground and didn’t change my approach to cooking. Offering hamburgers, everyone argued, would attract a wider clientele. The restaurant would be filled with people. And while on paper, their advice made sense, something about it felt off. Making hamburgers might have attracted more people, but I wasn’t a hamburgers person. There’s nothing wrong with a good burger, but that’s just not who I was. I remember arguing with Blumlo, “Just because you put steak frites on the menu doesn’t mean doors are gonna fly open.” So I kept pushing back because I felt that serving burgers wouldn’t change our bottom line—we’d be serving more people, but our profit margin would remain the same.</p>
			<p class="Para">Bistro fare was not the answer, either. The answer was, all along, under our noses: Stick with what we were doing best. And pray. And if we were going to go down, at least we would go down fighting. The way I saw it was, “If you’re going to kill me, do it, but I’m going to die trying.”</p>
			<p class="Para">I’m not patting myself on the back for having a “vision”­—it just worked out the way that it did. But I’m glad that I listened to my gut and didn’t change the menu; I’m glad that I stuck to cooking the food that I thought I was <span class="serif-ital">meant </span>to be cooking. The same gut feeling I had when I first saw the restaurant space was what said to me, “Don’t change a thing. Just keep doing what you’re doing. Just keep doing it, and if it doesn’t work, it just wasn’t meant to be.”</p>
			<p class="Para">If I had wavered and changed the menu, I don’t think we would’ve gotten that star. Someone noticed what we were doing and liked it; and I’m pretty sure that one of the things they noticed was that instead of buying twenty pounds of chopped meat and making twenty burgers, we were buying four lobsters and making twenty lobster dishes out of them. And instead of being stymied by our tight budget and growing debt, we tried to be creative and, for the most part, succeeded.</p>
			<p class="Para">In retrospect, being put in this position, after having worked at Michelin- and <span class="serif-ital">New York Times</span>–rated restaurants where creativity was not constrained by budgets, was one of the best professional challenges. Being creative with all the available resources is a lot easier than being creative on a tight budget.</p>
			<p class="Para">Around the time when we got the star, Barry Frisch, one of my sous-chefs, joined our team. He was supposed to be with us only for a couple of months, but circumstances changed and he stayed with us indefinitely, which was a huge gain for us. The sous-chef before him had a drinking problem, so eventually I had to let the guy go. With Barry, and more hands in the kitchen, the food started to get a bit more intricate. But I still had only one day off, which, for me, was a day for sleeping and stressing out. And most likely nursing a hangover.</p>

			<p class="H3">Looking within Myself</p>
			<p class="Para1st">I was in a curious place in my life. I was thirty years old, a business owner, and I had just moved in with my girlfriend. All of a sudden, life got very serious, and I was finding it all a bit overwhelming. My friend Robbie suggested that I join him in taking part in some Native American rituals, and it sounded like a good idea. When I was growing up, my father was always very involved in Native American tradition and rituals, so in a way, it was always part of my life. I decided to go, thinking maybe it would help me figure things out.</p>
			<p class="Para">We left the city and went to my friend Barnaby’s house, where a teepee had been erected in the backyard. There were about twenty or thirty people as well as a shaman, who gave us some Native American medicine and began to pray—either to the grandmother or the grandfather spirits. As I listened to him, all these questions were swirling in my head. I was desperately searching for answers, feeling like I had arrived at a crossroads. <span class="serif-ital">Can you handle all that’s coming up? Can you step up to the plate? Or are you going to crumble?</span></p>
			<p class="Para" id="page18">Every time I asked the grandfather or the grandmother what I was supposed to be doing, the answer was always the same: <span class="serif-ital">Quit your whining. You got yourself this far. Wake up and keep on pushing through. You can do this.</span></p>
			<p class="Para">And I don’t know what, specifically, worked, but these ceremonies, as I got more involved in them, really helped me emotionally and spiritually. In 2008 and a good part of 2009, I spent a lot of time beating myself up. I was at the point in my life where I needed deeper, more purposeful meaning. I questioned things so much that I started to doubt myself.</p>
			<p class="Para">But these sessions propelled me forward and helped me draw strength from within. Instead of focusing on the external and the ephemeral, I was able to find strength inside myself. The answer in that teepee, as always, was just to look within myself. It was a powerful realization.</p>
			<p class="Para">When I opened my restaurant, I was young and a bit ignorant of the realities of the world. Everything that happened during those two years had forced me to grow up really quickly. I had the biggest expectations of myself and the restaurant—and with the economy being what it was, what I was experiencing, while good, wasn’t what I had envisioned. As 2009 drew to a close, we were finally becoming the restaurant I had imagined from day one. When we were raising money for the restaurant, I had no doubt in my mind that this is what it was going to be on opening day. But life has a funny way of humbling you and making you grow up really quickly!</p>

			<p class="H2">2010</p>
			<p class="H3">A Flurry of Activity</p>
			<p class="Para1st">Of all the cooking shows out there, <span class="serif-ital">The</span> <span class="serif-ital">Next Iron Chef </span>was the one I wanted to be on. Ever since I saw the first season, which Chef Michael Symon won, I thought, <span class="serif-ital">Wow, I’d love to get the opportunity to do that. </span>At the time the first season ended, I didn’t think I was ready to do it, but as time went on I thought it would be a good challenge for me and would teach me a lot as a chef.</p>
			<p class="Para">The spiritual work I had been doing for the past six months started to pay off sometime in March; I was beginning to understand myself a little better. The restaurant was moderately busy, especially given that it was winter; and I felt like I was finally getting a handle on my personal life.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page19">In the spring, our pastry chef left and I was trying to do the pastries on my own, adding another responsibility to my plate. It was proving to be too much. At that time, one of our hostesses, whose nickname is Lady Ashton, asked me if she could bake me a chocolate cake (see <a href="FORGE_09_Desserts_PPF.xhtml#page325">the recipe</a>). And with that chocolate cake—which was amazing by the way—she went from the front of the house as a hostess to the back of the house as a pastry chef. Which was great, because the restaurant was starting to get busier.</p>
			<p class="Para">And then it happened: In early April, a Food Network talent scout called me for a phone interview—she said my name had come up for the third season of <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef</span>. The scout asked me everything about my life: where I came from, with whom I’ve worked, why I loved food. It felt like a therapy session; it was actually kind of fun. I guess it went very well, because Food Network called me back and said that I had made it through the first round of auditions.</p>
			<p class="Para">Round two was in the Food Network’s offices in Chelsea. I walked into this dark room where they shone a light in my face. I couldn’t really make out the faces behind the light, and questions were coming at me from every direction. When it was over, they just said to me, in a typical showbiz sort of way, “Thanks for coming in. We’ll call you.”</p>
			<p class="Para">On my way out, I happened to glance at a piece of paper on the table that listed the names of the other chefs coming in to interview, and there were some big ones: Tourondel, Gütenbrunner, White—I was up against serious talent. I thought maybe I’d been brought in to be typecast as an upstart young kid.</p>
			<p class="Para">I was told that casting decisions would be made by the time taping began on the Monday following Memorial Day, but by the third week of May, I still  hadn’t heard anything decisive. They kept saying, “Sorry to string you along, but we still don’t know.” I wasn’t told no, but I wasn’t told yes, either. It was a waiting game.</p>
			<p class="H3">Sir, It Is Time for You to Leave My Restaurant</p>
			<p class="Para1st">Meanwhile, the month of May was keeping us sufficiently busy. We weren’t completely full, but we weren’t empty either. The thing about 2010 was that no matter how bad of a night we had, it was still much better than any night we had in 2009. And then Ron Lieber came in, got kicked out of the restaurant, and wrote that infamous piece in the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times.</span></p>
			<p class="Para">It was a Saturday night, still early. We had about six tables come in and we had put them in the back by the kitchen door. About ten amuse orders had come in, and the completed dishes took a really long time getting out of the kitchen. Meanwhile, I was showing the cook how to do one of the evening’s appetizers, so I wasn’t staying on top of the amuses. I came back around and saw the amuses still sitting there.</p>
			<p class="Para">I was annoyed. “How the fuck did the amuses not leave already when the appetizers are ready to go?”</p>
			<p class="Para">And one of my runners, who still works at the restaurant, bless his heart, responded, “You know, if <span class="serif-ital">you </span>hadn’t made the amuses so complicated, they <span class="serif-ital">would </span>have gone out already.”</p>
			<p class="Para">I don’t know, maybe he was having a bad day or something, but the response was so out of character for him. My entire kitchen staff was there—everyone suddenly grew quiet. That manner of addressing the chef, <span class="serif-ital">especially</span> in front of the entire kitchen staff, was completely out of line.</p>
			<p class="Para">So I started to yell and wave my arms—and in the process, slammed my hand on a table. And when I did that, the ticket rail that was filled with glass marbles fell. Suddenly, all you heard was this thundering sound of marbles falling everywhere. And in the midst of it all, some guy peeked his head into the kitchen and said, “Look, whatever you’re yelling about in here, try to keep it down. We’re not interested out there.” And then he disappeared.</p>
			<p class="Para">The kitchen grew even quieter. For a patron to come into a restaurant kitchen and discipline the chef is in and of itself pretty ballsy. But I kind of understood—what was going on in the kitchen was, admittedly, very loud. </p>
			<p class="Para" id="page20">I took a deep breath and calmed down a bit. The next few minutes are ones I’ll never forget—they play in my mind like a movie reel. I remember thinking, <span class="serif-ital">You could just stay here and cook the food, or you could go out there and say something. </span>It was as if I had a vision: I saw a road with two paths, stay or go out there. Something in my body, for whatever reason, said, <span class="serif-ital">Go out there</span>.</p>
			<p class="Para">I walked out into the dining room and headed for the table where the man was sitting—I wanted to offer an explanation and an apology to him and the other patrons in the dining room.</p>
			<p class="Para">I hadn’t planned on asking anyone to leave. But as I started to head in the direction of the man’s table, I saw a woman, presumably his wife, start to gather her things. At the time I found it odd. “Sir,” I said (I remember calling him “sir”), “just so you know, the only reason I was getting upset in there is because I want to make sure that all your food is perfect.”</p>
			<p class="Para">He was facing away from me as I addressed him. He cut me off midsentence. Without even looking at me, he raised his hand inches away from my face as if to hush me. “Yeah, yeah, we’re not interested.” He still hadn’t turned around to face me.</p>
			<p class="Para">I clenched my fists as hard as I could, and took a deep breath. At this point I was staring hard at a spot on the wall.</p>
			<p class="Para">“Okay, ladies and gentlemen,” I finally managed to say, “you are all welcome to stay, but I’m not going to serve any food at this table while this gentleman is sitting here. <span class="serif-ital">Sir</span>, it is time for you to leave my restaurant.”</p>
			<p class="Para">The man finally turned to look at me. “So <span class="serif-ital">I </span>have to leave?”</p>
			<p class="Para">“Yes. <span class="serif-ital">You</span><span class="serif-ital"> </span>have to leave.”</p>
			<p class="Para">He started to get up. Later on, in his article, he would write that my yelling, the scene that I caused, made the diners exchange uncomfortable glances, suggesting that his major concern was to keep the peace and ensure a pleasant dining experience. He was there, as he reminded me, paying money to eat, not to listen to me admonish my staff. But as he started to get up, he began, very loudly, to address the other patrons. “Oh, it looks like <span class="serif-ital">I’m </span>the bad guy and <span class="serif-ital">I </span>have to leave!” The dining room grew so quiet you could hear a pin drop.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page21">We walked him out, and I went back to the kitchen; the rest of his table had also departed. I made midcourse dishes and special appetizers for the other five tables sitting in that section. I went around, sat at each table, and apologized for the scene that had unfolded. One table agreed with Ron Lieber: My yelling was ill-advised. Another table sided with me: I had a right to run my kitchen the way I saw fit. But we all talked about it, and there was a healthy, respectful discourse. By the end of the night it had sort of turned into a joke—“At least there was a good show while you were dining!”</p>
			<p class="Para">After service ended that night, I bought a drink for the runner who had commented on the amuses, and we hugged it out.</p>
			<p class="Para">The weekend came and went, but on Monday, I got a call at the restaurant from the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times</span>. I got on the phone, and the voice on the other end said to me, “Hey, my name is Ron Lieber. You might not remember me, but I’m the guy you kicked out on Saturday night.”</p>
			<p class="Para">He paused, as if to give me a chance to apologize.</p>
			<p class="Para">Instead, I just said, “What’s up, dude?”</p>
			<p class="Para">“I’m writing an article on this incident . . . ”</p>
			<p class="Para">Right away I said to him, “I’m telling you, this is <span class="serif-ital">not</span> a good idea to write that article. For either one of us. It’s not going to come out right and <span class="serif-ital">neither </span>one of us will look good at the end of this. It’s just going to cause something stupid.”</p>
			<p class="Para">But we talked anyway—it was obvious he wanted to do the piece. I made it very clear to him that he got kicked out for one reason and one reason only: He was rude, out of line, and above all disrespectful to me in my kitchen. And where I come from, you never show disrespect to anyone in his own house.</p>
			<p class="Para">At the end of our conversation, he asked me, if I could do it all over again, would I still do the same thing?</p>
			<p class="Para">I didn’t even pause. “Absolutely.”</p>
			<p class="Para">A few days later, Lieber’s piece came out and went viral. It turned into a national debate. Within a few hours of being published, the piece garnered dozens if not hundreds of comments from all over the country—Wisconsin, California, Texas—it was a coast-to-coast discussion piece, and it happened instantly. Everyone threw their hat in: Some people were firmly in my camp, and others sided with Lieber, pledging never to set foot in my restaurant.</p>
			<p class="Para">The piece, for the most part, didn’t bother me, but what frustrated me was that I never got to tell my side of it, not on the same platform anyway. As a <span class="serif-ital">New York Times </span>writer, Ron Lieber had a large, captive audience, and it didn’t feel fair that while he had the opportunity to tell his side of the story, I never got the same opportunity to tell mine. What <span class="serif-ital">would’ve </span>been fair is for the paper to have had us do point-counterpoint pieces side by side. But that didn’t happen. Instead, it was a very personal piece, and it felt somewhat demeaning—Lieber wrote that he felt he was kicked out because my manhood suffered at his bravery. Instead, the piece clearly read as if he, himself, felt slighted and “smacked around,” and because he is a writer for the behemoth <span class="serif-ital">New York Times</span>, it was his duty to rein in the big bad chef who abuses his staff.</p>
			<p class="Para">But that incident signaled a turning point for us at the restaurant. Everybody, at some point in their life, reaches a point (or several) when they make a decision that affects the rest of their life. Ninety-five percent of the people don’t even realize what that point is. It just happens; they don’t think about it. </p>
			<p class="Para">I’m very lucky to know exactly when that instant occurred for me—it occurred at that very point in time, and I got to see it. It was simply a choice of staying in the kitchen or going out and clearing the air with Mr. Lieber. And I chose to go out there. But in looking back on the whole incident, that was the moment that changed so many things for me. In looking back, I <span class="serif-ital">know </span>that was a defining moment for me. Maybe if I hadn’t gone out there, he would have eaten his dinner, left, and never wrote about us in the <span class="serif-ital">Times</span>. And then I wouldn’t have gotten on the <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef</span>, and maybe I wouldn’t have written the book you are now holding in your hands. I feel lucky to be able to pinpoint that moment in my life.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page22">For the record: Since we opened the restaurant, I’ve kicked out only four people. And all four times, Ron Lieber included, it was because the patrons were being disrespectful. One patron called my female manager a “cunt” and was asked to leave. Another time, a customer ordered a steak and sent it back because he said it was overcooked. We cooked him a new steak and sent it out. He sent it back again, citing the same issue, and as the waitress was heading back into the kitchen, said, “What, you’re <span class="serif-ital">so </span>stupid that you can’t order a fucking steak? I don’t know how you make it to work being as dumb as you are.” He, too, was asked to leave. You get the idea.</p>
			<p class="Para">The point I am trying to make here is I’m <span class="serif-ital">not </span>Gordon Ramsay, and I didn’t take cues from his show on how to treat my team. But at some point or another, each and every chef, from time to time, has to address his staff in a manner that might come across as stern. No matter how nice and calm you are, it just happens. The kitchen is a high-pressure area; everything moves quickly, and there’s a lot happening. Sometimes tempers flare and people yell, but conflicts get resolved and life moves on.</p>
			<p class="Para">I’m sure that as a result of the Lieber piece, we lost a few customers forever. That is unfortunate, but it is what it is. But immediately after the article came out, the restaurant started doing twenty to twenty-five more covers a night! At first we were worried that people might be coming in to try and get kicked out, but nobody acted up, and Lieber’s article, ironically, wound up helping, instead of hurting, us. The month wound up flying by—and we were busy!</p>

			<p class="H3">The Next Iron Chef</p>
			<p class="Para1st">I finally found out that I was cast in <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef </span>right before Memorial Day weekend. It felt very last minute, but I thought that was how it was supposed to happen. Later, I found out that the other chefs had known for months that they’d been cast. I still don’t know if it was the Lieber incident that made me look like a more interesting contestant, but I got on the show, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
			<p class="Para">So that Memorial Day Monday, I flew to Los Angeles to film the show. I told Barry, my sous-chef, that he couldn’t take any days off until I came back. It could have been a week into filming or four weeks, depending on how long I lasted. The rule of <span class="serif-ital">Next Iron Chef </span>was: You lost, you went home. Barry wound up working four weeks straight without a single day off. </p>
			<p class="Para">Before I went to Los Angeles, my mom gave me some good advice. “Whatever the first thought is that comes to mind when you see the ingredients,” she said, “go with that first thought. Go with your gut. You got to where you are by being you and listening to your gut. Don’t stop being you.” And I followed her advice. Every time I saw an ingredient, I’d close my eyes, and the first thing I saw, that’s what I went with.</p>
			<p class="Para">Being on the show was an incredibly intimidating, humbling experience. All of a sudden I was thrown into a competition with some of the country’s top chefs. The first person I saw when I got there was Ming Tsai, and shortly thereafter I met everyone else. There were James Beard award winners, Michelin star recipients, and awards all over the place—a star-studded cast. From the very first battle, I felt like the dark horse. I won the second battle overall, and while it boosted my confidence, I didn’t think I could win the whole thing. At the end of the show, people were telling me that they knew early on I would be there until almost the very end, if not <span class="serif-ital">the </span>very end, but at the time, I just couldn’t see it. I was just hoping that some exposure would help the restaurant. The lack of pressure to win might have been the best thing for me. It allowed me to take chances and shoot from the hip. Some of that helped me in the process, and some of it hurt me. But overall, it wound up working well for me. While others might have been agonizing that a certain decision might make or break their battle, and made safer choices in the end, I just went with my gut feeling. I wasn’t playing not to lose; I was playing just to play.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page23">At the semifinals, four chefs were left: Ming Tsai, Celina Tio, Marco Canora, and me. <span class="serif-ital">This just might be possible,</span> I thought to myself. The theme of the battle was Las Vegas, where everyone received a luxury ingredient. The judges announced Marco Canora as the winner of that battle, so he moved up. Celina Tio didn’t win, and immediately had to leave the room. So it was just Ming Tsai and me left with the judges. Up until that point, we all kind of thought that the show was set up to get Ming to win that season. It kind of made sense: Ming has all the accolades, a show, and was already a celebrity. So in my head I started to get ready to go, thinking, <span class="serif-ital">I made it all the way to the semifinals—great showing anyway. This should really help the restaurant.</span></p>
			<p class="Para">And as Alton Brown started to announce the winner, I started to leave—I was convinced that I was the one who was going home. It took a few seconds to register that I had won the semifinals and was staying for the final round. It was only at that point that it occurred to me, for the first time, that I could actually win this whole thing.</p>
			<p class="Para">The theme of the final battle was “Honor,” specifically Thanksgiving. All ten battles on the show had theme words associated with them. When I heard the word “honor,” I immediately interpreted it as, literally, “honoring the Pilgrims and the Native Americans” who came together for the very first Thanksgiving meal. When they announced it, I felt as if I had found the golden ticket. As cheesy as it might sound, the year leading up to this competition had been the toughest of my life, and what had helped me through it all was attending the Native American rituals. Without a second thought, I decided that this battle was my opportunity to do something to honor the Native Americans who have given me so much comfort during a tough time. Instead of what we now consider a traditional Pilgrim-influenced Thanksgiving meal, I wanted to do something that reflected the people who were here before the Europeans arrived. </p>

			<p class="caption">Just found out I won</p>
		</div>
		</div>
			
			<p class="Para">I did some research about the very first Thanksgiving. Surprisingly, we know quite a bit about it because a gentleman by the name of Edward Winslow meticulously documented it in a letter he wrote to England describing the dinner.</p>
			<p class="Para">I decided to take all the ingredients present at that meal: huckleberries, cornmeal, duck, venison, squash, and such, and get rid of what we think of as traditional Thanksgiving dishes. There was no cranberry sauce, turkey, or mashed potatoes—none of those were present at the first Thanksgiving. The year 1621, was, in fact, the year potatoes arrived on the shores of what is now the United States, but they weren’t at the feast. Instead, the Pilgrims and the Native Americans shared sweet potatoes. The original Thanksgiving meal would feel untraditional to the modern palate. It was a big risk—but one I was willing to take.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page24">To put it in baseball terms, this is how I saw it: You’re a baseball player, it’s the bottom of the ninth, and the pitches are coming down the middle. You could probably win with a bunt, if you wanted to, but you feel like you could hit that home run, so you just swing for it. If you miss it, everybody hates you and blames you for taking that risk. But if you hit the ball out of the ballpark—well, then you’re a legend!</p>
			<p class="Para">After we presented our dishes before the judges, they locked themselves away for three hours to deliberate. Those were the slowest three hours of my life; the suspense was killing me and Marco. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they brought us back to announce the winner. When they pulled down the curtain, and the picture behind it was of my face—my knees buckled and I would have fallen had my chefs not caught me. Tears were coming out of my eyes, and I was grinning from ear to ear like a five year old. I couldn’t believe I had won. After two of the hardest years of my life, to win this competition and to feel such euphoria and joy was overwhelming.</p>
			<p class="Para">My family had the opportunity to watch the finale as it was taping, but were not allowed to hear the results. The evening after the finale was taped, I had to stay behind to hear the judges’ decision, and once it was done I headed to the Gansevoort Hotel where my family was waiting for me.</p>
			

		
		
		<div class="full-image">
			<img alt="Coast_to_coast.tif" src="image/Coast_to_coast_fmt.jpg"/>
		</div>
		
			
			<p class="Para">I walked into the Gansevoort and found my entire family completely and over-the-top drunk. My mother was reading tarot cards in the bathroom; my sister was drunk and crying. They couldn’t take the stress of waiting, so they just went on a bender. When I walked in, I had my shoulders shrugged, the kind of body language that suggested I had just lost. And then they all rushed over to hug me and everybody just started crying. And I said quietly to the group, as we were all holding one another, “You know, I don’t understand why everybody’s crying. Winning isn’t that sad of a thing.” As soon as they heard that, my mom started howling like a coyote and security had to actually escort her out of the hotel. My brother ordered more shots. And that is when my dad grabbed me and we went outside.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page25">Now, it’s fair to say that my father isn’t the most communicative or emotionally open guy—with me or anyone else—but he was clearly moved by what he saw me do in the kitchen stadium. Plus, he was a little drunk. At some point, he pulled me close and said, “While I was watching you present your food, for the first time in my life I felt like I was watching a man, and not just my son. I’m so proud of you.” And then my father started to cry. So, in turn, I started to cry. There we were, grabbing one another by the back of the head, our foreheads together, sobbing and hugging. At some point, a homeless guy wandered over to us. He stared at us crying and hugging and finally said, “I just want to tell you guys both, I’ve been homeless for seventeen years, and I haven’t seen my son or daughter in twenty. And after seeing what I just saw, I think I’m going to go and find them. God bless you both.” And he walked away.</p>
			<p class="Para">The next morning, I woke up with an unfamiliar feeling of lightness and calm. It was the first time in my professional life as a chef running my own restaurant, that I woke up without a knot in my stomach. Instead, I realized I was smiling. Though slightly hungover and achy from celebratory drinks with my family, I felt this unfamiliar-to-me sense of calm. I felt weightless, as if, for the past two years I had been walking around with an eight-ton elephant on my back, and, suddenly, it was gone. I found myself pacing back and forth in my apartment, swinging my arms around, feeling light and free. It was the first day that I knew the restaurant was going to be alright.</p>
			<p class="Para">I went out for coffee, skipping down the street and whistling. That day I walked all over the city, just smiling to myself and saying hello to people on the street. Feeling spontaneous, I decided to get tattoos to commemorate my win and added the number <span class="serif-ital">1621</span>, the year of the first Thanksgiving, to both of my arms.</p>
			<p class="Para">While I wanted to share my exciting news with others, under contract rules I couldn’t tell anyone I had won until the season finale aired. So for months, I had to walk around with this huge secret. I returned to the restaurant, and life was back to the usual grind. We still had bills to pay, and I had a restaurant to run. When you win the <span class="serif-ital">Next Iron Chef </span>battles, you get some money as a reward. Each and every one of those checks went straight into the restaurant—every single penny. As soon as it would reach me, I’d give it to Blumlo, who would deposit it in our bank and pay some bills. It wasn’t glamorous but it felt great to know the restaurant, and our restaurant family, were going to be okay. When the show aired in the fall, we set up Sunday night <span class="serif-ital">Next Iron Chef </span>viewing parties at the restaurant, with a big-screen television and everything—it was fun to watch it all together with our patrons.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page26">In looking back, <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef </span>was, <span class="serif-ital">by far</span>, the hardest, most intense cooking challenge I’ve ever had. I met some immensely talented people and made some lasting friendships. But it was a grueling four weeks: You lived, breathed, and exhaled food and nothing but food without a break. It was physically <span class="serif-ital">and </span>mentally draining; you were always thinking about what you were cooking next. While I was there, I couldn’t really call my restaurant or my girlfriend. I was allowed to, but I was having a hard time talking to people not involved in the competition. It was four weeks of being totally consumed by everything having to do with the show—everything was <span class="serif-ital">Iron Chef</span>. I had to pretty much shut myself off from the rest of the world.</p>
			<p class="Para">And without a doubt, competing on the show, against such immensely talented chefs, made me a much better, more resourceful, and more inventive cook. It made me even more fearless in the kitchen, and the dishes that followed after the competition ended and I got back to New York, showed that fearlessness. Something happened to my brain during the competition; something opened up creativity-wise, and it hasn’t shut down since.</p>
			<p class="Para">When you are forced out of your comfort zone, when you are required to think fast, you either rise to the occasion or crash and burn. For me, it was akin to a spiritual awakening and by far the best thing that has ever happened to me as a chef. It gave me the courage to say, “Fuck it! I can try <span class="serif-ital">anything</span> I want to.”</p>
			<p class="Para">So much of cooking is about confidence, and when I was starting out on my own as a chef and tried to take risks with my food during the recession, people were pushing back. Just as no one wanted to take risks with their finances at the time, no one wanted to take risks with food. Everyone wanted to eat the old standbys, the well-known comfort dishes: steak, mashed potatoes, roasted chicken. In winning the <span class="serif-ital">Iron Chef </span>title, the confidence, and morale, of everyone at the restaurant, especially myself, was growing again. The restaurant started to fill up, we started to take more risks with our food—and our patrons were loving it.</p>

			<p class="H3">Sam Sifton, the Everyman</p>
			<p class="Para1st">Fall snuck up on us after a fairly busy summer. I was at home getting ready for a business trip to Orlando one evening, about to sit down to dinner—solo—when my phone rang. It was Blumlo: “Sam Sifton just sat down.”</p>
			<p class="Para">Sam Sifton was then the dining critic for the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times</span>. And he was sitting down to eat at the restaurant—I had to be there! I grabbed my keys and rushed over to the restaurant. At the end of the night, I felt as if the evening had gone very well. <span class="serif-ital">Thank God we didn’t miss him</span>, I thought. We made him some great food and noted what he ate.</p>
			<p class="Para">The following day I was already in Orlando, and Sifton called me on my cell. “I’m publishing a review of the restaurant next week and just wanted to fact-check a few things.”</p>
			<p class="Para">And then he proceeded to ask me detailed questions about food I couldn’t remember him eating the night before, until I finally said, “<span class="serif-ital">When </span>did you have time to eat all that stuff?” And that’s when he laughed. “You’d be very surprised to learn how long I’ve been coming to your restaurant and enjoying it.” There was a pause before he continued, “Don’t worry about not recognizing me—most people don’t catch me.”</p>
			<p class="Para"><span class="serif-ital">How the fuck did we miss him?</span></p>
			<p class="Para">One of the things that made Sam Sifton a perfect restaurant critic is that he has that everyman look about him and blends in easily with the crowd. He had probably been coming in for four or five months before anyone caught on. But in retrospect, I’m glad we didn’t know he was there. We served him the same way we served everyone else, and he wrote a great review of the restaurant.</p>

When Ruth Reichl donned her disguises and went around reviewing restaurants as an everyday person, she uncovered a systemic problem that restaurants, particularly fine dining establishments, had: If you were somebody with power, the red carpet was rolled out for you; but if you were a nobody, your meal could’ve been good, or average, or maybe even subpar. Because there was no reason, no incentive for the restaurant to impress you, or maybe because some of those restaurants thought that the average person couldn’t tell the difference between great food and mediocre food. I wanted everyone, each paying customer, to have an amazing experience at my restaurant—every patron deserved that.</p>
			<p class="Para">And for that very reason, we didn’t then, and still don’t, have special food that we set aside for our “special” diners. Because we believe that every person paying money for their meal, wanting a good dinner, is special. We don’t have VIP steaks or fish—everything is the same for everybody. We want someone like Sam Sifton, who has a great deal of influence, to be treated in the same manner as any regular person with no influence at all coming in to eat at the restaurant. The review was a testament to the way we work. He could have been waited on by any server, any cook, any manager. We don’t have a special busboy or waiter. We don’t have a general manager managing the wine for VIPs. Everyone gets the same treatment.</p>
			<p class="Para">So the fact that we got such a great review and had no idea that Sifton was coming in all along stood as a testament to the religion I preached and continue to preach in my kitchen: Cook every dish as if you’re cooking your last. You can ask any of my line cooks—the food does not go out unless it’s done the way it’s <span class="serif-ital">supposed </span>to be done.</p>
			<p class="Para">Most new restaurants in New York get reviewed within three months of opening. Here’s what happens: A famous chef opens a new restaurant, and spends three months there with his corporate manager, corporate chef, corporate sommelier—the works. Everyone from the <span class="serif-ital">Village Voice </span>to the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times </span>reviews them in that three-month time frame, and then the whole corporate team ships out for a new venture. We got reviewed several years after opening—that’s a bit unusual.</p>

			<p class="Para" id="page28">The week the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times </span>review came out was dubbed the Magic Week. From Sunday through Friday of that week, something amazing and positive happened every single day for the restaurant. On Sunday <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef </span>premiered, and I had been introduced to the world as Chef Marc Forgione. On Monday, we learned that we had retained our Michelin star for a second year. On Tuesday, <span class="serif-ital">Zagat </span>raised us two points in food. On Wednesday, the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times </span>review came out. On Thursday, I was named a Rising Star for Star Chefs. And on Friday, we were at Taste of the Greenmarket and everyone was coming over to say hello and congratulations on the <span class="serif-ital">New York Times </span>review. And since that week (knock on wood), the restaurant has never been slow.</p>
			<p class="Para">A few nights before we did the <span class="serif-ital">Next Iron Chef </span>finale party, I had asked my good friend Little Hawk, a powerful medicine man of the Cherokee tribe, to come and bless the entire restaurant and, specifically, this one corner of the room, where we were having some trouble. The corner of the room in question, for whatever reason, Table 34 in particular, was just a magnet for hostility: that’s where Ron Lieber sat; it’s where people would frequently get into disagreements. And I knew that once the word got out that I had won <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef,</span> the restaurant was going to get busy and I didn’t want any additional problems. So I invited Little Hawk to bless the entire space, and in particular that corner. He blessed the restaurant that day; it was a beautiful and moving ceremony. And since that day, that corner of the room has been problem-free. Call it what you will, but there’s been no negativity there since.</p>
			<p class="Para">For the actual party, Little Hawk brought a freshly killed deer, which I thought was a funny coincidence because for battle Thanksgiving on <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef</span> I made a <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page264">venison loin</a> as part of the meal. </p>
			<p class="Para">“Look,” he said to me, “your life is about to change, and for the better, too.” I never uttered a word of my win to him, but he just knew. “But before we do all that, before the party starts, I want to teach you how to skin a deer.” And in the kitchen he went. It was a humbling moment for me. <span class="serif-ital">Remember where you come from, </span>Little Hawk was saying. <span class="serif-ital">Don’t lose sight of who you are.</span></p>
			<p class="Para">We skinned the deer together and made a venison chili out of the meat. Every bit of the animal went to use; not a scrap was wasted. Even the skull was saved and now graces the restaurant as a memento. Right before the party began, Little Hawk gave me a necklace, which I haven’t taken off since. The necklace’s symbol reminds me to reach for the stars but also to stay grounded.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page29">In mid-November we hired another sous-chef, Chris Zabita, and a few more cooks, and I became more involved in running the restaurant and not just being in the kitchen. We started to pay purveyors on time, buy the china that we needed, and finally purchase chef coats. We were fixing stuff that needed to be fixed. On Sunday nights, we threw <span class="serif-ital">The </span><span class="serif-ital">Next Iron Chef </span>viewing parties, which doubled our covers. And in 2010, thanks to an amazing fourth quarter, the restaurant actually showed a profit. It wasn’t a huge profit, but it was enough for us to cheer when we saw it on the balance sheet. When you go from losing money for a year and a half to having a gain, even a small one is cause for celebration! We had come a long way.</p>
			<p class="Para">Around that time I also met Lonny Sweet, who became my agent. Who would’ve thought that a line cook from Long Island would eventually have an agent? Certainly not me. Without him, many things would not have happened. Without Lonny, you would not be reading this book right now.</p>

			<p class="H2">2011</p>
			<p class="H3">A Well-Oiled Machine</p>
			<p class="Para1st">2011 was the year when we finally became the restaurant we had always wanted to become. We had enough hands on deck that people could take time off. We were paying back our investors, paying our purveyors on time, and paying our staff without worrying that our checks might bounce. The restaurant was finally running like a well-oiled machine; it had a rhythm all its own. We hired a meat cook, which means I was finally off the line and was able to focus on expediting and managing the process of getting the food ready and out the door. Finally, we had time to finish the food at the pass; we set up a whole station with finishing oils, salts, and micro greens, and it made a huge difference.</p>
			<p class="Para">We were busy every single day of the week. On any given night I’d walk around the dining room and meet diners from all across the country: Texas, California, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. They weren’t just visiting New York; they were especially coming to New York to eat at one or two restaurants, and we were <span class="serif-ital">one of the two</span>! We had become a destination.</p>
			<p class="Para">We finally got around to putting together our Classics Tasting Menu. The first day we unrolled the menu, we got about twenty-five orders of the tasting menu in one night. I remember that number because it hasn’t been that high since, and anyone who has ever cooked at, or run, a restaurant, will know how difficult it is to coordinate twenty-five tasting menus while also serving people who are ordering à la carte. It was a crazy night in the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="Para">As we grew in popularity, people started to trust me more with cooking unusual things. I don’t know if it was because I had won the <span class="serif-ital">Iron Chef </span>title, but dishes that weren’t selling before I won started to appeal to our patrons. We added snails, sweetbreads, and tongue to the menu, and we got to be more playful with dishes like <a href="FORGE_08_Butcher_PPF.xhtml#page284">Foie Gras Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page226">Buffalo Tartare with Hottish Sauce</a>. We started to experiment with the sous-vide technique: <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page255">Veal Tenderloin wrapped in blood sausage</a> was one of the dishes that resulted.</p>
			<p class="Para">One of our most popular dishes, <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page182">Tortellini d’Avanzi</a> was created that year. The tortellini was a combination of a little kitchen ingenuity and a strong desire to treat all our ingredients with respect. One night, we wound up with some leftover veal breast confit. The following morning when I came in, there was a note from one of my sous-chefs, Barry: “Hey, I made these tortellini. No idea what to do with them, but they taste good, so let me know what you think.” Apparently, that morning, Barry took a look at the leftover veal and thought it might make a decent ravioli filling. Drizzled with truffle-infused balsamic vinegar, it was, in fact, very, <span class="serif-ital">very </span>good. So good, in fact, that we put it on the menu that same night. One of our investors happened to be in for dinner that evening, and after tasting the tortellini, he declared them to be the best piece of pasta he’d ever put in his mouth. It was his idea to tell everybody to eat the tortellini in one bite with the mushroom and the Parmesan.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page30">That year we were also able to give something back to the community. One night we organized a benefit at the restaurant called Coast to Coast to raise money for Feeding America, a leading domestic hunger-relief charity. We got five winemakers from California together with five New York Michelin-starred chefs: Justin Bogle (Gilt), Brad Farmerie (Public), Missy Robbins (A Voce), John Fraser (Dovetail), and me. Each chef made a dinner course at the restaurant and paired it with one of the California wines. The dinner was wildly successful, and we raised over forty thousand dollars.</p>
			<p class="Para">We grew our network of purveyors and started working with folks like <a href="FORGE_08_Butcher_PPF.xhtml#foraged">Foraged and Found Edibles</a>, who supply us with foraged (and found) wood sorrel, stinging nettles, fiddlehead ferns, ramps, chanterelles, porcini, and the like; and Møsefund, who raise amazing <a href="FORGE_08_Butcher_PPF.xhtml#page287">Mangalitsa pork</a>. I was introduced to the Mangalitsa breed after <span class="serif-ital">The Next Iron Chef</span>, and I just fell in love with the fat, which tastes incredible even when raw. I met <a href="FORGE_06_Poultry_PPF.xhtml#Joe">Joe Jurgielewicz</a> and was introduced to his amazing white Pekin duck—the best duck I’ve ever had, and what we now serve at the restaurant.</p>
			<p class="Para">That summer, Barry went away to France to do an apprenticeship. When he first sat down with me to discuss it, he was very nervous; he didn’t want to come across as not committed to working at the restaurant. When I realized what he was asking, I cut him off. “If you don’t go, you’re fired,” I said. Instead of hiring someone else to fill in for him, I picked up his shift and was “back in the shit,” as they say, doing all the ordering and closing just like in the early days of the restaurant. While Barry was in Europe, Chris Zabita got to step up and take on more responsibility, which was great for him, because now he and Barry are co-sous-chefs and help each other out.</p>
			<p class="Para">It was important to me that Barry was learning and growing in his career, and an apprenticeship in another country was a sure way to accomplish that. Not so long ago, it used to be common practice for chefs to apprentice abroad, but for some reason, unfortunately, it doesn’t happen all that often anymore. I tell people all the time that if they want to be serious chefs, they need to go and apprentice in another country—France, Italy, wherever. Not because they cook better than we do here, but because when you’re by yourself in an environment like that, you grow up really fast. When you’re in your head for an extended period, when you put yourself in an alien environment where they don’t speak English and you’re struggling with their language, when you stay quiet for three-plus months—<span class="serif-ital">you learn a lot about yourself</span>.</p>
			<p class="H3" id="page31">Cook Your Food. Stay in Your Kitchen.</p>
			<p class="Para1st">I suddenly found out that once you get on television, you get pulled in a lot of different directions. Consult here; open this there; do this with us; come see this. There’s nothing wrong with consulting and nothing wrong with putting your name on something. It’s natural to want to create your own brand and put your mark on the world. If you’re ambitious, you are always reaching higher and higher. But when you are asked to consult on something in Tucson, Arizona, what does it <span class="serif-ital">really </span>have to do with you? You are here, they are there. What business do you have with them?</p>
			<p class="Para">I had to say no to a dozen things before I said yes to one. In the fall of 2011, I started working on a steakhouse in Atlantic City, called American Cut. The name was a partial nod to my father and An American Place. The steakhouse seemed like a natural extension of what I was already doing. I knew that eventually I’d want to open up my own steakhouse. I had opened a few while working with BLT, so I knew how a steakhouse was run, and I had what I thought were cool ideas about how to elevate it. It was just a matter of finding the right fit. When the Revel resort group came to me with their plans, it immediately felt right. Everything about that idea sounded great. Taking part in something as monumental and exciting as the Revel Atlantic City project felt like the right move, and it helped that AC was close to home—not far away like Vegas or Miami. I didn’t want to be far from the restaurant I worked so hard to keep.</p>
			<p class="Para">I know that some chefs, from the get-go, dream of building an empire. And maybe it sounds dumb, but my whole professional life, the <span class="serif-ital">only</span> thing I ever wanted to do is have my own restaurant. I wasn’t averse to opening a few, but it wasn’t the goal—the goal was just the one. And now that I <span class="serif-ital">had </span>my restaurant, and finally had it <span class="serif-ital">just </span>the way I wanted it, and it was finally working the way it <span class="serif-ital">should </span>be working, everybody suddenly wanted to pull me <span class="serif-ital">out </span>of it to do something else! I wanted to yell, “Look! I’m <span class="serif-ital">finally </span>here, and now you want me to leave?” It felt like the most ironic thing in the world.</p>
			<p class="Para">And the thing I heard the most in 2011 from patrons was, “I can’t believe you’re still <span class="serif-ital">here</span>!” Where else was I supposed to be? I just wanted to keep working in my restaurant and continue to make it better.</p>
			<p class="Para">So what I really want to say to the young people who are interested in becoming chefs is this: Once you finally get where you want to be success-wise, take a minute to just enjoy it. Be in your restaurant. Cook your food. Stay in your kitchen. Stay there for a while.</p>
			<p class="Para">If you want to be famous, go be famous. But <span class="serif-ital">stay in your kitchen</span>. If you do that, if you focus on cooking <span class="serif-ital">your </span>food, I am pretty certain that good things will happen.</p>
			<p class="Para">I’m not suggesting that you stay in your kitchen, on the line, indefinitely. There will be a time when you can step back a bit, manage the actual restaurant a little more, have time on your hands to think about where your business is going, think about it all strategically. </p>
			<p class="Para">With the popularity of cooking television channels and shows, and America’s renewed interest in food (all good things, by the way), the food industry has become glamorous and alluring. I think people may forget just how much work, sacrifice and dedication goes into this business. I often hear of people who want to skip the hard work part, get to the “celebrity” part so they do not have to be in the kitchen anymore. But that is not “making it.” “Making it” in this business is being <span class="serif-ital">in</span> the kitchen. The names that are known today—Keller, Jean-Georges, Wylie, Grant, Symon, Carmellini, Bloomfield, Kahan, Boulud—I don’t have space to list everyone I can think of. These chefs are who they are because they <span class="serif-ital">stayed </span>in their kitchens and <span class="serif-ital">cooked </span>their food. They didn’t chase the fame; they focused on the trade they chose because they loved the work, loved the precision, loved being the best in their field. They loved their trade and worked hard (and <span class="serif-ital">still</span><span class="serif-ital"> </span>do) every day to get better and better at it.</p>
			<p class="Para" id="page32">And here’s the thing—if you want to do this for a living, if you want to pick this difficult (to put it mildly) life, be on your feet all day, work twelve- to fourteen- hour days, give up weekends and holidays, you need to ask yourself, “<span class="serif-ital">Why </span>do I cook?” I’m already assuming that you love to cook, so skip that part. Ask yourself what motivates you, every day, to cook. What drives you, what challenges you, what inspires you?</p>
			<p class="Para">Don’t cook like you’re afraid to get in trouble. It’ll show. Don’t play it safe in an attempt not to fail—that,  also, will show. If you are cooking “to get by” or you’re playing it safe, go do something else.</p>
			<p class="Para">One night a while back, I was showing one of my cooks how to cook a fish. I said, “This is how I want the final result to look. See that crispy skin? <span class="serif-ital">That’s </span>how I want it. But don’t do it for <span class="serif-ital">me­</span>—do it because <span class="serif-ital">you </span>want to figure out how to get that skin crispy. I can show you how I do it, but then it’s up to <span class="serif-ital">you </span>to make sure that every single piece of fish after this one ends up like this. Don’t do it my way only because you’re afraid to get in trouble. Do it because <span class="serif-ital">you </span>want to make the <span class="serif-ital">best </span>piece of fish with the crispiest skin.”</p>
			<p class="Para">The young kids who will be successful . . . you can recognize those kids right off the bat. And I don’t think that’s just in cooking—the same goes for anything in life. If you were to ask Jean-Georges Vongerichten, I guarantee you that when he was sixteen years old, he looked around the kitchen and said, “I’m going to be the best one in this kitchen today. And tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow.” I <span class="serif-ital">guarantee </span>it. I’ve been cooking professionally since I was seventeen years old, and it’s <span class="serif-ital">always been </span>a competition—with nobody else but myself.</p>
			<p class="Para">Cook to show the world that you know how and that you’re not afraid of taking risks. Show the world that you can do it. Don’t ask for approval—just cook. Cook every night like you are the best on the line. Cook every single dish like it’s your last. And be grateful for each and every blessing.</p>
			<p class="Para">And remember to never stop challenging yourself and those you work with. Complacency, especially in this business, is dangerous, and brings about the death of many restaurants, particularly those in food-focused cities like New York. Even though we are now busy and popular, we still push and challenge ourselves every single day. By the time you hold this book in your hands, we will have created dozens of new recipes and explored new techniques. The second you stop trying to accomplish something, you might as well close the doors, because you’re not going anywhere. The second you become stagnant, you’re done. There are a thousand other chefs who want to take your place. A restaurant is a constantly evolving, growing, living, breathing thing—treat it as such. And stay hungry for knowledge. Never stop learning, ever. But also be grateful for what you have.</p>
			<p class="Para">Every day, I meditate; I burn sage and I give thanks. I thank the universe for my great fortunes. When I come into my kitchen and look at my cooks—I have twenty now—I think about how far we’ve come. I walk around the dining room and say thank you to people. I thank them for coming in, say hello, shake their hand, give them a hug. Because in a city where you can go <span class="serif-ital">anywhere </span>for dinner, they chose to come <span class="serif-ital">here </span>and eat my food. And for that, I am genuinely grateful.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Julie Forgione, Marc’s Mother</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara"><span class="ital">Marc’s mother, Julie, tested a lot of the recipes in this book. Here are her thoughts.</span></p>
			
		<div class="imgcaption-float">	
		<div class="partial-float-image">
			<img alt="Marc_when_baby.tif" src="image/Marc_when_baby_fmt.jpg"/>
		</div>
		</div>
		
			<p class="FeaturePara">At the beginning, when I started testing Marc’s recipes, I often found myself stressed out and overwhelmed. Making the dishes required a thorough reading of the recipes and some thinking about them ahead of the cooking. I was stressing over finding the right ingredients and getting the techniques just right. When I got the first set of recipes to test, my first thought was, <span class="ital">Well, gosh, if he’d just made them easier, less laborious, or offered more substitutes—life would be so much easier. </span>But then I realized something: What would that be accomplishing?</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Once I got past a handful of recipes, I started to get more comfortable with what was coming next for testing. I even commented to Marc, “You know, I’m starting to get to know you in a whole different way, as a chef and with what you’re trying to do with these recipes!”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Once you get to know the recipes, you realize that you can make changes if you need to and not be so stressed out by it, which is what Marc is trying to accomplish. He’s giving you recipes that show you the way he thinks, and once you get that, they are easy to adapt—if you wish to leave a few things out, you can do so.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Some recipes are just fun. Everyone, even a beginner, should be able to make them. Pasta, for example, is something that everyone can make. I had so much fun testing the pasta recipes. I hadn’t made pasta in years, because living in New York, there is always a lot of good fresh pasta around. But I wanted the recipes to work for people like me, home cooks who might be intimidated by the recipes, so I tested the pasta recipes over and over until I got them just right.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Marc’s cooking is definitely technique driven, and now that I have these techniques down, there are recipes I keep going back to. Now that I have a larder of these wonderful oils and spices, as well as the techniques I’ve learned, cooking is so much more fun and rewarding. I love making <a href="FORGE_03_Shellfish_PPF.xhtml#page147">risotto</a> and <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#page89">caponata</a>, to name just a few. I also regularly make <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page242">chimichurri</a> and <a href="FORGE_05_Pasta_PPF.xhtml#page170">tomato consommé</a>. While before I’d never think of draining tomato water, people loved the results so much that I love making it now.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The feeling of accomplishment when you get a dish done is just amazing. And it was fun to get the family involved and bring everyone together in the kitchen. Once you master a few dishes, you, too, will feel empowered, like you can do the next dish, and the next dish, and the next. You will be fearless in the kitchen—which is a pretty good way to be, I think.</p>
