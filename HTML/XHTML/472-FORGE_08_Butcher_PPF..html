My granddad used to fry up some kidneys for breakfast with some eggs, and my mom made the best liver and onions with stewy gravy. I think more people should eat offal.

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Most people drink beer in the summer when it’s hot out; the cold beer cools them off. I’m the same way unless you’re talking about a Guinness, which I start drinking when the weather turns decidedly cold. The deep caramel, malty flavors taste better in the fall and winter and are excellent complements to meaty stews and soups. When I was making this dish in the winter, I knew I needed a strong beer to stand up to the bold oxtail flavor. Guinness happened to be on hand and made its way into this dish.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Oxtails</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pat the oxtails dry. Place 4 sprigs of thyme, rosemary, celery, 1 fresh or ½ dried bay leaf, and ½ strip of bacon on the remaining piece of bacon and wrap the bacon around them. Using a piece of kitchen twine, tie the bouquet garni tightly and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large stockpot or a Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, warm enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot until just before it starts to smoke. Season the oxtails with salt and pepper. Add the oxtails and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Discard the oil.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Add more oil to the pot, followed by the shallots, carrots, onion, garlic, and peppercorns, and cook until the vegetables are light brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the flour until well incorporated. Add 4 cups of the wine, 2 cups of the port, and the reserved bouquet garni. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the sauce has reduced to a third of its original volume.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page271"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>While the sauce reduces, preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Return the oxtails to the pot, and add the stocks. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Place a piece of parchment paper over the pot, then place the lid on top of the parchment, and place the pot in the oven. Braise the meat for about 4 hours or until the oxtails are tender and the meat is falling off the bone. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>While the oxtails cook, make a port reduction: In a 4-quart pot, combine the sugar and the remaining 4 cups wine, 2 cups port, 4 sprigs thyme, 1 fresh or ½ dried bay leaf, and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid has reduced to 2 cups, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Remove the oxtails and strain the sauce, discarding the vegetables. Pick the meat off the bones and set aside in a container large enough for the meat and sauce. Return the sauce to the stove over medium-high heat and cook, skimming off the fat as needed, until it has reduced to about 2 cups of sauce. Add the reserved port reduction and cook, skimming off the fat as needed, until the sauce has reduced to about 2 cups, about 30 minutes. Pour the sauce over the reserved oxtail meat, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>When ready to serve, in a saucepot, warm 1½ cups of the oxtail meat with 1½ cups of the oxtail wine sauce over medium heat, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Parsnip Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>In a medium pot, bring the cream, parsnips, and a couple of pinches of salt to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the parsnips are soft, about 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>While the parsnips cook, in a medium sauté pan, heat the butter over medium heat until the solids are a rich brown and the butter smells nutty. Remove from the heat and keep warm.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the parsnips to a blender; discard the cream or reserve it for another use. Add the reserved brown butter and blend until smooth. Transfer the puree to an ice bath and let cool completely.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Spaetzle</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>While the oxtails cook, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, milk, beer, ¼ cup of the Parsnip Puree, Pierre Poivre, and salt. Bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer, and using a perforated hotel pan or a large, wide colander, push the batter through the holes into the water. Wait for the spaetzle to float to the top and then count to 10. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked spaetzle to an ice bath and let cool for 2 minutes. Drain and transfer the cooled spaetzle to another bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Right before serving, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add 2 cups of the spaetzle to the pan in an even layer (you may have to do this in batches). Cook until the spaetzle begins to brown, add the butter, and cook until the spaetzle is crispy. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Béchamel Sauce</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>In a 4-quart pot set over medium heat, combine the garlic with 2 tablespoons of the butter, and heat until the garlic is roasted, about 2 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the flour, and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until the flour is cooked into the mixture. Whisk in the milk until incorporated. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Whisk to make sure the bottom of the pot doesn’t get scorched. Whisk in the cheddar and nutmeg, and season to taste with salt. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use. You will have 2 cups of béchamel, but will only need 1 cup for this recipe. Freeze the remaining sauce for later use. You can rewarm the frozen sauce over a hot water bath, but you may need to add more milk to loosen it up. Right before serving, warm 1 cup of the béchamel over low heat.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span>While the oxtails and sauce warm up, stir the Béchamel into the fried spaetzle. Remove from the heat and set aside. Once the oxtails and sauce are warm, stir in the fried spaetzle, 3 tablespoons of the chives, and the shallots. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Divide among 4 warmed ovenproof bowls. Sprinkle with the aged cheddar and set under the broiler until the cheese is bubbling and golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining chives on top and serve.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>James Beard was a great friend of my family and had a huge influence on my father’s career—he and my father shared a vision for the way the American culinary scene needed to change. My younger brother, Bryan, actually named him Grandpa Yoda because of his prominent ears. In many  ways, Jim was more than just my father’s friend—Jim was also his mentor. It was Jim who came up with the name for his restaurant, An American Place, drawing inspiration from photographer Alfred Stieglitz’s gallery for American artists under the same name. As my father was trying to bring back the glory of American ingredients and dishes, Jim thought it was an appropriate name and a tribute to a great American artist as well as a culinary tradition.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">It should go without saying that Jim loved to eat, and this salad was one of his favorites: a generous helping of raw onion and flat-leaf parsley dressed with a bracing vinaigrette. It’s as simple as salads get—and utterly delicious. Initially, I was inspired to put together a meal around this salad, and eventually the dish evolved into a collection of some of Jim’s favorite things to eat.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pat the cheeks dry and season liberally with salt. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Remove the cheeks from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 40 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place 6 sprigs of the thyme, the rosemary, celery, and ½ fresh or ¼ dried bay leaf over bacon and wrap the bacon around. Tie a piece of kitchen twine around the bouquet garni and set it aside. </p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a large heavy-bottomed pot or a Dutch oven set over high heat, warm enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before it starts to smoke, add the bouquet garni and cook until the bacon fat is rendered. Add the butter and halved heads of garlic, and cook until the butter browns, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove half of the butter from the pot and discard it. Return the pot to the stovetop, add the shallots, carrots, onions, and peppercorns, and cook until the vegetables brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the flour until incorporated. Add 1 cup of the wine and 1 cup of the port and cook until the sauce has reduced to a third of its original volume. Add the cheeks to the pot, and then add the stocks. Bring to a simmer. Place a piece of parchment paper over the pot, and cover tightly with foil. Transfer the pot to the oven and braise the cheeks for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>While the cheeks cook, make a port reduction: In a 4-quart pot, combine the sugar and the remaining 2 cups wine, ½ cup port, 2 sprigs thyme, ½ fresh or ¼ dried bay leaf, and black pepper, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Cook until the liquid has reduced to about 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Transfer the cheeks to a container large enough to hold the cheeks and sauce. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a pot. Return the sauce the stovetop over medium-high heat, add the port reduction, and cook, skimming off the fat as needed, until the liquid has reduced to about 2 cups, about 20 minutes. Pour the sauce over the cheeks, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a large sauté pan set over high heat, warm enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan until just before it starts to smoke. Add the shiitakes, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the mushrooms are browned, 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and transfer to a parchment paper–lined plate. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="marrowpotato">Make the Marrow-Potato Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>While you cure the veal cheeks, soak the bone marrow in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 12, changing the water every 2 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Preheat the oven to 450ºF; position the rack in the middle. Take all but 4 of the marrow bones, pat them dry, and place them in a roasting pan. Season with salt and pepper, and roast for 1 hour or until the fat has rendered and begins to caramelize. It will look like rendered bacon fat. Reduce the oven temperature to 350ºF.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Pour the rendered marrow fat into a saucepot, skimming off and discarding any big pieces that float in the oil using a slotted spoon. Set the marrow fat aside and let cool until semisolid.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Clean any meat off the remaining 4 marrow bones and place them in a roasting pan. Add enough water to come 1 inch up the sides of the pan and season the marrow bones with salt and pepper. Roast the bones for 15 minutes or until the marrow can be easily pierced with a needle. If the marrow bones need more time, cook them longer, but watch carefully—if it becomes too warm, the marrow will liquefy and leak out of the bones. Check on the bones every 5 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Spoon the reserved, rendered marrow fat into the  Basic Potato Puree and whisk until incorporated. Bear in mind that you cannot add hot liquid marrow fat to the puree or the puree will break, which is why the marrow fat needs sufficient time to cool and solidify. Set aside and keep warm until ready to serve. (You will have some extra marrow fat left over—save it and use it in place of bacon fat for frying eggs or potatoes.)</p>

Spoon the warmed cheeks on top of the puree and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Stir the reserved shiitakes and parsley into the remaining sauce. Spoon some of the sauce over the cheeks and drizzle them with some of the Garlic-Thyme Butter. Place a marrow bone on each plate and scatter the Parsley-Shallot Salad around the plate. </p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Stokes Farm</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Ron Binaghi and Tom Margotta</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Ron Binaghi remembers the very first farmers’ market in New York on the Upper East Side in 1976, where he and his father sold out of everything in no time. “Is there a famine in the city?” his father wondered. The first of many greenmarkets to spring up all over the city, selling out of everything was a sign that people were hungry for fresh, local produce. Stokes Farm, which is pesticide-free and famed for their beautiful herbs as well as their tomatoes, has been a faithful presence at New York’s greenmarkets ever since.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">In a time when many people choose to move away from farms to cities to pursue advanced degrees and desk jobs, Ron Binaghi, a fifth-generation farmer who started working on the family farm in 1976 when he was just nineteen years old, finds farming to be incredibly mentally challenging. “If you want to put your mind to it, it is . . . intellectually stimulating. You have to be a plumber, an architect, a psychiatrist, a banker, a marketer, an irrigation specialist, a carpenter. You have to wear a lot of hats.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Farming has been in Ron’s blood since he was a little kid. “When I got in trouble,” he recalls, “I just wanted to be grounded like regular kids and be sent to my room. My father, on the other hand, had a different idea and would make me do chores on the farm. While all my friends wanted to come and work on the farm, I wanted to be grounded like all the other kids—to stay in my room and think about what I did. I really wanted to think about what I did! But it never happened.”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Ron never felt that college was for him. Instead, he got married at nineteen and put all of his efforts into the family farm. “When you get married that early,” he says, “it ramps up your ambition level—makes you grow up fast.” But despite being what is now considered an adult, well past his teens with married children of his own, Ron still refers to himself as “almost a grown-up.” His conversation is often interrupted with his contagious chuckle. His son is now on board helping as well. Following in his grandfather’s footsteps, Ron’s son started at Rutgers on a scholarship singing, but after about a semester came back to work on the farm.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">While Ron interacts with customers at Union Square, we are fortunate enough, to have his colleague Tom Margotta at the greenmarket in Tribeca, a block away from the restaurant. I first met Tom when I was working at BLT and was coming to the Union Square greenmarket to buy produce. In time we got to know each other better. Sometime after I moved to Tribeca and opened my own place I ran into Tom at the Stokes stand, at the greenmarket—he had also moved! Whenever I go to the greenmarket, it’s always nice to see him and catch up while my chefs and I source some amazing produce.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I know this might sound weird, but whenever I think of a BLT, I always hear Billy Crystal's voice from <span class="ital">The Princess Bride</span>, “Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT—a mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They’re so perky, I love that!” While ours is definitely a BLT (as opposed to an MLT), it's a more playful version of the traditional sandwich.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>This is a bar staple at the restaurant. We get whole ducks delivered to the restaurant from Joe Jurgielewicz &amp; Son, and use the duck breast for dinner entrées. But then there’s all this duck meat left over: the legs, the liver, and so on. So we came up with ways to use the whole animal. It was our way of not wasting anything but the beak and the feet. What was an experiment, became an instant hit and a permanent fixture at the restaurant. Now, it’s one of the dishes that people come in for. They will sit at the bar and order these duck jars along with their drinks.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small nonreactive pot, combine the port, thyme, sugar, sliced shallot, garlic, and bay leaf, and simmer over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced to about ¼ cup, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the reduction through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Season the livers with the pink and kosher salts. Add enough canola oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before it starts to smoke, add the livers to the pan in one even layer without overcrowding (you may need to do this in batches). Reduce the heat to medium and cook, without moving the livers, for 1 minute. Add the remaining chopped shallots and brandy, stir, and cook for 1 minute more—the livers should be medium-rare. Transfer the livers to a blender and add the reserved port reduction. Blend, and when the mixture is sufficiently uniform, with the blender running, add the terrine, heavy cream, duck fat, and butter, piece by piece. Blend the mousse on high speed for 1 minute. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Pass the mousse through a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl set in an ice bath and let cool. Once the mousse is cool, transfer it to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip and pipe it into 4 (4-ounce) glass jars. Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil on top to prevent discoloration, and refrigerate until ready to use. </p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>To me, foie gras is one of those perfect ingredients that doesn’t need much assistance in order to taste absolutely delicious. This dish is as simple as it gets. I bring this home for a Christmas morning breakfast for my mom every year. Even though it’s a little bit gluttonous, she loves it—and it’s become a family tradition of sorts. Plus, Christmas morning deserves a little indulgence.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">At the restaurant, we serve the foie gras accompanied by different salts so diners can season it as they like. It’s a cool way to get people started on their meal.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Apricot Chutney</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Sterilize 2 pint jars by placing them in a large stockpot filled with boiling water for 5 minutes. Using jar tongs, transfer the jars to a clean dish towel, facing down.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Foie Gras</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Clean and devein the foie gras (see <a href="#notea">Note</a>). Place the foie gras and milk in a medium container or a resealable bag and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Remove the foie gras from the milk, pat it dry, and season it with the sea salt, pink salt, white pepper, and sugar. Wrap the foie gras in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Preheat an immersion circulator filled with water to 100ºF. Remove the plastic wrap from the foie gras, separate the foie gras into 4 logs, and using more plastic wrap, roll each log tightly into a cylinder, tightly securing both ends. Place the wrapped foie gras logs into a vacuum-seal bag, seal it, and poach in the immersion circulator for 1 hour. (If you don’t own an immersion circulator, please see the <a href="#note3">Note</a>.) Transfer the sealed bag to an ice bath and chill for about 2 hours.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page282">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Slice the chilled foie gras logs into ½-inch-thick slices and divide them among 4 plates. Serve with the toasted bread, Apricot Chutney, various salts, and Pierre Poivre alongside.</p>
			
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="notea"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note </span> You need to go through the entire lobe of foie gras with a paring knife to carefully pick out and discard the veins, one by one. It is tedious work, but pretty necessary unless you like veins in your foie gras!</p>
		
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note3"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>If you don’t have an immersion circulator, you can wrap the foie gras in cheesecloth instead of plastic wrap and poach it on the stovetop in rendered duck fat: In a medium pot over medium-low heat, bring 9 cups of rendered duck fat to 180ºF. Add the foie and poach for 90 seconds, and immediately transfer it to the refrigerator to cool for 20 minutes. Take the foie out of the refrigerator and twist the cheesecloth it is wrapped in tighter. The foie will start coming out a bit on the sides. Wrap it in additional layers of cheesecloth, tighten the ends to form a tight log, and hang the foie log in the refrigerator for 6 hours more or up to 1 day. This will give you just the taste and texture you are used to when you order foie gras at a fine dining restaurant. Alternatively, you can purchase a premade foie gras terrine, available at fine foods shops and online, and just make the chutney. It allows for a nearly effortless appetizer to enjoy with your friends and family. Also, if you don’t have a collection of fancy salts, don’t worry about it. All you need is one quality finishing salt to get a good feel for the tasting notes in this dish. I like Maldon sea salt, and in the last few years, a lot more stores have been selling it.</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium dry skillet, toast the pine nuts over medium heat until slightly golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Place the pine nuts, honey, salt, and pepper into a food processor fitted with a blade and process until smooth, about 2 minutes. If the mixture gets too sticky, you might need to add a bit of water. Transfer to a covered container and store at room temperature until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Bread Crackers</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Set the bread in a shallow baking pan, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 5 minutes or until crispy. Transfer to a cooling rack and set aside. Raise the oven temperature to 350ºF.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck Skin Crumble</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a medium bowl, stir together the oats, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter until combined. Spread out the crumble over a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined quarter-sheet pan and, using a silicone spatula, flatten it out. Bake the crumble for about 8 minutes or until it begins to crisp up. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature. Keep the oven on.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Place the duck skins over a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined shallow baking pan and stretch the skins out so they lie flat. Place another piece of Silpat or parchment paper over the skins and place another baking pan over the parchment, so that the duck skins are sandwiched flat between the parchment and pans. Bake the duck skins for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the skins are flat and crispy (the cooking time will vary depending on how fatty the skins are). Be careful removing the pan from the oven as there will be a lot of rendered duck fat between the baking pans. Remove the top baking pan. Allow the skin to cool slightly; pour off the rendered duck fat and reserve it. Brush the duck skins with the Duck Glaze and return the glazed skins to the oven. Bake for 5 minutes or until the glaze caramelizes. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and let sit until the glazed skins are cool enough to handle. Cut the skins into ½-inch equilateral triangles, and let the triangles cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page285"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a medium bowl, toss together the oat crumble, duck skin triangles, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved rendered duck fat until thoroughly combined.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Banana and Celery Root Puree</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a 2-quart saucepot, combine the celery root, banana, cream, stock, and a pinch of salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the celery root is soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid, and transfer the solids to a blender.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a small sauté pan, cook the butter over medium heat until the solids turn a rich brown. Transfer the brown butter to the blender with the celery root mixture. Starting on low speed and gradually increasing to high, puree the mixture for about 1 minute or until smooth. You may need to add a bit of the reserved cooking liquid to get the blender to go. (The remaining cooking liquid makes an excellent base for a soup or a sauce.) Pass the puree through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and set aside in a warm place.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Foie Gras</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Add the bacon to a sauté pan set over medium heat and cook until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Strain, reserving the bacon fat for another use. Set the bacon aside.</p>

			<p class="FeatureHead">Møsefund Mangalitsa</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Heidi Normand</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When Heidi Normand speaks of Mangalitsa pigs, her voice sparkles and you can tell she is excited. She can tell you all about G. C. Andersen, a financier, who spent years traveling Europe and eating the great Old World cuisine and discovering Mangalitsa meat. She can tell you how Mangalitsa is a cross between a lard pig and a wild boar, making the meat extra fatty and extra flavorful. She can tell you how, when Andersen returned to the States and couldn’t find Mangalitsa meat, he made it his mission to bring it to the United States and popularize it. Andersen did what any devoted food enthusiast with the means would do—he started a farm, Møsefund, to try to grow the Mangalitsa population and increase knowledge about it among consumers. It was his firm belief that if the consumers got their hands on Mangalitsa pork, they would go crazy for it.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">At the time when Møsefund was starting up, there was only one person, Heath Putnam, who was working to build a bigger distribution of Mangalitsa meat out of the West Coast. As Møsefund grew in scale, it made sense to merge their Mangalitsa populations with Putnam’s, and in 2012, Anderson purchased Putnam’s pig stock and combined it with his own.</p>
			
			<p class="FeaturePara">Meanwhile, Andersen’s personal chef, Michael Clampfner, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, had spent a number of years working for the Andersen family. Michael, who was passionate about quality ingredients, started to help with the business and eventually brought on Heidi to be the unofficial Mangalitsa Møsefund ambassador. She is, perhaps, the only purveyor we use who has more tattoos than me.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Before she came on board, Heidi happened to live twenty-five minutes away from Møsefund, and had earlier connected with Michael through Twitter while helping to source the meat for Charcutepalooza, a year-long home-cook meat-curing endeavor. One day, bored by her job at the time, she took to Twitter and asked the universe for a job in the food industry. Twenty minutes later, Michael tweeted her back—and Heidi had a job. She came on board focused on spreading the Mangalitsa enthusiasm to anyone who would listen. This is the job she was born to do.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">As Møsefund grows in popularity, the team is working to clean up the breed and continue to improve the quality of the meat. With four hundred to seven hundred pigs at any given time, the farm supplies both restaurants and Mangalitsa-loving individuals with delicious pork.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>The Mangalitsa breed is extra fatty and flavorful, and was bred, in the past, as a lard hog. Mangalitsas, aptly nicknamed “curly haired hogs,” have slightly curly hair, a reminder of the breed’s wilder ancestry, and a somewhat grumpy demeanor (again, thanks to its wilder ancestry). Because they produce so little lean meat, until recently, it was impossible to find them in the United States, and so Mangalitsas remain a bit of a novelty here. But with the resurgence of charcuterie, homemade bacon, and such, Mangalitsas are now being bred by small-scale farmers in America. We get our Mangalitsa pork from a wonderful producer called Møsefund Farm. I highly recommend that you give Mangalitsa a try—it will change you.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page288">Make the Mangalitsa Lardo</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a small bowl, combine the Ararat and kosher and pink salts, and rub the mixture all over the Mangalitsa fat. Transfer to a vacuum-seal bag and seal. Refrigerate the lardo for at least 3 weeks. Alternatively, you can wrap the fat tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 5 to 6 weeks—it takes longer to cure without a vacuum seal.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pig Cheeks</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small, dry skillet, toast the peppercorns, coriander, and fennel over low heat, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the toasted spices to a small bowl and set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Add the cooled spices to a medium bowl and combine with the kosher salt, brown sugar, pink salt, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf. Pat the pig cheeks dry and rub the spice cure all over the meat. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>The next day, preheat the oven to 200ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the lard in a 2-quart pot, and over medium heat, warm the lard until the temperature reaches 200ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Meanwhile, rinse the cheeks under cold running water and place them in a baking dish. Pour the lard over the cheeks, cover the dish with parchment paper and then in foil, and bake the cheeks for 12 hours. Transfer to a cooling rack or a refrigerator and let cool, in the lard, until ready to use. If making ahead, cover and refrigerate until needed.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>When ready to serve, return the pig cheeks to the stove, and over medium-low heat, warm the meat until it softens a bit. Remove the pan from the heat, and using two forks, shred the meat and set it aside. Quarter the cherry tomatoes.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>When ready to serve, light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the bread slices on both sides until slightly charred, but still soft inside. Alternatively, broil the bread on high for 1 minute or until one side of the bread is slightly charred. Spread the cheek mixture in a thin, even layer over the grilled bread. Arrange 2 cherry tomato halves on each slice and sprinkle with parsley. Top with a thin slice of the Mangalitsa Lardo (sliced on a mandoline on the thinnest setting). Grill or broil the crostini until the lardo melts, about 1 minute. Remove the crostini from the heat.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pig Heart</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the heart in a 4-quart Dutch oven or an ovenproof pot. In a nonreactive saucepan, combine the vinegar, mustard seeds, and salt with 2 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Pour the marinade over the heart, cover the pot, and transfer to the oven. Cook the heart for 3 to 4 hours or until fork-tender. Transfer the pot to a cooling rack, and once the heart has cooled, slice it, against the grain, into 4 slices. Place the heart slices in a bowl and pour over the braising liquid. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>In a separate bowl, stir together the olive oil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, pink peppercorns, and garlic. Set the olive oil–herb marinade aside until ready to grill the pig heart.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>When ready to serve, light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Remove the heart slices from the braising liquid, season with additional salt, and brush with the olive oil–herb marinade. Grill over high heat, turning occasionally, until slightly charred, 5 to 8 minutes. Maintain the grill heat for the gazpacho. Alternatively, place the heart on a shallow baking pan and cook under a broiler for about 2 minutes per side or until slightly charred. Remove from the heat and set aside. </p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Gazpacho</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Place the Italian eggplant, zucchini, summer squash, and onion in a bowl, season with enough olive oil to coat, and add salt and pepper to taste. Grill the vegetables over high heat, turning occasionally, until charred, 3 to 5 minutes. Maintain the grill heat for assembling the dish. Alternatively, place the vegetables on a baking pan and cook under a broiler for about 1 minute each side or until charred. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool. Pass the grilled vegetables, tomatoes, and 1 cucumber through a food mill fitted with medium holes into a bowl.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span><a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#Brunoise">Brunoise</a> the remaining cucumber and add it to the puree. Add the tomato juice, vinegar, and mustard oil, and season to taste with salt. Keep in mind that vegetables vary in flavor, acidity, and water content, so the amount of tomato juice, vinegar, oil, or salt might vary. Taste, and adjust the gazpacho seasonings to your preference.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page290">Make the Lime Sour Cream</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>In a small bowl, combine the sour cream with lime zest and sea salt, and mix to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>When ready to serve, grill the Fairy Tale Eggplants over high heat, 5 to 8 minutes or until slightly charred. Alternatively, place the eggplant on a shallow baking pan and cook under a broiler for about 2 minutes per side or until slightly charred. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span>Divide the gazpacho among 4 chilled bowls, and spoon the Lime Sour Cream in the center. Place the pig cheek–lardo crostini on top, and drizzle with the mustard oil. Serve each bowl with a grilled eggplant and a slice of the grilled pig heart.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you want to make this, but simply don’t have the time to get all the components done, the pig cheeks and gazpacho along with the Lime Sour Cream make a superb summer Sunday lunch. You can skip the overnight cure, and just slow cook the cheeks in the oven. Whip up the gazpacho, and serve it along with the cheeks.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page293">Make the Duck Mousse</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Pat the duck organs dry with paper towels. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a small saucepot, combine the port, sugar, sliced shallot, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf and cook over medium heat until the port has reduced to about ¼ cup. Strain the reduction into a small bowl and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>In a large sauté pan set over high heat, add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Just before it starts to smoke, season the organs with the pink and kosher salts and add the organs to the pan in one even layer. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the organs, without stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the chopped shallots and brandy, and stand back—the brandy could flame up. Stir the organs, and cook for 1 minute more for medium-rare. Transfer the organs to a blender and add the reserved port reduction. Starting with the blender on low and gradually increasing the speed, add the terrine, heavy cream, duck fat, and butter, piece by piece. Blend on high for 1 minute. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. If the mousse is not completely smooth, pass it through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Set the bowl over an ice bath or refrigerate until cold. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck Ham</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Pat the duck thighs dry, and season with the kosher and pink salts and the Pierre Poivre. In a small bowl, combine the Activa with 2 tablespoons warm water and whisk until smooth. Brush the Activa mixture all over the duck thighs. Lay out a large piece of plastic wrap on a counter and place 3 of the thighs on the plastic wrap, with the side where the skin used to be face down. Place the remaining 3 thighs on top of the other thighs, “skin” side up. Roll the thighs into a tight cylinder in the plastic wrap and twist off the ends to secure. Place the cylinder into a vacuum-seal bag and seal the bag. Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil on top to prevent discoloration. Refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>The next day, fill an immersion circulator with water and preheat to 156ºF. Poach the duck for 6 hours. Transfer the bag to an ice bath and cool for about 10 minutes. Remove from ice, remove the duck ham from the bag, and slice the ham into ¼-inch-thick slices.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck Lard</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Set a large dry sauté pan over high heat and add the duck fat—you will hear it sizzle. Reduce the heat to low and let the fat render for about 1 hour. Strain the fat through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Set the bowl over an ice bath and whisk until cool. Once the fat begins to set, transfer it to a container, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>The following day, transfer the rendered fat to a food processor, add the truffle oil, and process for 10 to 15 seconds or until the fat looks light and airy. Fold in the truffles and transfer to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped to form a quarter-size hole. Pipe the mixture onto plastic wrap and roll it into a tight cylinder, about 1½ inches in diameter, twisting both ends to secure (it will look like a log of butter). Transfer to the freezer and let sit at least 3 hours before using.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pickled Apples</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>In a small dry skillet, toast the coriander, cumin, and both kinds of peppercorns, over medium-low heat until toasted and fragrant. Transfer the spices to a small dish and set aside to cool. Once cool, transfer the spices to a piece of cheesecloth and add the thyme and bay leaf. Tie the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a sachet.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>In a small, nonreactive saucepot set over high heat, combine the sachet, vinegar, sugar, jalapeño, salt, and turmeric with 1 cup of water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, slice the apples into ⅛-inch-thick half-moons and transfer to a nonreactive bowl. Once the marinade comes to a boil, pour it over the apple slices and allow to stand for 4 hours, at room temperature, before serving. If making this in advance, refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Add enough oil to a skillet to come ½ inch up the sides of the skillet and warm the oil over medium heat. Fry the parsley leaves until crispy, about 30 seconds, and transfer to a paper towel–lined plate. Let cool.</p>
			<p class="method" id="page294"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Slice the Duck Lard into four ½-inch-thick slices and divide among 4 buttered ramekins. Drizzle the lard with some truffle oil and sprinkle some flaky sea salt on top. Slice the Duck Ham into four ½-inch-thick slices. Divide the Duck Ham among 4 small plates, drizzle with mustard oil, and top with flaky sea salt. Place a small scoop of the Duck Mousse on the side of the ham, and add a pinch of Pierre Poivre and flaky sea salt. Serve with the Duck Lard and Pickled Apples on the side, along with whatever greens happen to be in season.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>If you want to use every scrap of duck you have but don’t want to make every single component of this dish, just make one or two components at a time, and serve them with either Pickled Apples, which play nicely off the fattiness of the duck, or whatever pickles you happen to have on hand.</p>
			
			
			
			<div class="notebackground">
			<div class="notepadding">
			<p class="RecipeNotePara-plus"><span class="RecipeNoteHead-plus">+ </span>Unfortunately, to get the right texture on the duck thighs, there is no alternative to sous-vide cooking with this recipe. While you can make a homemade version of sous-vide poaching while standing over a pot and adding ice cubes to maintain a steady temperature, you probably don’t want to do so for 6 hours. Instead, try to find smoked duck breast or duck ham that is often sold at fine foods stores.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>Beef Wellington started out as a lavish and fashionable dish served at fancy dinner parties and banquets many decades ago. Some stories suggest that the dish was named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, while others claim that the dish was invented in Wellington, New Zealand. Whatever its origins, it is decadent, delicious, and hearty. For whatever reason, however, Beef Wellington has been made poorly so many times that it developed a bad reputation and has since fallen out of fashion. We decided to bring back its former glory days by making it the right way—and then some. </p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">Our version of Beef Wellington is even a bit more decadent than its traditional ancestor. We threw in some bone marrow and used braised oxtail meat in place of the tenderloin. There’s a lot of prep involved, but trust me, it’s well worth the time and effort. Once you have all the components, it takes just minutes to come together and cook. </p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page297">Make the Bone Marrow</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Soak the bones in a bowl of water in the refrigerator for 12 hours, changing the water every 3 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place the soaked bones in a roasting pan, bone side down, and season with salt and pepper. Add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan, and add the thyme and bay leaf. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 10 minutes or until you can easily stick a needle into the marrow and pull it out. If the marrow needs more time, cook for 5 minutes more and then check for doneness. Watch the marrow carefully; if the marrow overcooks, it will liquefy and seep out onto the roasting pan. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and let the marrow bones sit at room temperature, covered, for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and set aside to cool. </p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Oxtails</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>While the marrow bones are soaking, place 2 sprigs of the thyme, ½ of the rosemary sprig, celery, and ½ fresh or ¼ dried bay leaf on the strip of bacon and wrap the bacon around. Using a piece of kitchen twine, tie the bouquet garni tightly and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Add enough oil to a large stockpot or a Dutch oven to cover the bottom of the pot and set it over medium-high heat. Season the oxtails with salt and pepper. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the oxtails and brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the oxtails to a plate and set aside. Discard the oil.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Add more oil to the pan and add the shallots, carrots, onion, garlic, and peppercorns, and cook until light brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the flour until well incorporated, and add 2 cups of the wine, 1 cup of the port, and the bouquet garni. Bring to a simmer over high heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the mixture has reduced to one-third of its original volume.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Return the oxtails to the pot with the vegetables and add the stocks. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake for about 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>While the oxtails cook, make the port reduction: In a nonreactive 4-quart pot, combine the sugar with the remaining 4 cups wine, 1 cup port, the remaining 2 sprigs thyme, ½ fresh or ¼ dried bay leaf, and black pepper to taste, and bring to a boil. Cook until the liquid has reduced to 2 cups, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Remove the oxtails and strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding the vegetables. Pick the meat off the bones and set aside in a large container. Return the pot with the stock to the stove over medium heat, and cook, skimming off the fat as needed, until the liquid has reduced to 2 cups of sauce. Add the reserved port reduction, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, skimming off the fat as needed, until the sauce has reduced to about 2 cups and has a thick consistency. Pour the finished sauce over the reserved oxtail meat, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Duck Liver Mousse</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Prepare the Duck Liver Mousse.</p>

			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Prepare the Mushroom Duxelles.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Shallot Marmalade</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a small saucepot, combine the port, shallots, sugar, peppercorns, thyme, and bay leaf, and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the port has the consistency of thick syrup and the mixture looks like loose jam, about 20 minutes. Discard the thyme and bay leaf and set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page298">Make the Wellington</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Lightly flour a work surface and lay the puff pastry on top. Cut the pastry into 4 x 6-inch pieces; they should be large enough so that there is 2 inches of space from the top of the bone marrow and you can fold the pastry over with 1 inch of overlap. Brush half of 1 pastry piece with the beaten egg and place a piece of the bone marrow in the center. Spread a layer of oxtails on top of the marrow with the bone, top with Duck Liver Mousse, and finish with a layer of Mushroom Duxelles. Spread Shallot Marmalade over the top, and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and Pierre Poivre. Arrange 4 of the parsley leaves in a straight line over the marmalade. Fold the pastry over and seal on the side where the bone is. Brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg yolks and sprinkle some more flaky sea salt on top. Repeat to fill the other puff pastry pieces. Transfer the filled pastry to a Silpat- or parchment paper–lined shallow baking pan and bake for 12 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and puffy. While the Wellingtons bake, lay out two pieces of parchment paper and very lightly brush both pieces with oil. Lay out the parsley leaves for the garnish over one piece of the parchment paper so that the leaves are flat against the paper. Place the second piece of parchment paper, oiled side down, over the leaves, and transfer to the microwave. Microwave the leaves in 30-second intervals for a total of about 90 seconds to 2 minutes or until the leaves are crisp. Check on the leaves after each interval to see if they are crisp. Once done, remove the leaves from the parchment paper and set them aside.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Transfer the Wellingtons to a cooling rack and slice the white button mushroom on top. Serve the Wellingtons with the remaining sauce from the oxtails and remaining Shallot Marmalade. Finish with black truffle shavings, if using, and the parsley.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>You can make the dish a little bit faster by using a quality premade foie gras terrine. You can also double a batch of the <a href="FORGE_07_Meat_PPF.xhtml#page228">Short Ribs</a> and freeze the other half until you’re ready to make this recipe. </p>

			<p class="FeatureTitle">Foraged and Found Edibles</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Aaron Schaal</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">I am always amazed by how diverse wild edibles are and love using them at the restaurant. Thanks to Foraged and Found Edibles, founded in 2001 by Jeremy Faber, I can do it more easily. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Jeremy grew up loving to wander in the forests surrounded by the wilderness. So a forestry major in college seemed a logical choice, but somewhere along the way Jeremy had a change of heart, decided to pursue cooking instead, and departed for the CIA. Upon graduating, Jeremy realized he wanted to live closer to the woods and moved to Seattle. It was while cooking at various restaurants that Jeremy started foraging for wild foods and including them on his menus.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">From that love of foraging, and a particularly fruitful morel season in the Washington Cascades, a full-time foraging career emerged, and Foraged and Found was born. Jeremy’s company works strictly in accordance with what the season’s and nature’s offerings might be at any given time: fiddlehead ferns and morels in the spring; berries and chanterelles in the summer; mushrooms in the fall, just to name a few.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">While still a small company at its core, Jeremy and his colleagues work with dozens of foragers to gather produce for the greenmarkets and purveyors across the country and ship them as quickly as possible to their clients. They have been amazing in working with my restaurant, eager and enthusiastic about their foraged ingredients, and it is their passion and hard work that has allowed us to have more wild ingredients on our menus than ever before.</p>

Pour off most of the fat that has rendered from the lamb into a large ovenproof saucepot set over medium heat. Reserve the cooking juices that have collected at the bottom of the roasting pan. Add the bouquet garni and cook until the bacon has rendered. Add the garlic, shallots, carrots, onion, peppercorns, and 3 tablespoons of the curry powder to the saucepot and cook until the vegetables are light brown, about 10 minutes.

			<p class="FeatureHead">Koppert Cress USA</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Nicolas Mazard</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">To anyone who thinks micro greens are just a pretentious way to make food look restaurant-pretty, Nicolas Mazard will tell you that they are “living condiments.” But first, he’ll probably offer you some micro greens to try. Some will taste faintly of the sea and oysters, some of sambuca, and others of a forest after the rain.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Upon trying his micro greens for the first time, the response he hears most often is, “Holy shit, what did you do to the plant?”</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The experience with micro greens in the United States, prior to Koppert Cress, that is, had been a disappointment. More often than not, the micro greens looked lackluster, offering little in the taste department. They were purely cosmetic, a finishing touch before the food went out to the table. Koppert Cress, on the other hand, offers intensely flavored micro greens that transform the final taste of the dish rather than just acting as decoration.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">Raised in Paris and the French countryside by his farmer mother, Mazard was fascinated with farming and agriculture from an early age and studied agriculture and business in college.</p>
			
			<p class="FeaturePara">At some point he and his brother had plans to open a garden center in France—something like Home Depot in the United States, but focused entirely on plants and gardens. But plans changed and Nicolas found himself taking a job as a marketing specialist with Koppert Cress in 2001. “I wanted to work with something unique and amazing. I was fascinated with things like vanilla, which is an orchid, and its value and versatility in cooking,” Mazard recalls.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">He found that “unique and amazing” in Koppert Cress, a Dutch company that grows unique heirloom and forgotten rare varieties of herbs, and reintroduces them to chefs at fine restaurants.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The Szechuan button, for example, has been used in African cooking and medicine for hundreds of years. When placed on the tongue, people experience a tingling sensation, “like nature’s Pop Rocks.” In modern cuisine, it’s been used to infuse drinks and sorbets, but at our restaurant, it is served alongside the <a href="FORGE_02_Fish_PPF.xhtml#page61">Hiramasa Tartare</a>, one of our signature dishes.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When Mazard was hired, he was the first marketing professional to join the tiny company. Seeing an opportunity, Mazard quickly built out the European business and eventually expanded the business in the United States. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">With over twenty-eight employees today, the company has a one-acre greenhouse on Long Island with plans to add another in the near future. The operation allows Mazard to provide micro greens to restaurants all over the East Coast and out to the Midwest. Looking to the future, Mazard plans to eventually expand to the West Coast, as well as to bring micro greens to finer stores across the United States for home cooks who want to elevate their dishes to a more sophisticated level of flavor. </p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>I came up with snout-to-tail displays while at Charlie Palmer’s Pigs and Pinot food festival in 2011. We had an <span class="ital">Iron Chef</span>–style battle against the Voltaggio brothers and this was one of the dishes I created. I like using a lot of different heritage pig breeds, but the Hampshire breed is one of my favorites and wound up working great for the dish. I never cease to marvel at what a utilitarian animal a pig is—you really can use almost any part of the animal and make something delicious with it.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">The Hampshire breed, muscled and fast-growing, is one of the oldest and most popular American heritage breeds of hogs. Imported from Hampshire, England, in the early 1830s, the Hampshire quickly assumed its prominent place in the American animal-farming landscape as a sturdy and utilitarian animal with a reputation of being one of the leanest of the North American breeds. Its meat is a perfect match for this dish.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page304">Make The Cure</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a large bowl, combine the salt, sugar, peppercorns, pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf. Divide the mixture evenly into 2 separate bowls.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pig Head Pork Cakes</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Pat the pig head dry and rub 1 bowl of the cure all over. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Preheat the oven to 275ºF; position the rack in the middle. Rinse the pig head under cold running water, pat dry, and set aside in a roasting pan. Place the peppercorns, fennel, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf on a piece of cheesecloth and tie the ends together to form a sachet. Warm a dry skillet over high heat. Add the onion halves, cut side down, and sear until blackened. Remove the onion from heat. Place the sachet, oil, carrot, and blackened onion into a 4-quart pot set over medium-high heat. Warm the oil until the temperature registers 200ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Pour the warm oil mixture over the pig head, cover the roasting pan with parchment paper, and then cover with foil. Bake for 3 hours or until the head is fork-tender. Refrigerate, covered and in the oil, overnight.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Return the roasting pan to the stovetop, and warm the oil over medium heat, until you can easily pull out the head halves. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Pull all the meat from the head, making sure to get into every little crevice. Run your knife through the strands, so that the meat is no longer than 1 inch. Peel and chop the tongue and brains. Very finely dice the ears, skin, and fat. Basically, the only “garbage” should be the bones, teeth, eyes, and end of the snout. The rest gets used in this dish. You should wind up with about 8 cups of meat. In a large bowl, combine the meat with the mustard, red pepper flakes, tarragon, chives, garlic, and shallots. Set aside while you prepare the breading station for the patties.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a shallow bowl combine the flour and salt and set aside. In a medium bowl lightly beat the eggs and set aside. Place the Bacon Bread crumbs nearby in a shallow, wide bowl.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Slightly moisten your hands and shape the pig head meat into 3-inch-wide and ½-inch-thick round, pork patties—you should wind up with 10 to 15 patties.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Dip each patty in the flour mixture, then in the beaten eggs, and finally in the bread crumbs. Set aside 4 patties and freeze the remaining patties for another use (they are excellent for a Sunday brunch, with a fried egg on top). Transfer the reserved breaded patties to the refrigerator until ready to assemble the dish.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>When ready to serve, add 2 inches of oil to a Dutch oven or a skillet with tall sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Carefully slide the pork cakes into the hot oil and fry them for 40 seconds or until the outside is golden and crispy. Transfer the cakes to a paper towel–lined tray and season with salt.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Pork Belly</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>While the pig head rests overnight, make the pork belly, as it too will need an overnight rest. Rub the remaining bowl of The Cure all over the pork belly pieces, and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. </p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add the oil to a large Dutch oven and set it on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Warm the oil until the temperature registers 180ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. While waiting on the oil, place the peppercorns, fennel, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf into a piece of cheesecloth and tie the ends together to form a sachet. </p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>Rinse the belly under cold, running water, and thoroughly pat dry. Place the belly, spice sachet, garlic, carrot, and Onion Brûlé in the oil, cover the pot, and transfer it to the oven. Cook the belly for 3 hours. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool slightly before refrigerating overnight.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>Remove the belly from the fat and wipe off any excess fat from the meat. Cut the belly into 3 even squares and freeze until solid, 4 to 6 hours. Once solid, cut the belly into 16 (⅛-inch-thick) slices. Set aside the slices on a piece of parchment paper.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page305">Make the Tenderloin</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">13.	</span>Separate the speck slices into groups of 4, each piece with a group laid out to slightly overlap the other. Sprinkle each speck “block” with 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Place the tenderloins at the bottom of each speck “block” and roll them into cylinders. Lay out 4 pieces of plastic wrap on the counter and transfer each tenderloin cylinder onto its own piece of wrap. Wrap the meat as tightly as possible, twisting at both ends.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">14.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Cooking Instructions</span> (see <a href="#step15">step 15</a> for Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions): Preheat an immersion circulator filled with water to 140ºF. Place each tenderloin cylinder in a small vacuum-seal bag and seal the bags. Poach the tenderloins for 2 hours. Remove the tenderloins from the bags and set aside until ready to assemble the dish.</p>
			<p class="method" id="step15"><span class="methodnum">15.	</span><span class="smallcap">Sous-Vide Alternative Instructions:</span> Preheat the oven to 400ºF; position the rack in the middle. Add enough oil to a large ovenproof sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, remove the plastic wrap from the tenderloins and add them to the pan, seam side down, and reduce the heat to medium (you may need to do this in batches). Cook the tenderloins until browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the tenderloins over, transfer the pan to the oven, and cook until medium, 5 to 10 minutes or until the internal temperature of the loins registers between 140ºF and 145ºF on a meat thermometer. Set aside until ready to serve.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">16.	</span>When ready to serve, add enough oil to a large sauté pan to cover the bottom of the pan and set it over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the speck-wrapped tenderloins to the pan, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the tenderloins until browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the butter and thyme and baste the meat for 1 minute. Flip the tenderloins over and baste for 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate and let sit for 5 minutes. (If you cooked the tenderloin in the oven, return the meat to the stovetop, and over medium-high heat, add the butter and thyme and baste for 1 to 2 minutes. Let the meat rest 5 minutes before slicing.)</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Black Garlic Jus</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">17.	</span>Fill a small bowl with hot water and soak the black garlic for about 10 minutes. Peel the garlic (the skins should pop right off) and set aside. In a large saucepot, combine the clams, stock, wine, bacon, thyme, and bay leaf and cook over medium heat. As soon as the clams begin to open, remove the pot from the heat. Strain the jus through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and discard the bacon and herbs. Add the black garlic to the jus, and using an immersion blender or a stand blender, puree the liquid until smooth. Keep both the clams and the jus warm. Right before serving, reheat the jus until almost simmering and transfer to a gravy boat.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">18.	</span>Slice each pork tenderloin into 3 pieces and divide the tenderloins among 4 warmed plates. Divide the pork belly slices and pork cakes among the plates, placing them around the tenderloins. Spoon the reserved clams around and drizzle everything with a little mustard oil. Scatter the pea shoots around, if using. Thinly shave the matsutake mushrooms over the dish. Serve with the Black Garlic Jus alongside at the table.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Make It Faster  </span>It’s funny, but when you order this dish at the restaurant and it arrives, it looks like the simplest, easiest thing in the world. But looks can be deceiving: This dish, in its entirety, is very time-consuming and demanding. If you want to challenge your inner butcher or charcuterie-artisan, go ahead—in the end you will feel incredibly empowered. But if you’re trying to just get a feel for this dish and how much fun nose-to-tail cooking can be, just try making the Pig Head Pork Cakes the first time around. And maybe play around with various components separately. It’s amazing how much of the animal we can really use and how little goes to waste if you know what you’re doing.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 4  </span>One night a few years ago, my brother came over to the restaurant for dinner. At the time he was a chef at this barbecue spot on Long Island, and was constantly around pork. I wanted to give him something he might not have had before: half a pig’s head with toast and MF Pickles, which were inspired by an English take on an Indian pickle. Now at the restaurant, Thursday nights are pig face nights, and people call weeks ahead to get a table.</p>
