<p class="nonindent">A little cup of lemon sorbet is a classic dessert in Spain. I figured I’d like it even more if transformed into an ice cream. I love ice cream, particularly a lemon one that melds acidity and richness. In order to incorporate a lot of lemon flavor without curdling the milk or cream, we make a curd with extra eggs. That addition stabilizes the ice cream base and results in an intensely creamy final texture. You will notice after the base sets that it is almost thick. Don’t worry, that’s what you’re looking for. A stand-alone scoop is great for a casual dessert, but scatter a few fresh blackberries on top to end a fancier meal.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">BRING THE MILK, CREAM, AND THYME TO A BOIL</span> in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and let stand for 15 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, whisk the sugar, lemon zest and juice, egg yolks, and whole eggs in a medium bowl. Set over a saucepan of simmering water and heat, stirring continuously, until thickened and an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F, about 8 minutes. Whisk in the strained cream mixture, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl. Set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice and water to quickly cool to room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to overnight.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Churn the chilled mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serve immediately, with blackberries if you’d like, or freeze in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
