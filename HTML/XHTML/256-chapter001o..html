<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-23"/><span class="blue">Uova al Forno</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent"><em>Amatriciana</em> is a popular pasta sauce often made with guanciale, or cured pork jowls, and onions, tomatoes, and chilies. This Roman specialty is equally delicious as the sauce in <em>uova al forno,</em> or baked eggs.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 dried red chili or pinch red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 garlic clove, peeled and minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ teaspoons coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ pound smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch-thick lardons</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large yellow onion, peeled and thickly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 to 8 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredient">Grated pecorino Romano cheese, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F.</p>
<p>Place the entire contents of the can of tomatoes into a bowl and crush by hand. Set aside.</p>
<p>In a medium saucepan, warm the olive oil over medium heat, add the chili and the garlic, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add the crushed tomatoes and salt and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 30 minutes, or until slightly thickened.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over high heat for 2 or 3 minutes until the fat has rendered. Add the onions and reduce the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and a little bit brown and the bacon is a tiny bit crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer the tomato sauce to the bacon and onion mixture and stir to combine.</p>
<p>At this point you can leave the sauce in the pan and bake the eggs directly in the pan, or divide the sauce evenly among four individual baking dishes, being sure to evenly distribute the bacon and onions among the dishes. Whether you’re working in one big skillet or in four individual baking dishes, use a wooden spoon to make indentations in the sauce, and crack the eggs into the indentations. Use 1 or 2 eggs per person depending on how hungry you and your friends are.</p>
<p>Transfer the skillet or dishes to the oven and bake until the eggs are just set, about 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Serve immediately, with plenty of the grated cheese on top.</p></div>
