<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Feel free to use this recipe as a guide, changing the type of olives and seasonings as you please. For example, try crushed fennel seeds and lemon on bright green olives, or a combination of coriander and cumin seeds on oil-cured, black Moroccan olives. These can be made ahead and rewarmed just before serving, or simply served at room temperature.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 2 CUPS MARINATED OLIVES]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 cup green olives, rinsed and drained</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 cup black olives, rinsed and drained</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon Herbes de Provence (<a href="chapter008b.xhtml#page-261h">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Zest of 1 orange, removed in large strips with a vegetable peeler</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 dried red chilies, or a pinch of red chili flakes</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Place all of</strong> the ingredients in a skillet and stir to combine. Set the skillet over medium heat and cook until the olives are warmed through and the aromatics are fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and serve the olives warm, or let them cool and serve at room temperature.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-134"/><span class="dotted">Apple and Cheese Fricos</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">You know the little bits of cheese that stick to the pan when you make a grilled cheese sandwich? The ones that get crispy and brown and that you can’t help but scrape up and eat when no one is looking? A <em>frico</em> is a larger portion of that perfect bite. Though it’s sometimes made with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, I use Montasio, a cow’s-milk cheese from Friuli, where the frico originated. The apples here aren’t totally traditional, but are quite nice.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES 4 FRICOS]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">Extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1½ cups coarsely grated Montasio cheese (or other aged cow’s-milk cheese)</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 Gala apple, stemmed, cored, and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingredient">4 fresh sage leaves</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Set a heavy</strong> medium skillet over medium heat and pour in enough olive oil to thinly coat the entire surface of the pan. Sprinkle a quarter of the cheese evenly over the surface of the pan and scatter over a quarter of the apple slices and a sage leaf. Cook until the cheese has completely melted, is bubbling, and is golden brown on its underside. Using a spatula, carefully fold half the cheese over to form a half-moon shape (like an omelette) and transfer the frico to a square of parchment paper. Continue to make fricos with the remaining cheese and apples, adding more oil to the pan as necessary. Serve warm.</p></div>
