<p class="nonindent">For this book, I wanted to come up with ways home cooks could re-create Cúrate recipes without the fuss of, say, deep-frying. In the restaurant, we fry paper-thin slices of sun-chokes cut with a mandoline to serve as an earthy, crunchy topping. It turns out store-bought salted sweet potato chips deliver a just-as-satisfying crispness. And I actually love their sweetness with the acidity of the lemon vinaigrette and the creaminess of the yogurt in this dish. Another shortcut is the use of jarred artichokes. They work well here and make this a 10-minute dish, start to finish. But if you like prepping fresh artichokes, you can do what we do at the restaurant. Once we clean the hearts, we cook them slowly in the lemon vinaigrette. Home-cooked artichokes are more toothsome, but the version here tastes as much of spring.</p>
<p class="indent">You can serve this as an appetizer to any spring meal or as a light lunch, along with crusty bread.</p>

<p class="side-text"><strong>2 (12-ounce) jars artichokes in water, drained well, then halved lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 radishes, very thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup very thinly sliced sweet onion</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 (5-ounce) package spring mixed greens</strong></p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE VINAIGRETTE, ZEST THE LEMON</span> into the bowl of a food processor. Trim the top and bottom of the lemon, then cut off the peel and pith. Holding the lemon flesh over the food processor bowl, cut out the segments by slicing between the membranes. Squeeze any juice remaining in the membranes, then squeeze in any juice in the peel and pith. Add the honey and salt to the bowl and process. With the machine running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until emulsified. The vinaigrette can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature and shake well before using.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the salad, stir the yogurt and ¼ teaspoon salt in a small bowl, then spread on serving plates.</p>
<p class="indent">Toss the artichokes, radishes, onion, greens, and the vinaigrette in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss again. Arrange over the yogurt on the serving plates. Zest the lemon and pluck the tarragon leaves over the salad. Scatter the chips on top, breaking larger pieces. Serve immediately.</p>
