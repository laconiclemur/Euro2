<p class="left" id="p1"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">EVERY SUMMER, MY MOM’S FAMILY</span> gets together for a big family reunion we like to call Rammfest. It’s named after my grandpa, Poppy, whose full name is Bruce Ramm Andresen. A wonderfully Norwegian name, isn’t it? For years, though, apart from its name and the occasional Norwegian flag draped from a flagpole, Rammfest wasn’t a terribly Scandinavian event. But one year, we thought it would be fun to celebrate our Nordic heritage, so we planned a full day of meals and activities inspired by Scandinavia. We ate Swedish meatballs and cream cake and little jars of pickled herring (although I’m pretty sure Poppy is the only one who enjoyed that last one). We set up an enormous flower-covered maypole on the lawn, and even surprised my grandparents by dressing up in makeshift <em>bunads</em> (traditional Norwegian folk costumes) and parading into my aunt and uncle’s backyard, all fifty-something of us!</p>
<p class="indent left" id="p2">My aunt’s breakfast casserole is an old family recipe that served as the inspiration for this gathering when it made its revamped Scandinavian debut at Rammfest that summer. Other recipes are longtime family breakfast favorites with a Nordic touch.</p>

<p class="left" id="p4">A breakfast feast should be light and bright. I have an old tablecloth I bought at a secondhand store that looks like it belongs in a Swedish farmhouse—a white cloth with a sunny-yellow border and a scattering of colorful flowers across the center. If you have cheerful old-fashioned table linens, a Scandinavian brunch is the perfect place to use them, and if not, a plain white tablecloth is always a safe choice. Blossoms arranged in a tall white milk pitcher or a few small bouquets of wildflowers in little jars make sweet additions to the table. And don’t forget the beverages! A selection of juices and teas will round out the menu nicely, along with every Scandinavian’s favorite—coffee!</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p16">My great-grandmother Asta passed away when my grandpa was a teenager, so my mom and her siblings never knew her. But Asta’s oldest sister, Mathilde, who had helped raise Asta and all of her siblings in Norway, took a job as a cook in a mansion in downtown Salt Lake City to be near her family. Tante Tilda, as she was called, became a surrogate grandmother to my mom’s family. They would go visit her at work, and she would let them help her make her famous pancakes.</p>
<p class="headnote_indent" id="p17">I’ve heard about Tante Tilda’s pancakes my whole life; they’re a bit of a legend. My mom and her sisters remember standing on a kitchen chair next to Tante Tilda while she dropped tablespoonfuls of batter onto a hot, buttered skillet to make silver-dollar pancakes. They were topped with piping hot maple syrup that had a big pat of salty butter melted into it.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p35">These pastries are one of my family’s most prized treats. My mom has been making them for over three decades, ever since she got the recipe from her sister-in-law, who got it from a friend who owned a bakery. When we were growing up, my siblings and I would fight over who got the piece in the center. It always ends up with the most cinnamon-sugar filling, the most sweet icing, and the most gooey dough—the best part of an already amazing treat. If you are lucky enough to get a pan of warm pecan rings from my mom, it’s a sure sign that she likes you. With their intricate shape and delicious maple flavor, pecan rings are the perfect pastry to make when you want to impress.</p>

</div>
<p class="step" id="p59"><span class="step_num">1.</span> In a small saucepan, combine the milk and sugar; whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Add the butter and heat over medium low, stirring gently, until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="step" id="p60"><span class="step_num">2.</span> In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, combine the yeast, warm water, and a pinch of sugar. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes to make sure yeast is active and alive. You should see bubbles on the surface, and the mixture should grow in volume (see <a href="Bahe_9781632170699_epub3_fm9_r1.xhtml#K002">here</a> for tips on making yeast breads).</p>
<p class="step" id="p61"><span class="step_num">3.</span> In a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the milk mixture and the yeast mixture. Add the salt, eggs, and 7 cups of the flour. Mix until combined. The dough will still be very sticky, and that’s okay.</p>
<p class="step" id="p62"><span class="step_num">4.</span> Transfer the dough to a very large, lightly oiled bowl, cover with oiled plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="step" id="p63"><span class="step_num">5.</span> While the dough is rising, make the filling. In a small bowl, combine the pecans, sugar, cinnamon, and maple. Stir with a fork until well mixed; set aside.</p>
<p class="step" id="p64"><span class="step_num">6.</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page8" title="8"/>Punch down the risen dough, add the remaining 1½ cups flour, and knead by hand for 1 to 2 minutes on a well-floured surface.</p>
<p class="step" id="p65"><span class="step_num">7.</span> Divide the dough into six equal portions (each pan of pecan rings will have three layers of dough). Roll out one portion of dough into a 12-inch circle and place it on a lightly oiled 12-inch pizza pan. Brush the entire surface with melted butter, then top with one-sixth of the filling mixture (about a couple of spoonfuls). Roll out another portion of dough into a 12-inch circle, place it on top of the first, brush with butter, and top with more filling. Repeat with one more portion of dough, topping it with the melted butter and filling mixture. Make sure to get the butter and filling mixture all the way to the edges. Repeat step 7 with the remaining three portions of dough and another 12-inch pizza pan.</p>

Stop just short of that center circle. (I cut mine in half first, then cut each half in half again, then each quarter in half again, and so on until I have sixteen equal pieces.)</p>

My Aunt Shelly introduced our family to it when I was in elementary school. Ever since then, we’ve made it often for family get-togethers because it is such a crowd-pleaser. A few years ago, my mom tweaked the original recipe for the Norwegian-themed breakfast at our family reunion, and it was a huge hit.

<p class="headnote" id="p110">Dala horses, whose bright orangey-red color and whimsical detailing have become national symbols of Sweden, are named for the Swedish province of Dalarna where they originated. One of my favorite crafting techniques is freezer-paper stenciling. Freezer paper is very inexpensive and available at most grocery stores, and with just a little patience makes fantastic stencils. It’s perfect for painting designs onto fabric, such as these dala horse napkins.</p>
<p class="yield" id="p111">MATERIALS &amp; TOOLS:</p>

<p class="IL_item1" id="p120">Paper plate, cardboard, or something to put the paint on</p>

<p class="step" id="p123"><span class="step_num">1.</span> Turn to the dala horse template. Trace the dala horse design onto freezer paper with a pencil; trace one horse for each napkin you want to make. Be sure to trace onto the rough, papery side, not the shiny side, and leave at least 4 inches between each horse.</p>
<p class="step" id="p124"><span class="step_num">2.</span> Cut the traced dala horses apart, leaving lots of freezer paper around each design. Then carefully cut out the inside of each design. Keep in mind while cutting that you are creating a stencil. The piece of freezer paper that you are cutting the dala horse out of is the part you’ll be keeping. The design itself will be thrown away.</p>
<p class="step" id="p125"><span class="step_num">3.</span> Lay out the napkins flat on the ironing board, making sure the design is in the desired position. I positioned my dala horse stencils in the lower-left corner of each napkin so that when the napkins are folded in eighths, the design is still visible. If you make a mistake on this step, you’ll have to start over. Freezer paper stencils can only be ironed once, so take your time when placing the stencil on the napkin. With the iron set to the cotton setting and the steam turned off, iron the freezer paper onto the napkin, shiny side down. The heat from the iron will melt the plastic enough to make it stick to the fabric, but when you’re finished, it will pull off very easily. Pay special attention to the inside edges of the design, making sure they are completely smooth.</p>
<p class="step" id="p126"><span class="step_num">4.</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page14" title="14"/>Squeeze a small amount of paint onto a paper plate, then carefully use the sponge brush to apply paint to the exposed area of the napkin. Use a dabbing motion as opposed to big brushstrokes, and try to smooth out any big globs of paint.</p>
<p class="step" id="p127"><span class="step_num">5.</span> As soon as a design is filled in, remove the freezer paper and set the napkin aside in a safe place to dry.</p>
<p class="step" id="p128"><span class="step_num">6.</span> Once the bottom layer of paint is dry, use pink, yellow, or light-blue paint and a fine-tipped paintbrush to add a mane and a saddle to each dala horse, as seen in the <a href="#c01-f1">photo</a>. Use white paint and the blunt end of the paintbrush to add white dots for the bridle, cinch, reins, etc.</p>
<p class="step" id="p129"><span class="step_num">7.</span> Allow the painted napkins to dry completely, then cover them with a clean rag or pressing cloth, and iron over the painted areas to set the paint. Launder gently.</p>

<p class="IL_text" id="p142">You can find the wood for this project in the lumber department of your local hardware store. Clear cedar is a great choice. It is soft, so it is easy to cut with a handsaw, and it doesn’t have any knots.</p>
</div>
<p class="step" id="p143"><span class="step_num">1.</span> At the hardware store, have them cut your 2-by-2-inch piece of wood into 6-inch sections.</p>
<p class="step" id="p144"><span class="step_num">2.</span> Use the handsaw to cut each section of wood in half. There’s no real need to measure here, because the goal is to get blocks of slightly different heights—just eyeball it! Try to make your cuts as straight as possible; if you have one, a miter box will help. The ends that were cut at the hardware store will be perfectly straight; make those ends the bottoms of the houses, and the cuts you make can be the tops.</p>
<p class="step" id="p145"><span class="step_num">3.</span> Make a straight cut about ¼ inch deep across the square face of each block that will be the roof. This will be the slot for place cards.</p>
<p class="step" id="p146"><span class="step_num">4.</span> Sand all of the cut edges of each block with the sandpaper until they are smooth. Tuck the sandpaper down into the card slot and sand both sides of that lightly as well.</p>
<p class="step" id="p147"><span class="step_num">5.</span> Using a sponge brush, paint each block, starting with the color for the main part of the house (white, orange, red, yellow, pink, or light blue). You don’t need to paint the top or bottom of the block, just the four sides. Paint as many coats as needed, allowing each coat to dry before adding another.</p>

Some roofs can run side to side (with the peak on the front of the house) and some can run the opposite direction (with the peaks on the sides of the house). Mix it up for some variety! Paint the roofs in either dark gray or terra-cotta. Make sure to paint the top of each block as well. Paint as many coats as needed. As soon as you are done painting, remove the tape and allow the roofs to dry.</p>
<p class="step" id="p149"><span class="step_num">7.</span> Use the soft-bristled brush to paint a few dark-gray windows on the front of the house. The windows don’t need to look like perfect little rectangles; using a single stroke of the brush for each window is fine. Don’t worry about a door, or windows on the sides or back of the house. Let the paint dry completely.</p>
<p class="step" id="p150"><span class="step_num">8.</span> Using the white paint marker, draw a line between the house and the roof to represent the white trim work common on Nyhavn houses. Draw white trim around the windows too, and draw a cross on each window to create windowpanes.</p>
<p class="step" id="p151"><span class="step_num">9.</span> Allow the paint to dry completely. If the slot for the cards has paint stuck in it, gently pop your handsaw back into the space to dislodge any paint and to reopen the slot.</p>

<p class="headnote" id="p153">Beautifully painted welcome signs are popular in the friendly region of Scandinavia. My grandparents have had a Norwegian welcome sign on every house they’ve ever lived in. This rustic plaque is a simple, modern version of the classic <em>velkommen</em> sign. It looks just as cute hanging on a cozy kitchen wall as it does on a front door.</p>
<p class="yield" id="p154">MATERIALS &amp; TOOLS:</p>

</div>
<p class="step" id="p167"><span class="step_num">1.</span> Find the side of the tree trunk slice with fewer knots. This will be the front of your plaque. Use the paintbrush to paint a large oval on the tree trunk slice with clear acrylic sealer. This will keep any knots or imperfections in the wood from bleeding through the paint. Keep the sealer 1 inch away from the edge of the wood. Allow the sealer to dry, then paint over the exact same area with light-blue paint. You will need to paint two to three coats to get a nice opaque layer. Allow each coat to dry completely before moving on.</p>
<p class="step" id="p168"><span class="step_num">2.</span> While the paint is drying, photocopy the welcome sign template onto a plain white sheet of paper. Trim the paper so that it is just larger than the text. Hold the paper up to a bright window so that the blank side is facing you, and make a sesame seed–size dot with the pencil at the center of each X.</p>
<p class="step" id="p169"><span class="step_num">3.</span> Lay the sheet of paper pencil side down on the dry plaque so that the writing is centered top to bottom and left to right. Scribble over the whole word with a pencil, pressing very firmly. When you remove the paper, the pencil dots from the back of the paper should have transferred to the painted plaque.</p>
<p class="step" id="p170"><span class="step_num">4.</span> Use the red paint marker to make a small <em>X</em> on top of each pencil dot. Follow the welcome sign template if you get lost. Allow the paint marker to dry completely before moving on.</p>

To attach the screws, hold the plaque firmly with one hand while pushing a screw in firmly with the other hand. Start by just pushing the screw in while twisting it back and forth until you’ve made a small divot in the surface of the wood. Then screw it in with full turns until it is tight.</p>
<p class="step" id="p172"><span class="step_num">6.</span> Knot one end of the ribbon through the hole in one eye screw, and knot the other end through the hole in the other eye screw.</p>
