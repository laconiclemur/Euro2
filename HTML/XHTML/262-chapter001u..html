<h1 class="sidebar-title1"><strong>The Versatility of Crêpes</strong></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">Crêpes can be a snack or a whole meal. They can be sweet or savory. They can be made ahead and folded with elegant fillings like good ham and Gruyère cheese and baked later on. You can make small crêpes, stack them up, and serve them alongside jars of Nutella and jam, turning any morning or afternoon after school into a kid-friendly project. You can make a big floppy sombrero of a crêpe, place it in a large bowl, grate chocolate or scatter berries over the top, and serve it to guests who can fold it up however they’d like. Crêpes can be used like sheets of pasta and baked with layers of cheese and vegetables; they can be julienned, caramelized, and tossed with warm apples and cinnamon. Even a botched crêpe can be stirred in the pan with a spoon and served in a bowl with butter and sugar to be thoroughly enjoyed.</span></p>
<h1 class="simplesect-title">Resting Your Crêpe Better</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">Rested batter is better batter. When you make your batter in advance and let it rest before using it, it means that the proteins activated by combining liquid with the gluten in flour will calm down. This is a good thing as it makes for a more relaxed mixture, a more cooperative mixture, a batter that’s easier to work with, and ultimately, a more beautiful crêpe.</span></p>

<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">BRETON GALETTE / BUCKWHEAT CRÊPE</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Prepare the Crêpes as directed, but substitute ¼ cup buckwheat flour for ¼ cup of the unbleached all-purpose flour. Fill each crêpe with a slice of good ham (prosciutto cotto if you can find it), a small handful of grated Gruyère, or a slice of Brie or other soft cheese (Époisses is really lovely here), and a sage leaf and fold the crêpe into quarters. Transfer the filled crêpes to a buttered baking dish and bake in a 400°F oven until crisp and golden brown, about 10 minutes. These can also happily get a sunny-side-up egg tucked inside as well.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">CHESTNUT CRÊPES</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">For chestnut crêpes, use the Crêpes recipe, but substitute 3 tablespoons chestnut flour for 3 tablespoons of the unbleached all-purpose flour.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">CRÊPES WITH LEMON, BUTTER, AND SUGAR</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Make Crêpes. Spread each warm crêpe with a slick of good butter, sprinkle over a bit of granulated sugar, and squeeze over a few drops of fresh lemon juice. Roll the crêpe and eat immediately while warm, dusted with powdered sugar, if you’d like.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">CRÊPES WITH NUTELLA</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Make Crêpes. Spread each crêpe with a heaping tablespoon of Nutella, then fold into a triangle. Place the stuffed crêpes in a baking dish, dot with butter, and bake at 400°F until crisp and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Serve dusted with powdered sugar.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><a id="page-31"/><span class="dotted">CRÊPE RIBBONS WITH APPLES, WALNUTS, AND CINNAMON</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">For each serving, julienne half an apple and toss it in a pan with 2 tablespoons of melted butter, a small handful of chopped walnuts, a pinch of salt, a spoonful of sugar, and a pinch of ground cinnamon. Cook until the apples are just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, roll 3 crêpes (made from Crêpes recipe) like a cigar and cut crosswise into ribbons (they should look like fettuccine). Add the sliced crêpes to the apples, stir to combine, and then let the mixture cook until the bottom is crisp and browned, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately in a bowl like pasta, and say good-bye to cold cereal forever.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Decadent bread enriched with butter, milk, and eggs, brioche is a staple in French kitchens. I primarily use the dough for <em>brioche à tête,</em> little brioche rolls made in fluted molds that go by the same name, and also <em>bomboloni,</em> amazingly delicious, not-too-sweet doughnuts.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES A DOZEN SMALL BRIOCHES À TÊTE OR A BAKER’S DOZEN (13) BOMBOLONI]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large egg</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large egg yolk</p>
<p class="ingredient">2½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup sugar</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">¾ teaspoon active dry yeast</p>
<p class="ingredient">5 tablespoons (½ stick plus 1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing</p>
</div>
<div class="ingredients">
<h1 class="ingredients-title">IF YOU’RE MAKING BRIOCHE À TÊTE, YOU WILL ALSO NEED:</h1>
<p class="ingredient">An extra beaten egg, for brushing the tops</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredient">Butter and jam, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="ingredients">
<h1 class="ingredients-title">IF YOU’RE MAKING BOMBOLONI, YOU WILL ALSO NEED:</h1>
<p class="ingredient">Oil, for frying (corn, peanut, vegetable, canola, or grape-seed oil all work well)</p>
<p class="ingredient">Extra sugar, preferably superfine sugar,<a href="footnotes.xhtml#fn0001fn" id="fn0001"><sup>*</sup></a> for rolling</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In a small bowl,</strong> whisk together the milk, egg, and egg yolk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and mix briefly just to combine. Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and set the mixer on high speed. Let the dough mix until it goes from quite loose to the consistency of very thick cake batter, 2 to 3 minutes. Don’t panic while it’s mixing in fear that it won’t thicken and think you need to add more flour—just let it keep mixing and it will get there on its own. Once it’s thickened, stop the machine and scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure there are no pockets of flour or egg hiding anywhere.</p>
<p>Turn the mixer to medium speed and add the butter a little bit at a time (approximately 1 tablespoon per addition). Once all of the butter has been <a id="page-34"/>added, let the dough mix until it begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl and starts to gather on the dough hook, about 5 minutes.</p></div>
