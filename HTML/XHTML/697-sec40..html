<p class="nonindent">For years, I wanted to collaborate with a local North Carolina farm that raises rabbits. They treat the animals with such respect that I wanted to support them by becoming a significant and steady buyer, so I began researching Spanish rabbit dishes. I found a winner from the Canary Islands, which are in the Atlantic off the Southwestern coast of Spain. Rabbit dishes abound there. To keep the lean meat moist, I brine it to make it extra succulent and braise it until it’s fall-off-the-bone tender. Dark meat chicken works here, too, but doesn’t taste quite as complex. Eat this with a red wine from the Canary Islands. Their grapes grow in volcanic soils, yielding wines with a light body but a kind of funky bite.</p>
<p class="head1"><strong>BRINE</strong></p>
<div class="side1">
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup packed light brown sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 fresh or dried bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>10 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="side-text1"><strong>1 whole (3-pound) rabbit or 2½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="side">
<p class="head1"><strong>BRAISE</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>5 garlic cloves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ teaspoons fresh oregano leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 dried Nora chiles or 1 small New Mexico chile, stemmed and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 teaspoons pimentón (sweet smoked paprika)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ cups dry white wine, preferably Albariño</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons blended oil</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE BRINE, COMBINE THE SALT, SUGAR,</span> bay leaves, garlic, and peppercorns in a small saucepan and add 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar. Remove from the heat and stir in 2 cups water to cool. Transfer to a large bowl and refrigerate until cold.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cut the rabbit into 6 pieces: 2 hind legs, 2 front legs, and back with loin attached then split in half crosswise to form 2 pieces. Submerge in the brine, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove from the brine and pat dry.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the braise, preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indent">Puree the garlic, oregano, thyme, chiles, bay leaf, pimentón, cumin, vinegar, and 1½ cups water in a blender until smooth. With the machine running, add the wine in a steady stream.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or large, deep saucepot over medium-high heat. Add half of the rabbit pieces and sear, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining rabbit.</p>
<p class="indent">Drain excess oil from the Dutch oven, then add the wine mixture and the rabbit with its accumulated juices. If the liquid doesn’t cover the rabbit, add enough water so that the meat is barely covered. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven.</p>
<p class="indent">Braise in the oven until the meat is very tender and almost falling off the bone, about 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Carefully transfer the rabbit pieces to a platter. Bring the cooking liquid to a boil on the stovetop and reduce until thickened slightly. Pour the sauce over the rabbit and serve with crusty bread, the potatoes from the <a href="sec55.xhtml#page169">Patatas Bravas</a> or <a href="sec53.xhtml#page165">Olive Oil Potato Puree</a>.</p>

<h2 class="sec2"><a id="page136"/><span class="border1">CHICKEN STOCK</span><br/><br/></h2>
<h2 class="serve"><span class="small"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 13½ CUPS STOCK</strong></span></h2>
<p class="nonindent">From-scratch chicken stock has a purer, more intense chicken and vegetable flavor than canned but isn’t salty. Leaving stock unsalted gives you the flexibility of seasoning each dish to taste. And I scrub—not peel—the carrots. The peel doesn’t taste bad, so there’s no point in not using it.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To keep chicken stock on hand, freeze in stackable airtight pint or quart containers.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 pounds chicken neck, wings, and/or bones</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large carrots, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 head garlic, cut in half crosswise, extra skins removed</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 sprigs thyme</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 dried bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">COMBINE ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS IN A LARGE</span> stockpot. Add 12 cups cold water, then add more if needed to just cover the solids. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer; it should be bubbling only occasionally. Simmer for 1½ hours. If the water level ever goes under the chicken, be sure to add more cold water. Bring it up to a boil again, then bring it back down.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve or colander into another pot or container.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cover the stock tightly and refrigerate for up to 7 days or freeze for up to 3 months. To freeze the stock in smaller batches, cool the stock quickly in a large shallow dish in the fridge, then divide among smaller airtight containers and freeze.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To use frozen stock, zap the container in the microwave or immerse in a bowl of hot water for 30 seconds to pop the frozen stock out of the container. Put the block in a saucepan over super-low heat until melted. You don’t want to boil it because you don’t want it to evaporate.</p>
