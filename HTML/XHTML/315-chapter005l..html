<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-147"/><span class="dotted">Pâté de Campagne</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">This country pâté is the keystone to any charcuterie repertoire. A thick slice of this classic terrine makes a nice lunch alongside leafy greens or a first course for a casual Sunday supper. Dressed up with sliced black truffles, it’s ready for a holiday feast. The shopping list is the most intimidating part of the recipe, but the technique, no different than making meatloaf, is pretty straightforward. The terrine needs to rest overnight, so plan ahead.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[MAKES ONE 1-QUART TERRINE; ENOUGH FOR 12 PORTIONS]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">½ pound sliced bacon</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ pound slab bacon</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ pound fresh pork fatback</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 pound pork shoulder</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ pound pork or chicken livers</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 shallot, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">3 garlic cloves, finely minced or puréed on a Microplane grater</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ small yellow onion, peeled and finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 cups homemade, fresh bread crumbs (<a href="chapter008f.xhtml#page-268">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup Pineau des Charentes (a fortified French wine), sherry, or cognac</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="ingredient">3½ teaspoons coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon Pâté Spice (<a href="chapter008b.xhtml#page-261p">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon dried thyme</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon dried marjoram</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ teaspoon dried tarragon</p>
<p class="ingredient">Pinch ground allspice</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ cup shelled pistachios</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 large egg, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredient">Toast, whole-grain mustard, and cornichons, for serving</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Line a 1-quart,</strong> rectangular terrine mold with the sliced bacon, being sure to let the ends of the bacon hang over the edge. Place the prepared mold in the refrigerator while you prepare the pâté.</p>
<p>Cut the slab bacon, pork fatback, and pork shoulder into a fine dice. Chop the livers until they seem almost puréed. Run your knife through the meats and livers together to achieve a finer blend. There’s no need for a grinder or fancy tools here, as the most delicious terrines are chopped by hand. Place the chopped meats into a bowl and set aside in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Warm the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot, garlic, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the white wine and bring the mixture to a boil. <a id="page-148"/>Cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, stir together the bread crumbs and the fortified wine. Add the cooled vegetables along with the remaining ingredients and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to make sure everything is combined thoroughly. Combine this mixture with the reserved meat mixture. For optimal flavor, cover the final pâté mixture with plastic wrap and allow it to sit in the refrigerator overnight for the flavors to meld.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325°F. Set a kettle of water on to boil.</p>
<p>Evenly pack the pâté mixture into the prepared mold. Wrap the ends of the bacon over the pâté and place the lid of the terrine on top. If your terrine mold does not have a lid, wrap it tightly with aluminum foil. Place the terrine in a large baking dish and set it in the oven. Pull the rack out a little bit and carefully pour hot water into the baking dish so that it comes about two-thirds of the way up the sides of the terrine. Gently close the oven door to avoid splashing hot water into the mousse.</p>
<p>Bake until a thermometer inserted into the terrine registers 145°F, or until it’s firm to the touch, about 2 hours. Carefully remove the terrine from the oven and out of the baking dish. Place the entire terrine on a sheet pan. Remove the lid and place a piece of parchment paper over the surface of the pâté. Press down on the parchment paper with something heavy (a wine bottle works) so that the terrine gets nice and flat and even. The juice will come out of the pâté when you press it down—that’s what the sheet pan is for. Baste the pâté with these juices as it cools down to room temperature.</p>
<p>Once the pâté has cooled, remove it from the terrine mold and wrap it well in plastic wrap. Refrigerate it overnight before slicing.</p>
<p>Serve cold or at room temperature with plenty of toast, whole-grain mustard, and cornichons.</p></div>

<h1 class="recipe-title"><a id="page-149"/><span class="dotted">Aperitifs and Cocktails</span></h1>
<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Cocktails should be like clothing: change them depending on the season. In the heat of summer, nothing is better than a glass of cold Lillet served with tons of ice and a slice each of lemon and orange. A classic Manhattan made of strong bourbon braced with bitters and vermouth warms you in winter. A martini, like a pair of jeans, is good year-round. Keep in mind that cocktails are as much about the quality of your ingredients as they are about ceremony. Even the simplest drinks, which are my favorite drinks, require attention and care to make properly. Choose a beautiful glass, take the time to measure the correct ratios, use fresh ice, and don’t drink too quickly.</p></div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">AMAROS (ITALIAN HERBAL LIQUEURS, OFTEN BITTER)</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p><strong>Campari:</strong> My favorite first drink of the evening is a classic Campari (about an ounce) topped with soda (about 2 ounces) with a nice big slice of orange, served over ice.</p>
<p><strong>Cynar:</strong> An artichoke bitter digestif, it is usually drunk on the rocks with soda.</p>
<p><strong>Aperol:</strong> Made from rhubarb, Aperol is an <em>amaro</em> that is customarily served with a splash of orange juice and white wine.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">LILLET</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">This classic French aperitif made of wine, citrus liqueurs, and quinine (what makes tonic taste like tonic) is available in white (<em>blanc</em>), red, and rosé varieties. Whichever you choose, chill the bottle well and pour it over plenty of ice with a slice of lemon and a slice of orange in each wineglass or rocks glass.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">PERNOD</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Pernod is a French liqueur that tastes like anise. It’s used more often for cooking (with mussels, for example) than for drinking, but it does make a nice aperitif. To serve Pernod, place the bottle right on the table along with a tray filled with glasses, a pitcher of water, and a bowl of ice and let your guests mix drinks as they like them. In old French cafés, waiters used to splash a bit of Pernod on their towels and wipe down the table to perfume the air.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">KIR</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">For a kir, pour an ounce of crème de cassis (black currant liqueur) into a wineglass and top with cold white wine. For a kir royale, replace the wineglass with a Champagne flute and the white wine with Champagne. For a Communard, combine the cassis with red wine.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">A PERFECT MARTINI</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Chill a martini glass. Place a splash of vermouth into a mixing glass. Swirl it around so that the entire glass is coated with a whisper of vermouth. If you like your martini quite dry, pour out whatever vermouth is left in the mixing glass (otherwise, leave it in). Fill the mixing glass with ice. Don’t skimp on this step—ice is necessary to effectively chill and blend the other ingredients. Place 3 ounces of gin or vodka into the mixing glass. Stir for 30 seconds and then strain the mixture into the chilled martini glass. Garnish with olives, if you’d like, and serve immediately.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">A GOOD NEGRONI</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Stir equal parts Campari, gin, and Carpano Antica sweet vermouth (1 to 1¼ ounces of each, or just shy of a shot of each) with ice and serve on the rocks with a slice of orange.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">A CLASSIC MANHATTAN</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Chill your tumbler and drop an Amarena cherry into it. Rub a piece of orange peel over the inside of the glass and leave it in the glass. Fill your mixing glass with ice and pour over 1 ounce of sweet vermouth, 3 ounces of bourbon, and 3 to 5 dashes of bitters. Stir until well chilled and the ice begins to loosen. Strain into the seasoned, cold glass and serve immediately.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">PIMM’S CUP</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">Fill a glass with ice and pour over half Pimm’s (an herbal British liqueur) and half Old-Fashioned Lemonade (<a href="chapter003o.xhtml#page-94">here</a>). Fill the drink with sliced lemons, oranges, apples, cucumber, strawberries, and mint.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<h1 class="procedure-title"><span class="dotted">BEE’S KNEES</span></h1>
<div class="step">
<p class="step">For one drink, place 1½ ounces of gin in a cocktail shaker over plenty of ice and add 1 teaspoon of honey and 1 teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice. Cover the shaker and shake vigorously. Strain the drink into a coupe and serve immediately.</p></div>
