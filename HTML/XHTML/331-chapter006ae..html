<p><a id="page-227"/>To prepare the mussels, heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Add the fennel, shallots, garlic, thyme, parsley, and chili flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the vegetables liberally with salt. Stir in the mussels to combine them with the aromatics. Pour the wine and pastis over the mussels and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pot, and cook until all of the mussels have opened, about 5 minutes. Remove the mussels from the heat. Discard any mussels that have not opened.</p>
<p>At this point, you can portion the mussels into four large individual bowls, or onto one large serving platter. Scatter the crumbs over the mussels, pour over the broth, and serve immediately.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can wait until the mussels are cool enough to handle and then individually stuff each one with about a tablespoon of the bread crumb mixture and line them up in a skillet or on a sheet pan and broil them until the bread crumbs go a bit crunchy.</p>
<p>Place the broiled mussels into four large bowls or onto one large serving platter and pour the cooking liquid (which you’ve kept hot, mind you) over the top.</p>
<p>Whether or not you take the step to broil them is up to you, they are good both ways. Either way, be sure to serve them alongside a bowl of Rouille, which you can spoon onto your mussels as you eat them—pretty much heaven as far as I am concerned.</p>
