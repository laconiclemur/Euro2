			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes about 12 (1½-inch) squares  </span>I love being inspired by a dish I have eaten somewhere else. I had this beautiful strawberry consommé during the dessert course at Michel Trauma’s restaurant in France. The servers just keep filling your glass whenever you finished it. At the time I had never tasted anything like it. It was the most intense strawberry flavor, but not at all cloying. When we started to put the lemon cheesecake bites together at our restaurant, I instantly thought of what a perfect fit the strawberry consommé would be. The combination of lemon, strawberries, and lemon verbena is absolutely incredible. We serve it with a scoop of strawberry sorbet garnished with a candied lemon verbena leaf.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Strawberry Sorbet</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a saucepot, combine the strawberries and sugar with 1 cup of water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook at a lively simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the strawberries and syrup to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and stir in the Simple Syrup. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until completely cold.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Transfer the mixture to an ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Remove the sorbet from the machine, transfer to a container, cover, and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Graham Cracker Crust</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbs with the sugar until blended. Add the melted butter and, using your hands, work the mixture until the crumbs are all moist and coated with butter. Transfer the crumbs into a 9 x 13-inch pan and press them into an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes or until toasted. Remove the pan from the oven and let the crust cool completely.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page312">Make the Lemon Cheesecake Bites</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, sugar, eggs, cornstarch, vanilla, lemon zest, and salt and beat on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and no chunks of cream cheese remain, 3 to 4 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and mix again until thoroughly combined.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Add the egg yolks, one at a time, with the mixer on medium-low speed, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides after each addition. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the heavy cream, milk, and lemon juice. At this point, the batter should be smooth and free of any lumps.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Pour the batter into the prepared crust. Place the pan into a larger pan and fill the larger pan with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the smaller pan. Bake the batter for 40 to 45 minutes or until the cheesecake is firm to the touch and the center is no longer jiggly. Carefully remove the smaller pan from the water bath and let it cool. Using a knife dipped in hot water, carefully cut the cheesecake into twelve 1½-inch individual squares. Wipe the knife, dip it back into the hot water, and wipe it dry between cuts.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Strawberry Consommé</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>In a saucepot, combine the strawberries, sugar, mint, verbena, and pepper with 1½ cups of water and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, uncovered, for about 40 minutes or until the mixture has a thickish, jamlike consistency and the strawberries are beginning to disintegrate. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl; reserve the fruit and discard the mint and verbena sprigs. Place the bowl of strawberry consommé over an ice bath and cool the liquid until ice cold. Refrigerate the consommé and strawberries, separately, until needed.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Candied Verbena Leaves</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dip the leaves in the egg white, then in the sugar until evenly coated. Transfer the leaves to the lined baking sheet and let stand in a dry place for about 2 hours.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Dish</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>For each serving, arrange 3 pieces of cheesecake on a plate. Spoon some Strawberry Consommé around the cheesecake and top one piece with a quenelle of Strawberry Sorbet. Scatter the reserved macerated strawberries around, top another cheesecake piece with a dollop of the Whipped Cream, and garnish with a Candied Lemon Verbena Leaf.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes 4 to 6 (6-ounce) soufflés  </span>This dessert was originally created during an <span class="ital">Iron Chef America </span>episode for a familiar-to-me themed battle—Thanksgiving—except this was round two, and I was paired with Jose Garces, an Iron Chef, against two other Iron Chefs: Michael Symon and Bobby Flay. Since I was going up against some very stiff competition, I knew I had to dig deep into my bag of tricks and pull out something that would truly wow the judges. The soufflé didn’t disappoint, and Henry Winkler, a.k.a. “the Fonz,” who was one of the judges, said it was the best soufflé he’d ever had.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIntro-addl">The recipe here makes six dessert-size soufflés, but if you happen to be making dinner for four people, stick with these proportions (3 cups apple puree to 1½ cups whipped egg whites) to get a perfect soufflé every time. No one has ever complained about having an extra soufflé lying around.</p>
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Salted Caramel</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">1 cup granulated sugar</li>
			<li class="il">2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
			<li class="il">¾ cup heavy cream</li>
			<li class="il">2 ounces (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed</li>
			<li class="il">1½ teaspoons fine sea salt, plus additional to taste</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="RecipeIngredientHead">For the Apple Pie Soufflé</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">¾ ounce (1½ tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed, plus additional for buttering the ramekins</li>
			<li class="il">1 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, plus additional for dusting the ramekins</li>
			<li class="il">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus additional for dusting the ramekins</li>
			<li class="il">6 large Granny Smith or Honeycrisp apples, cored and sliced</li>
			<li class="il">1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
			<li class="il">1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
			<li class="il">1 cup egg whites (from about 6 large eggs), room temperature</li>
			<li class="il">Pinch of kosher salt</li>
			<li class="il">Pinch of cream of tartar</li>
			<li class="il">Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting the soufflés</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Salted Caramel</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and ¼ cup of water in a very clean saucepot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue to cook the caramel until it becomes a medium amber color (or the color of an Irish setter)—watch carefully and do not let the caramel burn. While the caramel cooks, do not stir it with a spoon, but gently swirl the caramel around the pot. Use a clean, moist pastry brush to remove any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pot. As soon as the caramel is ready, remove it from the heat and gently whisk in the heavy cream and butter. Be careful: The caramel will bubble and sputter, so stand back. Whisk in the salt. Taste and add more salt if you like. Transfer the caramel to a bowl; you will have about 2 cups salted caramel. Refrigerate the sauce until needed. The sauce will keep, covered, for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Prepare the Apple Pie Soufflé</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Generously butter 4 to 6 (6-ounce) ramekins and dust the inside of the ramekins with sugar and cinnamon. Set the ramekins aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single" id="page314"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Toss the apples with the butter, 1 cup of the sugar, the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves and transfer the mixture to an ovenproof roasting pan. Bake the apples for about 30 minutes or until they are soft and falling apart.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Transfer the cooked apples, without their cooking liquid, to a blender and puree until they are completely smooth; the texture should be smoother and finer than regular applesauce. (At the restaurant, we use a Vitamix to get our apple puree to the right consistency, but at home you can use a regular blender and then strain your puree through a fine-mesh strainer or a chinois to get any remaining lumps out.) Transfer the apple puree to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. You should have about 4 cups apple puree.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Place the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg whites on medium speed and slowly add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and cream of tartar. Continue beating until the egg whites become foamy. Raise the mixer speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form (when the whisk is lifted from the mixture, there should be a standing peak in the area where it was lifted).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>Measure 3 cups of the apple puree into a separate bowl, and use a rubber spatula to gently fold in 1½ cups of the whipped egg whites.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Fill the ramekins to the top with the batter, and smooth out the tops with an offset spatula. Place a kitchen towel on the counter and gently tap the ramekins on the towel to release any trapped air bubbles. Transfer the ramekins to a baking sheet and bake for about 8 minutes or until the soufflés have risen and are firm when lightly tapped. While the soufflés bake, do not open the door to the oven.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>While the soufflés bake, gently reheat the Salted Caramel in a small saucepan over low heat until warm and easily pourable.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Remove the soufflés and sprinkle them with confectioners’ sugar. Poke a small hole in the middle of each soufflé and drizzle warmed Salted Caramel into it. Serve the soufflés immediately, with the remaining salted caramel sauce on the side.</p>

			<h1 class="RecipeTitle" id="Mini">Mini Meyer Lemon Pies</h1>
			</div>
			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes 15 to 16 mini pies  </span>There are a few things I like the taste of but don’t necessarily eat because of the ingredients that go into making them. One of the things I don’t like to admit is that I actually like McDonald’s breakfast offerings—and I love their apple pie. This dessert was inspired by those crispy, deep-fried apple hand pies. You can use any fruit filling you want, but here, I really love to use fragrant, tart Meyer lemon curd. These are particularly great in the winter when Meyer lemons are in season and there’s not much available in the way of fruit but citrus.</p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">
			<li class="il">4 large egg yolks, room temperature</li>
			<li class="il">6 tablespoons fresh Meyer lemon juice or other fresh citrus juice</li>
			<li class="il">6 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
			<li class="il">2 ounces (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed</li>
			<li class="il">1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
			<li class="il">All-purpose flour</li>
			<li class="il">1 (11 x 16-inch) <a href="FORGE_13_BM_Index_PPF.xhtml#Puffpastry">store-bought puff pastry sheet</a></li>
			<li class="il">4 cups canola oil, for frying</li>
			<li class="il">Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>In a medium nonreactive bowl, whisk the egg yolks until combined.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the lemon juice, sugar, and butter and place over medium heat, whisking to completely dissolve the sugar. Make sure the sugar is fully dissolved and the butter is melted. Bring the liquid to a boil, then remove from the heat. Slowly pour one-third of the hot lemon mixture into the egg yolks while whisking vigorously to temper the eggs. After the first third of the lemon mixture has been incorporated, slowly pour in the remaining mixture, whisking constantly until well combined.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Return the mixture to the saucepan and place the pan over low heat. Do not let the curd come to a boil. Whisk constantly, until the curd thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the curd from the heat and transfer it to a clean, nonreactive bowl; you will have about ¾ cup lemon curd. Cover the bowl and let the curd cool completely.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk the egg with 1 tablespoon of water until combined. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry until it is a roughly 12 x 19-inch rectangle. Using a 3½-inch ring cutter, cut out discs of the puff pastry—you should be able to cut out about 15 discs. Using a pastry brush, brush the top half of each puff pastry disc with the egg wash. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the Meyer lemon curd and fold the puff pastry over to make a small half-moon shaped pie. Press or crimp the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough discs and lemon curd. Transfer the filled pies to the lined baking sheet and freeze for 1 hour or until frozen through.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>Place the oil in a large, high-sided pan set over medium-high heat, and heat until the oil registers 350ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Line a tray or large plate with paper towels. Gently slide up to 8 pies into the oil (do not crowd the pan or the temperature will drop) and fry until the pies are golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Be careful when frying—the oil may spatter, so stand back and wear protective clothing. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pies from the oil and transfer to the paper towel–lined tray. Repeat with the remaining pies. Dust the pies with confectioners’ sugar and serve warm.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>If you’re making these hand pies for a crowd, this recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Serves 8  </span>I asked Ashton, my pastry chef, to do something fun and interesting with pecan pie, and this is her spin. Pecan pie is rich on its own, but served with bread pudding, it’s even more decadent. The dessert was a hit with our patrons—and we return to the recipe time and time again. It’s even better when paired with <a href="FORGE_11_Cocktails_PPF.xhtml#Banana">Banana Jameson</a>, or with the addition of banana to the bread pudding (see <a href="FORGE_09_Desserts_PPF.xhtml#variation">variation</a>).</p>

			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Preheat the oven to 375ºF; position the rack in the middle. Butter 8 (6-ounce) ramekins. Spoon the bread mixture into the ramekins and sprinkle the Brown Sugar Crumble on top of the bread.

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Cocoa Marshmallows</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Place 6 tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin over water, stir, and set aside.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>Place 1 cup of water in a pot wide enough for the bottom of a stand mixer bowl to fit snugly on top. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. In a bowl of a stand mixer, combine the sugar, egg whites, corn syrup, and 2 tablespoons of the cocoa powder with 2 tablespoons of water. Place the mixer bowl over the pot of simmering water and whisk continuously until all the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot to the touch. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the bloomed gelatin (the gelatin should have doubled in size and will not be in powdered form).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Affix the mixer bowl to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix the batter on medium speed until the mixture is thick and glossy, 5 to 8 minutes. The mixture should be thick and light in color, and when you remove the whisk, it should feel elastic and the batter will cling to the whisk. Immediately transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch tip or a resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped to make a ½-inch-wide opening (see <a href="#note1">Note</a>).</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">4.	</span>Combine the remaining ½ cup cocoa powder with 1 cup of confectioners’ sugar and lightly coat a baking sheet with half of the cocoa–confectioners’ sugar mixture. Pipe long strands of the marshmallow mixture onto the sheet tray. If, when you start to pipe the marshmallows, the batter is too runny, let it sit in the bag for 1 to 2 minutes, and then try again. Sift more of the cocoa–confectioners’ sugar mixture over the strands until totally covered. Allow the marshmallows to come to room temperature. When firm, cut the marshmallows into 1-inch pieces and toss them in the remaining confectioners’ sugar.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page324">Make the Coffee Nutella Ice Cream</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a saucepot, bring the cream, milk, sugar, Nutella, and espresso powder to a simmer over medium heat, stirring periodically to prevent the liquid from burning on the bottom. Remove from the heat.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly drizzle one-third of the warm mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, to temper the eggs. Pour the tempered egg yolk mixture into the pot with the remaining milk mixture, whisking constantly. Return the saucepot to the stovetop over low heat. Stir the mixture constantly until it is thickened and coats the back of the spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the custard from the heat and strain it through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Set the bowl over an ice bath and stir until cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Refrigerate the custard until cold, at least 2 hours and preferably overnight. When completely cold, transfer the custard to the ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s specifications. Transfer the ice cream to a container, cover, and freeze for at least 2 hours or until firm.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="candiedhazelnuts">Make the Candied Hazelnuts</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Preheat the oven to 300ºF; position the rack in the middle. Toast the hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan for 7 to 9 minutes or until fragrant. Transfer the nuts to a bowl and allow them to cool.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>In a saucepot set over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, espresso powder, and cocoa powder with ¼ cup water and bring the syrup to a boil. Cook the syrup until it reaches a hard-crack stage (between 300ºF and 320ºF) on a candy thermometer. (If you dip a spoon into the syrup and plunge it into cold water and the sugar becomes hard instantly, the sugar has reached the hard-crack stage). Remove the pot from the heat, add the reserved hazelnuts and stir until the hazelnuts are coated in the thick syrup. Keep stirring until the nuts lighten in color and look almost “sandy”; this is when they are crystallizing and hardening. Immediately transfer the nuts to a wax paper–lined tray set over a cooling rack, and evenly spread out the mixture. Let the candied nuts cool to room temperature. Transfer the nuts to a food processor and pulse into coarse crumbs.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Nutella Sauce</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Place the Nutella in a large bowl. In a saucepot, bring the heavy cream to a boil over medium-high heat and pour over the Nutella. Let the mixture sit for 1 minute before whisking it together until smooth and shiny. Set aside.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Make the Brownies</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Place a metal bowl over a medium saucepan of 2 inches of simmering water. Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Combine the milk and dark chocolates and butter in the metal bowl and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth and homogeneous.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars and the eggs until well combined. Add the melted chocolate to the sugar-egg mixture, and mix until well combined. Add the flour and stir until the batter is free of any lumps. Pour the batter into a (8 x 8-inch) baking pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and allow it to cool completely before cutting into 16 individual squares. The brownies should keep for 3 days, tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</p>

			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes 1 (8-inch) double-layer cake  </span>This chocolate cake got Ashton, who was our hostess at the time, from the front of the house to the back of the house and into the kitchen as a pastry chef. At the time, I was doing our pastries myself, trying to save a little extra money for the restaurant. I was having a hard time with it, given that I was also cooking on the line and trying to run the restaurant. One day, Ashton came up to me. “Chef, is it okay if I make you a chocolate cake?” Who says no to an offer like that? Certainly not me. So, I said, “Sure, I’d love a chocolate cake!” Ashton’s cake was incredible—I absolutely loved it and wanted to put it on the menu immediately. About three weeks later, we started to discuss her helping out with pastries. Things kind of went from there and, as they say, the rest is history.</p>

			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="page326">Make the Chocolate Buttercream</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">5.	</span>In a saucepot, bring 1 inch of water to a simmer over low heat. In the clean, dry bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the egg whites and sugar. Place the bowl over the pot of simmering water (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water) and whisk until the egg white mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar granules are fully dissolved. Remove from the heat and affix the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk the warmed egg whites on medium speed until the bowl is cool to the touch. With the mixer on low, add the cubes of butter one at a time. When all the butter has been added, raise the mixer speed to medium. The mixture will go through a phase where it resembles cottage cheese­—anticipate this and do not be discouraged. Continue beating the mixture until it is uniform and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla extract or seeds and mix to fully incorporate.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">6.	</span>With the mixer on low speed, whisk the cocoa powder, ¼ cup at a time, until the cocoa is fully incorporated and the buttercream is smooth. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl before each cocoa addition.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead">Assemble the Cake</h2>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">7.	</span>Using a serrated knife, trim the tops of the cakes so they are straight and even. Center one of the cakes, trimmed side up, on a rotating cake stand. Place ½ to ¾ cup of the buttercream on the center of the cake layer. Using an offset spatula, spread the frosting evenly over the layer until it reaches the edges.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">8.	</span>Carefully place the second cake layer, trimmed side down, over the first layer; this will ensure that the cake will have a smooth top and will be easier to frost.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">9.	</span>Place 1 cup of the buttercream on the center of the cake; this will be your <a href="#crumb">crumb coat</a>. Spread the buttercream in a thin layer all over the cake, starting with the top and working your way down and over the sides. The crumb coat will trap any crumbs so that the cake does not have any crumbs in the second coating of buttercream. Be sure to also fill any gaps between the cake layers with the crumb coat, smoothing out (to the best of your ability) the frosting. Refrigerate the cake on the stand for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">10.	</span>Return the cake stand to the counter and place about 1 cup of the buttercream on top. Using an offset spatula, frost the cake evenly from the top down, adding more buttercream as needed. Frost the sides of the cake as well. To smooth out the top, using the back side of your spatula, sweep across the cake from edge to edge in one direction in one smooth motion. Wipe the spatula clean. Smooth out the sides of the cake by placing the back side of the spatula against the buttercream and applying gentle pressure as you slowly turn the cake stand. You can also choose to pipe the second coat of frosting (as shown in picture) using a #21 cake tip.</p>
			
			<h2 class="RecipeProcedureHead" id="whippedcream">Make the Whipped Cream</h2>
			
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">11.	</span>When ready to serve, in the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or using a hand-held mixer), whip the cream and sugar on high speed until stiff peaks form, 2 minutes.</p>
			<p class="method"><span class="methodnum">12.	</span>To serve, slice the cake and serve each slice with a dollop of whipped cream on top or just dust with confectioners’ sugar.</p>
			<p class="RecipeNote" id="note2"><span class="RecipeNoteHead">Note  </span>Don’t discard that scraped vanilla bean—they are expensive—so try to get the most use out of them. Let the vanilla bean pod dry, and use it to infuse the dairy base for ice cream, or place it in a jar of sugar to make vanilla sugar. You can also add it to a bottle of your favorite spirit to give it amazing vanilla flavor.</p>
			
			<div class="notebackground">
			<div class="notepadding">
			<p class="RecipeNotePara-plus" id="crumb"><span class="RecipeNoteHead-plus">+  </span>A crumb coat is essential to getting that beautiful, perfectly applied frosting. By applying the crumb coat and chilling the cake before applying more frosting, you are trapping all the loose crumbs in the first coat. When you finish frosting the cake, the result will be a beautiful, crumb-free frosting and a cake that is stunning in looks as well as in taste.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p class="RecipeIntro"><span class="Serves">Makes 16 (3-inch) cookies  </span>It’s hard to beat a freshly baked cookie right out of the oven, especially when it’s accompanied by a glass of very cold milk. I remember when I was a kid, my mom would bake cookies and set them on the counter to cool. I always tried to grab a cookie without her noticing, but she always saw me coming, and would gently tap my hand, telling me that the cookies needed to rest a little bit before I could eat them. She probably didn’t want me to burn the roof of my mouth, but all I wanted was a hot cookie, with warm melted chocolate, right out of the oven. And that’s how we serve them to our guests at the restaurant: baked to order and hot from the oven, accompanied by a glass of cold milk, of course. </p>
			
			<ul class="ing-list">

			<li class="il">1 large egg, room temperature</li>
			<li class="il">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>

			<li class="il">½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li class="il">1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
			<li class="il">Whole milk, for serving, preferably unhomogenized</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">1.	</span>Preheat the oven to 350ºF; position the rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with the sugars and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the egg and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and beat until fully incorporated.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">2.	</span>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, 1 cup at a time, beating until fully incorporated. Either fold in the chocolate chips by hand or mix them in on low speed. The dough will be slightly sticky. You can use the dough right away or cover the bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days to make it easier to work with.</p>
			<p class="method-single"><span class="methodnum">3.	</span>Using a 1½- to 2-inch diameter cookie scoop, spoon balls of the cookie dough onto the lined baking sheet. Lightly press the dough balls to 2 to 3 inches in diameter, leaving 2 inches of space between the cookies. Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, rotating the pan after 5 minutes or until edges are golden brown. (Note: It’s better to slightly underbake the cookies to maintain a soft, gooey center and a chewy, toothsome edge, but if you prefer a crispier cookie, flatten the dough balls more and bake for 1 to 2 minutes longer.) Serve warm, with a glass of very cold milk.</p>

Kristin loves anything blood orange, so I set out to create a dessert that would impress. I was basically homeless at the time, between apartments, and made her dessert at her place. I have always loved a simple Italian-style olive oil cake, and thought that the blood orange flavor, with its bitter and sweet notes, would play well against the herbal notes of the olive oil. Kristin loved the cake, and it was the very first thing to go on our dessert menu.</p>

			<p class="FeatureTitle">Marcelli Formaggi</p>
			<p class="FeatureTitleSub">Bob Marcelli</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">At the restaurant, we serve only Bob Marcelli’s cheeses, and even aside from our personal connection (he worked for my dad at An American Place), Bob’s cheeses are some of the best I’ve ever had. But the story of how these cheeses came to be available in the United States is something of a happy accident.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">A chef by training, Bob Marcelli stumbled into cheese making after he took a family trip to visit a village in Abruzzo, where his grandfather grew up. To escape the lack of opportunity, Bob’s grandfather left his beautiful little village when he was about sixteen years old for the promise of a better life in the United States, and never looked back. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The original plan was to stay in Bob’s grandfather’s village for three days. “What are we going to do there for three whole days?” Bob thought at the time, expecting to be bored day one.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">But in a surprising turn of events, Bob fell in love with the village and its landscape. He met his cousin Nunzio and the communication between the two proved amusing, as Bob didn’t speak any Italian and Nunzio spoke only snippets of broken English. Bob quickly learned of the family business, the farm they started in the 1970s to preserve the way of life that has existed in Italy for centuries. On the farm, the family raised sheep and made cheese the old-fashioned way, which happened to coincide with the rising interest in authentic food products in the United States.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">When Bob tasted the cheese, he was blown away. Never in his life had he ever tasted anything like it. Being a chef, Bob was used to working with great ingredients, but what he had just tasted was so extraordinary and so off the charts that he and his father decided they should do something for their Italian cousins. Over the next couple of years, they went back and forth visiting one another, and finally Bob decided to bring some of the cheese to the States, knowing there would be demand for it. At first, Nunzio was resistant to the idea—he didn’t want his way of life to be altered. But eventually he agreed to start exporting the cheeses, and he and Bob spent the year that followed trying to figure out the labyrinthine rules of exporting and importing a food product from Italy to the United States. Finally, the cheese made it to U.S. soil, and Bob and his family started doing cheese tastings for some chefs—one of whom was my dad, who loved the cheeses and encouraged me to try them. </p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">At that time, I was in the process of opening my restaurant. I had grown up with Bob’s kids and knew his family very well. Two of Bob’s kids went to the Culinary Institute of America and were on my opening restaurant staff. It was a nice little family circle.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">The first time I tasted one of Marcelli’s cheeses—the Gregoriano, I think—I closed my eyes and could almost see the sheep grazing on the hills at the farm and smell the Abruzzo air. In the end, I wound up being Bob’s first customer—something I’m very proud of.</p>
			<p class="FeaturePara">A few bites of Marcelli’s cheeses is the perfect way to end an evening of good food and wine. We serve the cheeses with Abruzzo honey, but at home, you can serve the cheese with your finest honey, some toast, and if you like, <a href="FORGE_09_Desserts_PPF.xhtml#candiedhazelnuts">Candied Hazelnuts</a>.</p>
