<blockquote>
<p class="txc1"><b>Although it’s one of my favourite vegetables, the aubergine can be a capricious character in the kitchen. Badly cooked, it’s tough, dry and bitter but, well cooked, it melts in the mouth, is juicy and almost sweet. By adding miso and caramelizing it, this hidden sweetness is emphasized even more.</b></p>
</blockquote> 
<p class="h2">Serves 2</p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 aubergines [eggplants]</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>neutral flavoured oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 vegetable stock [bouillon] cube</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp soy sauce</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 Tbsp sake (or any dry white wine)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 Tbsp mirin (or any sweet white wine)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 Tbsp white miso</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>sesame seeds</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>chilli powder or chilli flakes, to garnish</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Preheat the oven to 200ºC/180ºC fan/400ºF/Gas 6.</p>
<p class="tx2">Cut the aubergines in half lengthwise. Using a sharp knife, make deep diagonal cuts, 1cm [½in] apart, in the aubergine flesh, without piercing the skin. Now make more cuts on the opposite diagonal so the flesh is scored in a lattice pattern. Brush the flesh of each aubergine half with oil and sprinkle with salt. Lay the halves on a baking sheet, flesh side up, and cook in the oven for 35–40 minutes. Test with the point of a knife – the aubergine flesh should be very tender.</p>
<p class="tx2">Meanwhile, put a saucepan over a high heat, add 125ml [½ cup] water, the crumbled vegetable stock cube, soy sauce, sake and mirin. Bring to the boil and bubble until the sauce reduces by one-third. Take the pan off the heat and add the miso, mixing it in well.</p>
<p class="tx2">When the aubergines are cooked, brush them with the reduced mirin sauce, making sure you brush plenty into the cuts in the flesh. Sprinkle over some sesame seeds and grill [broil] the aubergines until the surface begins to caramelize and small bubbles appear on the surface. Remove the aubergines from the heat and sprinkle with a pinch of chilli powder or chilli flakes for that extra kick.</p>

<p class="txc2"><b>Something to meditate on</b></p>
<p class="txc"><b>In France, a dish is considered complete (we say ‘abouti’) when nothing else can be added to it. In Japan, a dish is ‘abouti’ when nothing can be taken away. Which proves that it’s all a question of your point of view...</b></p>

<div class="ser"><a id="page_143"/><img alt="images" src="images/img-143-1.jpg"/></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc1"><b>Ratatouille is slow-cooked comfort food where the flavours of all the different ingredients combine harmoniously to produce a dish that is greater than the sum of its parts. The problem is that it can often look like vegetable porridge but not here, where it’s guaranteed to blow you away!</b></p>
</blockquote> 
<p class="h2">Serves 4</p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 large tomatoes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 yellow courgette [zucchini]</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 green courgette [zucchini]</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 small aubergines [eggplants]</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 onion</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 red [bell] peppers, deseeded</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>sea [kosher] salt flakes and pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme and rosemary leaves</b></p>
<p class="tx2">Using a very sharp knife, cut the tomatoes, courgettes and aubergines into thin slices. As much as possible try to ensure all the slices are the same thickness so they cook evenly. Set the best-looking slices of the same size – at least 5cm [2in] in diameter – to one side for topping the ratatouille and keep the trimmings for the sauce.</p>
<p class="tx2">Roughly chop the onion, peppers and garlic cloves. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the chopped veg to the pan with the sliced vegetable trimmings. Season with salt and pepper and add the thyme and rosemary leaves. Cook for 10 minutes and then blitz in a blender to make a thick, orangey red sauce.</p>
<p class="tx2">Preheat the oven to 180ºC/160ºC fan/350ºF/Gas 4. Brush an ovenproof dish with oil and spoon the sauce into it in an even layer, about 1cm [½in] thick.</p>
<p class="tx2">Roll up your sleeves and arrange the reserved tomato, courgette and aubergine slices alternately on top of the sauce. So that they look really good, you need to overlap the slices quite tightly, a bit like the scales of a fish. Give the slices a final drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle over flakes of salt. Cover the dish with foil or baking parchment and bake for 30–45 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx2">Place the dish in the centre of the dining table and wait for the “wow!” that is bound to follow. If it doesn’t, take your dish back and eat the ratatouille in the kitchen all by yourself. But there’s no chance of that!</p>

<p class="tx2">Add the tofu cubes but do not stir any more, simply push the cubes very gently back and forth in the wok so they don’t break up.</p>

<p class="ttl0"><a href="chapter_Split3.xhtml#toc_19"><b>The 5 essential kitchen knives you need</b></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="txc"><b>Chef + knife = love. This complex equation is the basis of the special relationship cooks have with the tools in their kitchen. Joking apart, having the right knives not only lets you work more quickly but also helps you feel more relaxed and comfortable in your kitchen. I’ve classified the knives I use in decreasing order of importance. P.S. If you’re on a budget, concentrate on the first three...</b></p>
</blockquote> 
<div class="ser1"><img alt="images" src="images/img-151-1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="h2">Chef’s knife</p>
<p class="tx2">A 15-cm [6-in] blade is most practical; up to 22-cm [9-in] is more macho. For cutting, chopping, dicing and even breaking small bones, it is the ideal partner for all sorts of jobs in the kitchen. There’s no point in spending a fortune but it is difficult to find a decent knife for less than 30 euros [about £25/US$40]. German, Japanese, American, French… it doesn’t matter where it’s made; choose one you feel comfortable using.</p> 
<div class="ser1"><img alt="images" src="images/img-151-2.jpg"/></div>
<p class="h2">Paring knife</p>
<p class="tx2">Smaller, with a blade about 10cm [4in] long, it complements the chef’s knife perfectly, performing all those little tasks that require more precision, such as chopping a clove of garlic or lump of root ginger, as well as peeling a turnip or mushroom.</p> 
<div class="ser1"><img alt="images" src="images/img-151-3.jpg"/></div>
<p class="h2">Serrated knife</p>
<p class="tx2">There are certain foods that seem complicated or even dangerous to chop with a chef’s knife. I am thinking of melon, watermelon, squash and things like that. So, rather than exerting brute force, with a serrated knife you only need to use a sawing motion. The knife is also very practical for cutting fragile foods and anything in layers, such as a sandwich, for example.</p> 
<div class="ser1"><img alt="images" src="images/img-151-4.jpg"/></div>
<p class="h2">Filleting knife</p>
<p class="tx2">A knife that has a long, thin and – most important of all – flexible blade. This is the Number One knife for removing the fillets from whole fish and for slicing ham and all other delicate, fragile foods super thinly. For me, I find the best ones come from Finland.</p> 
<div class="ser1"><img alt="images" src="images/img-151-5.jpg"/></div>
<p class="h2">Chinese cleaver</p>
<p class="tx2">Be aware that this is not the same as a meat cleaver but a lighter and much cheaper version. It is a knife with a very wide and quite heavy blade so you needn’t worry about damaging it. I use mine for all kinds of things besides just preparing stir-fries – as a dough scraper, a worktop cleaner, a food shovel… oh, and I hack through big bones with it too.</p>
