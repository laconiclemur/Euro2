<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hanks, first and foremost, to the Gascons who opened their doors for us, and to those who knocked on ours. I am especially grateful to Nadine Cauzette, a magnificent cook and a natural-born teacher, and to André Dubosc, the most knowledgeable ambassador for Gascony I could ever have wished to meet. Thanks also to Diane Caillard and her husband, Nicolas Kujawa, and to Patrick Fitan, a man for whom the phrase <i>joie de vivre</i> seems to have been specially coined. To Alphonse Caulier, Michel Basso, and the rest of the Esbouhats: If the spirit of the <i>mousquetaires</i> is alive and well anywhere in Gascony, it is in the bodega behind the old bastide. Thanks to Henri and Monique de Rességuier, whose patience and kindness would certainly meet the definition of <i>noblesse oblige</i>, and to Amandine Belmonte, who is wise so very far beyond her years. Special thanks to Paula Wolfert, who, unbeknownst to her, became my spirit guide during my first forays into Gascon cookery. Thanks, too, to Maurice Coscuella, Alain Lagors, Fred Poppe, Lut Goudleder, Tim and Chloé Wootton, Jean-Claude Dupuy, Colette Lasserre, Sandra Lemarechal, André Daguin, and his daughter, Ariane, who kindled my interest in Gascony with a phone call and a prediction: “This place will change your life.” It did.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_260" title="260"/>I owe enormous gratitude to my agent, Daniel Greenberg, who shepherded me through the book-making process with such aplomb. I’m equally grateful to my editor, Jonathan Jao, for peering into the thickets of my first draft and locating the true path, and to his colleague Sofia Ergas Groopman, whose line edits helped me do a rather un-Gascon thing: Trim the fat.</p>
<p class="indent">This book also benefited immeasurably from talented and insightful early readers. Mark Adams is preeminent among them: He is the most astute and sympathetic guide a first-time author could ever want. Thank you to Maura Fritz, who steered me away from so many writerly pitfalls, and to Alex Fischer, Melinda Blum, and the friends and colleagues who considered my first, inchoate ideas for the book and said, “Do it”: David Brown, Bonnie Eldon, James Oseland, and Holly Dolce, among others.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to my parents, Jim and Susan McAninch, for their boundless love and support, and to Michele and Charlotte, for sticking with me, and for finding so much joy and beauty in places I’d never have thought to look.</p>
