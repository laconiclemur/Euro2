<p class="ct" id="ch1"><span class="script-i">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="co">In my other cookbooks, I always included rice dishes cooked in the Italian manner. This book is comprised totally of recipes that have rice as a fundamental ingredient.</p>
<p class="tx">The majority of these dishes have their origin in Northern Italy because most rice grown in Italy comes from the valley of its major river, the Po. Rice is the pasta of Northern Italy. I will be presenting a number of dishes using rice, everything from soups, salads, main courses, and even a few desserts. I am sure you will be as delighted as I was to discover these many pearls of Italian cuisine that are unknown, at least outside of Italy.</p>
<p class="tx">Rice was first introduced to European gastronomy by the Sicilians. In the ninth century, the Arabs brought rice farming to Sicily. Unfortunately, the methods of cultivation in those times were rudimentary and the terrain produced sparse crops. Hence the price was high and rice was served only on the tables of the wealthy. In the centuries following, the situation became progressively worse and the planting of rice in Sicily was completely abandoned.</p>
<p class="tx">However, as soon as a tourist arrives in Sicily today, his first encounter with the cuisine will be with rice croquettes called <span class="epub-i">arancini.</span> They are sold everywhere, in fry stands on the beach, in cafés, and in bars serving hot food (<span class="epub-i">tavloa calda</span>). This is easy to explain. The Sicilians’ love of this particular dish remained, even though rice was not readily available.</p>
<p class="tx">Be that as it may, this southern Italian concedes that Northern Italy has raised cooking rice to an art.</p>
<p class="tx">When I was on <span class="epub-i">Live! with Regis and Kathy Lee</span> in 1992, I cooked a risotto Calabrese. I had a tough time explaining to Regis what a risotto was. We wound up shouting at each other, but in jest. To finally clear up any misunderstanding, Regis, here is how a risotto is made: You begin by usually sautéing onions in butter and olive oil. Next, add the rice and sauté that, too. Then you add boiling hot broth, cup by cup, until the rice absorbs all the liquid. This takes about eighteen minutes of continual stirring with a wooden spoon. Okay. Let’s go back to the beginning.</p>
<p class="tx">In order to better understand Italian cooking, we have to know some basic facts about Italy. Italy is a peninsula shaped like a boot. It is a relatively small country; two-thirds the size of the state of California. Including Sicily and Sardinia, it has only 116,216 square miles.</p>
<p class="tx">Being a peninsula means that Italy is surrounded by seas: the Tyrrehenian on the west, the Ionian on the south, and the Adriatic on the east. The rocky Tyrrehenian coast has two principal ports: Genoa and Naples. The Adriatic coast is rich with gorgeous beaches; the Ionian coast is essentially a desert.</p>
<p class="tx">At its north, the Alps separate Italy from the rest of Europe. At the feet of the Alps begins the Po valley, a large, flat plateau of very fertile soil. South of this valley there is another chain of mountains, the Appenines, which cross down the middle of the peninsula from north to south. With the exception of the Po valley, Italy is primarily a mountainous country. It is about 750 miles long. The width varies from 395 miles in the Po valley to 25 miles in Calabria.</p>
<p class="tx">In the Padana valley we find the principal river of Italy: the Po, which flows from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea. Other important rivers are the Adige, also in the Padana valley, the Arno, which passes through Florence and Pisa; and the Tiber, which flows through Rome. At the foot of the Alps there are the famous beautiful lakes of Como, Maggiore, and Garda.</p>
<p class="tx">Italy has two large islands, Sicily and Sardinia, and many small islands, among which are Capri, Ischia, and Elba, all very beautiful and important as centers of tourism. Italy also has three volcanoes: Vesuvius in the gulf of Naples, Etna in Sicily, and Stromboli on the island of the same name.</p>
<p class="tx">Italy is situated in a temperate zone, and the Alps protect it from the northern winds, while the surrounding seas make the winters mild. But the climate varies a great deal between the north and south, and even from region to region. In general, winters are cold in the Po valley and in northern and central Italy: but along the Riviera to the east and west of Genoa, winters are mild. Winters are very mild along the Neapolitan and Calabrian coasts and in Sicily. Summers are hot and dry, but very pleasing along the coasts and in the Alps and Appenines.</p>
<p class="tx">Italy’s north, central, and south are administratively divided into twenty regions, and the regions divided into provinces. Northern Italy comprises the regions of Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto. These are agricultural and industrial regions and are very prosperous. Milan and Turin, the two great industrial centers, are in this zone. The regions of Central Italy are: Tuscany, Umbria, The Marches, Lazio, Abruzzi, and Molise. These are essentially agricultural. The South and its regions are also agricultural. Campania is very fertile, and Puglia is also very agriculturally developed. But in the regions of Basilicata and Calabria the level of agriculture is very low because the soil is depleted. Sicily and Sardinia also belong to the South and are also agricultural, because the soil is rich in volcanic minerals.</p>
<p class="tx">It is also important to keep in mind that there are two independent countries within Italy’s borders: The republic of San Marino and the Vatican City state.</p>
<p class="tx">Because of its geography and history, Italy offers the best of many different ethnic groups, diverse languages, and many different styles of cooking. This last is the result of foreign invasions and settlements. There is no such thing as an Italian cuisine per se, rather there are many regional cuisines, making Italian cooking an endless source of variety. When Italy was finally unified into a modern nation in 1870, the great Italian statesman Giuseppe Mazzini proclaimed: <span class="epub-i">“Abbiamo fatto L’ Italia, adesso dobbiamo fare Italiani”</span> (We have created Italy, now we must create Italians). It hasn’t happened yet, but in the meanwhile, Italy has given and continues to give the world one of its most appreciated gifts: Food for humans that is fit for the gods. Because of its great art, architecture, music, philosophical thought, science, foundations of law, systematic theology, and its glorious cuisines, little Italy is a giant among the family of nations.</p>
<p class="tx">Now let’s get down to some serious cooking, okay?</p>
