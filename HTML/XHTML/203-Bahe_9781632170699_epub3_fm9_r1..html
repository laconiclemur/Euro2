<p class="left" id="p2"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED,</span> flour is always all-purpose flour. And I always fork sift my flour before measuring it. Just stir the flour with a fork, using a fluffing/stirring motion, until the flour feels light and the fork moves through it smoothly and without meeting resistance. To measure the flour, dip your measuring cup in so that it is much fuller than it needs to be, then use the flat side of a butter knife to scrape the extra flour off the top. Don’t shake the extra flour off, because then you’ll undo all of that fluffy fork sifting you worked so hard on!</p>

<p class="left" id="p4"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED,</span> butter is salted butter. I know lots of cookbooks call for unsalted butter, and if you want to use it, you can. I just happen to have regular salted butter on hand all the time—it’s one of our staples—and find that most people I’ve talked to do as well. So that’s what I used when creating these recipes. If you are worried about the freshness of your butter (which is one of the main reasons cookbooks often call for unsalted butter), go buy a new box of salted butter and check the expiration date on the package to make sure it is fresh.</p>

<p class="left" id="p6"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB</span> for substituting dried herbs for fresh herbs in cooking is to use one-third the amount. So if a recipe calls for one tablespoon of a chopped fresh herb, you can use one teaspoon of the same herb dried.</p>

<p class="left" id="p7"><span class="M_sans smallcaps">YEAST BREADS CAN SEEM INTIMIDATING,</span> but I’ve figured out a way to have success with them every time: I proof my yeast in a hot water bath. After combining the yeast and a pinch of sugar with the warm water (or milk or buttermilk) as directed by the recipe, run your tap water as hot as it will go, and fill a medium bowl with about two inches of hot water. Set the measuring cup with the yeast mixture in it in the bowl of hot water (making sure the hot water is nowhere near the edge of the glass measuring cup) and watch the magic happen. You’ll know everything is working if there are bubbles and the mixture has increased significantly in volume after five minutes. If it still seems sluggish, dump the hot water out of the medium bowl, refill it with fresh hot water, and try again. This method has never failed me, and it can be used with all of the yeast bread recipes in this book.</p>
