<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">While there is no food more seductive or delicious on its own than a freshly shucked raw oyster, grilling them and anointing them with a simple combination of butter, shallots, and white wine is not to be missed. If you do not have an outdoor grill, shuck the oysters, fill them with the shallot mixture, and then broil them until the juices bubble and the oysters are just cooked through.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 shallots, peeled and finely minced</p>
<p class="ingredient">½ cup white wine</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 dozen oysters</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Melt the butter</strong> in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the white wine, increase the heat to high, and allow the mixture to boil and reduce until just barely beginning to thicken, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside. Season the mixture to taste with salt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, place the oysters on a hot grill, flat side up, and cook until the oysters open themselves up, 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, carefully, but quickly, transfer the oysters to a tray or a platter. Once the oysters have cooled down enough to handle them, remove and discard the top shells. Be sure not to lose any of the precious juice in the bottom shell (not to mention the oysters!).</p>
<p>Top each oyster with a spoonful of the shallot mixture and return the oysters to the grill, shell side down. Cook until the oysters are hot and their juices and the shallot mixture are bubbling. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">The combination of nutty browned butter, tart lemon, and salty capers highlights the natural sweetness of scallops. Serve in scallop shells, if you can find them.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredient">A dozen large sea scallops, tough connective muscle detached</p>
<p class="ingredient">Coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 tablespoons capers, dried on a paper towel</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>Using a vegetable</strong> peeler, remove the zest from the lemon in large strips and cut the lemon in half. Set all aside.</p>
<p>Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel and season them on both sides with salt.</p>
<p>Melt the butter in a large skillet over high heat. Once the butter begins to turn a little bit brown, carefully place the scallops in the pan along with the capers and reserved lemon zest. Cook until the scallops are thoroughly browned on both sides, turning only once, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</p>
<p>Remove the pan from the heat and squeeze over the juice from one half of the reserved lemon. Serve the scallops immediately, being sure to spoon over all of the capers and brown butter.</p></div>
