<p class="nonindent">Escalivada appears on tables all over Catalonia. Roasted onion, eggplant, and peppers come in all forms—as giant halves, big chunks, and fine dices—but I prefer them in thin strips. The slender shape allows them to readily soak up the vinaigrette made with their cooking juices. The dressed vegetables are a versatile side dish and taste, especially good with grilled meat. I like to top them with crumbled blue cheese, anchovies, or both. If you do that, you’re almost at lunch. Throw some <a href="sec01.xhtml#page22">Pan con Tomate</a> at it and you’ve got a full meal. Arrange the mix on toast points and you’re now armed with an elegant hors d’oeuvre.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 medium yellow onion</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons blended or canola oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 medium eggplant</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 red bell peppers</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ teaspoons sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 450°F. LINE A HALF-SHEET</span> pan with foil.</p>
<p class="indent">Cut the onion in half through the root end and rub 1 tablespoon blended oil all over the onion. Place on the prepared pan, cut sides down. Rub the eggplant and peppers with the remaining 2 tablespoons blended oil and place on the pan alongside the onion.</p>
<p class="indent">Roast for 30 minutes and turn over the vegetables. Roast for 30 minutes more and turn the eggplant and peppers, then wrap the onion halves in foil to finish cooking them without letting the cut sides get too black. Roast until the peppers and eggplant are very black and blistery looking, 15 to 30 minutes more.</p>
<p class="indent">Carefully transfer the vegetables with their juices to a large bowl and immediately cover with plastic wrap. When the vegetables are cool enough to handle, remove the skins, stems, and seeds from the peppers. Transfer the peppers to a large cutting board. Remove the skin and stem from the eggplant and transfer the flesh to the board. Remove the skin and two to three tough outer layers from the onion and transfer the onion to the board.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Spoon 2 tablespoons of the accumulated juices from the vegetable bowl into a smaller bowl, leaving behind any solids or black bits. Whisk the vinegar and ¼ teaspoon salt into the juices, then whisk in the olive oil.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cut the peppers, eggplant, and onion into ⅛-inch slices. Arrange them on a serving platter in sections, as if you’re putting together a striped flag of eggplant, pepper, and onion. Sprinkle the cut vegetables with 1 teaspoon salt.</p>
<p class="indent">Whisk the vinaigrette again and pour over the vegetables. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, at least an hour and up to a day.</p>
