			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page90a">Omelets</h2>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Were one to launch a “Demystification of French Cuisine” campaign, the rolled omelet should certainly mark the point of departure. There are no secrets, no special talent is required, and no method is any better than any other. Its execution demands less than a minute’s time from the breaking of the eggs to the presentation at table. (I was asked recently to demonstrate an omelet to a group of American high-school girls, come to France to study the language. After the demonstration, I gave them several trays of eggs and told them to go to work. Their teacher later told me that the omelet session had been the high point of their summer, simply because each girl, in a relaxed atmosphere and with no previous experience, had produced an absolutely correct omelet.) And, in any case, it is only as good as the butter and the eggs with which it is made; it shares neither creamy suavity with scrambled eggs nor homely wit with many a flat omelet.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page91">Standard professional-weight iron omelet pans need not be reserved for omelets alone, but they must be well cared for, the surface kept silk-smooth and oiled; if nothing has stuck, they need only be wiped with a clean dry rag or paper toweling (not the rumpled piece of old newspaper preferred by professional chefs); if something sticks but slightly, rub the inside with salt and wipe with oil, being certain to leave no trace of salt (which encourages rust), but if anything has stuck badly or if the pan has been used for deglazing, it should be scrubbed thoroughly with scouring powder and a fine abrasive pad or fine steel wool—nothing coarse enough to scratch—rinsed well, wiped dry, heated over a flame, and rubbed with oil. By all means, use them for small deep frys—it is good for them.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Filled and sauced omelets do not appeal to me as being very interesting. Finely chopped fresh marjoram will fuse with eggs to produce an omelet of singular fragrance. A handful of tender young sorrel leaves, raw and finely shredded, will, on the other hand, permeate the eggs with none of sorrel’s qualities, but, because of its disposition to “melt” instantly in contact with heat, the effect of fragile, disembodied sourness laced in suspension through the body of the omelet is not less exciting.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page91a" style="page-break-before:always;">Rolled Fines-Herbes Omelet</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Omelette aux Fines Herbes</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">3 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, chervil, and chives in equal quantities plus 3 or 4 leaves of finely chopped tarragon</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons cold butter</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal" id="page92">	Break the eggs into a soup plate, add herbs, seasonings, and 1 tablespoon of the butter, cut into small pieces. While the pan, containing the other piece of butter, is heating over a high flame, beat the eggs lightly with a fork—just enough to combine yolks and whites. Turn the pan, tilted, in all directions in order to evenly coat the sides and bottom with butter, and the moment the butter has stopped foaming and the slightly nutty odor of brown butter is perceptible, pour in the eggs, stir rapidly (without scraping the tines of the fork against the bottom of the pan)—a couple of turns only—to disperse the heat through the mass, and gently lift the edge of the omelet with the tines of the fork at two or three points successively, tilting the pan at the same time to permit as much liquid egg as possible to run beneath. Start rolling it immediately, easing the edge nearest you over with the side of the fork (it will not actually “roll”; a turn and a half is all that is necessary). Tip the pan sharply, cradling the omelet at the far side, press the outer edge of the omelet against the rolled mass with the tines, hold the still tilted pan for another three or four seconds over the direct flame to lightly color the underside, and turn it out onto a warm (but not hot) plate, either by inverting the pan or, holding it in its tilted position, by encouraging the omelet with the back of the fork to roll over, colored underside up. You may, if you like, lend it gloss by dragging a piece of butter across the surface.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page92a" style="page-break-before:always;">Flat Omelets</h1>
			
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Flat omelets are begun in the same way as rolled omelets, the mixture being poured into a hot pan and, if its consistency permits, being stirred briefly and its edges lifted with the pan tilted. In many flat omelets, a proportionately small amount of egg serves as a binder rather than as the principal element—such is the case with the zucchini and spinach mixtures in the following recipe; these not only may not be stirred, but they are also too stiff to spread evenly in the pan without the aid of a fork and, though begun over a high flame, they must be cooked longer over a lower flame before being tossed. They are best only just done—tossed as soon as they are firm enough not to fall apart in the tossing—and, once turned, they should remain over the heat but a few seconds longer. Too fragile at the half-cooked stage to be turned with a spatula, these omelets must be tossed—unless, in frustration, you prefer to finish each in the oven (starting it over a high flame to ensure its not sticking, then putting the pan into a hot oven for a half-minute or so—until the surface is only just firm).</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page93">Tossing is a simple enough affair, but one must be relaxed; the apprehensive novice often fails to produce more than a stubborn shudder from the omelet—or it may take flight. Before tossing, always shake the pan to be certain that the omelet slides freely. If it sticks at some point, gently free it with a flexible spatula, slipping a small piece of butter beneath it at the same time, and shake again. The pan is propelled forward in a scooping motion, abruptly curving upward, then back. The omelet slips out from the far side and is picked up in its elliptic course, the contact having hardly been broken. One’s entire body directs the pan’s action and the only perceptible movement comes, rhythmic and liquid, from the shoulder.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Any of the omelets from the following recipe served alone, either tepid or cold, provides an agreeable, light first course. The spinach version, sometimes enriched with a handful of grated cheese and some chopped onions stewed in butter or olive oil (chard may replace part or all of the spinach, fresh basil may be added, etc.), is a typical Provençal hors d’oeuvre and is often made in large quantities (about three pounds of spinach to a dozen eggs), first siezed over a high flame in a large, preheated pan containing olive oil, baked in the oven, and unmolded.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The delicate flavor and moist, melting texture of the zucchini omelet (count 2 eggs to something over 1 pound of zucchini) I find particularly attractive. Served alone, it, like the simplified <em class="ital">pipérade,</em> is best tepid, prepared 20 to 30 minutes before serving it.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page94" style="page-break-before:always;">Cold Omelet Loaf</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Gâteau de Crespèus</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">A <em class="ital">crespèu</em> (or <em class="ital">crespéou,</em> the Provençal tongue lending itself to a certain orthographic freedom) is, traditionally, a flat omelet containing pieces of fried salt pork, sautéed potatoes, or both—identical to an <em class="ital">omelette à la Savoyarde.</em> By extension, other flat omelets are often called <em class="ital">crespèus.</em> The Provençal <em class="ital">crespèu</em> and the Italian <em class="ital">frittata</em> are twins.</p>
			<p class="Normal">This <em class="ital">gateau</em> of multi-tiered omelets was chosen from the repertory of a regional restaurant for demonstration purposes in the Avignon summer classes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The original contains, in addition to those omelets in this recipe, artichoke, Gruyère, caper, and sorrel omelets, and the tomatoes, sweet peppers, and onions are conceived as separate omelets rather than being grouped together in a hamless <em class="ital">pipérade.</em> Parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil are added to all of them and each is spread with a reduction of anchovy, canned tuna, shallots, and white wine, mashed into a paste. The original <em class="ital">gateau</em> contains only one omelet of each flavor and the whole thing is bound with a <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> omelet mixture.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Such an orgy of different and sometimes contentious savors had, tastewise, pretty much the same effect as mixing together all the colors on a palette—a muddy grayness. And to the eye the cross-sectional pattern was only confusing: The presence of tarragon in all the omelets lent a sameness to everything; the fish paste dulled the clarity of the other flavors; the capers and the cheese lent disruptive support to the fish; the tomatoes, onions, and peppers, which fuse so beautifully into a single Mediterranean note, were senseless apart; the artichoke omelet, lovely in itself, was completely lost in the jungle and, although the whole business badly needed the sharp, clean relief of sorrel, the single little sorrel <em class="ital">crêpe</em> in the midst of all that was only frustrating. There were far too many things and not enough of any single thing.</p>
			<p class="Normal">I resolved to limit the flavors, repeating each; to eliminate the oppressive fishy presence, and to replace the repetitious <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> egg binder with a sorrel cream. As it stands now, I think the dish cannot fail to please, and the cross-sectional ribbons of repeated red, greens, beige, and black afford a very pretty presentation.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Use a small 7-inch omelet pan for the confection of these omelets. You will need an approximately 2½-quart receptacle of about the same diameter; a large charlotte mold or a round <em class="ital">cocotte</em>—a round, enameled ironware casserole—should be perfect. You will also need kitchen parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page95">Be organized: Prepare the five basic apparels plus the sorrel purée and line them up in bowls near the stove. Before preparing the omelets, line up five plates or a couple of large platters so as to be able to stack omelets of different flavors separately. Keep the salt and the bottle of olive oil within arm’s reach, a small ladle in the mixing bowl of beaten eggs, a fork in a soup plate for mixing the individual omelets, and a small flexible spatula at hand just in case an omelet should stick (should this happen—and even though the omelet has been successfully turned out and the pan appears to be clean—rub the pan with salt before continuing to the next omelet). Count about 1 tablespoon of olive oil for the confection of each omelet and reheat the pan for a few seconds each time before beginning another. The omelets should be from ¼ to ½ inch thick, depending on the material (the zucchini and spinach omelets will be thicker than the olive and mushroom omelets; the tomato mixture is more flexible). Individual mixtures should be salted separately (the zucchini will need no salt; the quality of the olives will determine their seasoning . . .).</p>
			<p class="Normal">The recipe will serve 12 to 15 people. It is impractical to prepare it on a smaller scale, but it may be kept for more than one meal, protected in plastic wrap.</p>
			<p class="H2">The Preparations</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(1)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">
				<li class="IL">1 pound small, firm zucchini</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">1 teaspoon fresh marjoram flowers, finely chopped (or a pinch of dried marjoram or a bit of crumbled fresh oregano)</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal">Rinse the zucchinis, wipe them dry, trim the ends but don’t peel them. Grate them coarsely or pass them, cut into sections, through the medium blade of a Mouli-juliènne, arrange in layers in a mixing bowl, each layer sprinkled with salt, leave to stand for about ½ hour, press the mass together, squeezing to release the water, pour the contents of the bowl into a sieve and, taking the mass in both hands, squeeze tightly and repeatedly to rid it of all the liquid possible. Sauté in olive oil over a relatively high flame, tossing regularly, for 6 or 7 minutes. Add the marjoram after removing from heat.</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr" id="page96"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(2)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">
				<li class="IL">1 medium sweet onion, halved and finely sliced</li>
				<li class="IL">3 to 4 ounces sweet peppers (the elongated light green Italian variety, if possible), halved lengthwise and sliced finely crosswise</li>
				<li class="IL">3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">2 medium tomatoes, ripe and firm, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped (out of season, use canned tomatoes, juice strained off)</li>
				<li class="IL">1 large clove garlic, crushed, peeled, and sliced thinly</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper, large pinch sugar, small pinch cayenne</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal">Stew the onions and the peppers gently in olive oil until soft, stirring regularly—10 to 15 minutes. Add tomatoes, garlic, and seasonings, toss for about a minute over a high flame, then cook gently at a simmer, tossing occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Toss another couple of minutes over a high flame until all liquid is evaporated.</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(3)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">			
				<li class="IL">1 pound spinach, stems removed, washed in several waters</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal">Parboil the spinach in a large quantity of generously salted, rapidly boiling water—2 or 3 minutes only. Drain, rinse in cold water, squeeze tightly and repeatedly with both hands, and chop.</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(4)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">			
				<li class="IL">4 ounces firm, fresh mushrooms</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon butter</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal" id="page97">Rinse the mushrooms rapidly or, if clean in appearance, simply wipe each with a damp cloth. Slice them as finely as possible and sauté in butter, seasoned, over a high flame, tossing repeatedly, until their liquid is completely reabsorbed (3 or 4 minutes—or more, depending on the size of the pan).</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(5)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">			
				<li class="IL">6 or 7 ounces natural black olives (no vinegar)</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal">Pit the olives or remove the flesh with a small knife and chop them coarsely.</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(6)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">			
				<li class="IL">10 ounces sorrel</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon butter</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal">Pick over the sorrel, pulling the stems off backwards to remove stringy veins from the leaves, and wash in several waters. If young and tender, cut into a fine <em class="ital">chiffonade</em> and put directly to stew, salted, in the butter over low heat, stirring from time to time, for about 20 to 30 minutes, until all liquid is evaporated and the sorrel is reduced to a purée. If the leaves aren’t tender, parboil first, plunging them into boiling water and leaving only long enough for the water to return to a boil. Drain in a sieve and stew in butter as before.</p>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<h2 class="Heading-B">(7)</h2>
			
				<ul class="IL-LIST-head">			
				<li class="IL">About 20 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">Pepper, salt</li>
				<li class="IL">About ⅔ cup olive oil (for making omelets)</li>
				<li class="IL">⅔ cup heavy cream</li>
				<li class="IL">About 1 tablespoon butter (for buttering mold and parchment)</li>
				</ul>
			
			<hr class="IL-hr"/>
			
			<p class="Normal" id="page98">Beat the eggs and pepper (no salt—or very little) with a whisk, only enough to mix them well. Make two omelets from each of the preparations, <em class="ital">excluding the sorrel,</em> putting half of the preparation into the soup plate and stirring in enough egg to bind well; the zucchini will take little—the equivalent of something less than 1 egg for each omelet; the tomato mixture will require about double that of the zucchini, etc. Salt each to taste, bearing in mind the amount of seasoning in the original preparation—it is possible that only the spinach will require additional salt.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Cut 2 rounds of kitchen parchment paper to the dimensions of the top and the bottom of the casserole or chosen mold, butter the mold liberally, butter both sides of 1 round of paper for the bottom and press it carefully into the bottom of the mold, leaving no air spaces or unstuck edges where the egg might run beneath.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Whisk together the sorrel purée, the ⅔ cup cream, and the remainder of beaten eggs, adding more eggs if necessary—there should be the equivalent of about 5 eggs in the mixture. Salt and pepper to taste.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Pour a small ladle of sorrel cream into the bottom of the mold and stack the omelets in alternating colors and flavors, pressing each gently into place and pouring a small bit of sorrel cream over each before placing another. Pour in enough sorrel cream to barely submerge the omelets, tap the bottom of the mold smartly against a muffled tabletop (a couple of folded towels to soften the blow) to settle the contents and chase out any trapped air bubbles, and add more of the sorrel cream if necessary for the top omelet to be only just covered (if any is left over, it can be poached in a small mold apart). Butter the other round of paper and place it, buttered side down, on the surface.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page99">Cook in a <em class="ital">bain-marie,</em> the mold immersed to about two thirds its height in boiling water, in a medium (375°) oven for 45 minutes, making certain that the center of the loaf is firm and elastic to slight pressure before removing from the oven. Leave to cool for about 1 hour—until only just tepid. Lift the paper off the surface, run a knife all around the sides, and unmold onto the serving dish (placing the dish upside down over the mold and turning it and the mold over together). If not to be served immediately, press plastic wrap over the entire surface to protect it from contact with air and refrigerate. Just before serving, decorate it simply (a ribbon of chopped parsley or <em class="ital">fines herbes</em> strung around the edge and a rosette of finely sliced tomato in the center, for instance. Pitted black olives sliced into rings or chopped hard-boiled egg yolks are also good decorative elements). To serve, cut into approximately ½-inch slices, using a spatula to transfer them to individual plates.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A salad of cucumbers in a dill-flavored lemon and cream sauce is an exquisite accompaniment.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page99a" style="page-break-before:always;">Savory Turnip Omelet</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Omelette de Navets à la Sarriette</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">This is an astonishingly good thing with a surprising flavor. Chopped black olives may be added to the mixture.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 pound turnips (young and tender—any with spongy or fibrous inclinations should be relegated to the soup pot)</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup butter</li>
				<li class="IL">3 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup chopped parsley</li>
				<li class="IL">Pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">1 teaspoon fresh savory leaves, finely chopped (if not of a spring tenderness, chopped to a near powder)</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Peel the turnips, grate coarsely or pass them through the medium blade of a Mouli-juliènne, and leave in salted layers to disgorge their water as for the zucchini in the preceding recipe. After ½ hour, squeeze the mass of juliènne tightly and repeatedly and put to stew gently in the butter sprinkled with the savory, tossing often, for about 15 minutes or until tender. Taste for salt and season the mixture accordingly.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Stir together the eggs, the parsley, and a generous grinding of black pepper. Add the turnips, a little at a time if they are still hot, beating them in with a fork.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page100">Prepare this like the other flat omelets, stirring the mixture the moment it is poured into the hot oil, smoothing it out, and cook for about 5 minutes over a moderately low flame before tossing (or start it out on the high flame and finish in the oven, unmolding it for the service). Serve tepid.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page100a" style="page-break-before:always;">Hot Onion Omelet with Vinegar</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Omelette à la Lyonnaise</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Lyons, to everyone in France, is known as the gastronomic capital of the world. What that means depends on who mouths the words. For the guidebooks and the foreigners it usually means elegant pike <em class="ital">quenelles</em> in crayfish sauce, truffled chickens, artichokes stuffed with foie gras, salmon in Champagne, bass in pastry—the fare of the starred and sometimes very good restaurants, for instance, that of the famous <em class="ital">mères Lyonnaises</em> and their successors and that of Point and his successors. To others—<em class="ital">les vicieux</em>—it means the <em class="ital">mâchon,</em> a morning meal of hearty and attractively vulgar preparations washed down with a cool abundance of Beaujolais, vibrant in its tender youth. Typical of this food are boiled pigs’ tails and rinds, quaint salads of lambs’ trotters and testicles, agrestic terrines, sausages poached in white wine with boiled potatoes, tripes in every conceivable form—and the following omelet. Sautéed onions and a pan washed up with vinegar melt into a single recurrent theme in Lyonnaise cooking.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">3 large sweet onions (about 12 ounces), halved and finely sliced</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup butter</li>
				<li class="IL">3 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">1 tablespoon wine vinegar</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Choose a relatively small, heavy pan in which to cook the onions so as to have a thick layer of onions—scattered loosely over a large surface, even with the tiniest of flames, they color too rapidly, their moisture being immediately evaporated. Cook them for at least ½ hour in 2 tablespoons of butter over a very low flame, tossing or stirring from time to time. They should be yellowed and very soft, but not browned.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page101">Beat the eggs lightly with the seasonings, stir in the onions and prepare the omelet (hot pan, pour in the mixture when the butter stops foaming, stir a couple of times, lift the edges to let liquid run beneath, toss and, a couple of seconds later, slip it onto a warm plate—just done), add a tablespoon of butter to the pan, return to the heat, and, when the butter has stopped foaming and starts to turn brown, pour it over the omelet. Add the vinegar to the pan, swirl it around, and dribble it over the omelet.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page101a" style="page-break-before:always;">Bread Omelet</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Omelette au Pain</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">2 ounces stale but not dried-out bread, without crusts	</li>
				<li class="IL">½ cup heavy cream</li>
				<li class="IL">⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">2 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons butter</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="Normal">Mash the bread with ¼ cup of cream until the mixture forms a consistent paste, add Parmesan, salt and pepper, the remaining cream, and work the mixture together until the consistency is smooth and creamy. Stir in the eggs, beating lightly, and prepare like other flat omelets. The bread and cream make a lighter and more tender mixture than that of the usual omelet and it is more difficult to toss it without splashing—it may be finished in the oven.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page102" style="page-break-before:always;">Baked Eggs with Artichokes</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Oeufs aux Artichauts</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">This is a common dish in the southwest of France and, in Italy, the identical preparation is known as a Florentine specialty. It is, essentially, an omelet that, because it is started out in a cold dish, sticks. Its uniqueness depends on a juxtaposition of flavors and textures—the crispness and nutty taste of the golden fried artichokes baked into the mass of creamy, barely set eggs—that can be obtained in no other way.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The size of the dish is important to the success of this preparation: it should only just contain the fried artichoke quarters, scattered closely over the bottom, the beaten eggs achieving a depth that easily covers them.</p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">8 or 10 small, tender artichokes	</li>
				<li class="IL">About 1 cup olive oil</li>
				<li class="IL">8 eggs</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt, pepper</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons butter</li>

			<p class="Normal">Pull off the tough outer leaves of the artichokes, cut off the top third of the remaining leaves, and pare any remaining tough edges. Split into quarters (or eighths, depending on the size of the artichokes), remove chokes, if necessary, and add to a bowl containing about ½ cup olive oil, turning to coat them completely in the oil, thus protecting them from blackening on contact with the air. Heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and fry the artichoke sections, turning them regularly in the oil with the tines of a fork, until tender and golden, the leaf tips crisp and richly browned. Drain on absorbent paper, sprinkle on all sides with salt and freshly ground pepper, and arrange them in the bottom of a liberally buttered gratin dish (any low-sided, non-metallic oven dish). Beat the eggs lightly with about 1 tablespoon of cold hard butter, cut into tiny pieces, add salt and pepper, pour over the artichokes, and bake in a moderately hot oven (400°) for about 8 to 10 minutes, keeping a close eye on the eggs—they should be removed from the oven before the center of the dish is set. The exact cooking time depends on the size of the dish and the depth of the eggs. Overcooked, all of the delicacy is lost.</p>

			<p class="Normal-noind">Correctly prepared, the softest of barely perceptible curds held in a thickly liquid, smooth, creamy suspension, scrambled eggs number among the very great delicacies of the table. They, like omelets, should be beaten but lightly with an addition of butter and, whether they be prepared over low, direct heat or in a <em class="ital">bain-marie</em> (their cooking utensil immersed in another containing nearly boiling water), they should be contained in a generously buttered heavy pan, preferably copper, which absorbs heat slowly and retains it for a long time. It is not only easier to precisely control the heat in a <em class="ital">bain-marie,</em> but also the cooking time is shortened, thanks to the heat’s being absorbed through the sides of the utensil as well as from the bottom. The eggs should be stirred constantly with a wooden spoon during their preparation, the sides and the bottom of the pan being repeatedly scraped, and they should be removed from the heat some moments before the desired consistency is achieved and stirred continuously for another minute or so, for they continue to cook from an absorption of heat contained in the pan. It is wise to remove them two or three times from the heat toward the end of the cooking to control more exactly the degree of creaminess and, once removed definitively from contact with heat, a small amount of heavy cream may be stirred in, arresting at once the cooking and underlining at the same time their caressing consistency. They may be served in butter-crisp containers carved out of crustless bread. Otherwise, if one is among friends, it is preferable to serve them directly from the cooking vessel onto warm, but not hot, plates and a wonderful additional garnish is the crisp, brown-butter note of croutons, either scattered over the surface or stirred into the eggs at the moment of serving.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page104">The complication of such rich garnishes as foie gras, game, crayfish, or lobster with their corresponding Périgueux, Salmis, Nantua, or Américaine sauces seems only to detract from the purity of the thing. But for truffles (the black ones incorporated, slivered, sliced, or chopped before the cooking; the fresh white ones sliced paper thin over the surface the moment the eggs are done) and morels (fresh or dried, stewed in butter before being incorporated into the eggs), scrambled eggs ally themselves the most beautifully with a single vegetable—be it tender asparagus tips, parboiled and sweated in butter (or, Oriental-wise, slivered, raw, on the bias, parboiled for but a few seconds, and tossed for no more than a minute in hot butter), artichoke hearts stewed in butter, finely sliced zucchini sautéed in butter or in olive oil, shredded sorrel stewed in butter, tender peas, rapidly parboiled . . . The same herbs that find a place in omelets are good, alone or in combination with vegetables, in scrambled eggs.</p>

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page106">Poached Eggs</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">There is a puzzling cluster of rules surrounding the poaching of an egg: The water should be kept simmering; vinegar should be added to the water to hasten the coagulation of the white; salt should be added to reinforce the vinegar’s work; salt should not be added because it toughens the whites or because it counteracts the vinegar’s firming action; the eggs should always be broken first into a cup or saucer to ascertain their freshness; they should be poached one at a time in a simulated whirlpool to prevent the white from spreading all over the place and one should deftly snatch the escaping edges of white from the far reaches of the whirlpool, folding them back over the yolk with a spoon; the eggs should be fresh . . .</p>
			<p class="Normal">The freshness is of primordial importance: The yolk stands high; the white clings to it in a mass. You can tell simply by taking an egg in your hand if the white is turning liquid—and, if you are uncertain, shake it gently close to your ear; you will not only feel, you will also hear the yolk rattling around. The other rules, I think, one may take or leave—I prefer to leave them. Water kept at a simmer toughens the underside of the egg and encourages its sticking to the bottom of the pan; vinegar flavors the egg; I sometimes add salt and sometimes not and cannot see that it affects in any way the success of the venture; breaking an egg first into a saucer only encourages the spreading of an unfresh white, dirties a dish, and is a waste of time, encouraging greater separation in the time that the eggs will be cooked; the whirlpool method may be useful in rescuing tired old eggs from total collapse, but tired old eggs should really be relegated to pastry-making (pastry chefs claim to prefer them—the whites mount higher and firmer) or to the garbage pail.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page107">Use the largest low-sided receptacle that you have; a skillet is fine—a still larger <em class="ital">plat à sauter</em> is better. The larger the quantity of water, the less heat loss is involved with the addition of each egg; don’t try to poach more than 4 eggs at a time—the loss of heat will be too great. The low sides are necessary to facilitate the removal of the eggs with a skimmer and a lid is necessary to prevent loss of heat.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Bring the water to a rolling boil, turn the fire off, and break in the eggs, one after another, cracking each on a convenient edge and opening the shell only at the water’s surface, permitting the contents to slip softly in. Cover and count about 3 minutes—but don’t depend on your timer; check and remove with a large, flat slotted skimming spoon as soon as the white is obviously sufficiently coagulated to be easily handled. Large or very fresh eggs may have to be left for as long as four minutes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">To be served cold, transfer to a shallow pan of cold water and later to a damp towel for paring and draining. To be served hot, remove directly to a damp towel for paring or, if not to be used immediately, transfer to a pan of warm water until ready for use.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Mollet eggs (cooked like hard-boiled eggs but only for 6 minutes) may replace poached eggs in any recipe and, if the eggs are not absolutely fresh, may be preferable. From infinite possibilities (the first edition of <em class="ital">Larousse Gastronomique</em> lists 115 formulas for poached eggs and they may easily be multiplied by the imagination), the American fancy appears, incomprehensibly, to have settled “once and for all” on eggs “Benedict.” Artichoke bottoms, in form and taste, provide a perfect vehicle for the presentation of poached or mollet eggs and one of the happiest methods of finishing the production—and among the simplest—is with a generous coat of Mornay sauce sprinkled with, cheese and a bit of butter and then rapidly gratinéed. A bed of vegetable juliènne or purée spread in the artichoke bottom before placing the egg there is a lovely addition. Make one from mushrooms, <em class="ital">soubise,</em> carrots, zucchinis, turnips, peas, green beans, broad beans, white beans, lentils, chick-peas, sorrel, spinach, black truffle or morel (or, for economy’s sake, add pounded truffle peel or chopped butter-stewed morels to a <em class="ital">duxelles</em> or a mushroom purée or juliènne). To avoid overcooking the eggs, all of the elements in this kind of preparation should be hot and the gratin conducted rapidly beneath a broiler flame.</p>
			
			
			<h1 class="RT" id="page108" style="page-break-before:always;">Eggs in Aspic with Sorrel Mousse</h1>
			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Oeufs en Gelée à la Mousse d’Oseille</p>
			
			<p class="Normal-noind-first">Whatever the garnish, the quality of eggs in aspic depends absolutely on the quality of the jelly. And, however sapid the jelly, all of its delicacy depends on the precise degree of natural gelatin contained in it: The jelly must be only just firm enough to hold its form easily, once unmolded—and it should tremble. No matter how rich and pure the flavor, an excess of gelatin will produce a rubbery and distinctly unpleasant material. A trembling jelly melts luxuriously on the tongue; a rubbery jelly smears it with gum.</p>
			<p class="Normal" id="page109">A jelly may be prepared exactly like a stock with the addition of a calf’s foot (first covered with cold water, brought to a boil for 5 minutes, drained and rinsed before being added to the other ingredients), but the most succulent of jellies is essentially a by-product of several different preparations. A plentiful veal stock (the meat from which may be removed when done and put into a tomato sauce, sorrel sauce, <em class="ital">blanquette,</em> etc., or simply accompanied by boiled vegetables, like a <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em>) can be subsequently used to moisten a <em class="ital">pot-au-feu</em> (including gelatinous cuts—shank, oxtail, shoulder) and, still again, to <a href="m_279-301.xhtml#page297">moisten a <em class="ital">poule-au-pot</em></a> (or chicken parts may be thrown into the pot from time to time during the other preparations. For each subsequent preparation, the stock, completely cleared of all fat when cold, should be warmed only enough to melt before adding the meat; vegetables should be added to each new preparation, but the head of garlic and the cloves should be eliminated. You will judge from tasting whether a new bouquet garni should be added each time and what and how much it should contain. Water may have to be added to provide sufficient moistening. I often keep a stock of this sort for weeks on end, using it, supplementing it, and, when flavor and gelatinous content coincide in the correct degree of concentration (the jelly quite firm, inasmuch as it will be somewhat lengthened by an addition of wine, the flavor rich but not so concentrated as to resemble a <em class="ital">demi-glace</em>), profiting to prepare some eggs in jelly. Obviously, one need not piously await the ideal moment; reduction can bring it about. A stock that is to be kept, unused, for some time should be reboiled every 2 or 3 days, simmered for about 15 minutes with regular skimming, returned to a non-metallic (unless it be stainless steel) container, cooled, and kept uncovered in the refrigerator. Submitted two or three times to this purifying process, the stock rapidly bypasses the respectable meat-jelly stage, becoming a <em class="ital">demi-glace,</em> invaluable for enriching sauces but too rich and too gelatinous to serve as a jelly. (To prepare a <em class="ital">sauce demi-glace,</em> which is nothing more than an honest <em class="ital">Espagnole,</em> it should be thickened slightly with a flour and butter roux before arriving at the <em class="ital">demi-glace</em> stage, simmered, and skimmed—or “skinned”—for a good hour; a bit of tomato is often added to enrich the color and to hasten the purification. Reduced to a meat glaze [<em class="ital">glace de viande</em>] by progressive transferrals to smaller saucepans and continued reduction to the state of a thick syrup [cooled, it is the consistency of fairly hard rubber; it can be kept, refrigerated, almost indefinitely and is one of the sauce-enrichening standbys of classical cuisine]. It should not be imagined that it undergoes no physical change other than that of concentration: dilution cannot transform it back into what it once was.)</p>

Skim several times, adding a bit of cold water after each skimming, until no more scum mounts to the surface. Add all the other ingredients; the bouquet garni, which should be a good bit larger than one’s fist, tied firmly with several rounds of string spiraled up and down its length. Return to the boiling point, skim once more, and regulate the heat so that, with the lid slightly ajar, the water’s surface is sustained at a light shiver.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Veal shank, after 2 hours of cooking, will have given of its best while remaining still serviceable for a family dinner, whereas the hock will have only begun to render its gelatin. It may be left alone to cook longer or it may be cooled in the stock and recooked with an eventual <em class="ital">pot-au-feu.</em></p>

Embed the container in a larger bowl containing cracked ice and stir until the mixture shows signs of beginning to thicken.

			<h2 class="Subhead" id="page112a">Hard-Boiled Eggs</h2>
			
			
			<p class="Normal-noind">Hard-boiled eggs should be at least 4 or 5 days old; too fresh (a rare circumstance), they are impossible to peel. It is said that they must be room temperature before being put to cook, but, inasmuch as they form a part very often of last-minute-decision preparations, this rule cannot always be respected and I doubt that the dish is the worse for it. Many claim that the only correct way to hard-boil an egg is to lower it into rapidly boiling water and cook it for exactly 9 minutes. I prefer to begin the eggs in cold water, bringing it to a boil over medium heat and leaving it just under a simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the size of the eggs, their number, the quantity of water, etc. (The quantity of water and the number of eggs affect the length of time necessary for the water to come to a boil, and the longer it takes to come to a boil the less time the eggs should remain at the boiling point.) It seems to me that, done this way, there is less danger of the shell’s cracking (particularly should the egg be refrigerated) and that the white remains tenderer. Whatever your method, the important thing is to avoid overcooking, which dries and dulls the flavor of the yolk, coating it at the same time a disgraceful blackish green, and turns the white to rubber. If, through misjudging the time, the very heart of the yolk should remain slightly liquid, that is no problem—it is at least as good that way.</p>

Keep the flame very low and turn them a couple of times over a period of about 20 minutes to ½ hour. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Chop or pass the mushrooms through the medium blade of a Mouli-juliènne and toss them, over a high flame, in 2 tablespoons of butter, seasoned, for 3 or 4 minutes, or until they have reabsorbed all their essence, the liquid completely evaporated. Sprinkle over a few drops of lemon juice, stir, and divide among the 6 artichoke bottoms, spreading a layer into each.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Purée the two “unattractive,” well-cooked bottoms through a fine stainless-steel sieve.</p>
			<p class="Normal">After peeling the eggs, choose the point at which the yolk, barely visible, has settled closest to the wall of the white (only absolutely fresh eggs retain the yolk in the center) and slice off, lengthwise, about one third of the egg, removing the thinnest section of the wall. Chop the white parts removed and add them to the artichoke purée. Sieve the yolks. Season and mash the egg and artichoke purées together, adding the brown butter in which the other artichoke bottoms have cooked. Taste for salt and fill the boat-shaped lower sections of the whites with the purée, molding it firmly, well mounded, with a teaspoon, into the original form of the egg and place each egg in an artichoke bottom, pressing it gently into the bed of mushroom juliènne. Arrange them in a lightly buttered gratin dish.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Stir about two thirds of the cheese into the hot <em class="ital">béchamel,</em> spoon it regularly over the eggs, coating them evenly, sprinkle the surface with the remaining cheese, and bake in a hot oven (400° to 425°) for 20 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling and the surface well colored.</p>

			<p class="XPARA1-RST">Gratin d’Oeufs Durs aux Navets</p>
			<p class="XPARA2">servings: <span class="oldstyle">4</span></p>
				
				<ul class="IL-LIST">				
				<li class="IL">1 pound turnips, tender, firm, crisp, non-fibrous	</li>
				<li class="IL">Salt</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup butter (for the turnips)</li>
				<li class="IL">2 tablespoons flour</li>
				<li class="IL">3 cups milk</li>
				<li class="IL">1 cup stale but not dried-out bread, crusts removed, crumbled</li>
				<li class="IL">¼ cup butter (for the crumbs)</li>

			<p class="Normal">It is not through disdain that <em class="ital">oeufs à la tripe</em> are not presented here—they are very much in the spirit of the text and among the most wonderful of egg dishes. It seemed to me, simply, that the preparations are so nearly identical that it would be senseless to present both the turnip gratin and <em class="ital">à la tripe</em> and, whereas recipes for eggs <em class="ital">à la tripe</em> abound, this will be found no place else.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Peel the turnips thickly, grate coarsely or pass them through the medium blade of a Mouli-juliènne, salt them in layers, leave for ½ hour, squeeze, first in their liquid and then, drained, squeeze thoroughly and repeatedly to rid them of all water. Cook gently in butter, tossing or stirring regularly, until tender—about 15 minutes.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sprinkle over the flour and continue to cook, stirring, for another 3 or 4 minutes, then add the milk slowly, stirring all the time. Bring to a boil and regulate the heat to a simmer, stirring occasionally over a period of ½ hour.</p>
			<p class="Normal">At the same time, cook the breadcrumbs gently in ¼ cup butter, tossing or stirring regularly, until lightly colored.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Taste the turnip sauce for salt, add pepper, and spoon over halved hard-boiled eggs arranged in a lightly buttered gratin dish. Sprinkle over the buttered crumbs and bake in a hot oven until the sauce is bubbling and the surface colored—15 to 20 minutes.</p>
