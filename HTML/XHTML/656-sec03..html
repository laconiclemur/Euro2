<p class="nonindent">The term banderillas refers to the sticks used in bull fights, but also translates to “little flags” in Spanish and, more importantly, skewers served with drinks. They’re basically the little snacks you’d serve at a cocktail party for a group of friends. The idea is that you’re pairing different ingredients into an interesting one-bite combination.</p>
<p class="indent">When spearing the ingredients, start with items that might slide off, such as boquerónes, then end with something that will hold at the bottom of the skewer, such as an olive, cornichon, or chunk of Manchego. I don’t often put more than three items and usually use only two or even just do a stuffed olive. Think about what people can fit in their mouths.</p>
<p class="indent">Though the basis of banderillas is high-quality canned and jarred ingredients, I like to throw in homemade okra pickles. They’re so easy and can be done far in advance, and take the tastes to another level. Even if you skip the okra, you can get wonderful results if you follow my formula below, which also works well with green beans and any other vegetables.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also make it fun for guests by setting up a DIY banderilla station: Throw a bunch of skewers down with a bunch of ingredients and let your guests try to create the best combo. They get to discover flavors and compare their creations with others (and make it so there’s less work for you to do).</p>
<p class="indent">What ties these bites together is something bright and refreshing to sip. The <a href="sec98.xhtml#sec98e">Jerez Sour</a> would be really good, as would any Fino or Manzanilla sherry.</p>

<p class="nonindent">There isn’t a bad combo of stuff. I wouldn’t necessarily do blue cheese and Manchego, but I’d put either of those cheeses with anything else. Fatty cheese calms the acidity of olives and pickles. There’s no wrong way to go with the ingredients above. Even a boquerón and anchovy, two preparations of the same ingredient, can be paired. In fact, it’s called el matrimonio, which means “marriage.” That’s how well they work together.</p>
