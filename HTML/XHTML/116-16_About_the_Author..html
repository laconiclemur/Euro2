<p class="C3788"><strong><span id="page_286">About</span> the Author</strong></p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Zack Bezunartea</strong> started his restaurant career at 10 years old when he spent the summer after fourth grade flipping burgers at the small snack bar his parents ran in New Mexico. A short-order cook in every sense, he had to stand on a milk crate to reach the patties and top them with roasted green chile strips and slices of American cheese. He’s been working in restaurants ever since.</p>
<p class="C3658">His interest in Spanish cuisine began as a teenager when he spent a couple of summers with family in Pamplona and Bilbao. The food captured his imagination, and every day he watched with rapt attention as the afternoon meal was prepared. Notes about those meals filled half his journals from those summers where he described Basque fish stews cooked in clay pots and thin-sliced lamb chops cooked over an open fire in detail. At least two pages were dedicated to his Tia Mercedes’ <em>croquetas</em>.</p>
<p class="C3658">Back stateside he worked in restaurants during school and beyond. He was a host and a barback in Phoenix, a busboy in Portland, a server in Tucson, and a bartender in San Francisco. Eventually his love for hospitality, food, and restaurants led him into management.</p>
<p class="C3658">As General Manager at B44, a Catalan Bistro in San Francisco’s financial district, Zack finally found himself working with the Spanish food he loved so much, and he became an enthusiastic cheerleader for the still little-known cuisine, bouncing from table to table explaining the menu and making recommendations.</p>
<p class="C3658">On a visit to New York shortly after the first Boqueria opened, Zack dropped in. He was immediately drawn in by the energy and design, and the food looked delicious too, but the wait was over an hour. He’d have to come back some other time. It would be a year before he visited again, but then he never left. He moved to New York, met with Yann and joined the opening team for Boqueria SoHo.</p>
<p class="C3658">He loved working service at SoHo. He’d rally the troops at line-up with jokes and games, doing his best to get their energy up for the dinner rush and then dart around the dining room talking to regulars and checking in on new guests.</p>
<p class="C3658">Today, as Director of Operations, Zack oversees the day-to-day of all the Boqueria restaurants, working alongside Managers and Chefs to make sure that every night at every Boqueria still feels the way SoHo did when he first walked in; the best party in town.</p>
<p class="C3643"><strong>Yann's</strong> story is told on pages <a class="RED" href="04_Introduction.xhtml#page_12">12–13</a>, and you can read all about <strong>Marc</strong> on pages <a class="RED" href="04_Introduction.xhtml#page_20">20–23</a>.</p>
