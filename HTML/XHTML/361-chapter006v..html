<div class="headnote">
<p class="noindent">Whether I am grilling seafood, poultry, lamb, or vegetables, I use this southern Italian classic marinade of lemon juice, garlic, oregano, parsley, chilies, and olive oil. This piquant marinade is the perfect complement for char-grilled foods. Keep a bottle full of <em>salmoriglio</em> in your refrigerator for up to 5 days. With a good shake, it is ready to go.</p></div>
<p class="yield">[SERVES 4]</p>
<div class="ingredients">
<p class="ingredient">Juice of 2 lemons</p>
<p class="ingredient">2 garlic cloves, finely minced or puréed on a Microplane grater</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="ingredient">¼ teaspoon red chili flakes</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt</p>
<p class="ingredient">1 tablespoon warm water</p>
<p class="ingredient">A dozen fresh whole sardines, scaled and gutted</p>
<p class="ingredient">A dozen scallions, washed and trimmed</p>
<p class="ingredient">A dozen large escarole leaves (the tender inner leaves can be grilled as well and served alongside, see <a href="chapter006k.xhtml#page-180">here</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="procedure">
<div class="step">
<p class="step"><strong>In a small bowl</strong>, whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, oregano, parsley, chili flakes, salt, and warm water.</p>
<p>Place the sardines and scallions in a large bowl or baking dish or any vessel that holds them comfortably. Spoon over half of the salmoriglio and set the remaining half aside. Using a spoon or your hands, gently stir the sardines and scallions to make sure that they’re fully coated with the salmoriglio and let them marinate for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, set up a charcoal grill and get it nice and hot, or if you’re using a gas grill, set the heat to high. If you’re working indoors, set a grill pan over high heat or preheat your broiler to high. Any of these options will work.</p>
<p>Wrap each sardine with an escarole leaf and place them on the grill along with the scallions. Grill everything until charred on all sides and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes a side for both the sardines and the scallions. Transfer the sardines and scallions to a serving platter and drizzle with the reserved salmoriglio. Serve immediately.</p></div>

<h1 class="sidebar-title1">RECIPE NOTE</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="special">If you use the salmoriglio beyond sardines, note that chickens should rest overnight in the marinade in the refrigerator, but fish, lamb, and vegetables need just 30 minutes at room temperature. Remember to reserve some of the salmoriglio to drizzle over the food just before indulging.</span></p>
