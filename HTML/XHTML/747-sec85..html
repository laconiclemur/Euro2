<p class="nonindent">I created this dessert and named it “flavors of the Mediterranean” because the combination reminds me of the time I spent at elBulli. I would drive along the Mediterranean coast every day to get to work. Along the way, I could pick super-ripe apricots from the farmers’ market. Once I got to work, I often helped pick pine needles from the trees outside and watched my colleagues shuck pine nuts from their cones for a pine nut risotto dish. To tie those elements together, I whip yogurt for a creamy base.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if you don’t live in a Mediterranean climate, chances are you’re near a pine tree somewhere. I have southern pines in my backyard, but northern white pines will do, too. (The spinach makes the oil a vibrant green color.) The we’re-on-a-hike woodsy aroma is intoxicating and brings out the best in sweet-tart apricots.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="head1">BAKED APRICOTS</p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>8 apricots, halved and pitted</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup honey</strong></p>
<p class="head1">PINE OIL</p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup fresh pine needles, free of any pesticides or herbicides</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 baby spinach leaves, optional</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong><a href="sec08.xhtml#page44">Candied Nuts and Seeds</a> for serving</strong></p>
<p class="head1">SWEET YOGURT MOUSSE</p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ cups heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ cup plain Greek yogurt</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">TO MAKE THE APRICOTS, PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350°F.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Place a very large sheet of foil on a half-sheet pan. Arrange the apricots on the foil, cut sides up, in a single layer. Drizzle the honey evenly on top. Bring up the sides of the foil and seal to create a packet.</p>
<p class="indent">Bake until the apricots are tender but still hold their shape, 20 to 30 minutes. Uncover the apricots and let cool in the foil until room temperature. The apricots with their juices can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using.</p>
<p class="nonindent">While the apricots cool, make the pine oil. Cover the pine needles with water in a small bowl. Swish to remove any dirt and debris. Repeat until the water is clear. Drain well and pat dry. Transfer to a blender and add the oil, and spinach if using, to keep the oil a bright green color. Blend on high speed until the oil is green and the pine needles are broken into tiny bits. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. The oil can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature and whisk before using.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Just before serving, make the yogurt mousse. Whisk the cream and sugar in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Whisk the yogurt in a large bowl until smooth. Fold in one-quarter of the whipped cream until well mixed, then fold in the remaining until incorporated.</p>
<p class="indent">Divide the pine oil among 8 serving bowls, then top with the apricot halves and yogurt mousse. Sprinkle with the candied pine nuts and serve immediately.</p>
