<p class="nonindent">One of the first dishes Félix’s mom, Pepa, made for me was albóndigas. They were the best meatballs I’d ever had. They were so tender, they fell apart the second I put them in my mouth. One bite and I could see why they were Félix’s favorite and why everyone in his family talked about Pepa’s albóndigas all the time. Félix grew up helping Pepa roll them, standing on a step stool at the counter. She’d feed them to him, one by one, as soon as they came out of the pan, even before they went into the sauce. From the moment I tasted them, I knew I had to have albóndigas on Cúrate’s menu.</p>
<p class="indent">I spent over a year experimenting with my albóndigas recipe, and in the process I added my unique twist: ham. It started as a way to avoid wasting food. We had all these scraps of Ibérico ham from assembling our charcuterie plates and wanted to figure out how to use them. The answer was mixing the bits into the pork-and-beef mixture and making a stock with the bone. Assuming you don’t have ham bones at home, I’ve adapted the stock recipe for sliced ham. In fact, you can do this with Southern country ham, too—just season a lot less, because country ham is much saltier. Rosemary is my other addition. It’s not used in albóndigas, but it does grow all over Catalonia. Its piney fragrance simultaneously matches and balances all the fatty meat. Good meatballs are as much about texture as they are about taste. To that end, I make sure all the vegetables are minced and cut the bread in tiny cubes. Finely dicing the bread creates more space between the dense meat mixture, makes the fried balls light and airy inside.</p>
<p class="indent">Serve with good, crusty bread or over pasta or rice. The albóndigas are filling enough to be a main dish that needs only a simple green salad on the side. They also work well as a party dish. Simply spear them with cocktail skewers to serve as an appetizer.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon blended oil</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1¼ cups minced onions (from about 2 small yellow onions)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon packed minced garlic (from about 6 cloves)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup <a href="sec29.xhtml#stock">Jamón Stock</a></strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 cups ⅛-inch cubes crustless stale ciabatta (from about 1½ small rolls)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>5 ounces Serrano ham (10 very thin slices), very finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ pound ground beef chuck (80/20 fat)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ pound ground pork (85/15 fat)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 large egg</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>½ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¾ cup all-purpose flour, for dusting</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>4 cups <a href="sec29.xhtml#salsadet">Tomato Sauce</a> warm or room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Canola oil, for frying</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">HEAT THE OIL IN A LARGE CAST-IRON OR OTHER</span> heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and spread in an even layer. Once the onions start to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, until just softened and shiny, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until golden and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the wine and ham stock. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half. You want to cook out the wine, but keep some liquid in there for the bread to soak and get soft. Remove from the heat, add the bread cubes, and stir well to evenly coat and let it soak up the liquid.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page100"/>Transfer to a large plate and spread in an even layer to cool completely. If you’re in a rush, transfer to the freezer to cool to room temperature quickly.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, break up the ham into tiny pieces in a large bowl. The fat tends to stick to itself, so you need to separate the pieces again after cutting to avoid getting any big clumps of salty ham. Add the ground beef and pork and break apart to evenly distribute with your fingers. Beat the egg and egg yolks until blended in a small bowl. Add to the meat, along with the parsley, salt, and onion mixture. Mix with your hands until thoroughly combined.</p>
<p class="indent">Roll 1 rounded tablespoon of the mixture into an albóndiga. It should be the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Repeat with the remaining mixture to make 36 albóndigas. If you have time, refrigerate them first and let them get cold. They’re easier to fry and hold their shape when cold. The uncooked albóndigas can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
<p class="nonindent">When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the flour in a medium bowl. Drop an albóndiga into the flour, turn to coat, then lift out and reroll in your hands, shaking off excess flour while you roll. Transfer to a clean plate or pan. Repeat with the remaining albóndigas.</p>
<p class="indent">Put the tomato sauce in a large Dutch oven or other heavy ovenproof saucepot with a lid. If you’re starting with cold tomato sauce from the fridge, reheat it to warm first.</p>
<p class="indent">Fill a large cast-iron skillet with canola oil to a depth of ½ inch (about ½ cup). Heat over high heat until an instant-read thermometer registers 350°F. When you drop an albóndiga in the oil, it should sizzle immediately and brown.</p>
<p class="indent">Add only as many albóndigas as can fit in a single layer with 2 inches between the balls. You don’t want to crowd the pan. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, to evenly brown, 3 to 5 minutes. You’re going for a dark golden brown. As the albóndigas finish browning, transfer them to the tomato sauce. Repeat with the remaining albóndigas. The later batches will go faster because the oil gets hotter and they’ll also brown faster because the oil is darker. When you’re done cooking, you’ll have to dump this oil because of all the flour in it.</p>
<p class="indent">Make sure all the albóndigas are covered with the sauce, gently spooning the sauce over them and pushing them down if needed. Cover the Dutch oven and bake for 45 minutes. Serve hot.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This recipe is the reason I own a food mill. It squeezes all the sauce out and leaves the seeds and rosemary leaves behind. You really want the sauce to be smooth so that it can cling to Albóndigas (<a href="sec29.xhtml#page99">here</a>). It’s also a handy all-purpose tomato sauce for pasta.</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon blended oil, divided</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 small yellow onion, very thinly sliced (1 cup)</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>6 small garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons tomato paste</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>1 rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>¼ cup <a href="sec29.xhtml#stock">Jamón Stock</a></strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>Kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="side-text"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="small">REMOVE THE TOMATOES FROM THEIR LIQUID IN</span> the cans; reserve the liquid. Coarsely chop the tomatoes and transfer to a large bowl. Add the reserved tomato liquid from the cans.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat 1 tablespoon blended oil over medium heat in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Stir in the onion. Once it starts to sizzle, reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and translucent but without any color, about 10 minutes. If the pan starts to get too dry or if you notice the onions starting to take on any color, stir a little water into the pan.</p>
<p class="indent">Push the onions to one side of the pan and add the remaining teaspoon blended oil to the other side. Add the garlic to the oil and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about 2 <a id="page101"/>minutes. Push to the side with the onions. Add the tomato paste to the other side and raise the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring, until the paste starts to stick and caramelize but not burn on the bottom, about 1 minute. Stir into the onion-garlic mixture, then pour in the wine. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot, until the liquid has almost all evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the rosemary, tomatoes with their juices, and ham stock. Bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and simmer, stirring occasionally, until you can no longer taste the acid in the tomatoes and the mixture has thickened, about 3 hours. You have to cook for a really long time for the flavors to intensify and sweeten.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Discard the rosemary, then pass the sauce through a food mill or puree it in a food processor or blender until smooth. Stir in ½ teaspoon salt and the olive oil. Taste and add more salt if you’d like. You should have 4 cups sauce. If you’re using it right away, return to a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Otherwise, you can keep the sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 week or in the freezer for months.</p>
