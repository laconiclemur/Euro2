<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pollo alla cacciatora</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Each Italian family seems to have its own variation on this classic dish. My father notes that this recipe, from the Tropiano family, is very similar to the Tucci family version. “The only difference is that we didn’t add tomatoes or marinara sauce.”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 red or green bell peppers, seeded and cut into 1-inch-wide strips</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound mushrooms, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 3-pound free-range chicken, cut into serving-size pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups coarsely chopped onions (about 2 medium-size onions)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup canned whole plum tomatoes, <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a>, or your own favorite marinara sauce</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the peppers and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Stir the mushrooms into the pan and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add to the pan and brown lightly on both sides, about 15 minutes in all. Remove the chicken from the pan to a platter and set aside. Pour the wine into the pan and stir to incorporate any cooking juices. Add the garlic and onions and cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand or the back of a slotted spoon as you add <a id="page_289"/>them to the pan. Return the chicken to the pan, along with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Stir the peppers and mushrooms into the chicken. Return to a simmer, cover, and cook to blend in the flavor of these ingredients, about 10 minutes. The cacciatore may be set aside at this point for several hours before reheating and serving with bread to dip into the sauce.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Medium white and light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Rabbit cut into serving portions may be substituted for the chicken. Omit the peppers. Quarter rather than slice the mushrooms. To the basic recipe add 2 all-purpose potatoes, peeled, halved, and each half quartered. Stir these into the pan along with the rabbit.</p>
