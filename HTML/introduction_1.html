<h2 class="h2-a">Introduction</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">PROVENCE IS AN</span> unparalleled feast for the senses, reflected in the azure blue of its sky and sea, in the stony hillsides fragrant with the scent of lavender and mountain thyme, and in the vibrant colours and exhilarating fresh flavours of the food. Softly lit languorous afternoons always draw me, waiting to dine in the shade of a richly leafed tree, sipping chilled local rosé and crunching on croûtons spread with rich, black tapenade. Or evenings by the sea, with laughter and little concern about the more serious side of life, tossing olive stones into the Med and waiting for a bouillabaisse to arrive. More often than not, on many of these occasions I’m elsewhere, hot and flustered, doing the actual cooking. But I’m just as happy in my beloved kitchen as I am anywhere else in Provence, where the ingredients are a source of permanent inspiration and pleasure.</p>
<p class="normala">Provence itself is divided up into six <em>départements</em>: Vaucluse, Bouches du Rhône, Alpes de Haute Provence, Hautes Alpes, Alpes Maritimes and our own region, the Var. Each ‘department’ offers its own culinary specialities, which may differ from other regions simply by the addition of a different herb, or just a bit more garlic, and there is much in the way of interdepartmental rivalry, each claiming dishes as their own. Provençal cooking is often referred to as <em>la cuisine du soleil</em>, ‘the cuisine of the sun’, and this sums it up pretty well, but not completely, as the cooler times, of which there are admittedly a lot less than in most places, have their own wonderful repertoire of dishes too.</p>
<p class="normala">The word ‘Provençal’ could describe a gentle, thoughtful way of moving through life, for passing time in a way that stretches conveniently at moments of pleasure and a little less so when you want the shutters fixed. Being part of Provençal life and becoming Provençal (and I think you really can, it’s a state of mind) are wonderful things to aspire to. The people themselves may seem calm and unconcerned, but are actually the most passionate I know. An argument is always simmering somewhere. Just watch a seemingly innocent game of boules and you’ll see what I mean. Most things are attacked, verbally at least, and when it comes to many workmen, verbally only, with fervent vigour.</p>
<p class="normala">Opinions are, mostly, there to have and hold for life, not to be changed, and from a culinary viewpoint certainly not by a lanky chap from the other side of the world. This is part of the Provençal charm. Monsieur, waiting in the fishmonger’s in Cogolin has always made his aïoli in a mortar and pestle. He is totally unimpressed by, even dismissive of, my whisk and bowl technique, no matter how practical it may be. Madame in La Mole heard I was a <em>cuisinier</em>. She wanted to show me a few things. ‘Since I was <em>une petite fille, vous comprenez</em>,’ she has cooked her <em>soupe au pistou</em> for hours rather than in the short fresh burst that I prefer. No matter what my argument, or the suggestion that being different is OK, a slightly pitying smile and famed Provençal shrug are all I’ll get. As for bouillabaisse, well, that’s another story (it is, later).</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">THE PROVENÇAL WAY</span> of being is reflected no more completely than in its food. To this day the seasons command more respect than in any other place where I have worked or visited.</p>
<p class="normalaa">Spring is the season of promise, the colours are soft and shy. The first of the tiny broad beans and peas make an appearance. The shiny, intensely green beans are shelled and eaten raw with salt and olive oil or the <em>bagna calda</em> of Nice, or sautéed with a little savory and served alongside cutlets of the first spring lamb. Peas are added to fresh soupe au pistou, or cooked, <em>à la française</em>, with carefully softened fresh white onions, lettuce and sometimes little artichokes. These have their first season in spring as well. The tender little buds are just trimmed – they have no choke to speak of – and all except the very outside leaves are edible so the preparation is easy. They are finely sliced and tossed with lemon and olive oil or cooked <em>à la barigoule</em>, a preparation with as many different versions as bouillabaisse.</p>

<p class="normal1">Asparagus, wild and cultivated, also arrives in abundance in spring. The white, held in such high regard in northern France, is not so favoured in Provence. The violet-tipped green variety with only a tiny woody stem and tender flavoursome spears that need neither peeling nor trimming is the chosen delicacy. They are either blanched then roasted in olive oil, poached or steamed. Served in the Provençal way with olive oil and lemon juice to slide each spear in before every bite, asparagus is one of spring’s most sensual pleasures.</p>
<p class="normalaa">In spring, as during most of the year, markets bring individual treats that reach beyond their produce. An elderly woman sits proudly with her goats’ cheese, each slightly imperfect round carefully topped with a sprig of mountain savory. She has just three trays. One has her freshest cheeses, which are pure white, creamy and mild enough to eat with berries and sugar. The second tray holds cheeses that are slightly dryer, yellowing a little and more strongly flavoured, but still creamy enough to be grilled and melted lusciously atop garlic-rubbed croûtons to serve in the midst of a salad dressed with olive oil and herbs. The third tray of cheese, dryer again, dark yellow and sweetly pungent, is to be eaten while sipping good red wine as a cheese course. She also offers a few bunches of wild savory, carefully tied with brown string, that surround her cheeses like a protective border. She may not have been at the market long but was probably up very early milking her goats. She shares half a roast chicken and a bottle of rosé wine with the monsieur next to her who is selling cured sausages and mountain-dried ham.</p>

<p class="normal1">Another maker of goats’ cheese once visited Pete and Di. She’d had a problem, caused I think by the mistral. Left without electricity, she’d come in search of some so she could milk her goats. They agreed to an exchange: electricity for cheese. Their power was hers to use at will and she milked away happily for weeks. But after the first few trays the promise of goats’ cheese melted away…</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">WITH SUMMER COMES</span> the food for which we know Provence best, when we rejoice at the arrival of sun-gorged tomatoes, peppers, aubergines and courgettes, the latter often with their bright yellow flowers still attached. It is the time to make ratatouille, Provence’s most celebrated vegetable dish from which the scent of summer itself rises as it murmurs gently at the side of the stove. Gently and lovingly cooked, the ingredients are first sautéed separately, then cooked together with softened onions and garlic that melt sweetly into what I think is the tastiest of all vegetable dishes. Ratatouille makes an aromatic and robust partner for grilled fish, usually one of the many varieties of sea bream such as <em>marbré</em> or <em>pagre</em>, or lamb, often cooked outside, sometimes over a fire of vine leaves. It is also eaten cold. The rich cooking oil oozes on to your plate and provides the perfect excuse to finish the bread basket. Olives are sometimes added, and a generous scattering of basil offers a lovely burst of freshness.</p>
<p class="normala">One of the biggest treats in Provence is the stone fruit, picked when ripe and sold soon after. The joy of a perfect ripe peach is something special, still warm from the sun and so full of juice that it pours down your chin with each bite. There are huge piles of local berries on sale, too, including up to four types of strawberry – from the heavily scented <em>mara des bois</em> to the delicate pink <em>gariguette</em>. Their sweet jam-like scent will permeate the entire market and drift down the street as the day warms up.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">OF COURSE FOR</span> a visitor the most enjoyable thing is to become part of the local crowd, milling around with purpose, but always having time to talk. You are recognised by the <em>vendeurs</em> and <em>vendeuses</em>, who pull out the best titbits from behind the stalls. We have, on a much more regular basis than the weekly market, become very attached to and well served by one particular supplier: Jacky, our butcher. He is a <em>maître boucher</em> who considers himself, quite rightly, to be an artist. He never lets himself be hurried or flustered, but talks first of all very carefully about the recipe, finds the cut of lamb (in the case of a navarin, for example, the neck end, still on the bone, properly hung), then prepares it perfectly while you watch, not hesitating to give a little flourish with his knife where he thinks the flourish is merited. Then he wraps it with great care in pink-tinted paper proudly bearing the name of his family firm, above, naturally, the words <em>Maître Boucher</em>.</p>
<p class="normala">Life in Provence is not restricted to the summer days by the sea, and during those summer days the sea is perhaps best avoided, crowded as it is. And there is always the threat of the mistral, the legendary wind that blows through Provence. If it lasts for more than five days a husband has a legal right to kill his wife (or so I’m told; I’m not sure what happens the other way around). This wind has the ability to completely throw you, to make you annoyed and irritated; but the feeling it leaves, once passed, is one of cleansing and peace.</p>
<p class="normala">The autumn and winter countryside, like the cuisine, has an enrapturing spell all of its own. The food is powerfully flavoured, warming stews and daubes, roasted game birds, and vegetables not often associated with Provence, such as endives and sweet potatoes. The Provençal passion for the hunt is legendary, although the woods, like the sea, may offer less than they once did. Some of the traditional offerings are now so rare they are only eaten behind closed doors, but there are still boar, partridges, pheasants and woodcock, the latter one of France’s great delicacies. More common and commonly discussed are the many varieties of mushrooms, each of which has its place, not only to be found but used. Each mushrooming spot is jealously guarded. I took a flight over specially in late October one year so that Sylvain, the guardian of Peter’s vines, could take us to a spot where he finds them on a regular basis. He found them in abundance, we feasted on them for days and a few of the recipes have made their way into the book.</p>
<p class="normala">These mushroom recipes, like a few others in this collection, are difficult for you to re-create outside of Provence. But they exist and, along with the azure blue of the sea and sky, they make up the inimitable, ever-changing spirit of Provence.</p>
