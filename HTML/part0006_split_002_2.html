<p id="sab0003229" class="calibre10"><a id="pg11" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>Being the only Spanish woman in a French kitchen wasn’t always easy. It’s a different world now, but at the time I really had to stand my ground. After a period working at Gaudí, a Spanish restaurant (now closed) in Clerkenwell in London – a really happy time in which I made some of my best friends – I moved to Fino, a small restaurant in Fitzrovia that Sam and Eddie Hart opened in 2003. Fino was probably the first proper Spanish restaurant in London and it was there, almost five years after I started working in restaurant kitchens, that I started to cook what I really wanted to: lots of small dishes and little bites packed with flavour, instead of traditional starters and mains. This way of eating has a different vibe: it’s less formal, more fun, and there’s more opportunity for playing around with ingredients. Working at Fino gave me the confidence to be myself, and I began to cook Spanish recipes with ingredients from the UK at the same time as building relationships with suppliers that enabled me to get amazing Spanish ingredients like goose barnacles (a crustacean that is a delicacy in northern Spain).</p>
<p id="sab0003230" class="calibre10">Four years after opening Fino, Sam and Eddie opened another restaurant, the first Barrafina on Frith Street in Soho. Again, I planned the menu – it was similar to Fino, but with more of a Basque influence, and more tapas. It was stressful because more dishes equals more ingredients and more to do. On top of this, there were no reservations, meaning we didn’t know how many people would show up. I’d always worked in kitchens that were tucked away from sight, and for the first time I was going to have people watching how we were doing everything. The day we opened there was one guy waiting outside, but slowly people started to look through the window and come in. After an hour or so, we were full – although you only needed twenty-three people to fill the restaurant! As soon as I began to cook, I forgot about everyone watching. Over the years the reaction of the customers at Barrafina has taught me so much; I can immediately see when people like something (or don’t), and this has helped me to make my recipes better. When the second Barrafina opened on Adelaide Street in Covent Garden in 2014, I wrote a completely new menu. I didn’t <a id="pg13" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>want to serve the same dishes, because we’re not a chain, and that’s not my style of cooking. I like when people talk about having a favourite out of the three restaurants (Drury Lane opened in 2015), as they all have their own identity, though they share the same atmosphere and brilliant service. In 2014, Barrafina was awarded a Michelin star. When the founder of Barrafina, Sam Hart, called to tell me, at 7 a.m. or so, I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ I didn’t think I’d ever have a Michelin star because that’s not my style of cooking, and Barrafina isn’t a ‘Michelin type’ of restaurant – although the service is exemplary. It’s good that the way people think about these things is changing, though: eating fantastic food doesn’t have to be so formal. For me, the point of going out is to have a great time. Barrafina has retained its star for three years now, and the team work so hard and really deserve it.</p>
