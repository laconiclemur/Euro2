</div>
<p class="summary">Discard any clams that are chipped or broken, as well as those that are too heavy (which will be full of mud) or too light (which will be dead). Also discard any open clams that do not close when they are tapped on the sink or dipped in ice-cold water; they should be tightly closed. Store them in a cool place where they can breathe, such as in a bowl in the refrigerator, covered with damp paper towels.</p>
<p class="summary">Clam farms put the clams through a process that washes them, but you may still need to scrub them with a stiff brush in a bowl of cold water. Some sand will remain inside; leave the clams in fresh cold water for 20 minutes—as they breathe, they will push the sand out of their shells. Then lift them out and rinse in one or two more changes of water.</p>
<p class="summary">To steam clams open, put them in a large pan with just a finger of water, cover the pan, and set over high heat. Take off the heat as soon as they open, about 3 to 5 minutes—they will be cooked. Discard any that remain closed.</p>
<p class="summary">Alternatively, you can cook clams on a flat griddle over high heat.</p>
