<p class="tx2"><b>We enjoyed this hearty soup at our cousin Tiziana’s house. It was dressed with olive oil that was just three days old. The lentils were organic and grown just 1 km (0.6 miles) away and the Swiss chard was from her <i>orto</i>. This recipe is very easy and very pure – the flavours come from the lentils and fresh ingredients.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) small brown or green lentils</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1–2 teaspoons salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 g (5 oz) Swiss chard with stalks, finely diced, or spinach leaves, finely shredded</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 long celery stalk, finely diced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tomatoes, fresh or tinned, finely diced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon best-quality extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of parsley, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½–1 teaspoon dried chilli flakes, or to taste (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Soak the lentils for 15–20 minutes in a bowl of cold water. Drain and put them into a pan and fill with 1 litre (34 fl oz/4¼ cups) of fresh cold water, or until the lentils are just covered. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and cook for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">While the lentils are cooking, put the Swiss chard, celery and tomatoes in a saucepan with a good pinch of salt, the oil, parsley and chilli (if using), and cover with a lid. Put over a low heat and let everything cook slowly for 15–20 minutes or until the vegetables have softened – it will form its own juice.</p>
<p class="tx">Drain the lentils and add them to the chard soup base, keeping the cooking water. Then add around 400 ml (13 fl oz/1¾ cups) of the lentil water (you don’t want to add too much). Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to low and continue to cook for 45 minutes, covered. Add a little more cooking water if it looks dry. Season with salt to taste. Serve swirled with your best olive oil.</p>
