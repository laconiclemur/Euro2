 verdure</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">vegetables</h2>
<p class="parab1">Southern Italians love vegetables so much that Neapolitans used to be known as <em>mangiafoglie</em>
 , or leaf-eaters. To this day, Italians have a rich tradition of vegetable cookery and serve vegetables as main course dishes, not just starters and accompaniments.</p>
<p class="parab1">When I was growing up, we usually ate meat only once or twice a week but we enjoyed an excellent, varied diet of seasonal vegetables. Nowadays, we can eat any vegetable all year round, but I miss the anticipation and excitement we felt at the beginning of each new season. We knew we couldn’t rely on fresh veg all year round, so right from the very first crop of spring we would start preserving them for the winter months.</p>
<p class="parab1">It was a joy eating the vegetables we had preserved from spring and summer – not just for the taste but also for the memories. Every time I opened a new jar, it reminded me of the day I had filled it. It may have been a feast day, or the first day of summer, or even a sad day, but the memories always came flooding back. The taste of those preserved vegetables was out of this world. Preserved aubergines, in particular, were so good that it was a miracle if they made it through to the winter months.</p>
<p class="parab1">Winter was a joy for me in many ways. I loved the beautiful chestnuts, the dried figs and fruit, and the pungent flavours of preserved summer vegetables. But, after a long winter living on root vegetables and preserved vegetables, spring was really something to look forward to. It brought the first broad beans, peas, courgettes, chicory, cucumbers, onions, asparagus and endless salads.</p>
<p class="parab1">The greengrocer shops gradually came alive with colour as they filled with new produce. As spring continued, more and more vegetables arrived – all kinds of cabbages, large aubergines and tomatoes. Then, with the summer, came an abundance of vegetables and the first fruit crops of the season. It was magnificent. Small pears and figs straight from the trees, herbs, chillies, peppers – everything was available and everything was delicious.</p>

 insalata di arancie e finocchio</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">orange and fennel salad</h3>
<p class="para1">This salad is typical of Sicily, where oranges are grown in abundance. It is eaten all over the South as well, and I remember it was one of my father’s favourite salads as a pre-lunch snack to refresh himself and stimulate his tastebuds – rather like an aperitif. The combination of sweet oranges, the aniseed flavour of the fennel and the saltiness of the anchovies makes this a very tasty salad indeed.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 oranges, peeled, zest and pith removed</p>
<p class="ingre">8 black olives, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large fennel bulb, finely sliced (reserve the feathery fronds)</p>
<p class="ingre">8 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tsp red wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Take an orange in the palm of your hand and with a small, very sharp knife cut out the segments from between the membranes, discarding the pips and any pith still attached. Repeat with the remaining oranges.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the orange segments and sliced olives in a bowl, then add the fennel and anchovy fillets. Season with salt and pepper (be careful with the salt as the anchovies are already quite salty). Mix in the olive oil and vinegar, leave to marinate for a minute or two and then serve. Decorate with the green feathery leaves from the fennel.</p>

<h3 class="h3">pure di ceci</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">chickpea purée</h3>

<p class="ingre">1 litre/1¾ pints vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the vegetables and rosemary and sweat until softened. Stir in the chickpeas, then add the stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, then cover the pan and simmer for about 1½ hours, until the chickpeas are tender and have absorbed almost all the liquid.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the heat, place in a food processor and whiz until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately, or make in advance and then heat through gently just before serving.</p>

 patate saltate</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">sautéed potatoes</h3>
<p class="para1">These are an essential accompaniment to all sorts of meat dishes and roasts. Leave the garlic cloves unpeeled and don’t worry about the skin; it all adds to the flavour and appearance of the dish.</p>

<h3 class="h3">insalata di patate</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">warm potato salad</h3>
<p class="para1">For maximum flavour, it is imperative that this dish is served when the potatoes are still warm, so make sure that all the other ingredients are ready as soon as the potatoes are cooked. It makes an ideal accompaniment to Involtini di Pesce <a href="text00008.html#page_81">Spada con Finocchio</a>
 for a light al fresco lunch.</p>
<p class="para">

 tortino di patate e cavolo nero</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">potato and cavolo nero bake</h3>
<p class="para1">Potatoes, cabbage and Taleggio cheese are a typically northern Italian combination. The climate is much cooler in the North and you would expect to eat such a dish there during winter. I have used cavolo nero in this recipe, as I find it much tastier, but you could use Savoy cabbage instead. Cavolo nero is grown mainly in Tuscany and has become widely available in supermarkets throughout the UK. Its name means ‘black cabbage’, referring to its long, thin leaves, which are so dark that they look almost black. It certainly stands out from the usual variety of cabbage found in greengrocer’s.</p>
<p class="para1">Taleggio gives the dish a rich, creamy taste but if you can’t find it, substitute Fontina or a mature Cheddar.</p>
<p class="para1">If you cook this in four individual terracotta dishes, it makes an ideal vegetarian main course, served with a simple green salad. Prepare it in advance and then bake once your guests have arrived.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">675g/1½lb cavolo nero (large leaves only)</p>
<p class="ingre">8 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">325g/11oz Taleggio cheese, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the stalks and hard central core from the cavolo nero leaves and cook in plenty of boiling salted water for 3–5 minutes, until just tender but still slightly crisp. Drain well, rinse in cold water and then drain again, squeezing out any excess water with your hands. Dry on a kitchen cloth. Cook the potato slices in a saucepan of lightly salted boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain, rinse in cold water, drain again and dry well on a kitchen cloth.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to its highest setting. To make individual servings, you will need 4 terracotta dishes about 20cm/8in in diameter and 3cm/1¼in deep. Grease each dish generously with some of the butter. Arrange half the potato slices, slightly overlapping, over the bottom of the dishes, dot with some of the butter and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the cavolo nero leaves over the potatoes, with the larger part of the leaf hanging a quarter of the way over the edge of the dish. About 10 cabbage leaves should suffice for each dish. Arrange half the cheese on top of the cabbage and then season with salt and pepper. Top with the remaining potatoes, then with the remaining cheese. Place a cabbage leaf in the middle and fold over the excess leaves, pressing gently with your fingers so that none of the other ingredients are visible, then dot with butter. If you are making one large bake, grease a large baking tray with plenty of butter and then layer the ingredients as above.</p>
<p class="para1">Cover with aluminium foil, place in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully lift off the foil, taking care not to burn yourself with the steam. Serve straight from the baking tray if you have made a large bake. If you have made individual portions, place a plate over each one and flip over. You should get a lovely layer of golden-brown potatoes on the top. Serve immediately.</p>

 peperoni ripieni</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stuffed baby peppers</h3>
<p class="para1">For this recipe, try to use small peppers or, if you prefer, the small, sweet long peppers. If you use the latter, slit them lengthways and remove the seeds, then make the filling as below, except for the provolone which you should slice in strips and place over the top of the peppers. Bake these long peppers for 20 minutes only. If you can’t find either type of pepper, use ordinary peppers and serve one per person.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">8 red or yellow baby peppers</p>
<p class="ingre">2 large potatoes, boiled and mashed</p>
<p class="ingre">75g/3oz provolone cheese, cut into very small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">1 egg</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp finely chopped fresh chives</p>
<p class="ingre">a little olive oil for drizzling</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6. Remove the stalks from the peppers and set aside. With a small, sharp knife, remove the white membrane and seeds from inside the peppers, taking care not to tear the flesh.</p>
<p class="para1">Mix together the mashed potatoes, provolone, Parmesan, egg, chives and some salt and pepper. Using a teaspoon, fill the peppers three-quarters full with the mixture and then put the stalks back in place, like a stopper. Pack the peppers tightly into an ovenproof dish, drizzle with olive oil and bake for about 30 minutes, until tender. Serve immediately with a good green salad. They are also delicious eaten cold.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h3 class="h3">agrodolce di peperoni</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">sweet and sour peppers</h3>
<p class="para1">Sweet and sour flavours go extremely well with peppers. This dish can be served as a starter with lots of bread to mop up the delicious olive oil, or as a side dish to accompany meat and game. It is ideal for making in large quantities for parties, as it can be eaten cold.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 2–4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large yellow pepper, deseeded and cut into thick strips</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large red pepper, deseeded and cut into thick strips</p>
<p class="ingre">3 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">2 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole</p>
<p class="ingre">6 black olives</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp capers</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the peppers and cook until the skins are golden brown. Then add the anchovy fillets, garlic, olives and capers. Stir in the sugar, then add the vinegar and allow to evaporate. Cook over a medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the peppers are tender. Season to taste and serve either hot or cold.</p>

 carciofi ripieni</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">Stuffed globe artichokes</h3>
<p class="para1">Artichokes are very popular in Italy, especially in the South where they grow in abundance. In fact, Italy is the largest producer of artichokes in the Mediterranean and a great number are exported as well as eaten locally. Just like chestnut sellers on street corners in England, we used to have artichoke vendors selling roasted artichokes. The smell was irresistible.</p>
<p class="para1">I love artichokes and cook them in a variety of ways – roasted, fried, <a href="text00010.html#page_135">steamed and in salads</a>
 . My favourite way of cooking the large globe artichokes is to stuff them and slow-cook them in a pot. Try this recipe; it’s simple to prepare, makes a wonderful starter and looks very impressive when served – almost too lovely to eat! When serving, remember to provide finger bowls, spare plates to hold the discarded leaves, and plenty of good bread to soak up the sauce.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 handfuls of fresh parsley, roughly torn</p>
<p class="ingre">4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">8 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">16 cherry tomatoes, quartered</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tsp capers</p>
<p class="ingre">8 green olives, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">4 large globe artichokes</p>
<p class="ingre">about 1.5 litres/2½ pints vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">8 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra for drizzling</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Combine the parsley, garlic, anchovy fillets, tomatoes, capers and olives in a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">With a small, sharp knife, remove the bottom outer leaves of each artichoke and cut off the stalk. Trim the base slightly so the bottom sits flat. With your fingers, gently open out the artichoke until you can see the hairy choke. With a small scoop or teaspoon, remove and discard the choke, which is inedible. Season the artichoke cavities with salt and pepper and fill each with the parsley mixture, gently pressing all the ingredients in.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the filled artichokes in a large saucepan, then pour in the stock. Pack them in tightly so they don’t wobble during cooking. If your pan is too big and there is space between the artichokes, fill the gap with a large potato. The stock should come three-quarters of the way up the artichokes, so if necessary add some more.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into each stuffed artichoke. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer for 1 hour or until the artichokes are tender; if you can pull out a central leaf easily, they are done.</p>
<p class="para1">Carefully lift out the artichokes with a large slotted spoon and place on individual serving plates, then gently open up the artichokes so the filling is exposed. Pour about half a ladleful of the stock over each artichoke and drizzle with some olive oil. Serve immediately, with lots of bread to dip into the sauce.</p>

 fagottini di zucchini</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stuffed courgette parcels</h3>
<p class="para1">This is a different and interesting way of using courgettes. They are simple enough to prepare, but allow yourself some time and you will find that once you get going they are fun to make. They look good, too, and make an ideal starter with some salad leaves or to serve with drinks. I am sure your guests will be intrigued to know how you got the filling in!</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6 as a starter</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 large courgettes</p>
<p class="ingre">350g/12oz ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz potatoes, boiled and mashed</p>
<p class="ingre">5 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">8–12 fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">8–12 thin slices of Fontina cheese, about 4cm/1½in square (you could substitute mature Cheddar)</p>
<p class="ingre">a little butter for greasing</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">With a sharp knife, cut the courgettes lengthways into slices 5mm/¼in thick; you should get 4–6 slices from each courgette. Cook the courgette slices in plenty of lightly salted boiling water for about 2 minutes, until just tender, then remove and plunge into cold water. Drain and pat dry with kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/Gas Mark 9. In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta, mashed potatoes, Parmesan and some salt and pepper. Take 2 slices of courgette, place them on a clean, dry surface and shape them in a cross. Repeat with the rest of the courgette slices. With your fingers, shape the ricotta mixture into balls about the size of a pingpong ball (one for each courgette cross). Place a ball in the middle of each cross, place a sage leaf on top and then fold the strips of courgette over to make a parcel. Place a slice of Fontina on top and secure with a wooden toothpick.</p>
<p class="para1">Line a baking tray with aluminium foil or greaseproof paper and grease with some butter. Place the courgette parcels on the baking tray. (At this stage, you can also choose to refrigerate them and cook when needed.) Bake for 10–12 minutes, until golden. Remove the parcels from the oven, place on a serving dish and remove the toothpicks. Serve warm, with some salad leaves.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">salad of raw artichokes, asparagus and fennel</h3>
<p class="para1">Raw artichokes are surprisingly delicious. They are usually served as a salad with shavings of fresh Parmesan, dressed with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice. Here, I have omitted the Parmesan and added other crunchy, raw vegetables. If you don’t like one of the vegetables, you could replace it with some raw carrots. This makes a lovely, healthy starter.</p>

 bietole rosse marinate</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">marinated beetroot</h3>
<p class="para1">Fresh beetroot doesn’t feature much on Italian menus but I remember it was one of my mother’s favourite vegetables, and she would often preserve it. If you follow this recipe, the beetroot will keep for about two weeks in the oil; if you want it to last longer you will have to store it in sterilised jars. Once all the beetroot has been consumed, keep the oil and use it to flavour salads or pasta or to marinate some more beetroot. You need such a lot of olive oil for this recipe that it’s a shame to throw it away.</p>
<p class="para1">Serve the marinated beetroot as you would pickles – perhaps as an antipasto with some salami or air-dried tuna (<em>mosciame</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">650g/1½lb raw beetroot</p>
<p class="ingre">500ml/17fl oz white or red wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre">2 litres/3½ pints water</p>
<p class="ingre">a pinch of salt</p>

<p class="ingre">2 garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingre">1 red chilli, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">500ml/17fl oz olive oil</p>
<p class="para1">Wash and scrub the beetroot under cold running water. Place them in a saucepan with the vinegar, water and salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer for about 1¼ hours, until the beetroot are tender.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the beetroot are cooked, drain, place on a clean kitchen cloth or kitchen paper and pat dry. Remove the skins with the help of the cloth. Cut into slices, place in the marinade and mix well. Leave for a day before serving. The beetroot will keep for several days in a covered container in the fridge but should be brought to room temperature before serving.</p>

 verdure miste sott’olio</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">mixed preserved vegetables</h3>
<p class="para1">Preserving vegetables was very common when I was a child. It was a means of enjoying certain vegetables all year round. Nowadays we can get all sorts of vegetables at any time of year but I still like to preserve them when they are in season. Not only is it an enjoyable task but preserving gives them a different flavour. Here I have chosen peppers and aubergines, which I have preserved raw so they remain nice and crunchy. Serve with a few slices of Parma ham and salami, plus lots of good bread for a delicious antipasto.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 8–10</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">600g/1lb 5oz red and yellow peppers</p>
<p class="ingre">600g/1lb 5oz aubergines</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz salt</p>
<p class="ingre">800ml/1¼ pints white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre">3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced lengthways</p>
<p class="ingre">1 red chilli, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingre1">250ml/8fl oz olive oil</p>
<p class="para1">Cut the peppers in half and remove all the seeds and white membrane. Slice lengthways into very fine strips. Peel the aubergines, slice them lengthways and then cut finely lengthways into strips approximately the same size as the peppers.</p>
<p class="para1">Keep the vegetables separate. Take 2 plastic containers, one for the peppers and one for the aubergines. Line one container with the peppers, sprinkle with a good handful of the salt, then carry on with layers of peppers and salt, ending up with salt. Place a weight over the top and set aside. Take the other container and do the same with the aubergines. Leave the vegetables for 1½ hours, after which time they will have exuded a lot of liquid.</p>
<p class="para1">Take the vegetables in your hands and squeeze out the excess liquid. Place in separate containers, cover each with the vinegar and leave for 1½ hours again.</p>
<p class="para1">Drain the vegetables, squeezing out the excess liquid with your hands, and place together in a bowl with the garlic, chilli and oregano. Add the olive oil and mix well. Place in a jar, securing tightly with a lid, and leave for a couple of days before using.</p>

<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Artichokes</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">To prepare artichokes, remove the bottom outer leaves with a small, sharp knife and cut off the stalk. With your fingers, gently open up the artichoke until you can see the hairy choke. Remove it with a small scoop or teaspoon and discard. If you want to use just the hearts, then remove all the leaves except for a few tender inner ones. If your hands get black while cleaning the artichokes, wash them with lemon juice – the dark stains disappear quickly. Rub the artichokes with lemon juice too, to prevent discoloration and, if not cooking them immediately, keep them in a bowl of water acidulated with lemon juice.</p>
<p class="para1">You can cook artichokes in many ways, and even eat them raw when they are young and tender. Simply chop them finely, drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice, then season with salt and pepper. Place on a bed of rocket and top with Parmesan shavings.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Celery</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">To obtain maximum flavour, bash celery stalks with the flat of a knife blade before chopping them. Use the leaves as well. Added at the end of cooking, they give a wonderful fresh flavour to the dish.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Courgettes</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Unless you are using very small, fresh courgettes, the white middle part does not really have much flavour. To make the most of courgettes, cut off the skin in long strips a good 5mm/¼in thick and discard the white middle part (save it to add to vegetable stocks). Slice or chop the green strips according to your recipe.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Garlic</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Before chopping garlic, squash the cloves whole, skin on, for the best flavour.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Mushrooms</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Do not wash mushrooms, whether wild or cultivated. Use a soft brush or slightly damp cloth to clean them. Mushrooms are already full of water and immersing them in more destroys their flavour.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Onions</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Soak whole onions in cold water for 30 minutes before peeling. You will find the skin comes off more easily and they will be less pungent when you chop them (so you will be less likely to cry!).</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Parsley</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Use the stalks, finely chopped, for stocks and soups. They are very flavoursome.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Peppers</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">To roast peppers, place them under a hot grill, turning several times, until the skin goes black. Remove and leave to cool. Peel off the skin, slice them in half and remove the white interior and seeds. Then slice according to your recipe.</p>
<p class="para1">For a delicious salad, slice roasted peppers into strips, sprinkle with extra virgin olive oil, chopped garlic, salt and pepper and leave to marinate for 15 minutes. This makes a good antipasto with lots of bread. Alternatively, to make a sauce for pasta, place the skinned, deseeded roasted peppers in a food processor and whiz with enough extra-virgin olive oil to give a smooth sauce. Season, heat through gently and mix with some cooked penne or tagliatelle.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Potatoes</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">If you plan to mash your potatoes, don’t peel them. Just wash them to get rid of any dirt, then boil them whole. Once tender, drain and remove the skin, which will peel off very easily. You will find that potatoes cooked this way make much better mash, as they are not so watery.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Salads</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">There are now so many different types of salad dressings from cuisines all over the world – all of them can be delicious, but for me the simple, classic Italian way to dress salads is the best. Place your salad leaves in a large bowl, then sprinkle them abundantly with salt and drizzle with two parts extra virgin olive oil to one part white or red wine vinegar. Mix well, using your hands – you will find that this way the dressing coats each leaf.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>
<span class="grey">Tomatoes</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">To skin tomatoes, cut a tiny cross in the base of each with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl of boiling water for no more than 30 seconds, then drain and place in cold water. Peel off the skins.</p>

 pomodori</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">tomatoes</h3>
<p class="para1">The tomato played a very important role in our culinary life when I was growing up. It is integral to Italian cooking, the basis for so many sauces, and a delight to eat raw in salads.</p>
<p class="para1">I remember the anticipation I felt in late summer when I knew my favourite tomato, the San Marzano, was nearly ripe and ready to eat. This long plum tomato grows close to my home, in the Pompeii valley under the shadow of Mount Vesuvius. The fertile volcanic soil helps to produce what I think is the best-tasting tomato in Italy. These tomatoes were perfect in salads and delicious on their own, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt.</p>
<p class="para1">Because tomatoes were so important to our cuisine, we preserved them for use all year round. These days you can buy tinned tomatoes in every corner shop and supermarket, whole or chopped, plain or herb-flavoured. Tomato purée is readily available, and sun-dried tomatoes can be bought at most supermarkets and delicatessens. But when I was a child, we had to prepare the tomatoes ourselves. The hard work made us appreciate the food and brought the family together.</p>
<p class="para1">In my house, tomato preservation was a great ceremony and enormous fun. It was usually in September, when the San Marzano tomato was still available, that the family gathered together and the grand procedure began.</p>
<p class="para1">We preserved our tomatoes in small beer bottles made of thick, brown glass. The glass had to be thick to survive the pasteurisation process. A long wooden table was set out in the garden with lots of chairs arranged round it for all the family to sit at. On the table was a vast supply of freshly cleaned bottles, a bucketful of corks, fresh basil leaves and kilo upon kilo of washed tomatoes. The tomatoes were cut lengthways into quarters and pushed into the beer bottles along with the odd basil leaf until they were almost full. The bottles were then corked, using a strange gadget. The scene was like a production line, but everyone was cheerful and relaxed, laughing and chatting as they worked.</p>
<p class="para1">At the other side of the garden was a large oil drum placed over a tripod. On the bottom of the drum was a raffia sack, folded in two. We placed the filled beer bottles in the drum one by one. Once it was full, water was poured in and another raffia sack placed on top to act as a lid. Then a fire was lit underneath. We took it in turns to sit with the fire all night and make sure it didn’t go out until the early hours of the morning, when the process was finished. Once the water had cooled, we removed the beer bottles, dried them and placed them in store cupboards, ready for use in winter.</p>
<p class="para1">We always made huge quantities, enough to ensure a year-round supply for us, as well as our family living in the city who could not make their own. The preservation process was perfect. Even when we found a bottle that was a couple of years old at the back of the cupboard, the tomatoes still tasted good. These tomatoes didn’t taste like the tinned ones you find in the shops; they were something else. There are still families in southern Italy who preserve their tomatoes in this way each year. If I had the time now, I think I would, too.</p>
<p class="para1">Besides preserving whole tomatoes, we used to make tomato concentrate to use throughout the winter months in heavy-based sauces for pasta or meat dishes. The tomatoes were washed and put through a special mincer to extract the pulp. Then the pulp was placed in large, flat, terracotta dishes, covered with nets to keep the flies off and placed on the veranda under the hot August sun for the excess moisture to evaporate.</p>
<p class="para1">One member of the family was put in charge of this process. Their duty was to stir the pulp every couple of hours with a large wooden spoon and occasionally sprinkle a few drops of olive oil over the top to prevent a crust forming. The dishes were taken in at night and put out again first thing in the morning. After three or four days, the fresh pulp turned into a thick, delicious concentrate of pure tomato. It was transferred to terracotta jars, drizzled with oil and sealed with greaseproof paper and string.</p>

 funghi</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">mushrooms</h3>
<p class="para1">I love the changing seasons. It is one of the reasons I live in England. My favourite season has always been the autumn. As September arrives, the summer ends. In Minori, that means the tourists leave, the sea becomes rough and populated with different kinds of fish, the weather changes and there is no more stifling heat. That was always my signal to leave the sea and move to the mountains, where I would lose myself in the forest, picking chestnuts, walnuts and mushrooms.</p>
<p class="para1">The first rain brought life to the changing land. The soil developed a rich, musky smell. Out of the blue, the fruits of the earth appeared. Thousands of mushrooms. There is nothing more magical than a glorious, sunny autumnal morning spent roaming the woods in search of these elusive fungi.</p>
<p class="para1">I was introduced to wild herbs and mushrooms at an early age. My mother used to take me with her on her collecting trips in the hills and fields. She showed me what was good to eat, what to try and what to leave well alone. She collected herbs and mushrooms for her herbal remedies, but we usually came back with such an abundance of produce that she would also use them for cooking.</p>
<p class="para1">I was still fairly young when she sent me out on my own to collect mushrooms and herbs for her. Even then, mushrooms intrigued me. I loved trying to distinguish the poisonous ones from the edible ones. It was like a game. I sampled them while I was out and about. Then I thought I was immortal; now I know I was just lucky.</p>
<p class="para1">I would take the mushrooms back to my mother. She threw away the ones she thought were poisonous and kept the ones she knew were good. I know so much more about mushrooms now and it breaks my heart to think of the priceless specimens she threw away.</p>
<p class="para1">I couldn’t believe the abundance of wild herbs and mushrooms in the fields and forests when I came to England. It was here that my passion grew, and I was determined to become more knowledgeable. I discovered the delights of truffles in England, not Italy – although I am certain they existed in the forests of my childhood, I just wasn’t aware of them.</p>
<p class="para1">I still go on regular herb and mushroom collecting forays. Some days I come back with seven or eight different edible species of mushroom – pretty ones, ugly ones, colourful ones, big ones, small ones – they are all delicious. On spring days, I like to go out and search for rocket, wild garlic, dandelions, wild fennel and sorrel.</p>
<p class="para1">I love the fact that you can find wild food anywhere – in fields, in parks, by the sea, even on the edge of motorways and in city centres.</p>
<p class="para1">Remember that although many mushrooms are safe to eat, others are highly poisonous and can be fatal. If you pick your own mushrooms, ensure you can identify them with absolute certainty, or go out with an expert.</p>

 funghi misti saltati</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">sauté of mixed wild mushrooms</h3>
<p class="para1">This is a simple but truly exquisite recipe, especially after a mushroom hunt when you have lots of different varieties. Nothing is more pleasurable than going into the forest on a clear, crisp, autumnal morning and looking for mushrooms. However, if you are not fortunate enough to go out and pick your own, cultivated ones will suffice if you add dried porcini to give that ‘wild’ flavour. Simply soak 10g/¼oz dried porcini in 120ml/4fl oz lukewarm water for an hour, then add them, together with their soaking water, instead of the stock.</p>

 tagliatelle con funghi misti</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">tagliatelle with mixed mushrooms</h3>
<p class="para1">If you enjoy making the sauté of <a href="text00010.html#page_148">wild mushrooms</a>
 and would like to use the same method for a more substantial dish, this is ideal. Fresh or dried tagliatelle are the perfect match for mixed mushrooms. Remember that you can use cultivated mushrooms, adding soaked dried porcini to give that ‘wild’ taste.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">225g/8oz fresh or dried tagliatelle</p>
<p class="ingre">400g/14oz mixed wild mushrooms, such as porcini, chanterelles, hedgehog, wood blewits</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">3 garlic cloves, finely chopped lengthways</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small red chilli, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">120ml/4fl oz vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="ingre">salt</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly grated Parmesan cheese, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="para1">Clean the mushrooms with a cloth and brush – do not wash wild mushrooms, as the flavour disappears. Roughly chop any large mushrooms.</p>
<p class="para1">Place a large saucepan of lightly salted water on the heat and bring to the boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook until <em>al dente</em>
 (fresh pasta will take only about 1 minute; check the instructions on the packet for dried).</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and chilli and sweat gently until softened – do not let them brown or burn. Turn up the heat a little, add the mushrooms and stir well for about 1 minute. Then add the stock, keep stirring, and cook for 2 minutes longer, until the liquid has evaporated slightly. Stir in the parsley and season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="para1">Drain the pasta and add to the mushroom mixture. Mix well and serve immediately, sprinkled with some Parmesan if desired.</p>
