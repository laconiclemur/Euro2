<h2 class="h2b">GRATIN DE BLETTES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Swiss Chard Gratin</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>We’re extremely fond of gratins in Provence, and with its crispy top and creamy centre this is one of the most loved</em>. Blettes, <em>which are known either as Swiss chard or silver beet, are widely used and much easier to get hold of than spinach. The green variety is a pale, almost olive green and has fewer or smaller stalks, and the white has large white stalks and beautiful, white-veined, dark green leaves. The whole of the vegetable is used, but not always in the same dish, as the leaves cook a lot quicker than the stalks. The stalks are peeled lightly by just snapping them in half and pulling away the stringy bits. They are then sliced, blanched and sautéed with a little garlic, rosemary and parsley. You can add the leaves halfway through the cooking or do them as a separate dish, stewed slowly with plenty of onions, tomatoes and thyme. They’re also quite nice blanched and tossed in a herby olive oil vinaigrette</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6</span><br/>
1 large head of Swiss chard, about 500g (1lb 2oz), leaves and ribs separated<br/>
40g (1½oz) butter<br/>
30g (1¼oz) plain flour<br/>
250ml (9fl oz) milk<br/>
150g (5½oz) Gruyère cheese, freshly grated<br/>
100g (3½oz) Provençal Breadcrumbs (<em><a href="chapter_001i.html#page31">see here</a></em>)<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Freshly grated nutmeg</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Melt the butter in a small saucepan, turn off the heat and add the flour. Stir to remove any lumps, then stir in the milk. Put back on the heat and bring to the boil gently, stirring all the time. Boil for a minute then add 100g of Gruyère and keep stirring until it has melted. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="normala">Chop the Swiss chard ribs into 1cm (½in) slices and boil them in plenty of salted water. Slice the leaves and add these when the ribs are almost tender. Boil for a further 2 minutes. Strain and dry well, then mix with the cheese sauce and spoon into a gratin dish. Sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and remaining cheese, and bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling.</p>
