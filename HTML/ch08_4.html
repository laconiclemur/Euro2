<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">MUM’S EGGY BREAD</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This Spanish bread-and-butter pudding, usually made for Easter, is the one dish that really reminds me of my mum. She makes the best torrijas in the world – no contest.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 6</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 5 MINUTES, PLUS INFUSING AND CHILLING</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 10 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">2 LITRES MILK</p>
<p class="recipe-list">300 G SUGAR</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 CINNAMON STICK</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 LOAF DAY-OLD WHITE BREAD</p>
<p class="recipe-list">VEGETABLE OIL OR MILD OLIVE OIL FOR FRYING</p>
<p class="recipe-list">2 EGGS, BEATEN</p>
<p class="recipe-list1">FOR THE CINNAMON COATING</p>
<p class="recipe-list">100 G SUGAR</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 TABLESPOON GROUND CINNAMON</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Place the milk, sugar and cinnamon stick in a pan and bring almost to boiling point, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and leave for about 15 minutes so the milk is infused with the cinnamon aroma.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Cut the bread into slices about 2–3 cm thick. Place the bread slices in a large shallow dish and pour the milk over. Chill for at least 2 hours, turning the slices over halfway through.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat – you need to be able to fry at least two slices of bread at a time. You could use butter instead of vegetable or olive oil but it’s best avoided and will burn more quickly. When the oil is hot, quickly dip each slice of bread in the beaten egg so that it is fully coated, and then place in the hot oil. Take care – I’ve burnt my fingers too many times. After a couple of minutes, flip them over and fry them for another minute or two until golden. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Mix together the sugar and ground cinnamon and sprinkle it on both sides of the torrijas. Do this while they are still hot – the sugary coating will stick more easily. Breathe in the lovely warm aroma of cinnamon and enjoy!</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Another way of serving these is with a sticky wine syrup. You’ll need a bottle of good red wine – Spanish if possible – nothing too expensive. Place in a large pan with 200 g of sugar, 1 star anise and 1 cinnamon stick and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the wine syrup over just-cooked torrijas and leave to cool before eating.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">CUSTARD-FILLED PUFFS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">These light-as-air fritters (literally ‘puffs of wind’) shouldn’t take you more than 15 minutes to prepare from beginning to end. You will see these sold from stalls on the streets of Madrid for All Saints Day. Sweets were not really for everyday eating so they evolved as something people ate to celebrate saints’ days or special occasions. Another reason is because the nuns in the convents used to receive egg yolks from the nearby landlords of the vineyards who used egg whites to clarify the wine. The nuns invented ways to use up the excess egg yolks…!</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Place the water, butter and salt in a pan and bring to the boil. Add the flour, remove from the heat and mix with a spoon for about 1 minute until it is well combined and the mixture has become a ball. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Add the eggs, one at a time. Mix into the dough until completely blended before adding the next one. Add the bicarbonate of soda and stir in – the mixture should have the consistency of thick yoghurt.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Pour enough oil into a deep pan to give you three fingers’ depth of oil. Heat until a cube of day-old bread dropped in the oil turns golden in about 30 seconds. Alternatively heat a deep fryer to 190°C.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg187"/><span class="no">4</span> Use a couple of teaspoons to start dropping in knobs of dough, about the size of a cherry. The dough should start frying and puff up after about 30 seconds, and then they will turn over by themselves. Leave them in the oil until they turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. They should have a delicate crispness on the outside and be pretty much all air on the inside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Dust with caster or icing sugar while still warm. If you want to fill with whipped cream, make a little cut on the side of each one and use a piping bag to fill.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">You could also try filling these with chocolate ganache or custard.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">‘THE’ CRÈME CARAMEL</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">I have probably tasted around 60 different crème caramels in my life but I have never tasted one as good as the one my mum makes. And I am not saying this because it’s my mum’s – if I genuinely had tasted a better flan I would have put it in the book instead. One of my earliest memories is of Mum making this flan and, if that’s not enough, this is the first thing I ever cooked – when I was just 4½ years old.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 5</p>

Using a cloth or oven gloves, swirl the caramel around the dish so that it covers the bottom and comes a little up the sides of the dish.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Whisk the eggs, condensed milk, milk and vanilla extract together using an electric whisk or blender (yes, it really is that simple). Pour this egg mixture into the caramelized dish and cover with foil. Place it into the bain marie and transfer to the oven.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Cook in the oven for 1 hour, remove from the oven and allow to cool before removing the foil. Place a plate over the top, flip over and remove the mould. The caramel should run down the sides of the flan. I hope is the best crème caramel you have ever tasted. If it’s not, complaints to my mum, please!</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Find a small ovenproof dish for this dessert – it’s very sweet so you only make it in small quantities. Put the sugar and water for the caramel into the dish and place over a medium heat until it turns to caramel and is a lovely golden colour. Swirl the caramel all over the bottom of the dish and a little up the sides. Set aside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Put the sugar, water and lemon zest into a small pan over a medium heat. When it comes to the boil, let it bubble for a further 3 minutes. Take off the heat and remove and discard the lemon zest. Set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Very gently whisk together the egg yolks with the whole egg – you do not want to create any froth. Pour the warm syrup into the egg mixture in a thin, steady stream, whisking as you do so. Keep whisking until it is completely incorporated. Pour this mixture into the caramel-coated dish and place the dish inside a deep-sided roasting tin. Pour in a couple of fingers’ depth of cold water (to create a bain marie) and put the whole thing in a cold oven. Turn the temperature to 160°C/gas mark 3 and cook for 25 minutes or until set. Take care not to overcook – it should still have a slight wobble.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Chill in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving. Run the point of a knife around the edge of the dish and then turn out on to a plate. Do not eat too much of this as it is extremely calorific, but it is a real treat.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">RICE PUDDING</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">I don’t like making comparisons but in the case of rice pudding, I have to say that no other country’s rice pudding even comes close to this Spanish classic. Spain is not a major dairy producer but in Asturias in the north (where most of the cows are) they know a thing or two about making great milky desserts. If you can’t find Spanish rice, you can just about get away with using short-grain or pudding rice.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 5 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 35 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 LITRE FULL-FAT MILK</p>

<p class="recipe-list">110 G SUGAR</p>
<p class="recipe-list">30 G UNSALTED BUTTER</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Pour the milk into a pan and add the cinnamon stick, vanilla pod or vanilla extract and about 3 strips of lemon zest, making sure there is no white pith attached. Place over a medium to high heat and bring to the boil. Stir the milk a few times as it heats up to stop the bottom burning. Be careful with the milk – it is very fickle and as soon as you turn your back it will suddenly boil over and mess up your hob.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Just as the milk starts to bubble and rise up, add the rice and give it a good stir. Allow to simmer for 20 minutes, stirring at all times, and then stir in the sugar and cook for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Remove from the heat and add the butter; keep stirring so that the butter emulsifies as it melts. Remove and discard the lemon zest strips and the cinnamon stick and vanilla pod (if using) and allow to cool, stirring every 30 minutes or so. Rice pudding is as much about texture as it is about flavour, which is why we add the butter at the end and stir it as it cools.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">In Spain this is served in different ways depending on the region. You can eat it warm or cold, sprinkled with ground cinnamon or even sprinkled with sugar, which is then caramelized with a blowtorch or under a hot grill.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">PEARS COOKED IN WINE</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">Increasingly these days I find that the supermarkets are filled with exotic fruits that have been flown in from some distant country. To me, these are nothing compared to the wide variety of apples and pears grown all over Spain and throughout the UK. I love this dessert as it is so simple. It also works well with peaches.</p>

Leave to cool down completely in the wine, ideally overnight so that the flavours have time to infuse and penetrate.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> These pears are delicious on their own but you could also serve them with vanilla ice cream for a more complete dessert. If you want to keep them for longer, place in a sterilized preserving jar, close the lid tightly and boil for 10 minutes. They should then keep for up to six months.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1" id="note12">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">You don’t need to use expensive wine for this dish and it is equally good with red or white wine. However, if you do fancy something special, try using a Malvasia or Moscatel wine – you should notice the difference in taste.</p>

Remove the vanilla pod and lemon zest from the milk and slowly pour the infused milk into the egg yolk mixture, whisking all the time. Return to the pan and place over a medium heat. Cook until it has thickened, whisking in the pieces of diced butter one at a time. Take care not to overcook it. This should take about 5 minutes. Allow to cool before chilling in the fridge for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> To make the crêpes, sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the centre and add the egg and about half the milk. Stir gently until you have a smooth mixture and then slowly whisk in the remaining milk.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">SPANISH DOUGHNUTS WITH CHOCOLATE</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">This is not a recipe for the faint-hearted as it involves frying in very hot oil. In Spain you would find a ‘churrería’ in every town, where these hot, crisp, doughnut sticks are served with rich hot chocolate. Churros is one of those recipes that could go either way but stick to the recipe and follow my advice and you will be fine. I have made thousands of these – trust me!</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 30 MINUTES</p>

<p class="recipe-list">400 ML WATER</p>
<p class="recipe-list">400 G STRONG WHITE FLOUR</p>
<p class="recipe-list">PINCH OF SALT</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 TABLESPOON OLIVE OIL</p>
<p class="recipe-list">750 ML VEGETABLE OIL FOR DEEP-FRYING</p>
<p class="recipe-list">CASTER SUGAR AND GROUND CINNAMON [OPTIONAL] FOR DUSTING</p>
<p class="recipe-list1">FOR THE CHOCOLATE</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 SMALL BAG OF SPANISH CHOCOLATE POWDER FOR HOT DIPPING CHOCOLATE</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 PINT MILK</p>
<p class="recipe-list">50 G DARK CHOCOLATE, ROUGHLY CHOPPED</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Bring the water to the boil. Meanwhile place the flour and salt in a large pan and place over a very low heat. Stir lightly for 3–4 minutes so that the flour dries out and becomes fluffy.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> As soon as the water has boiled, pour it over the flour and mix it with a wooden spoon for about 1 minute until a dough starts to form. Don’t over-mix and don’t worry if there are still some lumps in it as you can always finish it by hand once it has cooled down slightly. Halfway through mixing add the olive oil.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> When the dough is still warm, knead for 1 minute. Place in a piping bag (not plastic) with a 8-point star-shaped nozzle and spread out a sheet of baking parchment. Start squeezing the batter on to the parchment to make the churros. Let me warn you: it’s hard work so make sure you don’t strain any muscles. At this point you could freeze the churros and cook later (they can be cooked straight from the freezer).</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg202"/><span class="no">4</span> Heat the vegetable oil in a large deep pan – ideally you want it to be 230–240°C to get that delicious crispy outside and soft interior. To test whether the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of the dough into the oil – if it immediately floats to the surface and starts fizzing away then the oil is hot enough. If it sinks, wait a little longer.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Once the oil is hot enough carefully slide your churros, a few at a time, into the pan. Cook them for 40 seconds on one side and 30 seconds on the other. Remove and drain on kitchen paper and repeat until all your churros are cooked. They should be very crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Make sure the temperature of the oil doesn’t drop, as your churros will not cook properly. Dust liberally with sugar mixed with a little ground cinnamon (optional) while they are still warm.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">6</span> For the chocolate, just bring the milk to the boil in a pot and just before boiling point add the chocolate powder while whisking. Stir constantly for 10 minutes so the chocolate doesn’t burn on the bottom of the pot. Stir in the dark chocolate at the end to give nice body and intensify the flavour. Serve the chocolate in a cup and dip your churros in it.</p>

Roll small balls of the mixture between your hands. Dust liberally with cocoa powder and return to the fridge – enjoy them cold as they will take longer to melt in your mouth!</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">I love the intensity of the black olives and the contrast of the savoury and sweet here, but you can flavour these truffles with almost anything.</p>
