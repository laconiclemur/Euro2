<p class="nonindent" id="p1">Finally I have a book. And I’m not so sure I want another one. But what I learned from this book is the true meaning of teamwork and friendship. It has many faces: many people who either directly or indirectly are a big part of every page—and each other’s lives.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p2">Richard Wolffe: If he hadn’t written the first proposal, we wouldn’t be here today. I wrote this book between naps, and sometimes while snoring, at his house and mine. Thank you for waking me up when we were supposed to be working. But best of all, thank you for being my best friend and for staying on the road with me to true friendship. Gracias especially to Paula Cuello, for sharing her half-orange.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p3">Francesc Guillamet: for his passion, his creativity, and for waiting for the clouds to pass for the right light on every photo. Francesc works for love, not money, and it shows. And also thanks to Maribel Ruiz de Erenchun.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p4">My burner team: Katsuya Fukushima, for always being there, for his smile and for his jackets; Ruben Garcia, for being my rock at the moment I needed it most; Rodolfo Guzman, for being by my side for more than twelve years; Steve Klc, pastry-chef extraordinaire; Laura Trevino, for organizing my life and still staying happy somehow. For all their help over the years as well as their recipe-testing: Jorge Chicas, Terri Cutrino, John Paul Damato, Saul Herrera, Oscar Garcia, Secundino Gonzalez, Nicolas Guardado, Lauren Jones, Alex Mejia, Edgar Steele, Josh Whigham, Brandon Williams and Samantha Withall. And to everyone who has helped me move the restaurants forward.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p5">My dining room team: Tony Yelamos, for his hard work and support; Maria Chicas, for all her work and her contagious smile; Christopher Vasquez, for always being there for me and for choosing the right flowers; Jimmy Pumarol; Manny Flores; Sandy Lewis; Joanna Brady. Thanks especially to Francisco Astudillo for choosing all the wines, and for his amazing nose.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p6">My partners, Roberto Alvarez and Rob Wilder: for so many years of friendship and support, and for building me a stage to perform on.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p7">Heather Freeman: She’s the big sister I never had. Thanks for everything you do, all the time, to show the world my best side. Thanks also to Scott Homstead for supporting both of us so much.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p8">Chris Pavone: for being a guiding force, and for adding the necessary salt to this book. And to Pam Krauss and the entire team at Clarkson Potter, for knocking this book into shape.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p9">Kris Dahl at ICM: for playing the role of Charlie in my life. Thanks for making this book happen. Without you, a great idea would still be cooking in the pot.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p10">Roberto Sablayrolles at Tasty Concepts: for being a great friend and for bringing these words to life with his remarkable design. Also a big thanks to his team, Daniel Troconis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p11">For sharing with me their experience of cookbooks: Rick Tramonto, Claudia Fleming, Bob Kinkead and Tom Colicchio. To all the writers who inspired me and opened the door to Spanish cookbooks in America, especially Coleman Andrews and Penelope Casas. To all the people who paved the way for Spanish cooking in America: especially Julian Serrano, Gabino Sotelino, Rufino Lopez, Paco Peña, Josu Zubikarai, and above all Clemente Bocos and Yolanda.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p12">I can’t thank enough all the many people who have written about Spanish food <a id="page252"/>and wine and helped to bring it to the wider world. Thanks above all to Michael and Arianne Batterberry, who are my gastronomic parents in America and always believed in me; Phyllis Richman, who saw my future as a cook so early; Nikki and Michael Singer, for being true friends and visionaries, and for driving to Roses.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p13">Who says the public and the private sector don’t work well together? Thanks to all the people at ICEX in New York for their continued support over so many years, especially Luis de Velasco, Katrin Naelepa, Jeffrey Shaw, Sonia Ortega. To Jose Guerra, who always is ready and willing to help anyone in need, especially me. And to Pilar Vico from the Spanish tourist office, who has always been my biggest cheerleader.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p14">To all the food and wine importers who help chefs like me get the best Spain has to offer: especially José Arcas, Aurelio Cabestrero, Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzer, Hugo Linares, Jorge Ordoñez and Miguel Puig.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p15">A heartfelt thank-you to the wonderful community of chefs, restaurateurs and food writers in Washington who have always made me feel at home.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p16">To all my friends in the food and restaurant community in Spain: You have inspired me and taught me everything I know. Ferran Adrià and Juli Soler: for being an eternally unselfish source of inspiration and guidance, and for opening their doors once again—this time for the photos in this book. Alberto Adrià: the best <span class="italic">cocinero</span> I know, for being a true friend who’s always there with his insight and help. Thanks for being who you are. And thanks also to Silvia Fernandez for always taking my calls for help. Thanks to everyone, past and present, who is part of that amazing family known as el Bulli.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p17">To all those who shared their culinary expertise with me through the years, especially Josep Puig, Jean-Louis Neichel, Tomas Herranz and Lluis Cruaynes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p18">Javier Canovas and Elena: <span class="italic">por ayudarme a encontrar un camino y mas.</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p19">To my father, Mariano, and my mother, Marisa, for planting the seed of my love for cooking. And to my brothers, Mariano, Jordi, and Eduardo, for great childhood memories. And to all my family in Spain for being a precious part of my life.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p20">Restaurants, books, TV shows—nothing matters more than my family. Happiness isn’t destiny, it’s the road I travel every day with Tichi. Thank you for always steering me in the right direction, and for making the best gazpacho in the world. To my girls—Carlota, Ines and Lucia—I only have to see your joy cooking with me at home and devouring <span class="italic">croquetas</span> at the restaurants to know the true meaning of being a father.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p21">—JA</p>
<p class="extract1" id="p22">I promised myself I wouldn’t cowrite another book, but there’s something about José Andrés that’s irresistible. In public and private he’s the same: big-hearted, funny, incredibly generous and exceptionally creative. He fills a room with his energy, and he’s filled my life with his friendship over the last seven years. José—thank you for teaching me about Spain and about food, for taking my cooking to another dimension, and for being my best friend. An even bigger thank you to Tichi and the girls for sharing José with me (and the rest of the world), and for helping to make Washington our home.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p23">Thanks is still far too small a word for Paula. This book was written at night and on weekends, in the middle of another presidential campaign, when I should have been supporting her. Instead, as always, she was supporting me and our three wonderful monkeys: Ilana, Ben, and Max. I can’t thank her enough for her life and her love, her spirit and her inspiration. She’s all states, and all princes I; Nothing else is.</p>
