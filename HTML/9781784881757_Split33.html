<p class="tx2"><b><i>Caffè e cornetto</i> (coffee and a croissant) is the typical morning order placed at the local bar for almost every Italian, in every Italian street, in every Italian city I have ever visited. I love this time of day; there is a busy, bustling, convivial atmosphere in a small room crowded with freshly scrubbed Italians smelling of aftershave and perfume, with freshly applied make-up, chatting, laughing, and getting their first fix of sugar and caffeine for the day ahead. But life wasn’t and isn’t always like this.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">For our countryside-dwelling friends, who have animals to feed before themselves, breakfast is taken later. It is more substantial and perhaps more in line with my savoury tooth. In times past, <i>colazione</i> in the countryside was an array of bread, meats and cheeses always served with a jug of homemade wine. In time, the wine was replaced by a cup of milky coffee.</p>
<p class="tx">So, in this chapter, we have covered all the bases and included breakfasts from urban bars to rural farmhouse kitchens. We also have friends who, like many Italians, have realised they (like Giancarlo) can no longer tolerate gluten, and those who have been advised to cut sugar or carbohydrate out of their diet. Yes, diabetes and obesity are problems that face many Italians, too. For a healthier breakfast we suggest <a href="9781784881757_Split37.html#page_59a">Babbo’s Eggs</a>, a slice of the <i><a href="9781784881757_Split52.html#page_86">erbolata</a></i> or a <a href="9781784881757_Split92.html#page_157">vegetable timbale</a>.</p>
