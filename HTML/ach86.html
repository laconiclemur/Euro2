<p class="author1"><span class="txit">gnocchi</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe is for two variations of gnocchi—the regular small ones that are rolled off a fork and the larger hand-rolled ones that are stuffed. The stuffed version freezes very well and may be cooked in boiling water directly from the freezer. Both types may be topped with any number of sauces and served either as a pasta dish or as a main course.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large all-purpose potatoes (about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds), peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon ground nutmeg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> to 1 cup all-purpose flour, as needed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Melted butter or heated sauce, for serving</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the potatoes in a medium-size pot and cover with cold water. Season with salt and bring to a low boil. Cook until the potatoes are very tender when pierced with a fork but not breaking apart, about 35 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Drain the potatoes and press through a ricer or mash well with the back of a fork. Spread the potatoes out on a work surface and allow to cool. Gather the cooled potatoes into a shallow round, forming a well in the center. Place the beaten egg and yolk, olive oil, salt to taste, and nutmeg in the well. Distribute <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the flour and the grated cheese around the outer edge of the round. Use your hands to gradually incorporate all of the ingredients into the potatoes to form a smooth dough. (Making gnocchi is similar to making bread, so the amount of flour you will need will vary. Up to <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of additional flour may be necessary to make a smooth dough.) Form the dough into a short, thick log.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_167"/><span class="red">4.</span> Lightly flour your work surface. Cut the thick log into quarters. Roll each quarter of the dough into a long <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-diameter log. Cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch pieces. The gnocchi may be cooked in these cylindrical shapes or individually rolled off a fork to form the traditional gnocchi shape—three or four shallow stripes on one side, a small indentation on the other.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Cook the gnocchi in small batches in the pot of boiling water. They will sink to the bottom of the pot at first. When they rise to the top, they are done. Use a skimmer or slotted spoon to remove them from the water, and set them aside on a warm serving dish until all of the gnocchi are cooked. Toss with butter or sauce and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> For stuffed gnocchi, cut the thick log in half. Roll each half into a 2-inch-thick log. Cut a 1-inch-deep slit down the length of the log. Fill this slit with a semisoft cheese (such as Robiola, smoked mozzarella, Brie, Fontina, or Asiago). Firmly pinch the slit closed. Cut the filled log into 3-inch lengths. Firmly pinch the cut ends closed to seal in the cheese. The stuffed gnocchi may be cooked immediately in boiling water following the instructions for traditional gnocchi, or they may be frozen.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> To freeze, place the small logs on a baking sheet and place in the freezer. When the logs are firm, they may be transferred to a container and kept frozen for up to 2 months. Cook in boiling water directly from the freezer. Serve as an appetizer topped with butter or your favorite sauce.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Gnocchi may also be served topped with these warmed sauces: <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a>; 2 tablespoons chunky sweet Gorgonzola cheese melted in 1 cup heavy cream until thickened, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta">For an elegant version of stuffed gnocchi, fill the split log with smoked salmon. Serve topped with sour cream and a dollop of caviar.</p>
