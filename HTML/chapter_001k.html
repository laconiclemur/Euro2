<h2 class="h2b">BANON ROTI, TOMATES CERISES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Roast Banon Cheese with Cherry Tomatoes</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>I happened on this combination when I had a seemingly endless supply of cherry tomatoes from the garden and was eating them this way or that with every meal. You could, I suppose, use large tomatoes, but it was the intensely sweet flavour of the little ones combined with the piquancy of the cheese and the salty ham that really did it for me. Banon, the cheese wrapped in chestnut leaves from northern Provence, is my cheese of choice, but failing that you could use a strong goats’ cheese that slices easily, such as St Maure. You can toast the baguette but I prefer not to, just allowing it to crisp a little on top and letting the soggy bottom soak up the rich, sweet juice from the tomatoes</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2 whole Banon cheeses, removed from their leaves<br/>
200g (7oz) very ripe cherry tomatoes<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) olive oil<br/>
2 thick slices cured ham, cut into matchsticks<br/>
4 slices baguette, cut at an angle</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your grill to its highest setting.</p>
<p class="normala">Halve the cheeses horizontally through the middle. Put the cherry tomatoes in a pan and add a little salt and half of the olive oil. Cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes until the tomatoes have begun to burst and liquefy. Add the ham matchsticks, and keep warm.</p>
<p class="normala">While the tomatoes are cooking, put the cheese on top of the baguette slices, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Grill for about 5 minutes, and serve on top of the tomatoes.</p>
