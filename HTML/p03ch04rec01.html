<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This famous cold soup is the best thing to have on a hot day in the summer when tomatoes are sweet and full of flavor. It was born in the province of Seville, where tomatoes were first grown in Spain. It was the meal agricultural laborers made when they worked in vegetable gardens. They brought with them a</span> dornillo <span class="italic">(large wooden mortar and pestle) to pound the ingredients that grew on the spot; some olive oil, salt, and vinegar to dress them; and bread. Years ago, when I went to Spain to do a BBC TV series, the gazpacho was pounded by hand in the old way and the result was like a finely chopped and mashed salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers. Nowadays gazpachos are pureed in a food processor or blender.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">There are many versions of gazpacho. My friend Manolo (see page 173) makes his with just tomatoes, garlic, and his own olive oil and vinegar. He makes quantities that he pours into large Coca-Cola bottles so that he and his sister and any friends who happen to be around can have some at any time of the day. I have used the following recipe for years. I do not peel the tomatoes—if you use a food processor, the skin all but disappears. You can make this hours in advance, even the day before. If it is a very hot day, add an ice cube to each bowl when you serve. The garnish is optional. In Andalusia, they use green bell pepper because they like the peppery taste, but I like it with the sweeter red pepper.</span></p>

<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 thick slice white bread, crusts removed</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ pounds ripe plum tomatoes</p>
<p class="qun">1 red or green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 4 pieces</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or wine vinegar, or more to taste</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar, or more to taste</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE OPTIONAL GARNISH</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cucumber, finely diced</p>
<p class="qun">½ red onion or 4 scallions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">½ red or green bell pepper, finely diced</p>
<p class="qun1">1 to 2 slices of white bread, cut into small cubes and lightly toasted</p>
<p class="recsum">Dry the slice of bread under the broiler, without browning it, turning it once. Break it up into pieces.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Quarter the tomatoes and remove the hard white bits at the stem end.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Blend the bell pepper to a paste in a food processor. Add the rest of the soup ingredients and blend to a light cream. Add a little cold water if necessary to thin the gazpacho—about ½ to ⅔ cup. Pour into a serving bowl and chill in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for at least an hour or for up to a day.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Check the seasoning, and serve the gazpacho in soup bowls, accompanied, if you like, by the garnishes. Pass them around, each type in a separate little plate or in four piles in a large serving plate.</p>
