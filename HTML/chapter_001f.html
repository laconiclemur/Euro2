<h2 class="h2b">BEIGNETS DE COURGETTES ET SES FLEURS</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Courgette Fritters</em></h3>
<p class="normall0">Beignets <em>are as popular a starter as you get in Provence. Whether they’re made with sardines or courgettes, the main thing is that the batter is light. The mixture of plain and potato flours here, and not too much mixing, achieves that</em>. Beignets <em>are usually served either alone or with lemon, but I much prefer a bowl of thick aïoli (</em><a href="chapter_003k.html#page92">see here</a><em>)</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 courgette flowers<br/>
2 large courgettes, finely sliced at an angle<br/>
Salt<br/>
Vegetable oil for deep-frying</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">BATTER</span><br/>
1 egg yolk<br/>
275ml (9½fl oz) water<br/>
½ tsp salt<br/>
100g (3½oz) plain flour<br/>
100g (3½oz) potato flour<br/>
1 small bunch fresh basil</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the bases from the courgette flowers and open them out. Put the courgette slices with the flowers.</p>
<p class="normala">For the batter, mix the egg yolk with the water and salt, then add the plain flour, potato flour and basil with a wooden spoon. Don’t stir too much; it’s fine if you have a few pockets of flour.</p>
<p class="normala">Prepare an oven tray with plenty of kitchen paper and have a container of salt at the ready before you start frying. Heat your frying oil to 190°C/375°F.</p>
<p class="normala">Dip the flowers and courgettes in the batter and fry them in a single layer, in batches depending on the size of your fryer, for a couple of minutes each side. They should be light gold in colour. Lift them out with a spider, drain well, and put them on the tray with the kitchen paper in the oven. Season with salt and leave the oven door ajar while you continue. Serve piping hot.</p>
