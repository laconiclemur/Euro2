<p class="author1"><span class="txit">risotto con asparagi</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Canned asparagus may sound gross, but it provides lots of flavor and makes the rice very creamy. This dish can also be prepared using canned peas or crushed plum tomatoes. Of course, this risotto may also be prepared using fresh ingredients. But it also makes for a great “lazy” risotto with ingredients we usually have on hand—rice, onion, canned vegetables, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, chicken broth (or just water), and sometimes parsley.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 small onion, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups Arborio rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 15-ounce can asparagus (do not drain)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 cups hot chicken or vegetable broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Tips from 8 fresh asparagus stalks (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a medium-size saucepan set over a medium heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, stir in the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the parsley and all of the rice. Stir to toast lightly and coat the rice with oil. Stir in the canned asparagus with its liquid, plus 2 cups of the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer. Add more chicken broth, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup at a time, stirring frequently and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid after each addition, until the rice is al dente, about 15 minutes. (If you use fresh asparagus tips, add them with the last ladleful of broth.) The rice should have a slight resistance to the bite. If it seems too hard, add a little bit more liquid and continue cooking for another minute or two.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_197"/><span class="red">2.</span> Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, the butter, if using, olive oil, and Parmesan. Whip with a wooden spoon to bring out the creaminess of the rice and to incorporate all the ingredients. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> White canned asparagus may be used in place of green asparagus. Also, 2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves stirred in at the end of the recipe makes a nice addition to this risotto.</p>
<p class="noindenta">If using fresh asparagus, chop the tips off 1 pound asparagus and set aside. Coarsely chop the remaining portion of the asparagus, discarding any woody stems. Stir the chopped asparagus into the risotto along with the first 2 cups of broth, and proceed with the recipe as written. Add the asparagus tips along with the parsley, butter, if using, olive oil, and Parmesan.</p>
<p class="noindenta">You can make an even simpler version of this recipe: Cook the onion and parsley in olive oil, add the rice, and gradually stir in 6 cups of warm chicken stock. After seasoning with salt and pepper, stir in <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup grated or crumbled Fontina, Gorgonzola, or Gruyère cheese. These creamy cheeses add texture and flavor to this one-dish meal.</p>
