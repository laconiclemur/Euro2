<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Chilled seafood salads blending tomatoes, peppers, and a variety of shellfish and fish with a light vinaigrette are a coastal favorite from Galicia to Andalucía. Final flavors, though, depend somewhat on the season—steamed and shucked mussels or large clams make a typical winter addition—as well as how far south you travel in the country. Cooks in Andalucía tend to use a heavier hand with the vinegar, namely with the local tawny-colored sherry vinegar. This <em>salpicón</em> is one of those southern versions, the type found at tapas bars around Sanlúcar de Barrameda and Cádiz. At home, I like the large, meaty, and moist flakes of <em>dorada</em> (gilt-head bream), though any firm, white-fleshed fish will work.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>1 POUND/455 G FIRM, WHITE-FLESHED FISH FILLETS, SUCH AS BREAM, MONKFISH, COD, GROUPER, OR RED SNAPPER</li>

<li>2 RIPE MEDIUM TOMATOES, CORED, SEEDED, AND CHOPPED</li>
<li>½&gt; RED BELL PEPPER, CHOPPED</li>
<li>½&gt; GREEN BELL PEPPER, CHOPPED</li>
<li>½&gt; MEDIUM-SMALL ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups/1 L water to a boil and season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently lay in the fish fillets and poach until opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes depending on the thickness. Transfer them with a slotted spoon to a plate to drain. Once cool enough to handle, remove any skin and bones and discard, and break the fillets into generous pieces.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> If using fresh (uncooked) shrimp, poach them in the same water over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, until just opaque throughout. Immediately transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water to stop any further cooking. Once cool, remove the heads and shells, leaving the tails attached. Devein if desired.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Place the tomatoes, bell peppers, and onion in a large salad bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and vinegar until cloudy and blended, and pour over the vegetables. Season with salt and a generous amount of pepper and toss. Add the fish and shrimp and gently turn over to coat without breaking the pieces of fish. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Before serving, gently toss again (adding more oil if desired). Serve with the lemon wedges on the side.</p>
