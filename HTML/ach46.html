<p class="author1"><span class="txit">anello di pasqua di maria pia</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My grandmother Nonna Tucci baked this cakelike bread, decorated with eggs, every Easter. Now my cousin Maria Pia has taken over the tradition. She knows just how soft and sticky the dough should feel to create a light, not-too-sweet bread, and she serves it along with other desserts and coffee. Leftovers are great for breakfast, too.</p>
<p class="indent">The raw eggs in their shells can be dyed prior to being inserted in the dough or left plain. They bake along with the bread and can be removed from their shells and eaten just like hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<p class="indentb">When I was growing up, my other grandmother, Nonna Tropiano, or my aunt Angie would give us each one of these breads as an Easter gift. We would carry them around, munching on the sweet dough for hours.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">9 large eggs, at room temperature</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup granulated sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 teaspoons baking powder</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">12 tablespoons (1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> sticks) butter, softened</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups confectioners’ sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons milk or water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon pure lemon extract</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a medium-size bowl, beat 6 of the eggs, the granulated sugar, and the vanilla until pale yellow and frothy. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a large bowl, stir together 3 cups of the flour, the salt, and the baking powder. Add the butter and blend with an electric mixer to form a crumbly mixture. Gradually beat in the egg mixture. Add up to <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the remaining flour to form a soft dough that is dry on the outside but still sticky on the inside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_94"/><span class="red">4.</span> Gently roll the dough into a log about 15 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Cut off a 1-inch-long piece of the dough and set aside. Place the log on a baking sheet. Bring the ends of the log together to form a circle, pinching the dough together to seal the ends. Press 1 of the remaining eggs into the dough at this joint. Place the other 2 eggs an even distance apart on either side of the joint, gently pressing them into the dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Roll the reserved dough into six ropes about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inch wide and 4 inches long. Place two ropes over each egg to form an X, or cross, pinching gently to seal the ends of the ropes to the bread dough. Bake until the bread is light golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> In a small bowl mix the confectioners’ sugar, milk, and lemon extract, until smooth. Drizzle the icing back and forth over the bread to create a decorative topping. Allow the icing to set for 30 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Nonna Tucci made several different types of confections from this same dough: <span class="txit">Cicirata,</span> also known as <span class="txit">struffoli,</span> are deep-fried teaspoon-size balls of this dough that are dipped in honey and mounded together to create an Italian version of croquembouche.</p>
<p class="noindenta">This dough should not be sticky in the center; an additional <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup flour may need to be kneaded into the dough before rolling small sections into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick ropes. Cut the ropes into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch sections. Fill a small frying pan with vegetable oil to a depth of 1 inch. Warm over medium-low heat until the oil is hot but not smoking. Fry batches of the cookies in the oil until golden.</p>
<p class="noindenta">While the oil is warming before frying the cookies, place 1 cup honey, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup water in a medium-size saucepan and slowly bring to a boil. Boil to dissolve the sugar and thicken the mixture slightly, about 20 minutes. Use a fork or tongs to dip the fried cookies into the honey syrup. Shape the cookies into a mound on a serving plate. Decorate with colorful sugar sprinkles and serve in the middle of the table.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_95"/><span class="txit">Anellini</span> are small ring-shaped cookies. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Roll small sections of this dough into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick ropes. Cut the ropes into 2-inch lengths. Wrap each length around the ends of your two middle fingers and pinch together to form a small ring. Place the cookies on a baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely before drizzling with the same icing mixture used in the bread. Garnish with colorful sugar sprinkles if you like.</p>
