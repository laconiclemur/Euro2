  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page418"></a>This menu may be prepared in such a way, if desired, that at the last minute only the potatoes have to be steamed and the <em>blanquette</em> sauce thickened. The <em>ratatouille</em> may be prepared far in advance (for that matter, preserved, in sterilized glass jars, it is altogether respectable), and the <em>blanquette</em> may, except for the addition of the final thickening agent, be prepared a day in advance, rewarmed gently, and finished as described.</p>

  <p class="indent">The high color of the <em>ratatouille</em> and the cool, creamy, pale green of the <em>blanquette</em> form a very pretty juxtaposition.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE COLD RATATOUILLE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Ratatouille</em>, although often served hot as an accompaniment to pork and veal dishes, gains through being savored cold as an hors d’oeuvre. It is among those dishes for which everyone has a different recipe, “the only authentic one.” Many people insist that all the vegetables must be cooked separately—a refinement, to me, without interest and not at all in keeping with the basic nature of a dish whose origins are simple and unpretentious. A few details must nonetheless be retained to arrive at a perfect result: it should be well laced with thyme and garlic (which, being cooked, will be hardly perceptible); the olive oil must be impeccable; it should never boil, but should cook at a bare simmer; the saucepan should be of heavy material (preferably an earthenware casserole), low and wide of form, to permit maximum evaporation; and the natural vegetable cooking liquid (for there must be no addition of water) should be radically reduced separately (most often, unfortunately, the fire is simply turned up at the end of the cooking process and the contents of the saucepan stirred and reduced rapidly—the result is a messy purée in which the vegetables are no longer distinguishable).</p>

  <p class="indent">Ordinarily I would finish it with basil rather than parsley, but, in the context of this menu that is impossible, since basil plays a dominant role in the course that follows. As for the other identical elements, the garlic in one dish is cooked, and in the other, raw—two totally different flavors—and the aromatic ingredients lend support to the basic elements without themselves being aggressive.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c32-s120"><a id="page419"></a><em><span class="color">Cold Ratatouille (Mixed Vegetable Stew)</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Ratatouille Froide</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound white onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 large, firm, well-ripened tomatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound sweet peppers (red, yellow and green, mixed, or 1 large of each)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound eggplant (the small violet elongated variety, if available)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound baby zucchini (the smallest available, in any case)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>tiny pinch of Cayenne pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon thyme leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a bouquet of parsley and 1 bay leaf, tied together</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a handful of finely chopped parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly ground pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the onions and cut each in quarters or eighths, depending on their size. Put them to cook gently in ⅓ cup of the olive oil while preparing the other vegetables. Stir from time to time and do not let them brown.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel and seed the tomatoes and cut each half into 6 or 8 pieces. Cut the peppers in 2 lengthwise, discard the stems and all the seeds and cut them into pieces ¾ to 1 inch square; wipe the eggplant and zucchini clean with damp paper towels and cut off the tip ends of both. Cut the eggplant into ¾-inch cubes without peeling, and cut the zucchini crosswise into ½- to 1-inch sections, depending on its thickness. Smash the garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, discard the hulls, and chop the garlic.</p>

  <p class="indent">When the onions are yellowed and soft from cooking, add the peppers, the eggplant pieces, the garlic, salt, and Cayenne. Continue to cook gently for 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, then add the tomatoes, the zucchini (if desired, the zucchini may be added halfway through the cooking process, for it cooks very rapidly, and if delayed it remains firmer), thyme, and the parsley and <a id="page420"></a>bay-leaf bouquet. At this point, one may turn up the flame until the boil is reached, easing a wooden spoon to the bottom of the cooking utensil and stirring from time to time to prevent sticking. Leave to cook over a tiny flame, at a bare simmer, with the lid ajar, for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place a colander or sieve over another saucepan, pour in the vegetables and allow to drain well; then return the vegetables to their saucepan and to the fire, leaving the lid off (they will continue to give off liquid, which in this way evaporates in part). Place the saucepan containing the liquid over a very high flame and, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, reduce it to a light, syrupy consistency (first, the liquid will foam up—it must be rapidly stirred to prevent it from boiling over—then it will settle down to a loose, rapid boil, and finally, as it approaches the correct consistency, it will bubble in a more explosive way. There should be around ½ to ¾ cup of syrupy liquid remaining—pour it back into the vegetables and leave to cool. Add the remaining olive oil, half the chopped parsley, season with pepper (and more salt, if necessary), and mix together thoroughly, stirring carefully to avoid crushing the vegetables. Pour into the serving dish, chill thoroughly, and sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE BLANQUETTE OF BEEF TRIPE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The term <em>pistou</em> refers to the <em>pommade</em> of garlic and basil leaves (this ordinarily contains much more garlic), the flesh of raw tomatoes, and grated Parmesan cheese, the whole thing worked into a thick paste and thinned with olive oil; it is customarily used to add an explosive, last-minute perfume to <em>la soupe au pistou</em>, basically a minestrone containing, in addition to the usual vegetables and pasta, white beans, green beans, and a slice of cut-up local squash, somewhat resembling our winter squash, which lends a velvety quality to the soup. <em>Pistou</em> was, longer ago than anyone can remember, adopted into Provençal cooking from Genoa, where a somewhat different version, <em>pesto</em>, is often used as a sauce for pasta.</p>

  <p class="indent">In French culinary terminology, <em>gras-double</em> refers to the stomachs and intestinal parts of beef (it only becomes <em>tripes</em> when the feet are added), and the variety is preferable to the exclusive use of honey-<a id="page421"></a>comb tripe, but as far as I know, that is the only section of the <em>gras-double</em> available commercially in America.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c32-s121"><em><span class="color">Blanquette of Beef Tripe with Basil</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Blanquette de Gras-double au Pistou</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds honeycomb tripe</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 large onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ bottle dry white wine combined with approximately the same quantity of liquid, preferably veal stock, pot-au-feu bouillon, or roasting juices—lacking that, water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>thyme</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf and a bouquet of parsley, tied together</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Pistou:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 clove of garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 handful of fresh basil leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of ½ lemon</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut the tripe into pieces approximately 2 inches square.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel the onions, chop them finely and cook them gently in the oil, in an earthenware casserole or a large, heavy saucepan, for about 10 minutes, without allowing them to brown. Sprinkle with the flour and leave to cook for another minute or so, stirring several times so that the flour cooks evenly. Away from the flame, add slowly, stirring the while, a ladleful of the wine and stock mixture, then stir in the rest. Return to the fire and, over a medium flame, bring to a boil, without ceasing to stir.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add the tripe, salt, thyme, and the parsley and bay-leaf package, and leave to cook very gently for approximately 2 hours (tripe actually <a id="page422"></a>needs 6 or 7 hours of cooking, but it is precooked when one buys it—the time necessary depends on the extent of its precooking).</p>

  <p class="indent">Pound together in a mortar the clove of garlic, peeled, the basil leaves, a pinch of salt and some freshly ground pepper, until the mixture is reduced completely into a purée. Stir in the tablespoon of olive oil and the egg yolks.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the pot containing the tripe from the fire and discard the parsley and bay leaf. Set aside a ladleful or small bowlful of the cooking liquid and allow it to cool somewhat, then stir it slowly and thoroughly into the basil-garlic-egg yolk mixture. Pour the contents of the mortar slowly into the pot, stirring the while, and return it to a moderate flame. Stir without stopping until the sauce begins to thicken; it should coat the spoon. Above all, it must never come to a boil after the egg mixture has been added. Stir in a bit of lemon juice, taste for seasoning, and serve in its cooking utensil (if it is presentable), accompanied by the steamed potatoes, served apart.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c32-s122"><em><span class="color">Steamed Potatoes</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pommes de Terre à la Vapeur</p>

  <p class="nonindent">So-called “steamed” potatoes are nearly always boiled. They are far better if really cooked in steam, and this is easy to do if one has a special rack or some other device for steaming vegetables in a pot. Choose potatoes that are small, regular in shape, and of a nonmealy variety. Cook them, peeled, for about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the quality and type of potato. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to relieve them of their naked appearance.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c32-s123"><em><span class="color">Cherries and Fresh Almonds</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Cerises et Amandes Fraîches</p>

  <p class="nonindent">If fresh almonds are not to be found in American markets, certain parts of the country, nonetheless, abound in almond trees. The green almonds in the process of maturing contain a gelatinous material that <a id="page423"></a>eventually becomes the nut. Sometime between the months of May and July, depending on the species of almond and the climate, the nut solidifies. At this point in its development the outside hull and the unformed shell are easily cut through with a knife, and the almond, from which one first peels the soft, spongy skin (which later becomes the dried, brown covering of the shelled almond), is of a delicacy unrelated to that of the matured nut.</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve the almonds whole with the cherries and leave your guests to do the work. It is a fine marriage.</p>

  <p class="indent">When peeled and macerated in the freshly pressed juice of not-quite-ripe white grapes (<em>verjus</em>), and sprinkled with salt and chopped chervil, fresh almonds or fresh hazelnuts may be transformed into a delicious, light and refreshing hors d’oeuvre.</p>
