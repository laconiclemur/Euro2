<h2 class="h2b">CAILLETTES DU VAR</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Liver and Bacon Sausages</em></h3>
<p class="normall0">Caillettes <em>are specific to the Var, our</em> département, <em>and are found in most butchers and</em> traiteurs. <em>They also feature as a starter in many of the restaurants. Sometimes pork sweetbreads are used as well, although as these are very hard to get hold of, I have omitted them. A little nutmeg can be added which you may enjoy, or a good dash of eau-de-vie or</em> marc. <em>Be sure to roll the</em> caillettes <em>in their lovely cooking juices as they cool. The flavour is part roast and part bacon – you won’t be able to resist licking your fingers afterwards</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6–8</span><br/>
1 large piece caul fat, about 200g (7oz)<br/>
400g (14oz) pork liver<br/>
400g (14oz) streaky bacon<br/>
100g (3½ oz) back fat<br/>
1 bunch fresh parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced<br/>
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
5 sprigs dried thyme or savory, finely crumbled<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
3 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 170°C/340°F/Gas 3–4.</p>
<p class="normala">Rinse the caul fat under plenty of cold running water. Cut the liver into four long strips. Remove the outer skin from the streaky bacon and cut this into strips the same size. Cut the back fat into four thinner strips. Mix all of this with the parsley, garlic and savory. Season well.</p>
<p class="normala">Lay the caul fat out on a tea towel and dry it well. Build up the meats on top of it, alternating the liver, bacon and back fat. Roll them up into a long sausage as tightly as you can inside the caul fat and trim off any excess. Tie it as you would a roast loin of pork.</p>
<p class="normala">Rub the outside with salt and pepper then place the roll in a dish that just holds it. Pour over the oil and roast in the preheated oven, basting occasionally for 45 minutes. Leave it to cool in its juices and keep it in the fridge for at least a day before serving.</p>
