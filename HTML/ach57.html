<p class="author1"><span class="txit">salsa pomodoro di gianni</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">One might think that all tomato sauces are basically alike, but slight variations can make a big difference in texture and flavor. This recipe makes a slightly chunky tomato sauce. If you like a smoother consistency, cool the sauce and pass it through a food mill, process it with an electric mixer, or pulse it in a blender. I prefer to use fresh peeled and chopped plum tomatoes or ripe summer heirloom tomatoes from the farmer’s market rather than canned tomatoes. When tomatoes are in season, prepare a double batch and freeze the sauce in several small airtight containers for up to six months.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup diced onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 large fresh basil leaves, cut into long thin strips</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Place the butter and olive oil in a medium-size saucepan set over medium-high heat. When the butter begins to foam, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until they have softened but not browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand or the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Add half the basil and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until most of the water has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Just before serving, stir in the remaining basil. Briskly whisk the sauce to create a chunky puree.</p>
