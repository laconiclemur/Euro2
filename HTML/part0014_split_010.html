  <h3 class="h3a">Springtime wheat and ricotta pie</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">It is believed that this dessert dates back to pagan times, when ancient Neapolitans in springtime offered all the fruits of their land to the mermaid Partenope: eggs for fertility, wheat from the land, ricotta from the shepherds, the aroma of orange flowers, vanilla to symbolize faraway countries and sugar in honour of the sweet mermaid. It is said the mermaid took all these ingredients, immersed herself in the sea of the Bay of Naples and gave back to the Neapolitans a dessert that symbolized fertility and rebirth. The recipe as we know it today was first made in Neapolitan convents; the nuns would make it for the local nobility. Today in the region of Campania, Easter would not be the same without this traditional dessert. It is found in pastry shops all over the region and also made at home, usually in large quantities, to be given away as gifts to family and friends. The pre-cooked wheat is sold in jars in good Italian delis. Alternatively, you can make it with pearl barley, cooked according to the instructions on the packet. The pies can be made a few days in advance and stored in the fridge until required.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Makes 2 x 18cm/7-inch round pies;</p>

  <p class="ing">about 8 servings</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the pastry</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/2 cups plain (all-purpose) flour, plus extra to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/7 tbsp cold butter, cut into small pieces</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/½ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest of 1 orange</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing1">a little milk, to brush</p>

  <p class="ing">a little icing (confectioners’) sugar, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the filling</p>

  <p class="ing1">350g/12oz pre-cooked wheat or cooked pearl barley</p>

  <p class="ing1">150ml/5fl oz/⅔ cup full-fat milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">20g/¾oz/1½ tbsp butter</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of ground cinnamon</p>

  <p class="ing1">350g/12oz/1½ cups ricotta</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/1¼ cups caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest of 1 orange</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp orange-flower water</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the crema pasticciera</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">¼ vanilla pod</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz/scant ½ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing2">20g/¾oz/2½ tbsp cornflour (cornstarch)</p>

  <p class="para">First make the pastry. Sift the flour into a large bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and orange zest, add the egg yolks and mix to form a smooth dough. Form into a ball, wrap in clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge for at least 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the filling, put the wheat, milk, butter and cinnamon in a small saucepan on a low heat and bring to the boil, stirring all the time, until the wheat has absorbed all the milk and the mixture is creamy. Leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the crema pasticciera, put the milk in a small saucepan together with the vanilla pod and place on a medium–low heat until the milk reaches boiling point. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, add the cornflour and whisk until smooth. When the milk reaches boiling point, remove from the heat, discard the vanilla pod and gradually pour the milk into the egg mixture, whisking all the time to prevent lumps from forming. Once well combined, pour the mixture back into the saucepan on a medium heat and stir with a wooden spoon. As soon as it begins to boil, remove from the heat immediately and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para"><a id="page_163" class="calibre1"></a>Take the wheat mixture and whisk in the ricotta, vanilla seeds, sugar, orange zest and orange-flower water; gradually mix in the eggs and yolks. Add the crema pasticciera and combine well together. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para">Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and line 2 x 18cm/7-inch diameter round loose-bottomed pie dishes or shallow cake tins, reserving the trimmings. Pour in the wheat and ricotta mixture. Roll out the pastry trimmings and cut out long strips about 2cm/¾ inch wide; arrange these criss-cross over the pies. Brush a little milk over the strips, then bake for 50 minutes, until golden brown.</p>

  <p class="para1">Switch the oven off and leave the pies to set in the warm oven for about an hour. Remove and leave to cool completely. Sift over some icing sugar before serving.</p>
