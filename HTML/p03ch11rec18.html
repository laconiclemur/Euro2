<p class="summary"><span class="bi">In a primitive kitchen off his studio and art gallery outside Madrid, the</span> painter, sculptor, and typographer José Luis Alexanco cooked us <span class="italic">gachas</span> and other foods of the rural poor of La Mancha. Then, feeling happy and satisfied, we went on a tour of his huge white gallery to see his stunning artwork. <span class="italic">Gachas</span> is a gruel or porridge made with finely ground flour from the legume <span class="italic">almorta</span> (<span class="italic">Lathyrus sativus,</span> or grass pea), which was both fodder for animals and eaten by shepherds and peasants. The reliance on and excessive consumption of it during the civil war and the period after was blamed for a neurological disease that caused weakness or paralysis of the legs. But what was once referred to as <span class="italic">gachas de los años dificiles</span> (<span class="italic">gachas</span> of the tough years) is now popular, served with vegetables or with pork products such as bacon, chorizo, <span class="italic">salchichón,</span> or <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (blood sausage).</p>
<p class="summary">José Luis fried lots of garlic with mushrooms and asparagus tips in plenty of olive oil. He removed them and poured in the <span class="italic">gachas,</span> stirring until the flour acquired a light golden color. Then he gradually added water, stirring all the while. As he stirred the bubbling porridge, he talked about the lives of the peasants of La Mancha, of those who had to give more than half their produce to their landlords and those who waited every day in the village square to be picked for odd jobs; of the women who dyed all their clothes black when somebody in the family died and never again wore anything else. His maternal grandmother kept a goat for milk and cheese, and chickens for their eggs, and she dried her own tomatoes. In the winter, she cooked <span class="italic">gachas</span> and <span class="italic">caparrones</span> (mottled brown and white beans) in the fireplace over a wood fire. His paternal grandfather was the butcher in Ojacastro in La Rioja. His pigs tasted better than the pork you get today because they were fed differently. (He only slaughtered during the full moon, and in his sausages he never mixed the meats of male and female swine.)</p>
<p class="summary">In other regions, chickpea flour, wheat flour, and cornmeal (polenta) are used to make <span class="italic">gachas</span> in a variety of ways, sometimes with fried onion and croutons; sometimes with tomatoes and snails or with salt cod. In Andalusia, it is made with wheat flour and colored and flavored with <span class="italic">pimentón</span> and saffron. In Murcia, they season it with caraway and cloves. In the Canary Islands, they make it with a mix of corn and wheat flours and call it <span class="italic">gofio.</span> Sweet <span class="italic">gachas</span> are made with milk and sometimes flavored with grated orange zest and cinnamon or with vanilla. Honey, raisins, and almonds can be sprinkled on. In Asturias, Galicia, and Aragon, <span class="italic">gachas</span> is made with cornmeal and is also called by the local names <span class="italic">fariñes</span> and <span class="italic">farinetas.</span> Grass pea flour is not easy to find outside La Mancha.</p>
