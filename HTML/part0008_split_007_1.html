  <p class="chap-para">Hare meat is rich and dark like beef or venison. If you are a hunter yourself, you know how rare it is to catch a hare, but if you do get the chance or can buy hare from a good butcher, then I urge you to try this dish. The recipe was created by one of my chefs, Davide Bargione, who, like me, loves hare. The sauce can be made in advance and reheated.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 6</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 hare, cut into 12 pieces</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz fresh or dried pappardelle</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated Parmesan, to serve (optional)</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">150ml/5fl oz/⅔ cup white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic head, cloves separated and crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 cinnamon sticks</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">20 black peppercorns, lightly crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">juice of 1 lemon</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large celery stalks, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 onions, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the sauce</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 celery stalks, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">bouquet garni of thyme, bay leaf, rosemary and parsley</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp tomato purée (paste)</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">1.2kg/2lb 10oz (3 x 400g/14oz cans)</p>

  <p class="ing1">canned chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing2">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups hot <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="para">Wash the hare thoroughly under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen paper. Put the hare in a large bowl together with the rest of the marinade ingredients, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge for at least 12 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the hare from the marinade, pat dry and season with salt and pepper. To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and brown the hare all over. Remove the meat and set aside. In the same pan, sweat the onion, celery, carrot and bouquet garni together with the vegetables, garlic and herbs from the marinade for about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato purée, add the wine and allow to evaporate. Return the hare to the pan, add the tomatoes, stock, some salt and pepper, and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook gently for 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="para">At the end of the cooking time, remove the chunks of meat and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard the bones, chop the meat finely and return to the sauce and heat through.</p>

  <p class="para1">Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the pappardelle until al dente. Drain, mix with the hare sauce and serve immediately, with a little grated Parmesan if desired.</p>
