 FRESH JAM DOUGHNUTS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0001327">
<em>Doughnuts! Not the shop-bought kind, but fresh ones, made at home. This is one of those recipes where you have to remember that all good things take time and patience. It’s worth it for the warm, sugary mouthfuls and the sweet smell in the air. I’d never thought about making them myself until a few years ago when my mum came round and I wanted to impress her with something other than a Victoria sponge. She’s a hard woman to impress but she ate more than one of these, which was compliment enough. My kids devoured the rest – I can always count on them to make me feel better.</em>

<p class="method1" id="nad0001339">
<span class="pink">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Place the flour in a mixing bowl, with the sugar and yeast on one side and the salt on the other. Mix to combine.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001340">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the egg, warm milk and butter into a jug. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid. If using a stand mixer, attach a dough hook and mix until a dough is formed. If doing it by hand, first bring together using a spatula or the end of a spoon, then get your hands in and combine to make a dough.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001341">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 If you are using a stand mixer, now knead the dough for 5 minutes on high speed. If by hand, grease the work surface and knead for 10 minutes. You will know the dough is ready when it is smooth, shiny and elastic.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001342">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Grease the inside of a bowl, put the dough in, and cover with cling film. Put in a warm place and leave to double in size. This can take about an hour, sometimes more, sometimes less – it really does depend on the warmth of the room.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001343">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Once doubled in size, take the dough out and knead for a minute to knock out all the air. Divide into 12 equal pieces and shape into rounds. Place on a greased baking tray and cover with a piece of oiled cling film. Leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour till the dough springs back when you prod with your finger.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001344">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the oil into a pan and heat to 190°C. The oil is hot enough when you drop in a piece of bread and it rises to the top, sizzling.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001345">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Fry a few doughnuts at a time – don’t overcrowd the pan. Cook for 3 minutes on each side, moving them around gently in the oil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001346">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Drain on kitchen paper, then, while they’re still warm, toss them around in the vanilla sugar. Use a knife to make a small hole in the side into the centre of each one. Carefully pipe in the jam, being careful not to overfill.</p>
