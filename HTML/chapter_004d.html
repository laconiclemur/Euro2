The centre should be just cooked and creamy, and the outside not too coloured</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Mushroom omelettes are revered in season all over Provence. Girolles make the most elegant filling, and ceps the heartiest.

One autumn morning in St Tropez I was picking through a box of girolles, as was a local woman. We chatted about what we were going to do.

<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 1</span><br/>
3 very fresh eggs<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Large knob of butter<br/>
Good handful, about 50–70g (1¾ –2½ oz) girolles, trimmed and quickly washed<br/>
Few sprigs of parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Using a fork, mix the eggs well with some salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat a little frying pan with half the butter and sauté the girolles for a couple of minutes. Add the parsley, transfer to a small plate and keep warm.</p>
<p class="normala">Melt the remaining butter in the same pan and add the eggs. Stir well, pulling the mixture from top to bottom and side to side. When the mixture is too firm to stir any more and set around the edges, spoon in the girolles. Fold the omelette and turn it on to a warm plate. Eat immediately.</p>
