<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">There is no better way to harness the briny flavors of a whole fish, or to keep the meat moist and juicy, than to cook it packed in a salt crust. It is important to use a thick-skinned fish, so that the saltiness can’t penetrate. The favorite choice for this is dorada, a tin-colored gilt-head bream with a distinguishing gold spot on the cheek and a crescent-shaped mark above the eye. (<em>Dorada</em> means “golden.”) Once you crack the salt shell open, work quickly to keep the juices of the fish from dissolving the salt and making the dish too salty. <em>Dorada a la sal</em> is a specialty of Murcia and Alicante.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TWO 1-POUND/455-G OR THREE 10-OUNCE/280-G WHOLE SEA BREAM WITH HEAD AND TAIL, OR GROUPER, RED SNAPPER, ROCKFISH, OR ANOTHER NON-OILY WHITE FISH</li>
<li>4½&gt; POUNDS/2 KG KOSHER SALT</li>
<li>3 EGG WHITES</li>
<li>ALLIOLI <a href="239-chapter175.html#page_337">(PAGE 337)</a> OR HOMEMADE MAYONNAISE <a href="239-chapter175.html#page_337">(PAGE 337)</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Trim the fish’s gills and pull out the intestines through the gills (or ask your fishmonger to do it). If the fish has already been cleaned, tuck a small piece of aluminum foil around the outside of the belly to keep salt from entering the cavity. Leave on the head and tail. Do not wash; just gently wipe with a damp cloth.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large bowl, mix the salt with the egg whites until the salt feels slightly damp.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> On a rimmed baking sheet or large roasting pan that can comfortably fit the fish, lay down a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil (for easier cleanup). Spread about one-fourth of the salt in a layer approximately ½&gt; inch/1.25 cm thick across the bottom; pat down. Lay the fish on top, keeping them at least a generous finger’s width apart. Cover completely with the remaining salt in an even ½&gt;-inch-/1.25-cm-thick layer, patting it down around the fish. Be sure the fish are thoroughly and evenly covered.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Gently—without shifting the packed salt—place the fish in the oven. Bake until the fish are just done and the salt forms a hard, lightly browned shell, 10 to 15 minutes. (Calculate about 15 minutes per 1 pound/455 g of whole fish.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Have a large bowl ready for the salt crust. Using a wooden mallet or hammer, carefully break open the salt shell by tapping gently. Pull off the larger chunks of salt. Using a pastry brush, brush away any salt grains from the fish. Lift out the fish; brush away any salt from the skin. Working quickly on a clean surface, remove the skin and bones and transfer the fillets to a clean platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Serve immediately with the allioli on the side.</p>
