<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">British and Irish wine merchants began setting up business in fortified wines around Jerez de la Frontera in the province of Cádiz in the late eighteenth century. Their names are still on sherry labels. A Spanish version of English bread pudding is still part of the traditional cooking repertoire of an Andalusian elite. The pudding can be served hot or cold, and with or without a crisp caramel topping. Do also try the Ibizan pudding in the variation. It too is quick and easy and delightful comfort food.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">Eight ½-inch-thick slices white bread, brioche, or challah, crusts removed (about 3½ inches square)</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ to ½ cup golden raisins</p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup blanched whole almonds, coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">4 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons superfine sugar, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons for the optional topping</p>
<p class="qun">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups heavy cream</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ cup Pedro Ximénez sherry or sweet Málaga wine</p>
<p class="recsum">Butter a baking dish that will hold the bread in two layers. Arrange the slices in the dish, cutting to fit if necessary, and sprinkle the raisins and almonds between the layers.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Beat the eggs lightly with the 5 tablespoons sugar and lemon zest in a bowl, then beat in the milk, cream, and sweet wine, and pour over the bread. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 40 minutes, until golden and risen and lightly set. Serve hot or chilled. If you like, just before serving, sprinkle the top of the chilled pudding evenly with the optional sugar and caramelize with a mini blowtorch.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Greixonera de Ibiza,</span> a pudding made with leftover <span class="italic">ensaimadas,</span> a specialty of the Balearic Islands made with a kind of puff pastry with lard (croissants are a perfect substitute), is served in all the restaurants on the island of Ibiza. <span class="italic">Greixonera</span> is the local name for the clay dish in which it is baked and served. Tear 4 small croissants (mine weighed 6 ounces) into pieces, and spread them in a round buttered baking dish, about 10 inches in diameter. Bring 2¼ cups milk and ¾ cup sugar to a boil in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Lightly beat 4 large eggs in a bowl with a fork, add the grated zest of ½ lemon, and lightly beat in the milk. Pour over the croissants and bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 30 minutes, or until set. This is good hot or at room temperature, dusted with cinnamon.</p>
