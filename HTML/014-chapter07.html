<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">I</span></span><span class="italic">t is often said that Italy’s second courses are more austere than her first dishes. Not in Emilia-Romagna. Yes, second courses are often simple affairs of grilled or roasted meats, poultry, or fish. But “austere” hardly does justice to their deep brown flavors or the bold tastes imparted by fresh herbs and bastings of wine. The region’s stews and sautés are even more bountiful, with their multi-step cooking technique creating complex layerings of tastes. Emilia-Romagna is the land of plenty, and her second courses are as much a testament to her heritage of good eating and consummate cooking skills as is the rest of her regional menu</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">But the second course of decades ago had a very different meaning than it does today. Until post—World War II prosperity made meat available to almost everyone, the second course was the economic dividing line between the peasant and the middle class. Before World War II most of the recipes in this section were the dishes of the prosperous. To have meat was to have status. For the farm laborer and city factory worker, dishes like January Pork, Lamb with Black Olives, or Maria Bertuzzi’s Lemon Chicken meant holidays, harvest parties, or special family celebrations. The staples of the peasant diet were the foods of first courses: polenta, beans, vegetables, soups, rice and pasta, and of <a id="page252"/>course bread. For day-to-day eating, especially in the late 19th century and later, small amounts of meat fed many by becoming ragùs for pasta. Before that, even ragùs were regularly eaten only by the more prosperous</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Each area of Emilia-Romagna has its specialties, whether they are relegated to occasional feasts or eaten every day</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Veal is used more than beef throughout the region. Along the coast, seafoods are eaten—usually simply grilled, fried, or stewed</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Especially in Romagna, chops of veal, pork, and lamb are rubbed with olive oil and herbs and grilled over a wood fire. One of Romagna’s most favored meats is the neutered young ram <span class="underline">(castrato).</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Rabbit is eaten everywhere, but Reggio’s rabbit gained a particularly fine reputation decades ago. And Modena would not dream of letting a holiday go by without its stuffed pig’s foot sausage, <span class="underline">zampone.</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">For the entire region, Christmas means capon, either poached so its broth can welcome tortellini or cappelletti, or roasted with its skin burnished to edible gold</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Guinea hen, pigeon, and quail are always available, but autumn and winter bring game from the mountains and the plain—especially pheasant, hare, wild duck, partridge, and wild boar. Early summer is marked with signs at snack stands and restaurants offering frogs</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Chicken is perhaps the most popular meat of all, easy to raise almost anywhere</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Emilia-Romagna’s pork defines succulence, but traditionally almost every part of the pig went for curing. When the pig met its demise, whole families spent days preserving it for a year’s sustenance. On those evenings they feasted on fresh pork ribs and loin, the rare treats of winter</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Re-creating an Italian meal in the United States is a matter of subtly adjusting the menu’s balance. America’s main course is often merely Italy’s second dish—another element on the menu, not a dish the entire meal revolves around. In Italy second dishes frequently hold equal weight with first courses. And no matter how many pastas, risottos, or soups begin a meal, or how substantial they may seem, they are always considered first courses</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When first courses are intricate or plentiful, second dishes are simple, like grilled or roasted meats or fish. More elaborate second dishes, such as Rabbit Dukes of Modena or Zampone of the Aristocrats, demand <a id="page253"/>center stage. The dishes that precede them should be direct and uncomplicated, not distracting from the grandeur of what is to come</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The “Menu Suggestions” section of each recipe gives guidelines for serving these dishes as they are eaten in Italy, as well as ideas for weaving them into lifestyles on this side of the Atlantic. For instance, in Parma, Erminia’s Pan-Crisped Chicken is eaten hot at the table with a knife and fork. But in America I enjoy it also as cold finger food on summer picnics. For those of us who cannot spend hours cooking just before a dinner party, there is the blessing of dishes that are better for being made ahead, like Mardi Gras Chicken, Rabbit Dukes of Modena, and Beef-Wrapped Sausage. Notice, too, that most of the recipes are prepared in stages, so the cooking can be adjusted to individual schedules</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Many of these dishes are about celebration and about firsts. In Emilia-Romagna they mark the birth of a new baby, the summer’s first harvests of wheat and hay, the rigging of a new boat, a marriage, or the beginning of spring and rebirth. Herald the coming of spring with Mardi Gras Chicken. Feast on the first peppers from the garden with Riccardo Rimondi’s Chicken Cacciatora. Enjoy the first summer cookout with Herbed Seafood Grill or Grilled Beef with Balsamic Glaze. Celebrate a first Sunday with the entire family with Balsamic Roast Chicken. Mark the first snowfall with the homey comfort of Braised Pork Ribs with Polenta. Share a first Christmas together with Christmas Capon instead of goose, roast beef, or turkey. See in the New Year with Modena’s zampone sausage and lentils, knowing the Modenese believe the lentils will bring a year of prosperity</span>.</p>

Often those “restaurants” are no more than outdoor grills covered with canvas awnings set up on the beach. But the fish is always fresh, and always cooked over a wood fire. Do not let the lack of outdoor facilities stop you from making this simple dish. Cook it in winter and summer—over charcoal, on a stove-top griddle, and even in a sauté pan. Any firm-fleshed fish works in this recipe, from Spanish mackerel to bluefish, members of the bass family, triggerfish, sea trout, tilefish, swordfish, tuna, and a score of others. The most important ingredient in the fish is freshness. This recipe doubles easily</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Sautéing the Tuna:</span> Have a serving platter warming in a low oven. Heat the olive oil in a heavy 12-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the fish steaks in a single layer, sprinkling the onion and parsley over and around them. Sear the fish about 1 minute per side, so the flesh whitens and tightens. Slip a metal or wood spatula under the pieces to turn them without tearing. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Scatter the garlic, basil, and 3 tablespoons of the white wine around the fish. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Keep the fish uncovered as you cook it 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until still soft enough to have just a little “give” when pressed. If in doubt, slit into the center of a piece, checking that the meat is opaque but not dry or flaking.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Slip the steaks onto the heated serving platter. Turn the heat up to high, and add the remaining wine.

</div>

Since wide selections of Italian olives are sometimes hard to find, do not hesitate to try olives from Greece, France, and other countries. The best oil-cured ones are tasty and rich without overwhelming saltiness. Better to use a good brine-cured black or green olive than a mediocre oil-cured one. The olive’s nationality is far less important than its taste.</p>

Add the onions, turn the heat to low, and partially cover the pot. Cook 15 minutes, or until the onions are soft and almost transparent. Stir occasionally. If the liquid threatens to evaporate totally, add about ¼ cup water. Once the onions are soft and rosy colored, uncover the pot and let the vinegar bubble gently, stirring frequently, until it evaporates.

If you are using squid or cuttlefish, cook it at a very gentle bubble about 20 minutes, or until tender, before adding the remaining seafood. Layer the firm-fleshed fish in the pot, topping it with the thinner, flakier fillets. Scatter the shrimps and clams on top of the fish. Using the back of a wooden spatula, gently press the fish into the sauce. Bring the liquid to a slow bubble. Cover, and cook 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickest pieces are firm and opaque to their centers. Ladle the <span class="italic">Brodetto</span> into the heated soup plates or tureen, and serve.</p>

The argument over what kind of seafood should go into the stew is not settled easily. Fish with pervading sweetness or hinting at lavishness are banned from <span class="italic">Brodetto</span>. This is fishermen’s food, not a dish for the rich. Some make <span class="italic">Brodetto</span> with eel; others feel eel ruins the dish.

At that time, supplies were meager when Romagna’s fishermen went to sea, usually for seven and eight days at a time in small boats powered only by sail. A liter of olive oil, a small barrel of wine, and maybe some tomatoes had to last a week. Quondamatteo says that this was the foundation of <span class="italic">Brodetto:</span> seawater supplied the broth and the salt, and the unsalable fish they caught made the <span class="italic">Brodetto</span> a stew. It is still a part of traditions that have not changed in small coastal towns where men still mend nets at dockside and women still cook <span class="italic">Brodetto</span>.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">The Comacchio</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The area where the Po River meets the Adriatic in Ferrara province is a vast and mysterious place called the Comacchio. It is the stillest place in all of Emilia-Romagna, with lagoons like sheets of glass. Villages of only a few houses cluster at intersections of long, straight roads. Stubs of ruins jutting up from mounds of sea grass mark the site of ancient Spina, the first Greek settlement along the Po River. The Ferrarese view the people of the Comacchio as a breed apart—reticent loners, a people of another world and time. The eels that are their livelihood came with the Romans, who designed the underwater traps that still secure the fish each year, when they migrate into the lagoons from their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea. Today the seafood is shipped throughout Italy. The Comacchio, naturally, boasts a multitude of local eel dishes. One favorite is simply to rub pieces of eel with olive oil and grill them over a wood fire. Another is this braising, a choice for spring and early summer.</p>

</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Seasoning the Chicken:</span> Rinse the chicken. Cut it into eight pieces, halving each side of the breast and eliminating the wings and backbone. Pat the pieces dry. Use a food processor or mortar and pestle to blend the rosemary, garlic, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice into a paste, and rub it over the chicken. Set the pieces on a platter, cover lightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 18 to 24 hours.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">First Cooking:</span> The secret of the chicken’s succulence lies in taking care not to overcook it. Follow the timing for the two-step cooking carefully, and you will have no difficulties. Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat. Slip in the chicken pieces, skin side down. Reduce the heat to medium and cook 1 minute to lightly sear them. Then turn the pieces to coat them with the oil. Arrange the pieces in the center of the pan. Set a 9-inch cake pan on top of the chicken, and weight it with several heavy cans.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cook the weighted chicken, turning over the breast pieces after 8 minutes and the leg and thigh pieces after 10 minutes (put the weighted pan back on the chicken <a id="page271"/>after each turning). Sprinkle the chicken with the additional 1 tablespoon lemon juice after turning the legs and thighs. Cook the breast pieces another 8 minutes and remove. Cook the leg and thigh pieces 10 minutes. Then crisp the chicken to a rich dark brown by reducing the heat to medium-low and arranging all the pieces back in the pan, skin side up. Cook under the weighted pan for another 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon or tongs, immediately remove the pieces to a platter. Let the chicken cool about 10 minutes, and then lightly cover with plastic wrap or foil. Pour away all the fat and replace the sauté pan over high heat. Swirl in the water, and take about 3 minutes to boil it down by half while scraping up the brown bits with a wooden spatula. Turn the pan juices into a small bowl, and put it in the freezer for 2 hours. Then lift off the hardened fat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Second Cooking and Serving:</span> Have a serving dish warming in a low oven. Film the bottom of a sauté pan with a little olive oil. Have the heat at medium when you slip in the chicken pieces, skin side down. Top with the cake pan and weights, and warm 5 minutes. Set aside the weighted pan. Turn the chicken pieces, moistening each piece with the reserved pan juices, and lightly cover with aluminum foil. Heat another 5 to 8 minutes. Pile the chicken pieces on the platter, and garnish with rosemary sprigs if desired (at Il Vecchio Molinetto there is no garnish). Serve hot or at room temperature.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">II Vecchio Molinetto (The Old Mill) is an institution in Parma, typical of the simple <span class="italic">trattorie</span> and restaurants found throughout Emilia-Romagna and much of Italy. It shares the sense of timelessness found in most of these places. Its decor is unpretentious, and unchanged since it opened in 1954. Workingmen, businesspeople, and families dine here year after year on the Parma cuisine they have known since childhood. Whereas Americans often dine out on foods they do not cook at home, Italians most often dine out on the foods that mean home to them. Il Vecchio Molinetto serves the food of Parma’s mothers and grandmothers. The pasta is always handmade, the local wines are straightforward, the cured pork comes from nearby farms, and the seasons dictate the menu.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">These <span class="italic">trattorie</span> are usually the domains of women, and The Old Mill is no exception. Cook/owner Erminia Marasi may be shy and self-effacing, but she stubbornly holds the line in her kitchen, giving not an inch toward trend or fashion. Erminia’s partner and sister-in-law, Anna Bertolazzi, is more than the Molinetto’s waitress. She rules the dining room like a benevolent dictator. Regulars love her one-eyebrow-raised humor, her mothering, the reprimands when she feels you have ordered unwisely, and her approval of a new girlfriend or a new hairdo. The <span class="italic">vecchi molinetti</span> of Italy are not restaurants as we usually think of them. They are not removed from home life—they are an extension of it. Weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays are celebrated here. Everyone knows everyone by name. This is like a second living room for many Parmesans.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Use less oil in browning chicken, since it throws off so much fat of its own.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Give chicken fuller flavor before cooking by rubbing it with a blend of minced garlic, fresh rosemary, and a little salt. Lightly cover the meat and refrigerate it overnight. (Across the Po plain from Ferrara, in Modena, the blend is called <span class="italic">aglione</span>.) When a recipe or personal preference calls for other herbs, substitute them for the rosemary.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/bull.jpg"/> Leave the herb blend on chickens to be roasted if they are basted with some form of liquid. The addition of a little liquid keeps the blend from burning.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Protect the herb blend from burning and turning bitter by scraping it off chickens destined for pan-browning. Reserve the mixture and add it to the dish after browning is completed.</p>

This is not as great a sacrifice as it may sound. The aged chicken can be tough and dry, but it is inevitably full of good flavor. Braising it with local wild mushrooms and a handful of olives is one of the many ways to begin the feasting of this boisterous holiday.

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The little town of Spilamberto, near Modena, is home to the oldest of Modena and Reggio’s three balsamic vinegar consortiums. The Consorteria dell’Aceto Balsamico is the spiritual mother to Modena and Reggio’s organizations. Every year the Consorteria evaluates over a thousand of members’ vinegars until one is singled out. On June 24, the festival of Saint John the Baptist, the highest honor a balsamic vinegar artisan can receive is awarded in Spilamberto. Before visiting a Spilamberto tasting, I dined with three men whose families had been making the vinegar for generations. As plates of vegetable fritters arrived, one of my hosts took a small silver flask bearing his family crest from his pocket. Removing the medicine-dropper top, he offered some of his private <span class="italic">balsamico</span> for my pleasure. With only a few drops of the brown liquid, that simple fritter became unforgettable. With each new course I waited in silent but eager anticipation, hoping he would again offer the special condiment. I was not disappointed. The final pleasure was droplets of the vinegar over small crocks of caramelized baked custard.</p>

Her kitchen was in a corner of the 18th-century hay barn, now converted into the Villa’s simple dining rooms. A few electric lights and a gas stove were the only additions to that kitchen in 200 years. Giovanna seemed to like it that way. As she cooked, her timidness fell away, but her eyes were always sad. I do not know what troubles kept that wounded look there. But if that was her dark side, her food was the light. It transcended a mere “good meal,” often touching the heart. One night, tortellini from Giovanna’s kitchen brought me to tears, rekindling an overwhelming sense of oneness with my own Italian heritage. And this rabbit, eaten on a bright Sunday afternoon when the hay barn was full of noisy families out for a spring jaunt, hushed my boisterousness for a moment.

Like so many court dishes of those times, the rabbit is flavored in several stages, creating superb depth of taste. But its final seasoning is its most important: balsamic vinegar is spooned over the cooked rabbit.

Save any meat scraps for ragù sauces or the stockpot.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Using a meat pounder, pound the meat to half its original thickness, about ½ inch thick. Take care not to pull it away from the bone.

Then dip them in the crumbs, shaking off any excess. Slip the chops into the pan, making sure they do not overlap. Cook 2 to 2½ minutes on one side, or until a rich golden brown. Do not cook to dark brown, or the chops may dry out. Turn and cook to golden brown on the second side, about 2 minutes.

If cut with the grain, the scallops will shrink in cooking. To cut them yourself, slice the veal across the grain into ¼- to ½-inch-thick pieces.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Scallops:</span> Warm a serving platter in a low oven. Spread the flour on another platter for dredging the meat. Heat the oil and butter in a 12-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat. Decide how many scallops will fit in the pan without touching. Dip those in the flour, dusting off any excess. Quickly brown the meat, taking only 20 to 30 seconds per side. Using a wooden spatula, transfer the scallops <a id="page297"/>to the platter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Keep warm in the oven. Sauté the rest of the veal in batches, flouring the pieces just before they go into the pan. If necessary, add a little more oil to the pan. Keep the heat low enough so as not to burn the particles. Hold the meat in the warm oven.</p>

Sprinkle with the remaining commercial balsamic, or with all of the artisan-made balsamic if that is what you’re using, and the shredded basil. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The people of Romagna (<span class="italic">Romagnoli</span> in Italian), have a reputation for obstinacy and independence, for a keen critical eye and for openhearted hospitality. Their own poets call them arrogant and passionate, sloppy and kind, majestic and loving a practical joke. Writer Candido Bonvicini says, “Their dialect is wrought with roses, but teems with scorpions.” And yet, doors are always open to passersby. Several of my Emilian friends say the people of Emilia will greet you with honest pleasure and warmth, and treat you well. But once you are gone, they will not think about you again. When you return, they will sincerely delight in having you back. A Romagnolo friend says <span class="italic">all</span> that is true of the people of Romagna, with one important difference. He says, “We will worry and wonder why you have not returned.”</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In Romagna, food is often more immediate, and flavors more primal than in Emilia. It has been said Romagnoli eat Homerian meals of food straight from the earth and the fire, washing them down with strong wine. Their wine is the red Sangiovese
. Some say the Sangiovese stains the throat, labeling forever those who love it. It is part of their identity. The wine can be rough and aggressive. It can also be soft and velvety, almost seductive. Sangiovese always warms. Even at its most elegant, and it can achieve elegance, there is earthiness and vigor. White Albana is the other side of Romagna’s nature. Even at its driest, this wine has a sweet nature; it is soft and winning. In its old sweet style, Albana is golden with scents of fruit trees in full blossom. The wine makers around Bertinoro say a glass of Albana and a May afternoon of watching spring come to Romagna’s plain is the heaven of the Romagnoli.</p>

Lightly cover, and refrigerate 16 to 24 hours.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Meat:</span> For fine flavor, use the hot embers of a hardwood fire (oak, ash, nut, and fruitwoods are typically Italian) or the more available charcoal grill fired with real wood charcoal. These cuts of beef are best kept rare to medium-rare.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Grilling over Charcoal:</span> Light the grill, using real wood charcoal if possible. As the coals burn to a coating of gray ash, set the meat on a platter at room temperature. Stir the 6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and 1½ tablespoons brown sugar into the marinade left in the bowl. When the coals are ready, spread them out and top with another thin layer of unlit charcoal. Set the grill in place, letting it heat about 5 minutes. Place the meat pieces toward the center of the grill. When one side has browned, spoon marinade over the pieces and turn them to get crusty brown on the other side. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Continue basting. Once the meat is well browned, adjust the vents to lower the heat and cover the grill. Cook 5 to 10 minutes for rare, or 15 to 20 minutes for medium-rare, basting two or three times. Rare meat is barely firm when pressed with a finger; medium-rare is blushed with pink and just firm.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Grilling over Hardwood Embers:</span> This is usually an open campfire. Have stones piled around the fire so a metal grill can be set about 6 inches above the red-hot embers. Brown the meat as directed above, adding a few small pieces of wood to the fire if it threatens to die. Instead of covering the charcoal grill to finish cooking the meat, tent a large piece of aluminum foil over the meat pieces to reflect heat back onto them. Cook, basting two or three times. Five minutes is all that is needed for rare meat, but do test it by pressing with your finger as described above. Six to 9 minutes produces medium-rare.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Transfer the meat from the grill to a heated platter, and cut it across the grain into diagonal ¼-inch-thick slices.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking and Serving:</span> Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan that will hold the meat snugly. Take about 35 minutes to brown the meat slowly over medium heat, until deep golden brown on three sides. Add the remaining onion and the bay leaf as you brown the last side. Remove the meat from the pan. Add the garlic and wine to the pan and bring to a gentle bubble. Scrape up the brown glaze from the bottom of the <a id="page315"/>pan. Keep the pan uncovered as you boil off three quarters of the wine, taking about 15 minutes. Then add the meat and stock, bringing them to a gentle bubble again. Partially cover the pan. Cook over low heat 2 hours, or until an instant-reading thermometer inserted into the center of the cotechino reads 170°F. (If you are cooking this ahead, cool the meat in the liquid. Refrigerate, and lift the hardened fat from the surface before reheating.) Have a serving platter warming in a low oven. When you are ready to serve, skim the fat from the sauce. Transfer the cotechino to a heated platter and keep warm. Concentrate the sauce’s flavors by boiling it, uncovered, 3 to 5 minutes, or until reduced by half. Once the sauce is reduced, return the meat to the pan. Bubble gently 20 minutes, covered, if the meat is cold. Warm only about 5 minutes if the meat is hot. Trim away the string, and cut into slices between ¼ and ½ inch thick. Overlap the slices on a heated platter, and moisten with the sauce. Pass the remaining sauce separately.</p>

Slices of the sausage are served over mashed potatoes or braised lentils. Their final seasoning is a drizzle of the best of balsamic vinegars. You could also serve the zampone and vinegar as Modenese aristocrats did years ago: with a <span class="underline">zabaione</span> custard, flavored with balsamic vinegar. According to Renato Bergonzini, “Old families exalted <span class="underline">zabaione</span> with spoonfuls of their best balsamic vinegars.

<div class="bibliography"><p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Method</span></span> <span class="bold">Working Ahead:</span> <span class="italic">The Modenese have a practical and easy way of preparing zampone ahead. The zampone is prepared early in the day, but undercooked by about 30 minutes. Still in its cooking water, the sausage is refrigerated or put outside in the winter cold. An hour and a half before serving, it is slowly brought to a bubble over medium heat. Then the temperature is lowered, and the sausage is poached in water that is barely quivering 15 to 20 minutes to heat it through. The potato purée (or braised lentils) can be made 24 hours ahead and refrigerated, covered, in a shallow baking dish. Reheat, covered with foil, 30 minutes in a 350°F oven. The</span> zabaione <span class="italic">custard must be made shortly before serving</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing the Zampone:</span> Plan on cooking the zampone between 18 and 20 minutes per pound for a 7- to 8-pound sausage, about 25 minutes per pound for 4 to 6 pounds. Rinse and dry the zampone. Using a needle, pierce the skin in about ten places. Wrap it tightly in cheesecloth or a kitchen towel, and secure it by tying it with cotton string at 1½-inch intervals down the length of the sausage.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Zampone:</span> Use a fish poacher long enough to hold the zampone or a stockpot tall enough to immerse the sausage. Fill the pot with water and bring it to a lively bubble. Slip in the zampone and adjust the heat so the water bubbles every 20 seconds or so. If the top of the sausage protrudes above the top of the pot, cover the pot with foil and seal it to the edges. Poach 18 to 25 minutes per pound (about 2 hours), or until an instant-reading thermometer inserted into the sausage’s center reads 160°F.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Potato Purée:</span> While the zampone is cooking (or a day ahead), boil the potatoes in a 6-quart pot, 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender. Peel them, and pass them through a food mill fitted with the fine blade into a large metal bowl. (Do not use a food processor, as it makes gummy mashed potatoes.) While the potatoes are still hot, blend in the butter and milk. Use enough milk to create a thick but creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper. If you will be serving the potatoes within an hour or so, keep them warm by setting the bowl over a pot of simmering water. Stir occasionally with a spatula. If preparing 24 hours ahead, butter a 2½-quart <a id="page317"/>baking dish. Spread the purée in the dish, cover with foil, and refrigerate. Reheat, covered, 30 minutes in a 350°F oven.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Zabaione:</span> Fill a 3-quart saucepan a third full with water. Bring it to a lively bubble over medium heat. In a large metal bowl, beat together the yolks and the sugar. (Use 2 tablespoons sugar for <span class="italic">tradizionale</span> vinegar, 3 tablespoons for commercial balsamic.) If you are using commercial vinegar, beat in half of it now. Set the bowl over the bubbling water, taking care that it does not touch the water. Whisk the custard 3 to 5 minutes. It should be foamy, but thick enough to leave a trail at the bottom of the bowl. Lift the bowl from the water, and beat in all the <span class="italic">tradizionale</span> vinegar or the remaining half of the commercial. Immediately turn the custard into a serving bowl, and serve warm.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Have a serving platter warming in a low oven. Remove the cooked zampone from the pot by hooking a large fork under the string and lifting the sausage to a cutting board. Carefully remove the string and cheesecloth. Slice half the zampone into ¼- to ½-inch-thick rounds. Spoon the hot potato purée onto the warm platter. Arrange the uncut portion of the sausage and the slices on the potatoes. If you are not serving the <span class="italic">zabaione</span>, drizzle the sausage with a few drops of balsamic vinegar, and serve hot. If you are serving the <span class="italic">zabaione</span>, omit the drops of balsamic. Pass the warm <span class="italic">zabaione</span> in a sauceboat. Only a spoonful of the custard is used on each serving. (Although the skin is vital to the sausage’s juiciness, many diners trim it away, concentrating on the meat stuffing.)</p>
<div class="bibliography">
<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span></span> <span class="bold">Wine:</span> In Modena, Lambrusco’s grapey acidity cuts the zampone’s richness and lightens its impact. From other parts of Italy, drink a red Freisa Secco or “La Monella” Braida di Giacomo Bologna from Piemonte, the Lombardia region’s lively and fizzy red Sangue di Giuda, or a young Valpolicella Classico from the Veneto.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> Before the zampone, offer nothing more than a cup of homemade broth with a few tiny pastas. Instead of the potatoes, zampone could be served with Lentils Modena Style. With either lentils or potatoes, serve Spiced Spinach with Almonds. A traditional dessert is Modena Crumbling Cake for dipping into sweet wine, or Home-Style Jam Cake.</p>

American-made ones range in size from 3 to 8 pounds, depending upon their producer. Check the size before ordering.
