<p class="noindent">Despite its central role in the culture, by itself Spanish bread may appear unremarkable. Plain, sturdy, and somewhat underseasoned, it comes alive when paired with other ingredients—especially the traditional garlic and olive oil. Topped with anything from a few coins of chorizo to seared <a id="page_159"/>foie gras or <em>angulas,</em> the astronomically expensive baby eels, bread forms the basis for countless canapés and tostadas (Spain’s bruschetta) so fundamental to any <em>tapeo.</em> Brushed with olive oil and perhaps smeared with frothy tomato pulp, <em>pan</em> is a breakfast mainstay, while the <em>bocadillo</em> (a sandwich roll) is the snack that fuels most Spanish days.</p>
<p class="indent">As for yesterday’s bread, it seems to find its way into half of Spain’s traditional dishes, from gazpacho and <em>sopa de ajo</em> to <em>torrijas</em> (Spanish french toast) and <em>migas,</em> the delicious fried crumbs found on so many tables in Andalusia and Extremadura. Cubed, fried, and pounded in a mortar with nuts and/or garlic, bread thickens stews and sauces, such as Catalonia’s <a id="page_160"/>famous <em>romesco.</em> For Spaniards, every last crumb counts.</p>
<p class="indent">In its more evolved version, bread becomes empanadas, rustic but elegant Galician pies, thick with fillings that ooze sautéed onions and peppers and, usually, seafood (the word is derived from <em>en pan,</em> or in bread). Or seductive <em>cocas</em> (think pizzas with a difference) that are sold in the bakeries of the Spanish Mediterranean, from Catalonia to the Balearics to Alicante.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter is somewhat of a tapas extension. Most of the recipes here function best as appetizers, snacks, cocktail nibbles, or light luncheon dishes. For your tapas bash, here are irresistible canapés from the best tapas bar in San Sebastián, where food-on-bread veers into haute cuisine territory. As for toast smeared with melted dark chocolate, drizzled with olive oil, and sprinkled with salt, it’s one of these recipes that should be labeled “dangerously addictive.”</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PINTXOS DE ANCHOAS Y PIMIENTOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s a recipe for one of my favorite canapés at Bar Bergara in San Sebastián (<a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_164">page 164</a>). This colorful, savory confection includes green and red bell peppers, as well as two kinds of anchovies, regular brown ones and vinegar-pickled white <em>boquerones.</em> Also featuring potatoes and eggs, the canapés are filling enough for a light mid-day meal. If you can’t find <em>boquerones,</em> use all brown anchovies; the canapés will still have plenty of color.</p>

<h3 class="h3r">BASQUE TRIPLE SEAFOOD CANAPES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PINTXOS DE CHATKA, SALMON, Y ANCHOAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Owners of Basque <em>pintxo</em> bars love constructing elaborate canapés, piling up various ingredients, especially seafood. One of the staples includes surimi—mock crab legs, known in the Basquelands as <em>chatka.</em> Mixed with mayo and a <a id="page_162"/>few piquant additions, surimi makes one of the favorite bases for canapés topped with smoky fish, in this case both salmon and anchovies. The result is a sensational predinner bite. If you want to be classy, substitute lump crab meat, though it isn’t as authentic.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 cup shredded surimi (mock crab legs) or lump crabmeat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced red onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3½ tablespoons mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann’s)</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">DAINTY BASQUE EGG AND HAM SANDWICHES</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TRIANGULITOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This recipe from Goiz Argi tapas bar in San Sebastián proves that the Basques can turn even something as simple as a toasted white bread sandwich into a visual treat. Filled with egg and ham salad and decorated with shredded lettuce, grated hard-cooked egg, and poached shrimp, these sandwich triangles look as frilly and festive as cakes. They are delicious, too. Serve them as a tapa, a luncheon sandwich, or for an afternoon tea party. You will need large toothpicks or seven-inch wooden skewers for holding the sandwiches together.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 large hard-cooked eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size ripe tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 ounces (3 to 4 slices) boiled ham, finely chopped</strong></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PINTXOS DE ANCHOAS EN REVUELTO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Among the most sought-after <em>pintxos</em> at Bar Bergara in San Sebastián are canapés topped with a <em>revuelto</em> (egg scramble; see <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_157">page 157</a>) of sweet piquillo peppers and anchovies. They’re so delicious that the regulars seem to inhale them by the half dozen. Though Patxi Bergara, the owner, makes his <em>pintxos</em> with fresh anchovies, substituting salted anchovies adds an interesting savory twist. Serve these for brunch and watch them vanish. The eggs are also delicious on their own.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), drained and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 or 9 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained and cut into 4 pieces each</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large, very fresh eggs, preferably organic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea), if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 slices (½ inch thick) crusty baguette</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 roasted green bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut into thin strips, or minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a medium-size nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the piquillo peppers and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add the anchovies and cook for another minute. Break the eggs into the skillet, leaving enough space between the eggs so the yolks don’t run together. As soon as the egg whites turn opaque, about 20 seconds, vigorously stir and scramble the eggs with a wooden spoon or spatula until they are barely set, <a id="page_165"/>but still look a little wet, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Do not let the eggs overcook; they will continue to set on their way to the table. Taste for seasoning, adding salt as necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Spoon the eggs onto the baguette slices. Decorate the canapés with green pepper strips, arranging them in a crisscross pattern, or sprinkle parsley over them. Serve warm. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 12 CANAPES</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">BAR BERGARA’S AMAZING CANAPES</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Bar Bergara in San Sebastián is the Tiffany of <em>pintxo</em> (tapas) bars—a place where the canapé died and went to heaven. Sporting frilly chive garlands, grated egg sprinkles, and Technicolor bell pepper confetti, Bergara’s bread-based <em>pintxos</em> preen atop their Villeroy &amp; Boch plates like Lilliputian wedding cakes. I try an adorable canapé piled with a custard-soft <em>revuelto</em> of piquillo peppers and fresh anchovies (see <a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_164">previous page</a>), decorated with crisscrossed fried green pepper strips. Then I reach for a <em>pintxo</em> called <em>arco iris</em> (rainbow): nuggets of bacalao mounted on bread slathered with <em>pisto</em> (a vegetable spread) and topped with piped mashed potatoes. Festive egg white confetti and a single fat anchovy adorn a canapé of sliced seafood pâté. A luscious salad of the local spider crab is stuffed into flaky mini croissants. Tartlets emerge from the kitchen filled with duck gizzards and Armagnac-caramelized apples.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">So baroque and elaborate are the offerings here that it takes the owner, Patxi Bergara, and several assistants, four hours to assemble the counter display. “An ideal <em>pintxo</em> should be impeccably fresh, visually pleasing, and small enough to be eaten in no more than two bites,” Bergara explains. It should also be low in price, he adds, otherwise people will simply go elsewhere. “You should put a Do Not Touch sign on your <em>pintxos,</em>” I tell Bergara, sad that his gorgeously assembled counter will soon be ravaged by hungry mobs. He laughs and hands me a pastry boat filled with seared foie gras and grapes.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">CATALAN TOMATO BREAD</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PA AMB TOMAQUET</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is my favorite version of Catalan tomato-rubbed bread, based on the <em>pa amb tomàquet</em> at Paco Meralgo, a modern tapas bar in Barcelona famous for the dish. Choose a baguette that’s dense, chewy, and not too skinny, rather than a fluffy and crusty one. Or use half-inch-thick slices from a round loaf of country bread. (Sourdough is not very Catalan but <em>is</em> delicious.) Serve the bread as a tapa, either on its own or topped with an anchovy, cheese, or cured ham. It’s also wonderful as an accompaniment to saucey, olive oil–based dishes.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 piece (9 to 10 inches long and at least 2 inches in diameter) dense, chewy baguette, cut in half lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fat garlic cloves (optional), cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large ripe but firm tomato, cut in half crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><a id="page_166"/><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Brush the cut side of each baguette half very lightly with olive oil and rub it with garlic, if using. Grill or broil the bread until golden, about 45 seconds, watching out that it doesn’t burn around the edges.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> When the bread is just cool enough to handle, rub the cut side of each half with the cut side of a tomato half, pressing down on the tomato to extract some of the pulp. Drizzle more olive oil over the bread and sprinkle it with salt. Cut each baguette in half on the diagonal into roughly 1¼-inch pieces and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">YOU SAY TOMATO, CATALANS SAY PA AMB TOMAQUET</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Whether it’s breakfast, lunch, tapas, or dinner, a Catalan meal is pretty much unimaginable without a slice of country bread rubbed with a tomato half and drizzled with fruity olive oil. A snack born out of poverty—what could be more basic and cheap than bread and tomatoes?—<em>pa amb tomàquet</em> has achieved the status of a Catalan national dish. Eaten on its own or topped with <em>jamón,</em> cheese, anchovies, or just about anything else, <em>pa amb tomàquet</em> is essential and simple. It also provokes endless debates: Should the bread be toasted, grilled, or just slightly stale? Does the olive oil go on before or after the tomato? (Some say it needs two layers.) What kind of tomato is best, the sturdy half-green winter tomato or the ripe tomato of summer? And, it needs to be noted that a purist’s conception of good tomato bread doesn’t leave room for garlic (which isn’t to say that it’s not delicious). Classicists also frown on the practice followed by many restaurants of brushing the bread with frothy grated tomato pulp: To them it must be rubbed with a whole real tomato half.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">“DECONSTRUCTED” TOMATO BREAD</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PA AMB TOMAQUET “DECONSTRUIDO”</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">It was all but inevitable that something as ubiquitous and basic as tomato bread would get <em>nueva cocina</em> treatment in the hands of avant-garde chefs. Spain’s most famous “deconstructed” tomato bread was devised by Ferran Adrià, who translated the idea into tiny, ethereal pastry balls injected with tomato water and olive oil by means of a syringe. Less radical cooks play with the idea by taking the elements apart and reconfiguring them in new ways. The following recipe is the “deconstructed” tomato bread from Alkimia, a Barcelona restaurant run by the ever-creative Jordi Vilà. As an <em>amuse-guele,</em> Vilà often fills stylish martini glasses with toasted bread cubes tossed with olive oil and foamy tomato pulp and topped with slivers of dense, smoky salami. It’s a terrific idea. For a larger crowd, I like to serve this in Chinese porcelain spoons as a bite-size hors d’ouevre.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 large ripe tomatoes, cut in half, seeded, and grated on a box grater, skins discarded</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">“This is one of those recipes that changes your life!” my friends told me when they tasted this unusual toast for the first time. Combining bread, melted dark chocolate, salt, and olive oil is a Catalan tradition that goes back to the days of rationing and speaks to the Catalan love of mixing the sweet and the savory. <em>Nueva cocina</em> chefs have been having great fun with these flavors, but the original tostada, born out of deprivation, is still the best thing. Try it, and you’ll see chocolate in a completely new light. Serve the tostada for breakfast, afternoon tea, or at the end of the meal when the dessert is long finished but guests are still gathered around the table drinking wine.</p>

In this easy, elegant Basque <em>pintxo,</em> a Roquefort and apple spread and a sprinkling of toasted walnuts top baked puff pastry squares.

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_170"/>SPANISH CHEESE PRIMER</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">A long with the ubiquitous Manchego and the terrifically smelly blue Cabrales, some outstanding Spanish cheeses are finally making their way to a cheesemonger near you. Although it would take a whole book to do justice to the delights of Spanish cheese making, the ten <em>quesos</em> here are a good start. Look for them at a good cheese store or specialty food shop, or order them by mail (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>).</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>CABRA AL VINO</strong></span> The name of this young goat cheese from the southeastern Murcia region translates as drunken goat (or more literally goat with wine). The cheese is soaked in the tannic <em>doble pasta</em> red wine for up to three days, resulting in a distinctive purplish rind. Inside, Cabra al Vino is pleasantly mild, smooth, and bone white, with a lovely hint of milk and fruit. I love serving it with sliced strawberries.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>CABRALES</strong></span> Here’s one of Spain’s better-known culinary exports: a rich blue cheese from the mountainous northern Asturias region. (It’s named after the town of Cabrales in the northern spur of the dramatic Picos de Europa mountain range.) This artisanally produced cheese is gutsy, complex, and almost wild—you can smell it from miles away—but often has a surprising sweetness in the finish. Unlike some other blues, which are injected with mold, Cabrales develops its own natural blue veining in the cold, humid caves where it matures for at least three months. Most commonly it is made with raw cow’s milk; sometimes goat’s and ewe’s milk are blended in. Treat Cabrales as you would any other blue cheese: crumbled on salads, smeared on toasted bread and sprinkled with walnuts, or paired with crisp apples for dessert (a typically Asturian combo). Once you’ve tried Cabrales, don’t miss the other outstanding blue cheese from Picos de Europa: Gamonedo and the milder Valdeón.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>GARROTXA</strong></span> From the Garrotxa province of Catalonia, cushioned with fragrant Mediterranean woodland, comes this round, semisoft goat cheese with an attractive bluish gray rind. Creamy and white, aged in natural caves for at least twenty days, it’s appreciated for its velvety texture and suggestive hints of wild mushrooms, herbs, and nuts. The production of Garrotxa was begun in the 1970s by a group of visionary urban professionals-turned-farmers who had a dream of reviving traditional cheese making. Today it is one of Spain’s best-loved <em>quesos</em>.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>IDIAZABAL</strong></span> This is the signature farmhouse cheese of the verdant Basque hills. In the past it was produced by shepherds using lamb rennet and hung to drain on chimneys to <a id="page_171"/>acquire a smoky character. Made from the raw milk of the long-fleeced Latxa and Carranzana sheep, Idiazábal has a somewhat dense, buttery texture and a flavor that’s rich, nutty, and faintly piquant. Most Idiazábal available in this country is lightly smoked (usually over a local wood, such as hawthorn), which gives it a special rustic appeal. Fabulous for melting (try it in the Creamy Basque Smoked Cheese Risotto on <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_352">page 352</a>), Idiazábal is delicious on a piece of grilled country bread teamed with a sweet-smoky piquillo pepper. Or have it for dessert with a pear compote (such as the topping for the Blue Cheese &amp; Pear Tart, <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_408">page 408</a>).</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>MAHON</strong></span> This outstanding cow’s milk cheese, a specialty of the northernmost Balearic island of Menorca, comes in hefty, cushionlike blocks, shaped by placing the curd in pieces of cloth and twisting and knotting the corners together. Young Mahón is buttery, nutty, and tangy; as the cheese ages, it acquires a sophisticated, slightly rancid piquancy and a crumbly texture that recalls Parmesan. In Spain, Mahón is almost as popular as Manchego. It’s traditionally served sliced, drizzled with olive oil, and sprinkled with black pepper and herbs.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>MAJORERO</strong></span> Majorero is made on the exotic island of Fuerteventura in the Canaries, fewer than one hundred miles from Africa. Inside its ocher-colored rind, with its distinctive imprint of braided palm fronds, is a semisoft to hard cheese made with the rich milk of the hardy Majorera goats who scour the forbidding volcanic terrain for lichen. Many connoisseurs consider aged Majorero the best goat cheese in Spain, for its beautifully nuanced nutty-fruity-lemon flavor. Frequently the rind is treated with attractive notes of toasted corn flour, which further enhances it.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>MANCHEGO</strong></span> Mentioned by Cervantes in <em>Don Quixote,</em> Manchego is produced from the milk of Manchega-breed ewes, who graze on the arid planes of the central La Mancha region. Spain’s best-known cheese varies in quality; when good it is rich, oily-textured and vaguely briny, with the long finish of a noble wine. Manchego can be fresh, seimcured, or cured, and aged anywhere from two months to more than a year. The mature cheese develops a crumblier texture and a salty complexity. Marinate cubes of semicured Manchego in olive oil and herbs, and serve it with drinks alongside marcona almonds and green olives. Aged Manchego makes a terrific last course; it’s classically paired with <em>membrillo</em> (quince paste), honey, or dried figs.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>RONCAL</strong></span> From the Navarra region, close to the French border, this exciting raw sheep’s milk cheese is somewhat similar to Manchego but drier and even earthier, with a musty suggestion of gaminess that evokes hay and sheep. Roncal is delicious with <em>membrillo</em> or cherry preserves, Tomato Jam (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_390">page 390</a>), plump medjool dates, or grated on pasta.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>TETILLA</strong></span> Named for its evocative breast shape—<em>tetilla</em> means nipple—this semisoft cow’s milk cheese comes from the lushly green, rainy northwestern Galicia region. Surrounded by a waxy yellow rind, the interior is elastic and creamy with the texture of Muenster and a buttery, subtly grassy taste. It’s great as a table cheese or for melting on sandwiches. San Simón, a similar—but rather more interesting—Galician cheese is also worth seeking out.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>TORTA DEL CASAR</strong></span> This disk-shaped semisoft cheese from the Extremadura region is produced largely from the milk of merino sheep. Following an ancient practice, a local thistle is used in place of rennet to coagulate the unpasteurized milk, giving Torta del Casar its exotic, floral-herbal bitterness. As the cheese matures and ripens, it becomes spectacularly oozy and sensuous, with a terrific complexity. Traditionally, Torta is warmed in the oven ever so slightly, the top rind is cut off, and the insides are scooped out with a spoon. This is my favorite cheese in the world, expensive but worth every cent. A similar, but somewhat less stunning, cheese from Extremadura is la Serena.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PASTELA MORUNA</strong></small></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0173_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Moorish Chicken and Nut Pie</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">This is one of my favorite recipes of all times, a swooningly good pie, clearly related to the Moroccan <em>bastila,</em> but not nearly as sweet, rich, and time-consuming. <em>Pastela moruna</em> is a specialty at many bakeshops in the bewitching Andalusian city of Granada, and local food historians like to say that the recipe was made by the Moorish aristocracy of the Alhambra palace and then kept alive in convents by nuns. Romantic as that sounds, it’s more likely to have been borrowed from the city’s sizable North African community. Because I make <em>pastela</em> for every possible occasion, I’ve come to rely on store-bought rotisserie chicken for the filling. If you purchase the puff pastry, too, the pie is a cinch to make.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chicken stock or broth, plus more for sprinkling on the onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups skinned chicken, torn into bite-size pieces (from 1 medium-size rotisserie chicken)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon ground ginger</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup lightly toasted pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup lightly toasted slivered almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg yolk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting the pie</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until it begins to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the onion is very soft but barely browned, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a little more olive oil and 1 to 2 teaspoons of the chicken stock if the skillet looks dry. Stir in the chicken and cook for 1 minute. Add the paprika, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne and stir for a few seconds. Add the ½ cup chicken stock, the tomatoes, and raisins, cover the skillet, and cook for 12 to 15 minutes. The filling should be soft and moist; if it seems a little too wet, increase the heat to high for a few seconds so the liquid reduces. Season the filling with salt to taste and let it cool completely. The filling can be prepared up to a day ahead and refrigerated, covered.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly brush a 17-by 11-inch baking sheet with olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Lightly flour a work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out 1 sheet of puff pastry to a roughly 18- by 12-inch rectangle. Transfer it to the oiled <a id="page_173"/>baking sheet. Roll out the remaining sheet of puff pastry to a rectangle that is slightly smaller than the first. Spread the filling evenly over the pastry on the baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch bare along each of the 4 edges. Sprinkle the pine nuts and almonds evenly on top. Cover the filling with the second pastry rectangle. Fold the edges of the bottom crust up over the top and crimp them decoratively.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the egg yolk and milk in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Brush the top of the pie with this egg wash. Using a sharp knife, make slits all over the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Bake the pie on the center rack until golden brown and baked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the pie cool until slightly warm or room temperature.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>EMPANADA GALLEGA DE ATUN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">One of my favorite Galician empanadas features good canned tuna, tons of slowly cooked onions and bell peppers, and the pungent accent of green olives to balance the oniony sweetness. Tuna is the simplest option, but you can use this recipe as a blueprint for any Galician seafood empanada, using flaked, cooked, white-fleshed fish, sardines, or sliced raw scallops, for example.</p>
<p class="indent">In Galicia empanadas are often made with a wheat or cornmeal dough purchased from a bakery or with puff pastry. The wonderfully flaky—and remarkably easy—olive oil and yeast dough you’ll find here comes from a baker who sells her pies at a market in the medieval town of Pontevedra. This empanada tastes even better when made a day ahead and gently reheated.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed</strong></p>

Add the tomato, paprika, and saffron, cover the skillet, and simmer over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are reduced to a jamlike consistency, about 15 minutes.

<p class="box-title">EMPANADA: THE TRIUMPH OF THE GALICIAN OVEN</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">In her fascinating book <em>America’s First Cuisines,</em> food historian Sophie Coe describes a legendary banquet given by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in Mexico City in 1538. The pièce de résistance, we learn, was gargantuan empanadas brought out at the end of the meal. Ladies were invited to dig in first, and when the crusts were broken live rabbits and birds leapt out onto the table. The chronicler who recorded this extravaganza was awestruck, as well he should have been.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In Spanish the word <em>empanada</em> means “in dough” and describes glorious (if not always Cortésian) pies with savory fillings enclosed in bread dough, short pastry, or puff pastry. Though turnover-shaped South American empanadas are better known in this country, these smaller pies (called <em>empanadillas</em> in Spain) are just the offspring. Their progenitor—a handsome large pie, as thick as a book and oozing a filling of fish or pork sweetened with masses of onions—remains the mother of all empanadas. They’re an obsession in Galicia, a misty-green, northwestern corner of Spain.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Spanish historians believe that the empanadas of yore were akin to sandwiches: large round breads (probably stale), split horizontally and piled with some kind of filling. These empanadas became a veritable fast-food industry in medieval Galicia, sold to pilgrims walking the long Way of St. James from France to the Galician capital of Santiago de Compostela, where the saint’s relics are kept in its cathedral. You can still find such sandwichlike “pies” in remote parts of Galicia, and if you look closely, you’ll spot them depicted on the sculpted relief adorning the twelfth century Pórtico de la Gloria, the Romanesque entrance to the splendidly florid cathedral.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Fillings for large Galician empanadas always start with <em>zaragallada,</em> a delicious mixture of onions and peppers, sometimes flavored with tomatoes and saffron, cooked down in ample amounts of olive oil to an almost candied sweetness and jamlike consistency. To this base cooks add steamed and shelled mussels, salt cod or sardines, oysters or clams, thinly sliced scallops, chopped cooked octopus, or something meaty, like pork, chorizo, or game.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Today empanadas are the pride of any <em>gallego</em> baker or home cook, and an excuse for endless fiestas and contests where empanadas turn up as fantastical bread sculptures adorned with baroque decorations of heraldic symbols, towers, or flowers.</p>

The salt cod needs to soak for at least twenty-four hours, so plan accordingly.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound boneless salt cod, soaked and cooked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_198">page 198</a>), then drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup olive oil, plus more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size white onions, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size green bell peppers, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small bay leaf, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 canned tomatoes, chopped, plus about 2 tablespoons of their juices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup golden raisins</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh lemon juice (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed, or Olive Oil and Saffron Pastry (<a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_176a">previous page</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg yolk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons milk</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Pat the salt cod dry with paper towels. Flake the cod into small pieces, removing any bones or hard bits. Set the cod aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the green and red peppers and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, 7 to 8 minutes, adding a little more olive oil if the skillet looks dry. Reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft but not brown, about 12 minutes. Add the paprika, bay leaf, and tomatoes and their juices, and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the raisins and wine, cover the skillet, and simmer over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are reduced to a jamlike consistency, about 15 minutes. Let the vegetable mixture cool, then stir in the salt cod. Season the filling with salt and black pepper to taste, adding a little lemon juice if it needs a touch of acidity. The empanada filling can be prepared up to a day ahead and refrigerated, covered.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly brush a 17-by 11-inch baking sheet with olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Lightly flour a work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out 1 sheet of puff pastry to a roughly 18- by 12-inch rectangle. Transfer it to the oiled baking sheet; it will overhang the edge slightly. Roll out the remaining sheet of puff pastry to a rectangle that is slightly smaller than the first. Spread the filling evenly over the pastry on the baking sheet. Sprinkle parsley evenly on top. Cover the filling with the second pastry rectangle. Fold the edges of the bottom crust up over the top and crimp them decoratively.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the egg yolk and milk in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Brush the top of the empanada with this egg wash. Using a sharp knife, make slits all over the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Bake the empanada in the center rack until golden brown and baked through, about 30 minutes <a id="page_179"/>for puff pastry, 45 minutes for Olive Oil and Saffron Pastry. Once the empanada has been removed from the oven, if you’ve used Olive Oil and Saffron Pastry, cover the empanada loosely with a clean kitchen towel (if you’ve used puff pastry, don’t cover it). Let the empanada cool until slightly warm or room temperature. Cut it into squares and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 1 LARGE EMPANADA; SERVES 12 TO 14 AS A TAPA, 8 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Coca with Candied Red Peppers</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">For sipping wine and watching the crowds go by, few bars in Spain are more enjoyable than Vinya del Senyor in Barcelona. Considering its location—right in the shadow of the fourteenth-century Santa Maria del Mar church, in the city’s most touristy area—the offerings are truly outstanding: interesting wines by the glass, first-rate cheeses, boutique charcuterie. The most curious and addictive thing on the menu is the <em>coca</em> (a Spanish-Mediterranean pizza), baked with a Mallorcan topping of sweetened red peppers that are dusted with confectioners’ sugar. The result is a delicious, intriguing cross between a dessert tart and a savory pizza. And there is nothing I’d rather eat with a glass of crisp, chilled rosé.</p>
<p class="indent">Because I’d sooner hang out sipping wine than slave in the kitchen, I’ve adapted this recipe to use store-bought pizza dough and roasted peppers from a jar—with excellent results. (For best results buy the dough from a pizzeria.) If the confectioners’ sugar topping seems too unorthodox, feel free to omit it—but not without trying it first!</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing the coca</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size white onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups thinly sliced drained roasted peppers in oil (from four 14- to 16-ounce jars)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons granulated sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the rolling pin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound store-bought pizza dough, thawed if frozen</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting the coca</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until limp but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the roasted peppers and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring. Add the granulated sugar, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water and stir until the sugar dissolves. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time. Season with salt to taste and let the pepper mixture cool completely.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly brush a 17-by 11-inch baking sheet with olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_180"/><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Lightly flour a work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough so it is roughly as large as the baking sheet. Transfer it to the oiled baking sheet and brush it with olive oil. Spread the filling evenly on top.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Bake the <em>coca</em> on the center rack until it is light golden and baked through, 18 to 20 minutes. Let the <em>coca</em> cool to warm (or make the <em>coca</em> ahead, which actually adds to its flavor; reheat it gently before serving). Cut the <em>coca</em> into rectangles (I use sturdy kitchen scissors for this), dust it very lightly with confectioners’ sugar, and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 1 LARGE COCA; SERVES 12 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3r">COCA WITH HONEYED ONIONS AND PINE NUTS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COCA DE CEBOLLA CON MIEL Y PIÑONES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The recipe for this incredible flatbread was demonstrated to me by my favorite Mallorcan chef, Joan Torrens, at his restaurant Es Baluard. Harking back to medieval Arab cooking, the intriguing mix of sweet and savory flavors here is typical of the island’s cuisine. Joan prebakes the <em>coca</em> dough briefly so that the topping doesn’t render it soggy. To soften the onions and get rid of some of their bitterness, he rubs them with salt and lets them sit (you’ll need to allow about an hour for this). Once you’re ready to bake the <em>coca,</em> make sure to rinse the onions well and thoroughly squeeze the water out. See the Variations to turn this <em>coca</em> into a savory one, made with anchovies.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 large sweet white onions (about 3 pounds total), cut in half and very thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup plus 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Joan’s Coca Dough (<a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_181a">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup plus 1 to 2 tablespoons honey, preferably rosemary honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dried currants</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely minced fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup pine nuts</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the onions in a sieve and massage about 1 tablespoon salt into them. Place the sieve over a bowl and let stand for about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Generously brush a 17- by 11-inch baking sheet with olive oil. Lightly flour a work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough so that it’s roughly as large as the baking sheet. Transfer it to the oiled baking sheet. Prick the <a id="page_181"/>dough all over with the tines of a fork and bake it on the center rack until half done, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> While the crust is baking, rinse the onions well under cold running water. Thoroughly press the slices of onion hard against the sieve to get rid of the excess moisture. Add ¼ cup of the honey to the onions in the sieve, massaging it into the onions and pressing against the sieve to squeeze out more moisture. Transfer the onions to a bowl and add the vinegar, currants, rosemary, and ¼ cup of the olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> When the dough is half baked, spread the onion mixture evenly on top. Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons of honey over it, then scatter pine nuts on top. Bake the <em>coca</em> for 20 minutes, drizzle with the remaining olive oil, then continue baking until the onion is lightly golden and has lost most of its crunch, 15 to 20 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Cover the <em>coca</em> with a clean kitchen towel and let it cool for about 30 minutes, then cut it into squares and serve. The <em>coca</em> can be baked ahead and served the next day; it will taste even better. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 1 LARGE COCA; SERVES 12 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATIONS:</strong></span> To turn this <em>coca</em> into a more savory onion-and-anchovy flatbread, follow the recipe but omit the honey, vinegar, and currants. After spreading the onion topping on the dough, top it with drained, oil-packed anchovy fillets (you’ll need 20 to 24 fillets). Or toss some chopped anchovies into the onion topping before spreading it on the <em>coca.</em> Alternatively, the onion <em>coca</em> can be topped with thin slices of pork sausage, julienned salami, or cleaned, fresh sardine fillets before baking.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MASA PARA COCAS DE JOAN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The traditional <em>coca</em> dough of Mallorca is made with lard and is incredibly rich—delicious but hardly what the doctor ordered. It often includes a yeast starter. In his typical fashion, chef Joan Torrens has modernized the recipe, using olive oil and a touch of beer.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>⅓ cup lager-style beer</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2¾ to 3¼ cups all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the beer, olive oil, egg, salt, and ⅔ cup water in a large bowl and whisk to mix. Add 2¾ cups of the flour, ½ cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Knead the dough briefly in the bowl to incorporate all the stray flour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, kneading in enough of the remaining ½ cup flour for the dough not to stick to your hands. (If the dough still sticks after all the remaining flour has been incorporated, oil your hands and continue kneading.) The dough will be pliable and slightly oily. Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a well-oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let stand while you prepare the <em>coca</em> filling. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ENOUGH FOR ONE 17- BY 11-INCH COCA</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_182"/><span class="green-1">COCA WITH A TOMATO SALAND</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COCA DE TRAMPO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">On its own, <em>trampó</em> (or <em>trempó</em>) is a classic Mallorcan salad of finely diced tomatoes, sweet onion, and pepper made soupy with good olive oil and some vinegar, and often eaten with a spoon and bread for dipping. Drained, it’s frequently used for topping flatbreads, making for one of the island’s most popular <em>cocas.</em> The <em>trampó</em> is delicious plain, but you can also cap it with anchovy fillets or add some chopped black olives to the mix. Once it’s baked, squares of <em>coca</em> make a great base for a slice of good cheese or ham.</p>
<p class="indent">Chopping the vegetables fine to the point of mincing is important here—besides being traditional, it also helps the topping bake through faster.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ pounds ripe sweet tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced as finely as you can</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of sugar (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 dash of red wine vinegar (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size white onion, diced as finely as you can</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size Italian (frying) peppers, cored, seeded, and diced as finely as you can</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced as finely as you can</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling over the coca</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound store-bought pizza dough, thawed if frozen</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the tomatoes in a fine sieve and let them drain for 20 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes to a large mixing bowl and taste them: If they are too acidic or seem to lack flavor, add the sugar and/or vinegar to heighten the flavor.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Add the onion, Italian peppers, red pepper, olive oil, and garlic and toss to mix. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Let the <em>trampó</em> stand for at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Generously brush a 17- by 11-inch baking sheet with olive oil. Lightly flour a work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough so it is roughly as large as the baking sheet. Transfer it to the oiled baking sheet. Prick the dough all over with the tines <a id="page_183"/>of a fork and bake it on the center rack until half done, about 12 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Remove the <em>coca</em> crust from the oven. Take a handful of the <em>trampó</em> and press it against a fine sieve to squeeze out the excess moisture, then spread the <em>trampó</em> over the dough. Repeat with the remaining <em>trampó,</em> spreading it over the crust in a thick, even layer. Bake the <em>coca</em> until the vegetables are soft and lightly charred, about 30 minutes. Halfway through baking, drizzle a little olive oil over the vegetables.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Let the <em>coca</em> cool to room temperature, then cut it into squares and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 1 LARGE COCA; SERVES 12 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>
