<p class="author1"><span class="txit">passata di pomodoro</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">The best time to prepare this dish is summertime, when sweet, flavorful tomatoes are in abundance. This sauce is wonderful over pasta, but is also delicious served on bruschetta.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds ripe tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound pasta (spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccine)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use a sharp knife to score the bottoms of the tomatoes with an X. Gently place the tomatoes in the boiling water. When the skin begins to unfurl at the X, remove the tomatoes from the water with a slotted spoon and plunge into a bowl of cold water. Allow the tomatoes to cool slightly; then peel away the skins.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Cut the tomatoes into several small pieces. Remove and discard the seeds. Place the tomatoes in a food mill fitted with a coarse blade. Grind the tomatoes through the mill (or finely chop by hand) into a bowl. Place the tomatoes in a fine mesh sieve placed over a bowl. Allow the tomatoes to drain for several hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, following the package instructions. Drain well and toss with the olive oil. Distribute evenly among four plates. Discard the water accumulated in the bowl below the tomatoes, and spoon equal portions of the concentrated tomatoes on top of the pasta. Serve immediately.</p>
