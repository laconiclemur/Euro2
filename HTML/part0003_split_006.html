			<p class="rec-intro">This is not hard to do and once you’ve mastered the technique, a soufflé is an impressive dish. You’ll need four ramekins measuring 8 x 6cm if making individual soufflés or one 20cm dish. The béchamel sauce recipe makes more than you need for the soufflé but it keeps in the fridge for a week. Cover it well, though.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">400g leaf spinach</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">unsalted butter, for greasing</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g Parmesan cheese, grated</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 medium free-range egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 medium free-range egg whites</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of salt</p>
			<p class="for-the">Béchamel sauce</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">40g unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">40g flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">freshly grated nutmeg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="method-nu">Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the spinach for 30 seconds. Plunge it into iced water to refresh, then drain and press out some of the water with your hands. Blitz the spinach in a food processor until smooth, then place it in a clean cloth and press and squeeze out as much water as you can until the spinach purée is as dry as possible.</p>
			<p class="method-nu">To make the béchamel, melt the butter in a small pan. Stir in the flour and cook for 3–4 minutes without letting it colour, then whisk in the milk. Bring to the boil and whisk until the sauce is smooth. Season with a grating of nutmeg and some salt and pepper, then cover to avoid a skin forming.</p>
			<p class="method-nu">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Butter your ramekins or mould and coat the insides with grated Parmesan. Put 4 tablespoons of béchamel in a bowl, add 4 tablespoons of the spinach and mix well with the 2 egg yolks. Whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl with a pinch of salt until stiff, then fold into the béchamel and spinach mixture until smooth. Do not over mix. </p>
			<p class="method-nu">Pour the mixture into the ramekins or mould and level off the top with a spatula. Run a knife or your thumb around the inside rim to ensure a straight rise. Place in the preheated oven and cook for 8–10 minutes for individual souffles or 16–18 minutes for the bigger one. Serve immediately on its own or with a sauce such as tomato coulis (see <a href="part0010_split_025.html#Tomato-dressing">here</a>).</p>
