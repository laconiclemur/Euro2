<h2 class="h2b">CASSOULET</h2>
<p class="normalla0">Cassoulet <em>is not something that is ordinarily associated with Provence. Its origins lie slightly to the west, in Toulouse, but it’s another dish that is eaten with gusto all over France. The generous addition of tomatoes and the little shins of lamb are a variation on a dish that I love. Often cooked in two parts, then combined, I find it more flavoursome and practical to cook everything together as one. The</em> cassoulet <em>should just murmur, not simmer or boil, so that the beans will absorb the flavours more fully and the meats dry less. Puréeing some of the beans and adding them back makes for a wonderfully creamy result which contrasts perfectly with the crisp topping</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6</span><br/>
2 shanks of lamb, about 350g (12oz) each<br/>
3 tbsp duck fat<br/>
400g (14oz) dried white haricot beans, soaked<br/>
1 large onion, peeled and diced<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and diced<br/>
3 Roma tomatoes, cored and chopped<br/>
1 tbsp tomato concentrate<br/>
1 × 400g (14oz) piece garlic sausage<br/>
2 Toulon sausages (coarse pork sausages), 200g (7oz) each<br/>
1 × 250g (9oz) piece of green bacon, skin removed<br/>
1 bouquet garni (1 bay leaf, 1 sprig fresh thyme)<br/>
2 Duck Confit legs (<em><a href="chapter_006m.html">see here</a></em>)<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
100g (3½ oz) coarse breadcrumbs</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 110°C/225°F/Gas ¼.</p>
<p class="normala">Sauté the lamb shanks for about 10 minutes in the duck fat, first over a high and then a medium heat until golden. Add the drained beans, diced onion and garlic, and sweat these for about 5 minutes until well coated with the fat but not coloured. Add the tomatoes and tomato concentrate and boil furiously, stirring well until the tomato just begins to caramelise. Add the lamb shanks back to the beans along with the sausages and bacon. Cover just to the level with water and add the bouquet garni. Bring to the boil, cover and cook for 2 hours in the preheated oven, making sure that the liquid never boils.</p>
<p class="normala">Add the duck confit and cook for a further hour until the beans are soft but not breaking up, and the lamb shanks are melting from the bone. Lift out a quarter of the beans and blend them with some of the liquid. Add this back to the rest and stir in gently but well along with some seasoning. I find it most appealing to serve <em>cassoulet</em> in the dish in which it was cooked, when everyone cuts up or tears off bits of the meat and sausages at the table. In this case I just sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and grill slowly until golden. But you can leave the dish to cool for a while, lift out the meats, portion them, then put them on top of the beans in a serving dish. You then sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top and heat through gently in the oven before grilling. It’s a dish that’s easily made a few days in advance.</p>
