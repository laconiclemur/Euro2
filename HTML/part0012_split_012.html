  <p class="chap-para">Duck and apple is a perfect marriage, and this dish makes a great alternative for Christmas or for a Sunday lunch. For this recipe, I have used the excellent English Gressingham duck. Keep the drained-off fat and use for roast potatoes to accompany the duck.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 oven-ready duck, weighing about 1.8kg/4lb</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz/2 tbsp butter</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 sage leaves, finely chopped, plus a few extra</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para">Wipe the duck clean inside and out, season the cavity with salt and pepper and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the onion and sweat on a medium heat for 3 minutes. Add 2 tbsp water and continue to cook for 2 minutes until the onion has softened. Remove from the heat, stir in the chopped sage, breadcrumbs, egg yolks, apples, and some salt and pepper and combine well. Fill the cavity of the duck with this stuffing.</p>

  <p class="para">Prick the duck skin all over and sprinkle with salt – this will release the fat and make the duck skin nice and crisp. Put the duck on a rack in a roasting tin and roast for 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Pour off the fat and reserve to make roast potatoes. Drizzle the duck with the wine, scatter with a few sage leaves and continue to roast for about 1¼ hours, until the duck is cooked; test by inserting a skewer in the thigh – if the juices run clear, it is done.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven, pour off the fat and leave to rest for 5–10 minutes. Carve and serve with the stuffing.</p>
