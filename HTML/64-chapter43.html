<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Most Spanish clam preparations are pretty straightforward, and cooked in a way that they won’t lose their delicate sea flavors. There is usually some garlic, perhaps a bit of onion, and almost always a shot of white wine. This tapas recipe is no exception, except that it adds shrimp into that equation. In springtime, use the more mild tender garlic shoots (called <em>ajetes</em> or <em>ajos tiernos</em> in Spanish) or, in autumn, sauté a handful of wild mushrooms in the pan before adding the clams. Serve with some bread to soak up the liquid and a glass of crisp white wine.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Purge the clams of any sand by soaking them in salty water following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Discard any with broken shells.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large sauté pan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the leeks and garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the shrimp, clams, parsley, and (if using) chile pepper and cook for 2 minutes, shaking the pot from time to time. Pour over the wine, partly cover the pan, and cook over high heat, shaking the pan from time to time and stirring, until the clams have opened and the shrimp are opaque throughout, about 4 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Transfer it all to a serving bowl (including the liquid), discarding any clams that did not open, and serve immediately.</p>
