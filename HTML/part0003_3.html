For comparison it is estimated that in the USA smoked meats account for about 30% of meats sold. And hot dogs constitute the largest portion of this number, though few people ever think of them as a smoked product. A meat department in an American supermarket pales in comparison with its counterpart in Poland or Germany where in addition to fresh and smoked meats there are dozens of different sausages and all kinds of smoked fish such as eel, herring, mackerel and others. The popularity of pork in smoked products can be attributed to a few reasons:</span></p><div class="calibre_10"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Pork meat was most popular among the masses. Unlike pragmatic animals like cows and horses, pigs were not of much practical benefit besides the fact that they were the first sanitation system. In ancient Rome they roamed the streets at nightfall and ate any leftover garbage. In early Europe, there was a strong sentiment towards cows. They produced milk, which was processed into butter, cheese and cream. They were also used for labor, pulling ploughs and performing other chores. Upon death, they were buried, not eaten. On the other hand, pigs were not of much practical use, but they tasted good and were prepared in hundreds of different ways. The pigs were smart: when the times were hard they ran away to the forest where they ate nuts, acorns and berries. When the danger passed away they would return to villages where they would roam around and eat whatever was available. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Pigs reproduced rapidly and ate everything.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Pork meat was the best meat for curing and smoking.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">The pigs felt much safer living next to humans and became one of the first animals domesticated by man.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Countries in Northern Europe smoked meats well before America was discovered. In 1493 Christopher Columbus took 8 pigs into new territories and they were released in Cuba. Then in 1539 Hernando de Soto landed with 13 pigs in Tampa Bay, Florida and he deserves to be called the king of the pork industry in the USA. By that time the art of making sausages was in full swing in Europe.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">The Importance of Christmas and Easter Holidays</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">When Poland became a Catholic nation in 966, it affected the ways people ate and behaved. There was an unusually large number of days when people had to fast and of course on those days meat consumption was not allowed. Even today most Catholics do not eat meat on Friday. But there were two periods when people were allowed to celebrate and eat to their hearts content, and that was Christmas and Easter.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_15" src="../images/00052.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> As every year Dziadek (Grandpa in Polish) starts Christmas production. He makes it all: smoked hams, loins, sausages, liver, blood sausages, and head cheeses and when he is done not a single scrap of meat remains.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">A pig would be slaughtered and processed a few weeks before Christmas or Easter, and the noble cuts of meat like ham, butt, and loins would be cured and smoked. Remaining scraps of meat such as the liver, tongue, heart, skins and blood were reserved for headcheeses, liver and blood sausages. Bacon and fatback would be smoked, some of the back fat would be rendered to make lard. A pig is a very unique animal where nothing is wasted. Even the bones will be used to make soup stock. Those products had to last over the winter and often until summer when it was time to gather crops and the ready to eat sausages would become food and snacks out in the field. For a common person eating meat was still limited to holidays or family occasions like weddings. Even relatively well off people would eat meat only on Sundays.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_17" src="../images/00027.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.2</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> This is what separates sausage makers like “Dziadek” from others. He can do it all.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_18" src="../images/00060.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.3</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Finished sausages.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">They might land a good paying job in a large factory taking care of some department, but to make it from A-Z by yourself is a different matter. Pig slaughter was not just a kill, it was a long awaited event, a kind of social gathering where in addition to the host and his family, his friends and neighbors were also invited.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Christmas Eve dinner traditionally would be served after sunset, then many people would attend Midnight Mass. The table would be set up close to the beautifully ornamented Christmas tree and the gifts would be placed under it. People would walk to one another, break a little part of holy wafer and make wishes for the new year. Then the dinner was served although no meat was allowed. Fish was fine and the carp was traditionally prepared in different ways. But on the first day of Christmas all restrictions would be lifted and people would try to make up for all those days of rigid fasting. This is when some serious eating took place and meat products and sausages played an important part.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">During Easter Holidays meat products became the most important item on the menu. For those that did not witness it first hand, it is hard to imagine hundreds of people standing in a line that began outside of the meat store and waiting their turn to get the provisions they need. And that continued non-stop for 12 hours a day. This is how Christmas and Easter have been celebrated in Poland for a thousand years and these holidays definitely sustained the popularity of sausages until today. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In Poland people eat sausages all the time, most of them smoked. The commonly eaten “White Sausage” is a not smoked fresh sausage which is traditionally served with soup called “żurek” at Easter time.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_19" src="../images/00029.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.4</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Leaving church.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">A day earlier people prepared a wicker gift basket that contained items like bread, eggs, horseradish and of course sausages. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">This basket was taken to the nearest church where it was blessed by the priest during a short mass. This blessed food was arranged on the breakfast table among hams, bacon, and countless varieties of sausages. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">A holy wafer was used to make wishes at Christmas and sliced egg was used to make wishes at Easter.

We do know from archeological sites that trade merchants from Rome and other countries visited Polish territories reaching as far north as the Baltic Sea as early as 500 B.C. They followed what was known as the Amber Route to get amber (thousands of years old crystallized tree resin or sap) that was held in high esteem and was washed ashore by the Baltic Sea. Besides valuable amber the local tribes provided merchants with fine furs.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">On the other hand the merchants displayed manufactured goods such as gold and silver jewelry, silver and bronze dishes and drinking cups, gold medallions with the likenesses of Roman nobles and coins. In addition they brought swords, knives, spices and dry sausages. Romans liked pork and made the whole assortment of sausages. Without a doubt the art of making sausages had originated in Rome and reached other areas by trade merchants and Roman military legions.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The ties between Poland and Rome strengthened when Poland accepted Christianity as a nation in 966. In 1000 Otto III, a highly educated Holy Roman Emperor and a fervent Christian, travelled to Poland where he became friends with Polish King Boleslaw I the Brave (Boleslaw Chrobry). Both nobles exchanged gifts and dined for three days. Contacts of this kind were helpful in learning social customs and culinary arts between different countries and new ways of meat preparation were of great interest to all. The Catholic Church required many days of fasting and that influenced the way people dined. On many days not only meat, but even eggs, butter or milk were prohibited and the penalties were severe. Adding to it the fact that meat was very expensive and beyond the reach of an average peasant, we can conclude that sausages were mainly consumed by the privileged class and clergy. The monasteries were cultural centers where most of the science research was conducted and those places were familiar with methods of meat preservation or beer and wine making.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In the second part of the Middle Ages (X - XVI century) the individual castles or large households were the centers of cultural life and culinary arts. Of course they were owned by noblemen who also owned entire villages. All of them were self-reliant on food. The peasants that lived in a particular village were also self-reliant and they prospered quite well. It was not unusual when some of them owned cattle or horses. Polish cuisine of that era was simple and based on meats, sausages, fish, bread, grouts, vegetables, fruits and honey that was commonly used in place of an expensive sugar. The food warehouse or kitchen pantries were stocked with items like wheat and rye, flour, bread, buckwheat and barley groats, peas and beans, vegetable oils, dry and pickled mushrooms, sauerkraut, salted and smoked meats, sausages, salted and smoked fish, cheeses, butter, eggs, wooden barrels with beer, honey and fruit wines. The most popular vegetables were cabbage, onion, garlic, cucumbers, carrots, parsley and caraway. The dishes were simple but the plate had to be large and full of food.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In the Middle Ages as the cities grew larger in size and the food markets developed, this culinary exchange of ideas progressed even further and people got acquainted with new dishes and recipes. Some regions became well known for the type of sausage they made and many sausages of today still carry those original names. Those independent households gave origin to the regionally prepared foods and sausages were no exception.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In 1646 Polish King Mieczyslaw IV married French Ludwika Maria Gonzaga, the daughter of Prince Charles Gonzaga and that brought sophisticated French cuisine into Poland. Liver sausages and pâtés became popular and not the size of a meal, but its looks and presentation became more important.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The next 50 years were very turbulent as the country was invaded by the Swedish, Russians and Turks and had to deal with mutiny by Cossacks. Although Poland repelled those invasions, it emerged from those wars terribly ruined and depopulated. The wars were accompanied by plagues and famine. The population which before 1645 amounted to some 10 million, decreased to 6 million at the end of the century. Trade shrank, currency lost in value and economic reconstruction was slow. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In XVIII century we find first mention of the word </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">“kielbasa”</span></span><span class="calibre_2">. It describes a thick sausage, dark in color (heavily smoked) and a few feet long. This sausage was an ever present item on the tables of noblemen and better off knights. Merchants would carry it during their long travels, knights would be seen riding horses and carrying sausages at the belt. In those times the favorite hobby of the royalty was hunting and venison with wild birds was served regularly on the menu. So it comes as no surprise that wild boar, deer or rabbit meat was often combined with pork and new spices were introduced, thus creating new sausage varieties. In time the kielbasa diversified into regional brands and new recipes were created. Copying customs of the rich households, the peasants in villages started to make sausages, first for their own enjoyment, then for the trade and sale.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Lithuanian Products</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">There was a region in the Northeastern part of Poland that we have to mention as it produced magnificent products. This region known today as Lithuania was once a part of Poland. It became famous for its smoked products that would last for 2 years at room temperature (76°F, 25°C) without apparent loss of flavor. The meat was carefully chosen from 12-15 month old pigs that were fed mainly rye, barley and potatoes. In some cases the pig was fed exclusively with flour. Different methods of slaughter were employed; the pig was killed by inserting a knife into its heart and the wound would be immediately closed with a wooden plug. That prevented blood loss and imparted a dark-red color to the meat. For the same reason the pig was not hung but lay stomach down. To remove the hair, the pig was not scalded with hot water as this would have made skin and meat too soft. Instead the pig was burned all over its body with burning hay and then the hair was scraped with knives. Then the entrails would be removed and the pig would be carved into pieces.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Large meat cuts would be cold smoked for 2-3 weeks and smaller products for 10-12 days. Unusually tall smokehouses with a free standing source of smoke were employed to produce cold smoke. Then the finished products were covered with a 2 - 3 mm (0.1”) layer of wax to prevent drying. What must be mentioned is that juniper twigs (“juniperus”-gives gin its characteristic flavor) were commonly added to wood logs during smoking to create a specific flavor. Sometimes juniper berries would be added but those most often would be added directly to meat, either in whole or ground form. Juniper sausage (“jałowcowa”) had been made in Poland for as long as anybody can remember. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In those times sausages were originally made by cutting meat into smaller pieces and stuffing them into casings through a suitable funnel, often called a stuffing horn. Most old-timers are familiar with the “Finger Sausage” (Palcówka), that derives its name from the word fingers (palce) which were used to stuff the sausage.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">There were continuous wars in XVII, XVIII and XIX centuries and only after the end of WWI in 1918 we see making sausages becoming an art. The country was a capitalistic state now and many great sausage making businesses opened up and flourished. The first books on regional cooking and sausage making started to appear.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Between the Wars Period - 1918-1939 </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">After the first World War ended in 1918 there was no centrally organized meat industry. There were hundreds of small meat plants and butcher shops across the country which made products in a slow traditional way using primitive equipment. The city owned slaughter houses provided services to individual butcher shops. Large slaughter houses had some cooling facilities but smaller houses located in little towns did not.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The Czerniewice Meat Plant was one of the first large industrial meat plants and started working in 1912 exporting bacon to England. The plant would buy pigs from local farmers and process meat into finished products. Another known plant located in Motycz specialized mainly in the production of bacon. Bacon would go to England, hams to America and canned hams and dry sausages to Africa. That was a typical method of operation for about two thousand Polish plants in the years 1930-1938. From 1932 and on, more and more factories started to make canned hams and butts for export although the production was still taking place in little plants.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">World War II - 1939-1945</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Due to Polands’s very unique geographical location (the East meets the West) there were always wars taking place on its territory. Always problems with the Russians and the Germans. When Napolean tried to conquer Russia his armies marched through Poland on the way to Moscow and when he retreated the Russians chased him again through Poland. The same happened during WWII, the war did not stop in Poland for a second and either Germans were chasing Russians, or the Russians were chasing Germans with Poles fighting them both. Poland was the buffer zone, a boiling pot where fighting never seemed to stop. When the war ended 20% of the Polish population (6.5 million) was dead and some cities were completely destroyed.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The horses and cattle were decimated but the pigs escaped to the forests and returned back when it was safer. As there was no industry and no farm machinery the agriculture had to be rebuilt using horses and cattle. Pork was the meat of the necessary choice and the products had to be cured and smoked to be preserved for later use as there was no refrigeration. During the war Germany took over Czerniewice meat plant to produce meats for its military. In 1950 the plant was back in Polish hands and it resumed its meat production. Better equipment was installed and the plant started producing the whole assortment of meats and sausages for export and for the local market. In the 1990’s after the fall of the government the plant was in deep trouble and declared bankruptcy in 2000. A year later the plant was taken over by the Polish company “Mat” and has been continuing its operations until today. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">The Glory Years (1945-1989) </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">During WWII (1939 - 1945) most meat plants were destroyed and the re-birth was very slow. In 1948 only about 600 slaughter houses were in operation. Creating a new, modern and prospering meat industry became a necessity for the government. The country’s currency “zloty” was not convertible, the government needed hard currency and the only way to get it was to export raw (coal) materials or finished goods (vodka, meat products). The government spared no effort to create the best meat industry. A peculiar characteristic of the new regime was its fondness for long-term planning:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">3-year plan (1947-1949) - re-building war damages and re-growth of animal herds.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">6-year plan (1950-1955) - modernization and development of the meat industry. Mechanical methods of slaughter were introduced, new plants were built and older ones were modernized. More types of meats, sausages and canned products were produced, both for export and for local needs.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">5-year plan (1956-1960) - further modernization and development of the meat industry. Specifically designed machines were introduced to facilitate faster and more economical cutting and carving of animals and newer methods of production were implemented. Huge diversification of meat products was visible. Assembly line production concept was introduced. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Meat technology manuals with manufacturing instructions and detailed recipes were written to be used in meat plants in order to produce a consistent and high quality product.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> That was the beginning of the Golden Era of Polish Sausages. </span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Until 1945 a sausage of the same name had many variants and although the basic recipe remained the same, different regions used different spices which led to different flavors of the product. The typical example was the sausage known as Kabanosy that in 1920-1930 started to appear in all areas of the country. In 1945 someone in the newly organized government came up with a brilliant idea of standardizing Polish meat products using traditional time proven recipes.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The official list of products was drawn and the Department of the Meat Industry started to work out details. In 1959 the first official guide for making meat products and sausages was issued. The publication was known as </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2"># 16 Collection of Recipes and Instructions for Making Meat Products and Sausages</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> and it was reserved for internal use only. At three hundred pages long it had sections on meat curing, making brines, grinding and emulsifying, cooking, methods of smoking, the whole factory process was described in details. It covered 31 smoked products (hams, butts, loins, bacon, 46 sausages, 11 head cheeses and 13 liver and blood sausages. In 1960 the </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2"># 17 version</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> was issued which was a slightly revised version of # 16. Then in 1964 the Polish Government issued an expanded version called </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2"># 21 Collection of Recipes and Instructions for Making Meat Products and Sausages.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> It was 760 pages long and included: 39 smoked products (hams, loins, bacon, ribs), 119 sausages, 12 headcheeses, 19 liver and blood sausages and 11 pâtés and meat loaves. In total 200 meat products were covered and ONLY ONE chemical was used.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The additive was potassium nitrate which had been used for centuries and is still used today although it has been replaced by its easier to administer cousin - “sodium nitrite.” In fifty years millions of pounds of meat products and sausages were made without the use of chemicals. Just quality meats and spices. Those government manuals helped to create the best meat industry that ever existed anywhere though its life was only about 50 years. Those manuals were not written by restaurant cooks or college students, but by the best professionals in meat science the country had. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">The recipes presented in this book come from these manuals and they were never published before.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The project was government funded and no effort or money was spared. This standardization allowed Poland to produce sausages of high and </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">consistent</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> quality. Moreover it taught people what to expect from a particular sausage as its taste, texture, color and flavor were basically the same in all areas of the country. All meat plants and retail stores belonged to the government and meat inspectors rigidly enforced the regulations. Suddenly the Kabanosy or Krakowska Sausage tasted exactly the same even when produced in different regions of the country. In 1948 Kabanosy were officially approved as the product name that would be sold in Polish meat stores. In 1954 production instructions were worked out and in 1964 taking under consideration the traditional recipes of the product, the Government adopted the standard recipe that became a legally binding document that could not be changed.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Although those products were of such high quality, their recognition and popularity was mainly limited to Poland. The country was behind the Iron Curtain, its communist system was the worst evil the world has ever known, there was always a possibility of a new war and the Polish currency was not convertible. Those were not helpful conditions for trading sausages between countries of opposite political systems. From that time until the collapse of the system in 1989 Kabanosy and other meat products were always made the same way. This uniform quality enforced by the government meat inspectors made them very famous Polish sausages. Some sausage makers were lucky and rich enough to bribe their way out to getting a passport, others simply defected crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Italy, those people brought the taste of Polish sausages to the USA and other countries. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The war damage and general poverty did not provide the right conditions for fast rebuilding of agriculture. Farmers raised pigs in traditional ways, feeding them with potatoes, grains and kitchen leftovers. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The chemical industry was in its infancy, there were no fertilizers so cow’s manure was used and this made all products organic and healthy. Those were not conditions that would favor the growth of the economy but </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">they were the ideal conditions for raising animals of the highest quality meat possible.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Those high quality meats, great recipes without chemicals and proper manufacturing practices allowed the production of great products. Those government manuals covered not only sausages but also hams, bacon, loins, butts, ribs, picnics and all meats that could be boiled, baked, smoked or dried. There are still master butchers and sausage makers from that era and they have been holding on to those publications all their lives. We are very fortunate to have them as members of our site www.wedlinydomowe.pl and our discussion forum. Those people are walking encyclopedias of sausage making knowledge and to them we are deeply indebted.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The Polish ham “Krakus” brand became the best ham in the world and the sausages that were exported had to conform to the highest standards. At that period, between the end of the war and collapse of the communist system Polish meat products were made the best ever. The decline in Polish meat products is synonymous with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent collapse of communism. This opened Polish borders to the free trade with the West and created new business ventures between Poland and other European countries.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Poland became a new undeveloped market and capital started to flow in. European standards for making meat products were more relaxed than those in Poland and some countries feared competition from Poland once it became the member of the group. As we mentioned the only chemical used in Polish meats and sausages was potassium nitrate even though the list of food additives allowed in Europe was long and impressive. It starts at E 100-Curcumin and ends at E1518-Glyceryl Triacetate. In total 1418 different ingredients can be introduced to the food we consume. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The story goes that when Poland was invited to join the Common Market it was granted an exception and was permitted to use any quantities of food additives to its sausages. Kind of a catch up game: “jump on the waggon guys and start putting chemicals in your products.” Soon many meat processors established joint ventures loaded with capital and new partners. That allowed them to bring the latest technology meat machines and the products were made faster and cheaper. Factory prepared curing solutions were injected into meat to shorten curing time and to increase gain of the product. This peaceful revolution came so suddenly that the new government was not able to control all that was happening. The meat industry imported the latest machinery and chemicals from other European countries and started to follow the same standards of production. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Unfortunately those standards were much lower than the high quality sausage standards that were enforced by the former Polish regime. When Poland officially joined the Common Market in 2004 the situation deteriorated even further. Now the country had to conform to new European regulations and that did not make sausages any better. For example in the 1900’s the Polish government allowed 1.5 mg (150 parts per million) of phosphates to be added to 1 kg of meat (phosphates increase meat’s water holding capacity). New standards allowed 5 mg of phosphates and of course manufacturers loved the idea as it amounted to higher profits. On the other hand now an average Polish consumer had to swallow three times more chemicals than before and was buying a product with more water in it. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Common Market policies have affected other countries as well. For instance, Germany never allowed the use of liquid smoke in its products. When Germany became a member of the European Common Market it had to conform to new regulations and liquid smoke was added to meat products.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, hundreds of smaller sausage makers who made wonderful products, could not compete with larger companies and went out of business. Very few managed to survive by charging higher prices for their superior products and catering to a more demanding consumer.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Trade Associations </span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_7">(Cechy)</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">In XIII-XVIII century Poland there were trade associations </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(cechy)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> which enlisted highly trained and experienced members in their particular field. Membership was highly sought as those organizations provided many benefits to their members who in turn gained financial wealth. They also performed the following functions:</span></p><div class="calibre_21"> </div><ul class="calibre_11"><li class="calibre_12" value="1"><span class="calibre_2">Provided exclusive rights to supply and sell products in a particular city or geographical area.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="2"><span class="calibre_2">Enforced proper manufacturing methods to make sure that their products were of the highest quality.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="3"><span class="calibre_2">Enforced that delivered meat conformed to standards. </span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="4"><span class="calibre_2">Estimated market demand and accordingly controlled supply.</span></li><li class="calibre_13" value="5"><span class="calibre_2">Provided specialized training to new would-be members.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">The trade organizations structure remained basically the same. What varied was the amount of power they held. Originally they were very strong monopolistic organizations that protected interests and markets of their members. This type of structure continues to this day though it may be called a worker’s or trade union. The first sausage making trade organizations were established in XIII century in Kalisz and Torun (birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus), then in XIV century in Wroclaw and Szczecin. In XV century such organizations prospered in every larger city. At the end of XV century the trade unions made it very difficult for new members to join it. The apprenticeship was made longer, membership fees were higher and no new seats were created. That was done to limit competition and to stabilize prices at the same level. Unfortunately this course of action largely backfired as more people got involved in the sausage making trade by by-passing trade unions.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_22" src="../images/00078.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.8</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Sausage Makers Trade Association still functions inside Belchatow City Chamber of Commerce building.

Eventually they became training centers and issuers of the trade licences. Although they could not control the market the way they once did, they provided a great service by educating and licensing people who chose sausage making as a career. All individually owned businesses had to belong to the regional trade association that held jurisdiction over that area. Only there they could sign up for new courses, take exams and become members of the group. That allowed them to buy materials that were not available at the market at large, but were centrally distributed by the government to licenced establishments. They were also issued new recipes and only they were authorized to make those sausages. For the struggling economy, materials like fuel, meats and sausages were of utmost importance for the country’s survival. The meat industry and its distribution were centralized and so important for the government that any deviation in the recipe or adding food additives not called for was punishable by law. There were few larger affairs where dishonest operators introduced cheap meat substitutions to increase profits and we know of two cases where those responsible were sentenced to death and executed. The Polish Government still issues latest guidelines for making processed meats and sausages. However, they include all chemicals and additives as permissible by the European Common Market Law.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Which Way Are We Going?</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">There is an enormous interest in the traditional methods of food preparation. A customer is well aware of the present state of the meat industry and expects his products to be healthy. There is a universal dislike towards chemicals and people want to know what goes inside. And they start to make those products at home if only once or twice a year. After just one year our organization Wedliny Domowe has grown so much that its First National Convention took place in August 2006. In addition to hundreds of attendees a number of professional courses and demonstrations were offered. This three day gathering became so popular that it became a yearly celebrated event. Our 8th National Convention took place in August 2013. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Due to many requests from our members in February 2009 we have established our own sausage making school in Lazy. The main objective is to preserve traditional ways of sausage making and save traditional recipes from becoming extinct. These 3 day hands-on experience courses have become a popular event and are offered every month. There are also advanced sausage making, salami making, processing wild game and cheese making courses.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00039.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.10</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Wedliny Domowe First National Convention in 2006.

It is also often misunderstood. Kielbasa is the</span><br class="calibre3"/><span class="calibre_2">Polish general name for “a sausage.” You cannot walk into a Polish store and say: “please give me a pound of kielbasa.” The sales lady surrounded by 50 different types of kielbasa will inevitably reply: “yes, but which one”? It is like going into a deli and asking for a cheese. Sure, but which one: American, Provolone, Swiss, Gorgonzola, Gouda, Muenster - you have to provide some details. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2"> As the most popular Polish sausage is without a doubt Polish Smoked Sausage, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(Polska Kielbasa Wędzona)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> we are willing to speculate that this is what people have in mind. This is probably what the first immigrants brought with them to America. The little problem we face here is that you can find Polish Sausage in almost every supermarket in the USA and no two are made the same way.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Many books were written about sausages and each one provides some Polish sausage recipes. And they are all wrong but....one book had it right. The book, considered a classic today, was </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">The Great Sausage Recipes and Meat Curing,</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> written in 1976 by a Pole, Rytek Kutas from Buffalo. Later Mr. Kutas created the Sausage Maker Inc, the biggest mail order (now also selling online) company specializing in sausage making equipment and supplies.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_25" src="../images/00050.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 1.14</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Rytek Kutas. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_16">Photo courtesy The Sausage Maker, Buffalo, N.Y.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">The Polish Smoked Sausage has been well defined for centuries and almost everybody in Poland knows what goes inside.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">We do not intend to become the judges in this matter and instead </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">we are going to rely on</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Polish Government Standards for Polish Smoked Sausage as those rules have remained unchanged for the last 60 years. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">This way if any reader does not agree with our recipes,</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> he is welcome to contact the Polish Meat Industry in Warsaw, which still publishes the latest standards for meat products and sausages through the Polish Bureau of Standards </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(Polish Komitet Normalizacyjny).</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Before we anger many people who have been making Polish Smoked Sausage in their own way for many years, let’s clarify something further. If you add an ingredient that you or your children like into your sausage it is fine and you have the full right to say that you have made a better sausage than the famous Polish Smoked Sausage. You may say that your grandfather who came from Poland made the best Polish sausage in the world and we honor that. Maybe he used chicken stock instead of water or maybe he added something else. What we are trying to say is that he was making </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">his own version</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> of the known classic or some other Polish sausage and it could have tasted better for you and your family. We do not dispute that fact. You can of course add anything you like to your sausage, but it will no longer be the original Polish Smoked Sausage </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(Polska Kielbasa Wędzona)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> or another name brand sausage. Once you start changing ingredients, you create your own recipe and you may as well come up with your own name. Let’s unravel some of the mystery:</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> For centuries Polish Smoked Sausage was made entirely of pork. Then in 1964 the Polish Government introduced a second version of the sausage that was made of 80% pork and 20% beef. All other ingredients: </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">salt, pepper, sugar, garlic,</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> and marjoram remain the same in both recipes. The marjoram is optional but the garlic is a must.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The meat is cured before it is mixed with spices. </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The sausage is stuffed into a large hog casing: 36 - 38 mm.</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">4.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The traditional way was to cold smoke it for 1 to 1.5 days (it had to last for long time). </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">5.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> In most cases it is hot smoked and cooked in water today.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">For curiosity let’s see how large American manufacturers make Polish Smoked Sausage. Four sausages called Polish Kielbasa were bought at the local American supermarket in Florida and each of them were produced by a large and well known meat plant. Let’s see how they compare with the original Polish recipe.</span></p><table border="1" class="calibre4" valign="top"><tr class="calibre_26" valign="top"><td border="1" class="calibre_27"

recipes we tried to come up with a name of an equivalent Polish sausage that might fit the description but we couldn’t. It becomes quite clear that different manufacturers put different ingredients inside of the casing and the name Polish Kielbasa is used just for credibility and to gain the trust of the consumer. It seems that for some manufacturers any sausage that is smoked and stuffed in a 36 mm casing will qualify to be called the Polish Smoked Sausage or Polish Kielbasa. With all due respect to the Polish meat industry we can say that </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">although the recipes remain basically correct, binders, fillers and chemicals are widely used in order to improve yield and profits.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> That is why there is such an interest in home made products as people want the old quality and taste. It is not realistic to expect that a person will make sausages all the time, but it is feasible that he might do it once for Christmas and another time for Easter, exactly as it was done 100 years ago.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Although we do love the latest achievements in science and technology, we feel that the simple time proven methods of sausage manufacturing will still create higher quality products. It may not last as long on the shelf or in a refrigerator, it may lose its pink color sooner, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">but it will definitely taste better.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> I do not care much how pretty and plump they are, as they will not hang on the wall among my paintings and photographs. I am going to eat my sausages and I want them to be good.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">As mentioned before the best quality sausages were made in Poland until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Then in 2004 Poland joined the European Common Market and the situation deteriorated even further. Joining an organization of this kind is like living in a community controlled apartment complex. You lose your freedom and decision making and have to submit to regulations that are forced on you, be it the height of the grass on your lawn, the amount of guests you can accommodate overnight, or until what time you can make noise.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Why Would Sausages Made 50 Years Ago Be Better Than Those of Today? </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Well, there are three answers to this question and the one can be found already in the first step of sausage making-</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">the meat selection process.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Good meat cuts make good meat products, everybody knows that.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1. Meat quality.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The flavor of the meat, especially the pig, depends on its diet. If the animal eats a lot of barley </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(jęczmień)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> its meat is firm and fat. If the same pig will be fed with corn, its meat will be softer and fatter. Meat of pigs that were fed with kitchen meal leftovers or fed mainly with potatoes or beets, will contain more water in it. Famous Spanish Serrano hams even today are still made from pigs that graze freely on grass and eat a lot of oak acorns. Change that diet and you will change the quality of the ham. Old sausage makers were well aware of those factors and for them meat was quality food and they strived for the best. Today all pork tastes the same as it is mass produced, growth hormones and antibiotics are added, the pigs movement is restricted in order for the animals to grow as fast as possible. An average meat of today is not a quality food, it is just a product for sustaining our bodily functions. Living in large metropolitan centers, there is little we can do about choosing our meat. That large piece of meat that we buy from a supermarket will be most likely already individually packed and injected with liquid. If you read the label it will say: “up to 12 % of patented solution was added to improve tenderness and juiciness.” And the ingredients are listed on the label: potassium lactate, sodium phosphates, salt, sodium diacetate. Pig meat was perfect for thousands of years and now suddenly we need to improve it? Well, the truth is that this patented solution was added to improve meat’s shelf keeping qualities and preserve color, but that does not sound as nice as saying: to improve “tenderness and juiciness.” Another factor which is completely beyond our control is that the pigs of today are fed a specially prepared diet to make their meat much leaner. You have to take that under consideration because the fat is what makes sausages succulent and those meats used in old recipes were much fatter. You may not agree with me, but when I eat my hamburger I want it to be good and juicy, and I intend to compensate for my cholesterol in another way. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2. Adding water.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> It seems that today’s meat technology is obsessed with adding the maximum amount of water that the meat can hold inside. Entire labs with college educated scientists are working on better and more efficient ways of trapping water inside. Check out any meat equipment supplier and you will see that half of all equipment manufactured today is related to injecting meat with curing solutions and shaking it in tumblers to uniformly distribute this liquid. You can shake it all your life and it still will not distribute the solution so evenly as immersing a ham for 30 days in a container. And the final result? Of course more juiciness, after all you are eating more water now. But what happened to the original meat flavor? Well, it’s gone now so you have to use all kinds of flavor enhancements to compensate for it. Here is a simple example to follow. Let’s assume that for many years you have been drinking your favorite Earl Grey tea and you have always used one tea bag per cup of water. What will happen if you still will use one tea bag but add 50% more water to your tea? </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Will it taste the same or will it taste weaker?</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The answer is self-explanatory. The same happens to the quality of meat, it may be juicier but it will have a watered-down flavor. Commercially prepared curing solutions allow the introduction of up to 80% of the solution into the meat. In simpler terms you can add 8 lbs of solution (water, salt and chemicals) into 10 lbs of meat. After cooking, smoking and other processes the finished product will weigh 13 lbs what constitutes 30 % gain in relation to the original weight of meat.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">As a curiosity matter Soviet hams were: salted, cured, soaked, air-cured for 10 days at 12-18° C (54-64° F) and the relative humidity not exceeding 80%. Then they were smoked for 3 days at 30-35° C (86-95° F) or for 15 days at 18-20° C and dried for 10 days. The yield of the finished product was 70% of the original meat weight. Hams that are smoked today </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">after losing moisture</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> during smoking and cooking still weigh the same as what the original weight was. This miracle is due to the water that is injected into the meat and held there by phosphates. The present day ham may be juicier (extra water) than those old European products but its flavor does not even come close.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3. Extra ingredients.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Looking at the original recipes you will see how little spice was needed to impart a required flavor to a particular sausage. And this is how they were made and they were great. No binders, fillers or chemicals were used, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">only meat, salt, pepper, sugar and spices.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> The only chemical that was used was potassium nitrate and that ingredient was mandated by law in Poland and everywhere else in the world. Nitrates are still used in every country, although in its different form called nitrite. All those extra ingredients that are added to meat today have a certain cumulative value and will distort the flavor of the sausage. To compensate for that we have to increase the amount of spices and use flavor enhancers. We are not picking on meat plants that make those products as we understand that they have to walk a very thin line between profits and quality. Our aim is to convince you that you can make those sausages at home the way they were once made. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">To stress the point that you can make a superior product without adding chemicals let’s show the example of the famous Polish ham “Krakus” brand that was made during the Communism era. The main reason Polish Ham “Krakus” brand was the best ham in the world was that it was produced from carefully selected young hogs and no water was added. The consumer enjoyed full taste and flavor. The ham was cured in water, salt and nitrate only. Nothing else was added. This cure (1.5 - 7 %) was injected into an artery and then the ham was immersed in cure for 10 days. Then it was rinsed, dried, smoked and cooked. The ham was canned, it had its own certificate of authenticity and its own serial number. It was so good it grabbed 30 % of the American market share and was displayed in every supermarket. The Krakus brand still exists but is now produced by Polish concern “Animex” which is owned by American Smithfield Foods. In 2014 Smithfield Foods was purchased by China. We have no details about how this ham is manufactured today.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_3"></div>
