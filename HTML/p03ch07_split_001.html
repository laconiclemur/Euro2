<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Vegetables and salads are served as</span> <span class="bold">entreméses</span> <span class="bi">or starters in Spain.</span> Salads can be very simple—a few tomatoes with a sprinkling of chopped sweet onions; a bowl of crisp lettuce; sliced oranges with a few black olives; or diced tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers—or they can be complex and represent a light snack. An English friend who has had Spanish au pairs complained that they “could never leave vegetables alone,” and it is true. Spaniards do not boil vegetables for a plain side dish; they turn them into something that can be enjoyed as a dish in itself.</p>
<p class="summary"><span>An enormous variety of vegetables grows in Valencia, Murcia, Catalonia, Andalusia, and in the valleys of the great rivers of Spain. There are only a few Spanish vegetables that we cannot easily get in America. These include tiny tender baby artichokes that can be eaten whole and</span> <span class="italic">pochas,</span> <span>a type of white bean that is grown on family farms in La Rioja and Navarre and is eaten fresh. Most of the vegetables in our supermarkets come from far away and have not ripened in the sun. Some, such as artichokes, peas, and spinach, are frozen in a way that preserves their flavor and texture, so do not feel unhappy about using them if fresh ones are not available.</span></p>
<p class="summary">Vegetables were once dismissed in Spain as “poor food,” belonging to the vegetable patches of the peasantry. It is only since the middle of the twentieth century that they have become truly appreciated. And now star chefs of the <span class="italic">nueva cocina</span> have elevated them to a rank equal to that of foie gras and caviar on their menus—or at least that is what they say. These chefs do produce fantastic delicacies with them that are a take on what their grandmothers used to make. The peasant families who were the source of the old vegetable dishes lavished love and attention on their preparation, as vegetables were all they had. They sometimes added chickpeas and dried beans or chestnuts, sometimes almonds or pine nuts and raisins, and most often tiny bits of home-cured ham. This last tradition came about at the time when agents of the Inquisition often visited at mealtimes, obliging everyone to prove their Catholicism in an obvious way. During Lent, and on the many days of abstinence from meat throughout the year, ham was never included in a dish because it could leave you open to accusations of heresy and to punishment. But Lent made little difference to the urban poor anyway, as they lived on bread and vegetables alone. Monasteries famously devised special vegetable dishes to be cooked during Lent. They added herbs and sometimes substituted salt cod for ham.</p>
<p class="summary">One of the best things that the innovative chefs have done is to put grilled or roasted vegetables—which is the way peasants prepared them out in the fields—and lightly boiled vegetables on their menus, thereby making them trendy. <span class="italic">Hervido</span> (or <span class="italic">bollit</span> in Valencian Catalan), an assortment of boiled vegetables that represents the traditional evening first course in Valencia and Murcia, has spread to other parts. On my arrival in Madrid, my friend Alicia served up a platter of hot steamed tiny artichokes, tender wide green beans, and asparagus. I dressed the vegetables on my plate with sweet fruity extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of sea salt. It was all I could wish for. New or waxy potatoes and vegetables such as zucchini, leeks, scallions, chard, and spinach are all served in this way. Some like to add a little vinegar with the olive oil.</p>
<p class="summary">If you are vegetarian, you will find a huge choice of dishes here. You will also find vegetable dishes in other chapters, combined with rice, in fillings for pies, as toppings for pizza-type <span class="italic">cocas,</span> and in soups and omelets. They make perfect starters, and sometimes main dishes too.</p>
