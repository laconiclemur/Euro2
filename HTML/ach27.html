<p class="noindentb">My grandfather never quite learned to speak English properly, primarily because he was surrounded by Italians and didn’t have to rely on it to get by. My sisters and I loved his thick Italian accent. In Nonno Tropiano’s mouth, “vegetable soup” became “dirigible soup”—which, of course, sent all of us, my grandfather included, into fits of laughter. This is my grandmother’s basic chicken soup recipe, made special by the addition of her signature tiny, delicious chicken meatballs.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE SOUP</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 3-pound free-range chicken, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 quarts water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large celery stalks, cut into thirds</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 medium-size carrots, cut into thirds</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 sprigs fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large onion</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 very ripe or canned plum tomatoes, quartered</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE MEATBALLS</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> boneless, skinless chicken breast (or 1 pound ground chicken breast)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons freshly grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the quartered chicken in a large pot and cover with the water. Set the pot over medium-low heat and slowly bring the water to a simmer, skimming off any foam that accumulates on top. Add the celery, carrots, parsley, onion, and salt to taste. Simmer, uncovered, to soften the vegetables, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and continue to simmer, with the lid slightly askew, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_53"/><span class="red">2.</span> Remove the chicken, carrots, and onion to a platter and set aside. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the celery, parsley, and tomatoes. Transfer 1 cup of the broth to a small pot. Return the rest of the broth to the large pot. Shred the cooked chicken, discarding bones and skin, and add to the large batch of broth. Dice the cooked carrots and onions. Add them to the remaining broth along with the shredded chicken. Cover the pot and keep the broth warm while you cook the meatballs.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a food processor, finely chop the chicken breast. Transfer to a small bowl and add the egg, parsley, bread crumbs, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir with a fork to combine into a soft mixture.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Use a <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-teaspoon measuring spoon to scoop out a small portion of the mixture and roll between the palms of your hands to form small, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch balls. Continue rolling until all of the mixture has been made into meatballs, setting finished ones on a wax paper–lined plate or cutting board as you proceed. This recipe will make 20 or more <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch small meatballs. Bring the small pot containing the 1 cup of broth to a gentle boil and cook the meatballs, 8 to 10 at a time, in the broth, until they are cooked through, about 5 minutes. If the broth begins to evaporate, water may be added as needed. As they finish cooking, transfer them with a slotted spoon to the large pot of broth.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Serve with grated Parmesan or Romano cheese if desired.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Light white, medium white, and light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> The beauty of soup is that it can be varied to accommodate ingredients you have (or don’t have) on hand. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> The cooked chicken may be served separately, rather than shredding it and adding it to the soup. Serve the soup, containing the vegetables and the chicken meatballs, as a first course.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> 2 cups cooked pasta, such as orzo, or 2 cups cooked rice may be added to the strained broth and warmed through just before serving.</p>
<p class="bull"><a id="page_54"/><span class="red">•</span> 2 medium-size all-purpose potatoes, peeled and quartered, may be added to the soup with the tomatoes. Return to the pot with the carrots and onion, and serve with the soup.</p>
<p class="noindenta">This soup may be prepared using any fowl. Allow an additional 30 minutes of cooking time to tenderize the meat.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> This rich broth may be strained and frozen for up to 3 months and used in recipes that call for chicken broth.</p>
