<p class="flush_left_large"><a id="pg_500"/>Brindisa began with cheese, and it is largely through the many wonderful, engaging cheese-makers I have met, listened to for long hours, and become friends with over the years that I have come to know Spain’s more secret, remote and hidden landscape, its local traditions and foods. Many are mentioned or profiled throughout this book, as they have introduced me to far more than the skills of cheese-making, inviting me to cook with them and generously sharing their family recipes.</p>
<p class="indented_large">The culture of traditional cheese-making is unique: not only can it keep us in touch with the land and the seasons but it is a constant reminder of the determination, dedication and often courage required of the small-scale farmer or artisan. Nurturing a cheese with real personality and quality is <em>‘muy sacrificado’</em>, a challenge that demands daily uncompromising commitment and often an extended family network.</p>
<p class="indented_large">The history of cheese in Spain varies depending on who you talk to. The Basque country makes the oldest claim, dating it as far back as 8000 BC. Some give credit to Moorish technology, others insist that the real knowledge of cheese-making was spread across the country by monks. What is certain is that by Roman times, the process was already well understood. The writer on agriculture Columella, who was born in Cádiz, includes in his book <em>De Re Rustica</em> clear instructions about rennet coagulation using crushed green pine nuts, thistle, fig tree sap or thyme. He explains the pressing of the curds in wicker baskets, the process of salting manually or in brine, then ageing the cheese on wooden shelves, noting that ‘this kind of cheese can even be exported beyond the sea’.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Spain boasts hundreds of varieties of cheeses made from sheep’s, goat’s and cow’s milk. Since this is a country of vastly diverse ecological conditions, these often determine both the animal and the breed which can best adapt to a particular area. The local climate and the type of micro-organisms which act on the curds will also traditionally have an effect on the style, appearance of cheese produced <a id="pg_501"/>and the kind of maturing process it undergoes. Many of the shapes and patterns that pertain to a particular cheese were originally formed by whatever local material was available for making moulds, such as the ceramic bowls typical of the Levante coastline, or the carved wood and sycamore leaves often used in the mountains.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Until the eighties, however, the majority of cheeses were not known or valued beyond the immediate vicinity in which they were produced, let alone in the UK and abroad. After 1975, when Spain opened up to foreign trade following Franco’s death, local produce tended to be looked down on in favour of imported, often industrially made foods promoted for their consistency, milder flavours, smooth textures and their aura of improved hygiene. So processed cheese began appearing on shop counters, along with the likes of imported sunflower and soya oils, marketed as superior to olive oil. The first official listing of Spain’s cheeses by the Ministry of Agriculture was printed in 1969 and included forty-eight varieties, but the government’s food safety authorities continually closed down unregistered or illegal dairies and insisted that any new ones must use only pasteurised milk. As a result, many of the famous cheeses of northern Spain disappeared almost entirely, and indigenous breeds of cows were replaced by Friesian herds which produced higher volumes of milk, but with little of the character needed to maintain the quality of traditional cheeses.</p>
<p class="indented_large">In spite of this repression, however, unpasteurised artisan cheeses continued to be sold in small village markets in rural areas such as Asturias, Andalucía, Galicia and the Canaries, where local authorities would turn a blind eye so long as there were no outbreaks of food poisoning or disease in the herds.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Then, after years of totalitarian government, the early eighties heralded a resurgence of traditional culture, reflected in the formation of the first association of artisan cheese-makers. In 1981 Roncal cheese from the Navarran Pyrenees became the first Spanish cheese to be awarded <a id="pg_502"/>the status of PDO, the EU scheme which protects particular, distinctive regional and traditional foods, and by 1989 a total of eighty-one cheeses had been officially rediscovered, twenty-seven of which achieved PDO status. In that year the first cheese fair was staged in Trujillo, giving local producers and <em>afinadores</em> (specialist maturers) an outlet for their cheeses.</p>
<p class="indented_large">1989 was also the year that, in the fledgling days of Brindisa, my brother, Mark, and I began looking for Spanish cheeses to bring into the UK. We were really ahead of our time, as there was limited distribution beyond the main cities and it was a big challenge to decide what, and how much, to buy, and then where to sell it.</p>
<p class="indented_large">The regulatory council for each PDO determines the rules, standards and controls that will govern its producers according to six basic criteria, which are: that the cheese needs to be recognised by the name of the area in which it originates; it must display qualities that reflect the geography and climate in which it is produced; the cheese and the milk from which it is made must pertain to a particular territory; the raw material needs to have particular characteristics, for example, the dairy animals must be of a certain breed; the milk and cheese must be produced according to particular methods; and there must be a system of control and a guarantee of origin and quality on the label.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Every batch of cheese that is made must be checked and analysed and once approved will be awarded the stamp and/or label that carries the logo of the PDO, and a number relating to the specific dairy, so that each cheese is traceable.</p>
<p class="indented_large">There is no doubt that the PDOs of Spain have helped enormously to give Spanish cheeses the support and identity that they needed, both at home and abroad. However, the system leaves big gaps and pockets of land where very good cheeses are made that do not have the PDO identity. The stamp cannot always acknowledge the difference between a relatively industrial cheese and <a id="pg_503"/>the produce of an artisan dairy which places great importance on forging an important, sustainable relationship with the environment, and takes great care over the quality of life and feed afforded to their dairy herds. Nor can it recognise the endlessly different and fascinating nuances that a skilled cheese-maker can achieve.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Of course, one of the constant issues facing the cheese industry in Spain, as all over Europe, is how to balance the introduction of modern chilled facilities and provide high-quality products at more reasonable prices, while preserving cherished handed-down traditions and artisan techniques. In many areas, in these tougher economic times, smaller cheese-makers are once again having to fight for their existence against the dominance of the big dairies, who want milk volumes on a massive scale from animals bred to produce quantity over quality. This brings down the price of milk, making it harder for those farmers of traditional breeds who produce lower volumes of higher-quality milk to maintain a viable place in the market. As a consequence, in some areas traditional farming and shepherding jobs are in danger of being wiped out for good.</p>
<p class="indented_large">At Brindisa, we see it as our mission to discover and support these small, often remote dairies wherever we can, and the following is a selection – by no means exhaustive – of some of the ones that we and our customers most enjoy, together with some suggestions for the wines, and/or fruit and nut accompaniments which enhance the eating experience.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Some of these cheeses are only ever with us in the UK for a short seasonal visit and not very widely available, but there has been an explosion of artisan cheese shops in Spain, even in the smallest provincial towns, so if you are there it is worth seeking some of them out and, of course, there will be many, many other local ones to explore.</p>

<p class="quote">‘traditional blues and some very buttery soft cheeses’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Spain’s traditional blue cheeses all come from the north, as do some very buttery, soft cheeses. The green valleys and humid meadows stretch around the coastal regions, and Galicia, Asturias, León and Cantabria in the north-west all benefit from abundant rainfall and plenty of land on which to graze dairy cattle, and small herds of sheep and goats too. The crags of the Picos de Europa mountains, with their unique eroded limestone landscape and some of the deepest gorges and caves in Europe, offer their steep pastures to hardened shepherds.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Picos de Europa blues</h3>
<p class="flush_left">The farmers of the Picos de Europa mountains have moved their cattle herds around these rich pastures for centuries, diversifying into mixed herds including sheep and goats. The milk from any combination of these animals can be used to make the cheese – although cow’s milk has predominated over time. The cheeses were originally pressed and salted by hand and wrapped in sycamore leaves so they were easier to handle, as their rind became slippery and sticky during maturation in the region’s natural, damp mountain caves, rich with the <em>Penicillium roqueforti</em> mould which would penetrate the cheese and give it its distinctive blue-green veins. Some, like Gamonéu, are made in tiny quantities, and are often only found within the Picos de Europa mountains.</p>
<p class="indented">As well as serving these blue cheeses as they are, throughout the Brindisa kitchens we use them a great deal in salads with walnuts and beetroot, or endive; in sauces for cuts of Basque beef, or to add to pumpkin soup.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Cabrales PDO (cow’s milk or mixed milk, i.e. cow’s, sheep’s and goat’s), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is an artisan cheese still produced in a traditional way, but it is not one for the fainthearted: you love or hate it. The thin, muddy rind of the cheese is sticky and bumpy, with a fetid aroma (think silage and fermented fruit), and although the mottled, yellow-white interior, with its veins of green-blue, can be crumbly in texture when young, it becomes creamy as it ages. It has a strong flavour that can almost burn the palate, with a persistent aftertaste, and as it ages it can become completely blue, with almost no yellow paste. In the old days, there was much <em>machismo</em> associated with eating very old, rank Cabrales, and if it had some <em>gusanos</em> (maggots) inside, so much the better! Thankfully, those days have gone, but a piece of Cabrales should still always be offered at the end of a selection of cheeses.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_505"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg505.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_506"/>The cheeses are matured in deep, damp limestone caves for a minimum of two months, and each cave has natural running water, a south-facing opening and an exit to allow the <em>soplados</em> (breezes) to flow through and create the blue veins without the need to pierce the paste. The cheeses are a slightly irregular round shape and can be identified easily, as these days they are wrapped in sheets of deep green foil to evoke the sycamore leaves that were originally used. The sycamore leaf also appears on the PDO label along with the serial number of the cheese.</p>
<p class="indented">Cabrales is best paired with a sweet sherry like Pedro Ximénez, or a fruity cider, and we like to serve it with a slice from one of the artisan wheels of pressed prunes and walnuts made for us in Catalunya.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Valdeón PGI (blue, mainly cow’s milk), pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The village of Posada de Valdeón, which gives the cheese its name, is on the south side of the Picos mountains in the province of León, surrounded by high passes, rushing mountain rivers and spectacular jagged peaks, and the dairy is the only industry in its valley.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheese has a rough, grey rind with tiny specks of red and blue mould, and inside the paste is a pale creamy colour with veins of greeny-blue mould running through it. It is made all year round, with pasteurised cow’s milk blended with a little goat’s milk.</p>
<p class="indented">The dairy has managed to move very capably from traditional production to a more industrial, modern set-up, so that while the cheese is still wrapped in sycamore leaves, it is matured (for at least a month and a half) in modern curing chambers rather than caves. The conditions are not as humid and although this produces a less intense flavour, the creamy freshness of the cheese has proved very popular. It is outstandingly well balanced, strong but not overwhelming, salty but not overly so, and it is fatty and melts in the mouth, leaving an elegant aftertaste.</p>
<p class="indented">Valdeón is best paired with a sweet wine such as port or a robust white Rioja and served with walnuts and dried fruits.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Picón Bejes Tresviso PDO (cow’s milk or mixed milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The name Picón indicates the sharp flavour of this ancient blue cheese, and Bejes and Tresviso are the names of the two villages around which it is produced.</p>
<p class="indented">Picón Bejes Tresviso has the lowest production of any PDO cheese, since the area is so isolated and hard to reach. It is made from a blend of cow’s, sheep’s and goat’s milk – predominantly cow’s milk – and matured for a minimum of three months. Traditionally, it was matured in abandoned mines and natural, damp caves but our current supplier prefers to exert more control, maturing his cheeses in a small modern curing chamber high in the mountains.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em>Penicillium roqueforti</em> which forms the greeny-blue veins of mould is allowed to penetrate the paste naturally, and, unusually, the slightly irregular round cheeses (varying from 1–3kg and 12–13cm in height) are never turned, resulting in an uneven blueing, darker at the bottom and lighter at the top. The rind that forms is a beautiful pale orange, slightly sticky with rich yeasty aromas, but the interior is pale yellow and has an open, creamy texture and an enjoyable balance of bite, butter and salt.</p>
<p class="indented">As with Cabrales, the cheeses were originally wrapped in sycamore leaves, which has given way to foil – in this case, gold.</p>
<p class="indented">Picón Bejes Tresviso pairs well with sweet wines such as Moscatel and dried fruit and nuts.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">La Peral (cow’s milk), pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Antonio León’s family, now in its third generation, adapted a family recipe in the 1920s when they built the modern La Peral dairy, where the cheese is made on a small scale using pasteurised cow’s milk. It is matured for two months and has a sticky yellow rind with a pale yellow interior of <a id="pg_507"/>glistening curds speckled with blue veins, a gentle omelette-y aroma and a creamy, briny flavour that gradually develops into a clean, fresh, mild blue taste.</p>
<p class="indented">La Peral pairs very well with aged white Riojas or Asturian cider, and is excellent with forest fruits such as blackberries and hazelnuts.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Fresh cow’s milk cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a">Tetilla PDO (cow’s milk), mostly pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The original home of this cheese is the Galician province of La Coruña, but now it can be produced throughout Galicia. <em>Tetilla</em> is the diminutive of <em>teta</em>, meaning small breast, and refers to the cheese’s distinctive shape, which comes from the mould, similar to a ladle, in which it is made (it may also be called <em>de perilla</em>, ‘round pear-shaped’). Most Tetilla is now made in modern dairies, although a number of artisan makers still survive. On rare occasions you might find unpasteurised cheeses made from the milk of Friesian or Gallega cattle which feed on natural scrub and pastures, plus fodder crops such as corn, beets and turnips. It is aged for just seven days and is soft, elastic and straw-coloured, with a smooth, waxy, yellow rind and a mild, milky sweet flavour and buttery aroma that make it very accessible and popular. Tetilla pairs well with fruity white wines like Godello and it is served most often with quince or apple paste. It also makes a very good sandwich with <em>piquillo</em> peppers, or try it melted over slices of <em>lacón</em> (wet-cured ham from Galicia) or gammon.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Pasiego de Las Garmillas and La Jarradilla (cow’s milk), pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Pasiego is originally made in the Cantabrian valleys through which the River Pas makes its way to the Cantabrian Sea. It is sold at about 15 days old, and has a subtle, beguiling and enticing character. The interior is soft and fatty, with an aroma of fresh yogurt and mountain streams, and the flavour is surprisingly mild.</p>
<p class="indented">It comes in different guises. The cheese made by Álvaro Carral at La Jarradilla, his wife’s family dairy in Barcenilla near Villacarriedo, is tall, with a slightly firmer texture and the hint of a rind, whereas the one from Las Garmillas in Ampuero is a fragile, primitive patty with no rind that comes wrapped in wax paper.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheese is good for breakfast, eaten with crusty bread or fresh fruit. It also combines very well with the savoury flavours of anchovies and <em>piquillo</em> peppers, together with a glass of dry cider.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Rey Silo (cow’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">At the Rey Silo dairy in Pravia, named after the eighth-century king who set up the Asturian court there, Ernesto Madera López has devoted his energies to bringing the ancient Afuega’l Pitu cheese recipes of Asturias into modern times. These are mentioned in texts dating back to the eighteenth century, and the cheeses were usually made on the farm with milk from local dairy herds of Friesians or indigenous breeds. Some were formed by the milk fermenting spontaneously in the heat and were bound in a knotted cloth, while others had animal rennet added and the firmer curd would be shaped in a perforated mould. They could be fresh or briefly matured, pyramid or tri-conical shaped, or they might be rounded like a large ox-heart tomato, with a rippled rind formed using the culture, <em>Geotrichum candidum.</em></p>
<p class="indented">Ernesto’s cheeses are diligently crafted into flattened cone shapes and matured for up to 20 days in cellars on the banks of the Nalón river. The cheese comes in two styles: white or red (thanks to the addition of <em>pimentón</em>), and inside the rinds, with their entrancing patterns, they have a quite unusually compact texture, a little like mashed potato, with a fresh aroma of white cabbage and a sweet flavour reminiscent of white chocolate (the red version also has a pronounced spicy finish): utterly delicious.</p>
<p class="indented">Both cheeses are best paired with medium-bodied white wines such as Riojas, while the <a id="pg_508"/>red cheeses would go very well with bigger whites such as Mas d’en Compte from Celler Cal Pla in Priorat, or Godello whites from Galicia. I also tasted them with local cider, which was an excellent match.</p>
<p class="indented">They are fine with fruit, but also excellent in cooking. Many of Spain’s leading chefs use them in delicate foams and sauces and pair them with fish and shellfish, from anchovies and sardines, to tuna tartare or mussels.</p>
<h3 class="a-head" id="g2">Mountain sheep’s milk cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a">Idiazábal DOP (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Idiazábal is a shepherd’s cheese that is produced throughout the whole of the Basque country and the north of Navarra in the mountains and valleys such as Urbia, Aralar, Urbasa and Gorbea. On a visit to the region in the company of some British and American cheese experts, we ate at a local restaurant, where to finish the meal we were given a cheeseboard of half a dozen Idiazábal cheeses from local makers, which, despite their similar appearance, all tasted remarkably individual. One, in particular, stood out, made with milk from a breed of sheep known as Carranzana, which a father and daughter team were trying to save from extinction – proof of the worth of keeping special breeds for small-scale cheese production.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally the shepherds herded the sheep up into the mountains in the summer, to enjoy the fresh pastures. Here they made the cheese and then in October they would guide their herds down again to the valley of Goierri, where they sold the cheeses at the market in Idiazábal village, hence the name.</p>
<p class="indented">Since 2008, these small-scale shepherd cheese-makers have established their own Artzai Gazta PDO, which further enhances their Idiazábal identity, setting specific criteria for artisan production. This dictates that a maker can only use milk from his own herds of sheep, he must also make his own rennet and ultimately control the whole cycle from animal husbandry to marketing the finished cheese.</p>
<p class="indented">The hard cheeses, pressed in moulds, and distinguished by the red band on their label, are made from the raw milk of the Latxa sheep, a breed found only in the Basque country and next-door Navarra, which are easily recognised by their long straggly coats. They are well adapted to these high, alpine pastures, have a healthy appetite and are excellent producers of milk.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses are very compact, generally made in 1kg or 3kg rounds. They are aged for a minimum of two months, bone white in colour, and the flavour is pronounced and pleasantly fatty in the mouth, with a caramel sweetness from the ewe’s milk which begins modestly and ends with a touch of salt and acidity.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses can be smoked or unsmoked, but most commercially made ones are smoked. Only natural woods are permitted, and the beech and hawthorn that is typically used gives a bronze colour to the smooth, oily rind and allows the mild sweet taste of smoke to hover over the distinctive flavour of sheep’s cheese.</p>
<p class="indented">It is said that this style came about almost by accident, because the shepherds would cure and store their cheeses in the rafters of the huts known as <em>txabolas</em> that were dotted around the mountains and where the shepherds would stay. The <em>txabolas</em> were provided by the Basque government but were not permitted to have chimneys, as this would denote a permanent home. So when the shepherd lit his daily wood fire in the hut on which to cook, the cheeses would become smoked naturally.</p>
<p class="indented">Both cheeses also play an important role in local cooking. The smoked version is often used with blue fish or red meats, while the unsmoked one is better in soufflés or cheesecakes.</p>
<p class="indented">Idiazábals pair well with the local white wine, Txacoli, or dry cider, and are good served with walnuts and quince paste.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Roncal DOP (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The environment and climate of the Roncal valley is similar to the alpine conditions of the Idiazábal <a id="pg_509"/>region, in the neighbouring Basque country (see <a href="chapter_006.html#g2">here</a>), and shares the same breed of mountain-hardy Latxa sheep, whose milk makes an extremely handsome cheese with a persistent and interesting flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">At the Larra dairy, an extraordinary concern run by artisan shepherd-cheese-makers in an ultra-modern, solar-powered environment, the curd, once cut, is manually pressed into moulds, originally of beech wood, then salted and matured – preferably for at least four months, though the best are aged for up to 12 months. Once matured, the rind becomes slightly darkened by the natural moulds that are a sign of an excellent cellar-aged cheese. The interior is very firm and dense, and its sheepy flavour has a touch of burnt caramel and a strong piquancy that lingers on the finish, with hints of dried fruit. Individual cheeses can generally range from 2 to 3 kilos in weight, although smaller cheeses can now be found.</p>
<p class="indented">Roncal pairs well with full-bodied red wines from Navarra and La Rioja and is good in cooking, for example, in a gratin of artichokes or grated over asparagus.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Pyrenean cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a">El Benasqués (cow’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The cheese takes its name from the valley in which it is produced, within the national park of Posets-Maladeta in the Huesca area of the Pyrenees, where the flora and fauna of the pasture are exceptional. Amado Ballarín and Carmen Demur use only raw milk from their own herd and mature the lightly pressed cheese for 2–4 months in caves beneath their house. It has a natural velvety rind whose aromas are reminiscent of mushrooms and cool damp wood, while the flavour of the cheese is distinctive and enticing, sweet with milky, buttery tones and a hint of raw hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="indented">It is mainly eaten before dinner with drinks, or afterwards, and pairs perfectly with the red wine of the area, such as a Crianza from Enate.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Tou dels Til.lers and Tupí de Sort (cow’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These cheeses are made in the town of Sort, in an area of the Pyrenees in the north-west of Catalunya called Pallars Sobirà, which I first discovered in the early nineties. It is a beautiful region, deep in the mountains, where shepherds guide their sheep over the high passes of Los Encantados peaks. It is a favourite place for horse-riding and hiking, where river experts know every turn and rock of the roaring rapids enjoyed by canoeists.</p>
<p class="indented">Agricultural engineer Josep Font, together with a group of Pyrenean cattle farmers, started the artisan Tros de Sort dairy in 1995 in order to add extra value to their outstanding unpasteurised milk. The cheeses range from hard, pressed cheese to lactic, soft cheese such as Tou dels Til.lers, which is similar to a Camembert.</p>
<p class="indented">One of the most interesting styles is Tupí, named after the little ceramic pot it is presented in. It is a strong, twice-fermented paste, originally designed to use up leftover cured cheese, which is broken up and fermented again with olive oil and alcohol so that the bubbling yeasts turn the dry cheese into a creamy spread.</p>
<p class="indented">Tupí can only really be paired with sweeter drinks such as cider or dessert wines, while the creamy, mild Tou dels Til.lers goes very well with the red wines of Navarra or Somontano.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Garrotxa (goat’s milk), pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Garrotxa was created in the eighties by a group of city dwellers who opted for a rural life, re-inventing the style of cheese originally made in the Comarca of La Garrotxa from the pasteurised milk of Murcia–Granada goats. These animals thrive on the green, herb-filled slopes of the foothills of the Pyrenees and the lowlands of Tarragona. The cheeses are now made in a number of small dairies and most are identified by the producer’s name. At Brindisa we work with Toni Chueca and his wife, Maria Rosa Heras, of La Bauma dairy, just outside Borredà in the <a id="pg_510"/>forested mountains of Berguedà.</p>
<p class="indented">The Catalan climate is temperate but with significant humidity, which helps create <em>pell florida</em>, the fluffy, velvety-grey bloom typical of most Garrotxa cheeses. They are semi-cured and cylindrical. Inside, the compact paste is snow-white with a slightly soft and elastic spring to it. It has a mild goaty, yet floral, aroma and taste. At four weeks old the cheese is very creamy; then, as it ages, the paste close to the rind becomes more complex and intense while the very centre retains its moisture, developing gorgeous savoury notes of herb and mushroom.</p>
<p class="indented">Garrotxa is produced all year round and can be served marinated in herb-infused oil, lightly fried, or with hazelnuts and plums. It pairs well with Verdejos and Penedès white wines.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1" id="p510">Ermesenda and Castellot (cow’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The Mas d’Eroles dairy was founded by Salvador Maura, an engineer who worked for the regional Ministry of Agriculture in Barcelona for many years before deciding to move to the mountains and start his own dairy on a milk-producing farm in Adrall, close to Andorra. He experiments with a range of recipes, putting his own interpretation on to them. All are made with raw cow’s milk, and matured in caves.</p>
<p class="indented">Ermesenda is a large round cheese, best aged for around three months. It has a natural washed rind and a slightly elastic, close texture. There are aromas of wild mushrooms and the initial sweet flavour is both fruity and honeyed. As the cheese matures the flavours become full-bodied and meaty.</p>
<p class="indented">Castellot, also at its best at around three months old, is inspired by the Italian technique used to make Castelmagno cheese (in both Italian and Catalan the name means ‘magnificent Castle’). This is known colloquially as <em>pasta rota</em>, in which the paste is kept in a mould for a day, then crushed and salt is added before it is pressed a second time.</p>
<p class="indented">The paste is yellow and has some small eyes. The taste at the beginning is lemony, with interesting vegetal notes reminiscent of nettles, intensified since the fat and cream has drained away, and the texture is close but crumbly.</p>
<p class="indented">All the Mas d’Eroles cheeses are extremely good with red wines from Catalunya, such as those from the Empordà <em>bodega</em> Castillo Perelada – my personal favourite is their 5 Fincas Reserva.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec210"><a id="pg_511"/>Membrillo/Codonyat</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Quince paste</p>
<p class="flush_left">Quince is one of the flavours of Spain that my husband, Rupert, says takes him straight back to his childhood in Santorcaz, near Madrid, because when the fruit was in season there would always be a big bowlful and the aroma would fill the house. While in the UK quince might be made into desserts, and in the Middle East it is a favourite ingredient in spiced meat stews, in Spain the fruit is chiefly turned into the rich fruity paste <em>membrillo</em>. Thick slices of <em>membrillo</em> sandwiched between María biscuits was Rupert’s favourite playground snack to take to school.</p>
<p class="indented">And while some chefs might use <em>membrillo</em> in a more adventurous way – Sam and Sam Clark, of Moro, use a layer in their <em>tarta de Santiago</em> (almond tart) – in Spain people generally prefer to eat it in the time-honoured way, with cheese. It is especially beautiful paired with a fresh white Queso de Burgos, made with sheep’s milk, a fresh goat’s cheese such as Cabra del Tiétar Fresco<em>, requesón</em> (pressed ricotta), or yogurt.</p>
<p class="indented">I met our very first supplier of <em>membrillo</em> (known as <em>codonyat</em> in Catalunya), over 20 years ago in Plaza del Pi in Barcelona, which is a small square on the opposite side of the Ramblas to the Boqueria market, where a small group of artisans used to set up their stalls. Among them was Víctor, with his ponytail and big smile, selling blocks of deep coppery-amber fruit paste.</p>
<p class="indented">At that time most commercial quince paste was made in the south, around Córdoba, and was quite yellow, smooth and sugary, in the style known as <em>dulce de</em> <em>membrillo</em>. By contrast, Víctor’s <em>codonyat</em> was of the style known as <em>carne</em> (meat) <em>de membrillo</em> and was much closer to the paste people made at home: deeper in colour, more fleshy and fibrous, with a good grain. It was beautifully balanced and not too sweet. It was the best quince paste I had ever tasted.</p>
<p class="indented">Víctor was a real pioneer, who had run one of the best fruit and veg stores in Barcelona, called El Pèsol (the Green Pea), but moved out of the city to make his <em>codonyat</em> in Corbera de Llobregat. All he had was a tiny space with a fridge for the quince pulp, a couple of jam-making machines and the help of a beautiful girl who used a domestic iron to gently and very lightly heat-seal the wrapping around the quince once the blocks had set. Finally, it was presented in simple wooden boxes at a time in Spain when to show off a food so elegantly was quite revolutionary.</p>
<p class="indented">Víctor has diversified over the years and makes other pastes with fig, or orange and tomato, and I have also seen industrial producers put squares of different flavours together in blocks that look like a Battenberg cake, which I find overly sweet and more about pleasing the eye than the palate. For me, the classic quince <em>membrillo/codonyat</em> will always be the best.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">How to choose <strong><em>membrillo</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">There is a vast variation in the colour, texture and flavour of <em>membrillo</em>, from grainy and dark to light and golden; from fruity to sweet; some so thick you can slice them, some so soft they are spoonable.</p>
<p class="method">You can buy very good quince paste in jars, which can be kept at ambient temperature, but these tend to have higher levels of sugar in them. Personally, I always prefer <em>membrillo</em> sliced from a block. Not only does it look more beautiful, but the texture is more unctuous and juicy. Block <em>membrillo</em> is best kept in the fridge, as it retains its juiciness better.</p>
<p class="method">More industrially made <em>membrillos</em>, generally from Córdoba, tend to be yellower in colour and sweeter than artisan ones, which are usually a deeper coppery orange that feels more reminiscent of the fruit.</p>
<p class="method">You want the paste to have some texture, but not be too fibrous.</p>
<p class="method">Since quince has a very short season, most producers will purée and freeze as much fruit <a id="pg_512"/>as possible in order to provide <em>membrillo</em> all year round. However, some makers will also buy in quinces from the southern hemisphere, especially Chile (though this won’t be apparent from the label). While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as with the very best jams, the highest-quality <em>membrillo</em> will be made with the very best local fruit, in small batches.</p>
<p class="method">Some are made with fructose, rather than sugar, which doesn’t taste different but just offers an alternative.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec211">Membrillo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Quince paste</p>
<p class="flush_left">Like making your own jam, there is a special satisfaction in achieving the complexity of flavour and texture of <em>membrillo</em> in your own kitchen. It is an amazing way to preserve fruit, and if kept well wrapped in greaseproof paper in a larder or a fridge the <em>membrillo</em> should easily keep for up to six months. This recipe is simple, but be prepared for plenty of stirring.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 1kg</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5kg quinces</p>
<p class="ingredients">rind of 1 lemon, cut in strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 1kg sugar</p>
<p class="method">Put the quinces (which will be rock hard) into a large pan, add enough water to cover, together with the lemon rind and cinnamon, bring to the boil, then cook for around 40 minutes. When the quinces are tender you should be able to push a skewer easily through the centre of the fruit.</p>
<p class="method">Drain the quinces, leave to cool and discard the lemon rind and cinnamon. Peel and core the fruit, keeping the seeds and skin on one side.</p>
<p class="method">The seeds and skin are high in pectin, which helps the <em>membrillo</em> to set, so put these into a sieve and push through with a wooden spoon. Add this pulp to the cooked fruit.</p>
<p class="method">Now weigh the cooked fruit and add the same weight in sugar. Either mash to a smooth paste by hand or use a blender. Put the fruit and sugar mixture back into the pan and heat to just below boiling, stirring regularly for at least 40 minutes to allow any excess water to evaporate.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, line a loaf tin with baking paper, and when the mixture is ready, spoon it in, smooth the top and put into the fridge to set overnight.</p>
<p class="method">If by any chance your <em>membrillo</em> hasn’t set, put the loaf tin into a low oven (about 90°C) for an hour or so to let more of the water evaporate.</p>

<p class="quote">‘some of the most recognised cheeses in Spain’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The central area of Spain consists of two high <em>mesetas</em> (plateaux) – Castilla y León and Castilla La Mancha – with Madrid sitting between the two. These have always been home to numerous hardy sheep breeds such as the Merina, Castellana, Churra and Ojalada, which thrive in the very dry climate that ranges from -10°C in winter, with icy winds coming off the snowy Guadarrama mountains, to 40°C heat in summer.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses produced from the milk of these sheep are some of the most recognised in Spain. Hard-pressed and tyre-like, they fall into two main categories: those made with pure sheep’s milk, which can be some of the best cheeses you might ever taste; while those made with a blend of cow and goat’s milk, much of which is brought in from outside the region, tend to be everyday cheeses. However, newer prize-winning cheeses made by innovative dairies using only high-quality local goat’s milk are now emerging too.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Hard sheep’s milk cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a">Manchego DOP (sheep’s milk), pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">There are so many Manchegos – or cheeses calling themselves Manchego – that it is quite easy to be overwhelmed. To make sure you have an authentic Manchego, always check for the PDO label and for the serial number of the cheese, which will be on its base and label. Then try to establish the size of the dairy, which can help identify how far production has been industrialised, since most Manchego is now made in factories using milk that is transported long distances, pasteurised and put through a fully automated production line.</p>
<p class="indented">The best cheeses, however, are made with raw milk and have a natural rind. There are still some smaller artisan concerns that produce these, combining manual and modern techniques and using milk that comes from within 30 kilometres of the dairy. These will have <em>queso manchego artesano</em> on the label.</p>
<p class="indented">All the cheeses are pressed and salted and patterned in the traditional Castilian way, i.e. the sides are imprinted with the zigzag weave of the local esparto grass, which was once used as a plaited belt (<em>pleitas)</em> to contain the curds, and the tops and bottoms have the imprint of the wooden boards which were used for pressing. These days, however, plastic moulds are used to create these patterns, rather than grass and wood.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses stand about 8cm high and 20cm in diameter although smaller ones are now made. The rind can range from natural muddy grey on artisan cheeses through darkish yellow on wax-coated cheeses, to the flat dark brown of some industrial cheeses that have been painted with food-grade paraffin wax. The ivory-coloured <a id="pg_516"/>paste inside is speckled with small irregular eyes and the texture is compact and dry, yet creamy and rich in flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">Manchego is matured to various stages. At 60 days (the minimum curing time) up to five months it is called semi-cured; from 6–11 months it is cured, and from 12–48 months it is <em>añejo</em> (meaning one year) or <em>Gran Reserva</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">The best Manchego tastes of dry summer grasses, with a hint of roast lamb and caramel and a faint earthy aroma of lanolin. Younger cheeses are buttery and slightly oily on the palate, while older cheeses are granular, with crunchy crystals and a more spicy flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">This is a cheese that should be eaten simply with good white bread drizzled with olive oil and maybe a hint of tomato rubbed across it. It pairs best with a <em>cava</em> or, alternatively, a Riojan wine, either a hearty red such as Sierra Cantabria from the Eguren family, or an aged white such as Viña Izadi.</p>
<p class="indented">As well as certified Manchegos, the region produces many cured sheep’s milk cheeses that are sometimes coated with lard and rosemary or other herbs, then wrapped so that as they mature the flavour penetrates right through the paste. Despite not being allowed to call themselves Manchego, they are often elegant, aromatic and every bit as good as a cheese carrying the mark of the DOP. In fact, some people prefer them.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_515"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg515.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c-head1" id="p516a">Zamorano DOP (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In the Museo Etnografico (Ethnographic Museum) in Zamora you can see cheese-making utensils that date back 4,000 years, and numerous references in local historical documents, including the archives of two important twelfth-century Cistercian monasteries, Santa María de Moreruela and San Martín de Castañeda, confirm that Zamora has been a consistently important area for sheep farming and cheese-making. It is also a region where the skills of the shepherd are still valued (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_526">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">The traditional sheep of the region are primarily the black-and-white-faced Churra and the pure white Zamoran Castellana, and only the raw milk from these can be used in the cheese. The sheep are nourished on the traditional crops of the region: cereals, pulses and vine cuttings, with certain supplementary foods added to enhance their diet. However, the population has been constantly whittled down as more and more high-volume milk-producing breeds, originally from the Middle East, such as the Awassi and the Assaf, are infiltrating dairy herds.</p>
<p class="indented">The Zamorano cheese-makers established their own PDO in 1982 to protect and distinguish their cheese from the other Castilian varieties of Manchego and Castellano, so look for the flower-shaped design of the label. Like Manchego, the cheeses are characterised by the design of the traditional grass <em>pleitas</em> and wooden pressing boards, but are deeper and bigger, at about 3kg, and 8–12cm in height and 18–22cm in diameter. The rind has a darker yellow colour, often blackened slightly by moulds, while the interior is an ivory yellow, dense and compact, with the tiniest of eyes spread irregularly throughout. The flavour is long and nutty with a pleasant sharpness on the finish.</p>
<p class="indented">Maturation must be for a minimum of 100 days, but can be up to 16 months, and once matured, the cheese can also be cut and marinated in herb-infused olive oil.</p>
<p class="indented">Zamorano cheeses, particularly the Gran Reserva from Félix Vicente Pastor, go extremely <a id="pg_517"/>well with the best bold yet elegant red wines made along the Duero river, such as La Ribera del Duero, Viña Pedrosa and Cillar de Silos; or those from Toro, such as Bodegas Vega Saúco.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Castellano (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The pastures around Palencia and Burgos in Castilla y León are incredible: full of mushrooms, wild flowers, camomile, thyme and other herbs, and the long, slender grass re-grows constantly, as there is a good amount of rain. As a result, the local Churra and Castellana sheep produce excellent intense and aromatic milk, and the three Paramío brothers, who set up the Campos Góticos dairy in Villerías de Campos in Palencia in 1994, are determined to keep their herds intact and respect the traditional recipes.</p>
<p class="indented">Their Castellano has a natural rind, traditionally imprinted with the pattern of plaited grass, and combines sweet and piquant flavours, honeyed overtones and a floral aroma. The January and February cheeses will be the best of the year, and while we like the subtle grassy, nutty cheeses that have been matured for 2–4 months, the dairy matures the cheeses for up to 12–15 months and you could even eat them up to 17–20 months, as they don’t spoil; on the contrary, the flavours are enhanced with maturity.</p>
<p class="indented">Castellano pairs very well with big red wines such as El Gordito or Viña Pedrosa and should be served just as it comes, with crusty white bread or with a slice of pressed fig and almond wheel.</p>

<h3 class="a-head"><a id="pg_518"/>Soft and semi-soft cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a">Monte Enebro (goat’s milk), pasteurised</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This unique cheese, which has won many gold medals at international competitions, is the creation of the late Rafael Báez (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_520">here</a>). It involves a slow lactic coagulation of the milk, the use of a ladle to cream the curds into the cheese moulds, and the introduction of the blue <em>Penicillium</em> <em>roqueforti</em> in the maturing chambers. Here the cheeses stay for 20 days, growing the thinnest of natural, light brown rinds with a rich crust of natural bluish-grey mould that helps retain the creaminess of the cheese and give it an earthy, mushroomy aroma.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses are shaped like a flattish, rounded log or ‘mule’s hoof’ (<em>pata de mulo</em>), about 10cm high and 30cm long. The interior is bright white, with a smooth, semi-soft texture, citrusy creaminess and an intense lingering flavour, distinctly goaty, with complex woody aromas and hints of herbs and fresh hazelnuts that give way to a pungent bite as the cheese ages. Although the cheese is made all year round, production levels vary with the seasons, as only the highest-quality milk is selected. The best time of year for flavour is April to June.</p>
<p class="indented">Although the Monte Enebro takes priority, the dairy uses any surplus milk to make a pressed goat’s milk cheese (Cabra del Tiétar), which is semi-cured over two months, and has a robust ivory rind, cream-coloured paste and a herbaceous and slightly toffeed flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">Both these cheeses go beautifully with fruity white wines such as Verdejos or whites from Galicia. Monte Enebro, in particular, suits a white such as Vega de la Reina from Rueda, while a youthful red such as Rudeles from Ribera del Duero combines well with the acidity of the younger Cabra del Tiétar. We serve Monte Enebro with fresh grapes and orange blossom honey and also use it in many recipes and salads on our menus.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Cremoso de Cañarejal (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is made in Pollos, Valladolid, by the Santos family, who have been growing cereals and farming sheep for many generations. It is a new cheese made with milk from their 1,800-strong herd of Assaf sheep (a cross between the resilient Israeli breed, Awassi, which is used to arid climates and produces high volumes of milk, and East Friesian). The dairy is based in the National Reserve of Las Riberas de Castronuño in Valladolid province, close to the Duero river where the lush pastures are filled with aromatic wild rosemary, thyme and oregano in the spring and summer. During the winter months the animals’ diet is supplemented with straw, grains and cereals, many of which the family grow themselves.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheese has balanced sheepy aromas, feels silky on the palate and tastes slightly bitter, but since it is made with vegetarian rennet as opposed to the infusion of cardoon thistle typical of other ‘torta’ styles, it has a sweeter finish.</p>
<p class="indented">Cañarejal goes very well with the elegant soft red and rosé wines of Ribera del Duero, and the 250g Cremoso is a perfect size for serving whole. I like to eat it at room temperature, with the top sliced off so you can spoon the creamy paste on to a cracker, and on our menus we serve the creamy cheese with boiled new potatoes and caperberries.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1"><a id="pg_519"/>La Setera (goat’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This semi-soft cheese comes from the tiniest of dairies in a remote village in the area of Sayago, Zamora. It is staunchly local, with a limited production and season, and is made by Sarah Groves-Raines, an Englishwoman whose husband, Patxi, is a wine-maker from the Basque country. Sarah makes the cheese with goat’s milk collected daily at first light from local herders within 10 kilometres of the dairy. It is cured for about three weeks, which allows it to keep its very fresh character, and it has a stone-coloured rind with a fine grey bloom, a bright white interior, mild flavour and a delicate and smooth finish.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheese pairs well with the robust dry red wines of the area of Los Arribes de Duero, made with Juan García grapes, as well as Patxi’s own La Setera wines, and is good served with tomato jam (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_533">here</a>).</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Beato de Tábara (goat’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Having farmed and shepherded their own flock of goats in the Sierra de la Culebra for over 30 years, Santiago Lucas León and his sons set up a family dairy in San Martín de Tábara in 2001. He makes his semi-soft artisan cheese to a traditional recipe, but using modern facilities and technology, according to his mantra: ‘<em>prima la calidad sobre la cantidad’</em> (quality before quantity).</p>
<p class="indented">The paste is compact and smooth and the cheese is aged for about two and a half months. Its light grey rind looks almost like an inscribed goat’s skin and its aroma makes you think of dark cellars, while the bright white paste has a coolness on the palate and a character that invokes the floral meadows where the herds graze.</p>
<p class="indented">It is an elegant and excellent cheese with a purity about it that should really be enjoyed simply, with just a Verdejo wine from nearby Rueda for company.</p>
<p class="panel-title"><a id="pg_520"/>Engineering Cheese</p>
<p class="flush_left">In 1984 Rafael Báez dreamed of bringing a new identity to the traditional Castilian Pata de Mulo cheese, using pasteurised goat’s milk in place of the sheep’s milk that is typical of the Valladolid province.</p>
<p class="indented">Rafa was a force of nature, an enigma, a man of great spirit and conviction, and we had the privilege of knowing him for more than twenty years. Maybe I recognised in him a kindred spirit who took on a slightly crazy challenge, and pulled it off; after all, how many people retire from a career in engineering at the age of sixty, with a family of eight children, decide to learn a new skill at agricultural college, start up an all-consuming, innovative artisan business, and succeed in creating one of the world’s most wonderful cheeses?</p>
<p class="indented">Enric Canut, a tutor in artisan cheese-making at the agricultural school Torre Marimon, just outside Barcelona, remembers perfectly the day Rafa walked in in 1982: ‘In came a very well-dressed, upright and polite man, who had arrived in his BMW sports car – and this was Rafael. However, he proved himself, within days, to be an honest man of few, but sound, words, responsible and with one big decision in his head: to change his life. He learned fast and made radical decisions. He was on his final adventure – <em>olé tus huevos!</em> – what tenacity! He chose to leave the course and start the new path he had carved for himself. He wanted to make a delicious but exceptional cheese that would stand out against all the rest. His decision to change his life was a big one and the cheese would be his companion.’</p>
<p class="indented">Two years later Rafa set up his own dairy in the valley of Tiétar in Ávila, below the Sierra de Gredos mountain range, a corner of Spain that he loved, where the climate is mild and the Tiétar and Alberche rivers encourage abundant lush pasture.</p>
<p class="indented">On the other, north side of the mountains, sheep predominate, and their milk goes into the local semi-hard pressed Pata de Mulo cheese; however, on the south side, where Rafa built his dairy, the local farmers raise Verata goats close to La Vera to the west, and the Serrana breed towards Madrid in the east, which graze on the fine grasses, wild flowers and herbs, producing wonderful rich milk.</p>
<p class="indented">When Rafa arrived, however, most were struggling to maintain their herds on the meagre income they could make from selling the milk, and traditional cheese-making was virtually non-existent. <a id="pg_521"/>So Rafa’s mission was to pay the farmers well for their exceptional milk, which he planned to make into a completely new handmade lactic cheese, with a mould-ripened crust, that had the shape of the neighbouring Pata de Mulo but was made in a different way, using milk from goats rather than from sheep.</p>
<p class="indented">As an engineer, he understood the machinery required, he had the wonderful milk, and he had an unstoppable creative energy, wit, generosity and humour. Though he may have sometimes growled, or fixed you with a piercing glare if you asked boring bureaucratic questions, he loved people, especially women, whom he mostly employed in the dairy, as he believed they have a gentler touch with the delicate curds. So it is fitting that it is now Rafa’s cheese-maker daughter Paloma, who worked with her father for over 20 years, who is in charge of the dairy.</p>
<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_522"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg522.jpg"/></div>
<p class="quote">‘traditional breeds produce very aromatic milk’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The cheeses in this section include favourites from the Mediterranean coast. As it turns northwards the land becomes more temperate, with gentler hills filled with wild herbs and floral shrubs, so the many traditional breeds of goat that are pastured here produce very aromatic milk. When you reach Catalunya the dairies tend to be on a smaller scale, with many of the newer styles of cheese, such as Garrotxa and Montsec, being made by people who have left behind city lives, in search of something simpler and more fulfilling.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Tortas and cremosos</h3>
<p class="flush_left">Extremadura, in the south-west corner of Spain, is the home of the famous Merino sheep whose milk defines the flavour of <em>tortas extremeñas</em>: round, cake-like, luxuriously creamy cheeses that are traditionally eaten with the tops sliced off and the insides scooped out – ideally they should be served between about 18°C and 22°C, at which temperature they are at their most fluid.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally the Merino herds (mostly concentrated around Casar de Cáceres, La Serena, Tierra de Barros and Trujillo) were kept for wool, but they would also provide farming families with milk at its very best – full of nutrients, thick, fatty and aromatic – and they would usually take advantage of the breeding season to collect a little extra milk to make cheese for their own use. However, the Merino milk has such a concentrated flavour that it would often be softened with the milks from other breeds, such as Churra and Lacaune.</p>
<p class="indented">Over the years these <em>tortas</em> have become some of the most expensive and sought-after cheeses of Spain, but ironically, commercial dairies originally considered them to be <em>atortado</em> (collapsed), i.e. their runny texture meant they had failed to mature into semi-hard cheeses, and so they were given away to the local people.</p>
<p class="indented">In October 2012 the name <em>torta</em> was restricted to those that have PDO status in the region of Casar, and so the many very good cheeses that are made using an identical process, but outside this official area, have to go by the name of <em>cremosos</em>, or sometimes <em>retortas</em>, as in the case of the Trujillo cheese made by Juan Figueroa (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p524a">here</a>). In drier microclimates such as La Serena, where they are semi-soft, they are simply known as <em>quesos</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Made with raw milk and coagulated slowly, using vegetable rennet extracted from the cardoon thistle, <em>tortas</em> and <em>cremosos</em> have a distinctive earthy flavour and the gentle bitter finish typical of thistle rennet cheeses. They are so in demand that the cheese-makers and shepherds of the region are actively pulling <a id="pg_524"/>together to find ways to increase production without compromising quality. They now provide better folds and more abundant food for the animals, and synchronise their breeding periods so that milk is available throughout the year.</p>
<p class="indented">We were once told that the way to serve this cheese in Spain is after leaving it in the boot of the car on a hot summer afternoon, but an easier option is to take the cheese out of the fridge overnight, or long enough to bring it to room temperature. It needs to be runny enough so that when you slice off the top, you can spoon it out of its wall of rind on to good bread – or you can dip breadsticks into it.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_523"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg523.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c-head1" id="p524c">Barros (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Made in Villafranca de los Barros, this cheese has a deep orange-coloured rind created by the yeasts which impregnate the wooden boards on which it is aged for 60 days in the traditional way. If you slice off the top, the inside is soft and scoopable, the aromas are fruity and fermented, and although the paste is smooth, the flavours are complex and full-bodied, with distinctive bitter artichoke-y notes of thistle rennet.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1">Casar (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The most famous and widely available of the <em>tortas</em>, named after the village of Casar de Cáceres. There are currently six dairies producing this cheese, with its thin, delicate rind and ivory-coloured paste. The texture should be smooth and silky, rich with the sweet flavours of sheep’s milk and the complex vegetal notes of thistle.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1" id="p524a">Pascualete la Retorta (sheep’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The cheese is made in Trujillo with milk of exemplary quality from Finca Pascualete’s own herds of sheep, which graze on the extensive pastures of this vast estate. The Retorta is one of Spain’s most complex cheeses, and the rind is an ochre-yellow with assertive aromas of beer and mustard. Once the lid has been sliced off, the paste has a soft, oily sheen. Flavours are bold, with notes of bitter thistle, sweet milk and English mustard.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Semi-cured and cured cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a" id="p524b">Payoyo de cabra (goat’s milk) and Payoyo de Oveja Merina de Grazalema (sheep’s milk)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">In his early forties Carlos Ríos had the vision to leave his job as a salesman in order to form a business partnership with Andrés Piña and start up a ground-breaking co-operative dairy, Quesos Payoyo, in the stunning setting of the natural park of Grazalema in the Sierra de Cádiz. Here the altitude and high levels of rainfall mean that the pastures are of the best quality. Carlos bought some 80 goats and 160 Merino de Grazalema sheep, and he and his wife, Ana Sánchez, now make artisan cheeses that are direct descendants of the traditional ones once made by the region’s shepherds.</p>
<p class="indented">Both cheeses are called Payoyo after the local Payoya breed of goats, even though some are made with sheep’s milk, or blends of the two.</p>
<p class="indented">The pure goat’s milk cheese has a clean flavour of fresh curd. The unctuous, pure Merino de Grazalema sheep’s milk cheese is coated with lard and then with <em>salvado de trigo</em> (wheatgerm), which minimises the loss of moisture as it cures, intensifying the complex fermented-tropical-fruit flavour with its toasted caramel finish.</p>
<p class="indented">Some of the mixed milk cheeses are coated in rosemary and lard and wrapped for about three months in greaseproof paper to infuse the herb into the cheese.</p>
<p class="indented">All the styles pair really well with aged sherries, such as Antique Oloroso from Fernando de Castilla or Amontillado Seco Sacromonte, and the Payoyo makes a good ‘butter’, melted over grilled steaks.</p>
<h4 class="c-head1"><a id="pg_525"/>Tronchón (goat’s or sheep’s milk), pasteurised or raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The Catí dairy was formed in 1972 by a group of farmers wanting to pool their resources to preserve and continue traditional cheese-making in the Maestrazgo hills in the south-east of Spain, with its age-old tradition of <em>transhumance</em> (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_526">here</a>) and raising sheep and goats in mixed herds.</p>
<p class="indented">Their Tronchón is a semi-hard cheese, cured for two months and made in an unusual shape which resembles two upturned shallow bowls joined together and indented on the top and bottom, reflecting the vessels in which the cheese would originally have been made. The paste in this artisan cheese is dense, with a flavour that varies according to the milk: the sheep’s milk cheese will be sweeter, while the one made with goat’s milk has a sharper taste. Both have a floral aroma that reflects the wild, herbaceous pastures where the animals graze.</p>
<p class="indented">It pairs well with a dry white wine like Rueda and fresh fruits such as grapes and apples.</p>
<p class="indented">The dairy also makes Pañoleta, a semi-soft goat’s cheese also made in a distinctive shape, this time square, with rounded corners created by the knotted cloths that hold the curds as the cheese cures for two months. It has a velvety olive-green bloom and is fresh and smooth, with a crisp citric finish.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Fresh cheeses</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a">Mató and Requesón</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The fresh cheeses (and yogurts) of Catalunya and the Levante play an important part in the region’s cuisine. Mató (which is like cottage cheese) and Requesón (ricotta) are made from the whey that is left after making cheese from cow’s milk (though originally it would have been goat’s or sheep’s milk). They are very mild in flavour and can be eaten with honey, nuts or fruit, and are used in savoury dishes, cheesecakes or the <em>flaó</em> (tarts) of the area.</p>
<p class="panel-title"><a id="pg_526"/>The Contented Shepherd</p>
<p class="flush_left">There is a simple beauty about the shepherding way of life that I have always found very emotive – and it is probably my husband Rupert’s dream job. I often find myself stopping the car in the middle of the countryside to chat to elderly shepherds (<em>pastores</em>) because I know they are likely to be the last of their line, since in most regions shepherds are a vanishing breed, although in pockets of Castilla y León, especially Burgos and Zamora, and in the Canary Islands, their skills are still valued. Here the language of whistles as the shepherds speak to each other can be heard from valley to valley, like Swiss yodels.</p>
<p class="indented">A shepherd understands his land, and will know where to move his animals, depending on the season, between the <em>páramo</em> (higher open mountain plains), and richer lowlands in order to feed on exceptional pockets of flowers, tender grass shoots and wild herbs. The animals enjoy a stress-free existence which, together with this diet, gives the milk a wonderful quality.</p>
<p class="indented">This movement of animals is known universally as the <em>transhumance</em>, and in central Spain the well-trodden routes, dotted with huts where the shepherds would sleep along the way, are known as <em>las cañadas reales</em>. Though the routes have inevitably been modified to take into account modern obstacles such as motorways and new urban developments, they are still managed by regional laws, known as <em>Leyes de Mesta</em>, that have been in place for centuries and dictate when each official route is open for the movement of herds. Possibly as far back as the thirteenth century, for example, the inhabitants and shepherds of the Roncal valley in the far-eastern corner of Navarra established themselves as an independent political entity – ‘the community of the seven villages of the valley of Roncal’ – to govern the use of the communal pastureland and control the calendar of the <em>transhumance</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">In the village of Roa de Duero in Castilla y León, home of our friends Ambro and Asun, there is a herd of beautiful Churra sheep, looked after by a shepherd who is known only as El Suave (the gentle one). This is a village where nicknames (<em>motes</em>) prevail, and I was told that El Suave earned his <em>mote</em> when he was ten years old and a buyer came to the family farm to collect some lambs. While the other children played truant, he helped to guide the lambs into the trailer with such calm that the buyer slipped him a tip, while <a id="pg_527"/>praising him for his gentleness. On the day I met El Suave it was lambing season and he was setting off for the plateau lands with his herd of Churras and a donkey with saddlebags to hold any lambs that might need carrying.</p>
<p class="indented">Zamora is a province of Castilla y León, the autonomous region that produces the highest volume and best-quality milk in the whole of Spain. In Zamora the tradition was that when shepherds took their herds in search of fresh pastures their families travelled with them, making cheeses wherever they came to rest. And though these nomadic days may be over, this is a region that still values the skills of the shepherd, albeit on a smaller, more local scale.</p>
<p class="indented">The aptly named Félix Vicente Pastor is one of three brothers who pasture around 2,000 sheep in Morales del Vino and who still employ shepherds in the traditional fashion for their family business, which produces around 80,000 kilos of artisan queso <em>zamorano</em> every year (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p516a">here</a>). Félix remembers that when the brothers were growing up, the shepherds lived in the family home and would be out with the sheep all day, milking the ewes by hand in the open fields in summer and under cover in the winter. Often they would take their lunch and dinner into the fields with them. Times change, though, and Félix told me that for a long time the young people of Zamora saw the role of shepherd as much less of a pastoral idyll and more a low-skilled, relentless grind, so the family had to rely on Portuguese and Romanian shepherds, who brought the old gifts of experience and dedication to the task. Now, however, tougher economic climates have at least brought one positive outcome, in that local young people are again looking to the role of shepherding.</p>
<p class="indented">In Zamora there is also a new system, known as the <em>Ordenación común de hierbas, pastos y rastrojeras</em>, which encourages sheep farmers to ‘rent’ agricultural fields from arable farmers after the harvest, so that the animals can feed on the stubble and grasses. It works well, encouraging the arable farmer to buy more land to cultivate, and the sheep farmer to acquire more sheep. It also means that the herds don’t have to be moved so far to graze, so the new breed of shepherd/farmers can pen the animals and, instead of cooking up a pot of stew over an open fire in a remote hut, they can go home for lunch before the afternoon shift.</p>

<p class="quote">‘a specialist culture of ageing cheeses’</p>
<p class="flush_left">In the Balearic Islands cow’s milk cheeses are a speciality, particularly in the most northerly and easterly of the islands, Menorca, where dairy cattle – mainly Friesians which arrived during the British occupation in the eighteenth century – thrive in the climate, which is warm but with generous rainfall, softly salted by the marine winds. As a result of this the pasture is rich and green, from October to spring.</p>
<p class="indented">The pale yellow cheeses of Mallorca are very similar, although they may have goat’s or sheep’s milk added to the recipe, and they tend to have a milder flavour and a buttery texture.</p>
<p class="indented">On the Canary Islands, where the land is extremely dry and wild, it is the goat, rather than the cow, that thrives and the dairy industry is an important part of the local economy. Until recently the cheeses have rarely left the islands, and the Canarian people eat more cheese per capita than any other European country. It is like bread to the islanders, particularly in the poorer, remote areas away from the tourist centres. Often it is eaten along with the local grain, <em>gofio</em>, and it is present, in savoury and sweet combinations, at almost every meal.</p>
<p class="indented">Gran Canaria has the richest cheese culture of all the islands, since much of the land is completely unspoilt and provides exceptional pastures in which shepherds still take charge of flocks, leading them up into the hills to run free. Often farmers will be doing the milking in the corner of a field under rustic, palm-leaf shelters but the raw milk is excellent and there is no history of disease, so the farmers can use it to make fresh cheeses, as well as those intended for maturing, using simple methods. It is common for people just to buy directly from their neighbouring farmer, whose production might be only half a dozen cheeses, made that morning.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally, like Menorca, the Canaries had a specialist culture of ageing cheeses, and you can still see the names of the original <em>afinadores</em> (maturers) on old buildings; however, this is a skill the cheesemakers mostly have to perform themselves these days.</p>
<p class="indented">Some of the Canarian goat’s cheeses, in particular, like the Majorero and the lightly smoked Queso Palmero, are beginning to find appreciative markets abroad, and are gaining in reputation and production. With success, however, comes the temptation to expand and, in some cases, risk compromising the very qualities that have attracted outside attention. Across the islands, the Canarian government has been trying to intensify production, build bigger dairies and make the most of the milk, often at the expense of small farms, many of which already face uncertainty, since the younger generation don’t necessarily want to live the same lives as their parents and grandparents.</p>

<h4 class="c-head1a">Mahón or Maó DOP (cow’s milk), pasteurised or raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Mahón, or Maó, to give it its local name, is a square cheese with rounded edges and corners, a tangy, sharp flavour, and characteristic saltiness that reflects the rich maritime <em>terroir</em> on which the dairy cattle thrive. Mahón cheeses are sold at different stages of maturation: fresh at 21–60 days, when they are quite elastic, semi-cured at 2–5 months, and cured, or aged (<em>añejo)</em> at over five months, when they become more brittle.</p>
<p class="indented">While you can still find traditional artisan farmhouse Formatge de Maó cheese produced from raw cow’s milk, the bulk of cheeses are now produced by the bigger dairies using pasteurised milk. However, within the PDO classification the two must be distinguished by their labels. A green label denotes artisan Maó, while industrially produced cheese has a red label.</p>
<p class="indented">For the green label cheese, originally produced in Menorcan <em>llocs</em> (traditional small farms with stone-walled enclosures), the curds are gathered inside a <em>fogasser</em>, or cheesecloth, so the cheese is often called <em>formatge de fogassa</em>. The mass is pressed manually into a square shape, which loses the bulk of the whey, and the four corners of the cloth are then pulled in tight and tied with a <em>lligam</em>, or cord. Next, the cheese is pressed again in a horizontal press, so that the creases of the cloth imprint themselves in a pattern on the upper surface of the cheese. The cheeses are then salted, and originally the farmer would sell them on to the island’s skilled <em>afinadores</em>, cheese maturers, who would finish them in their own cellars. These specialists are now few and far between, however.</p>
<p class="indented">The rind starts off a light straw colour and, as the cheese matures, becomes a matt ochre with a stunning aroma of fresh peaches, as the rind is rubbed with olive oil and paprika to protect it from excessive mould growth, as well as adding colour and character.</p>
<p class="indented">Artisan green label cheese can be stunning, with a saline yet fruity taste that is buttery on the palate when young, and becomes more nutty with age. It goes very well with <em>sobrasada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p260aa">here</a>) and honey on toasted bread.</p>
<p class="indented">In industrial dairies, the red label cheeses are formed in plastic moulds, which recreate the traditional cloth pattern, and they are pressed in modern vertical presses and salted and matured in special chambers within the dairy. The rind of these cheeses tends to be a waxy orange, created with dyed food-grade paraffin. They can be excellent, but their character is different from that of a green label cheese: piquant and quite sharp in flavour, with a hard, granular texture almost like that of a Parmesan. In addition to <em>sobrasada</em> and honey, the cheeses are good with jams and in gratin dishes.</p>
<p class="indented">At Brindisa we buy our Maó from one of the last two <em>afinadores</em> of artisan Mahón or Maó cheese on Menorca, Nicolás Cardona. Nicolás’s grandfather, Josep Cardona, known as Bep de Torralba, founded Quesos Torralba in 1939 in the town of Alaior. This was a time when food was scarce, and Josep would barter with local farmers, offering the likes of oil, salt and sugar in exchange for a turkey, vegetables, tomatoes, milk, and of course Mahón cheese. The cheese was Josep’s passion, so he began maturing and selling the cheeses in premises next door to the family home. He named the business after the nearby ancient stones of Torralba d’en Salord, which are the remains of a prehistoric town dating somewhere between 1000 BC and the Roman era.</p>
<p class="indented">The Maó Torralba cheeses that Nicolás matures are still handmade and pressed in selected dairies from raw milk. He chooses ones made between November and May, when the island is covered in good lush pasture, and ripens them to his exacting standards, greased with olive oil and paprika, to give the rinds elasticity. They are either semi-cured for around two months, so that they are ivory-coloured with a soft, buttery texture and an orange-brown rind; or aged in small batches for five months until yellow and hard, with a dark brown rind and a flavour that is intense and piquant.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_531"/>Nicolás and his wife Rosa champion excellence and insist on paying much more than the industrial dairies for the cheeses, as their way of helping to sustain the true artisans and small farmers of the island, whose number is sadly reducing as they find it harder and harder to keep going.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses are good with fruity white wines and big reds, and we serve them with home-made tomato jam (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_533">here</a>) on our menus at Brindisa. The aged Torralba is supremely good with honey.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Fuerteventura</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a" id="p531aa">Majorero (goat’s milk), pasteurised or raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Majorero is made on the island of Fuerteventura, which is the closest to Africa of all the Canary Islands. The land is desert-like, has almost no rainfall, and the goat is the only dairy animal that can survive on the scrubby vegetation. This island has its own indigenous breed called Majorera, and its dairies collect their milk from around 100 farmers. The cheese is pressed into large, low rounds decorated with the rhomboid pattern of the traditional belt which was wrapped around the cheese and was made of palm fronds.</p>
<p class="indented">The big, flat round cheeses are cured from eight to 60 days. The younger cheeses have a white rind and interior and are creamy and fresh with a mild goaty flavour; the medium-cured cheeses are firm, lightly goaty and sweet; then, as they age, the rind and the interior become straw yellow and the flavour caramelly. As the cheese matures the rind can be coated with a mix of olive oil and paprika, which turns it a burnt orange colour, or it is coated with the local cereal <em>gofio</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_60">here</a>), which gives it a brown colour.</p>
<p class="indented">Majorero pairs well with a minerally white island wine such as Los Bermejos, the dry, crisp and citrusy white made from the Malvasía grape in Lanzarote. In winter the cheese is often grated into vegetable soup and in summer over salads. And in one restaurant on the island, run by a Swiss-German, I ate one of the best fondues I have ever had, made with buttery young Majorero, blended with <em>mistela canaria</em>, the traditional orange liqueur made with <em>aguardiente</em> (cane spirit), orange juice and sugar and aromatised with orange peel. The pillowy fondue had specks of fruit peel in it, and when you dipped your bread into it, it was heaven.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">La Palma</h3>
<h4 class="c-head1a" id="p531a">Palmero DOP (goat’s milk), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is a terrific cheese, originally the biggest produced in Spain or any of the islands. Made on La Palma, the greenest of the Canaries, it can weigh up to 15kg and is usually lightly smoked. In the markets the cheeses are a sight to behold, with their rind marked with biscuit-coloured lines from the wooden slats of the smoking room.</p>
<p class="indented">The native Palmera goats are well nourished on diverse and lush pasture, and their milk gives the crumbly-textured, bright white cheese a rich flavour, salty and lightly acidic, with a toasted aroma and earthiness. It is often briefly grilled and served, sometimes alongside sliced fish, vegetables and potatoes, with <em>mojo</em> sauces (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>), but it is also good on its own, paired with one of the local mineral-rich Malvasía wines.</p>
<h3 class="a-head">Gran Canaria</h3>
<h4 class="c_head">Flor de Guía, Media Flor and de Guía (sheep’s milk or mixed sheep’s, cow’s and goat’s), raw</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The creamiest of all Canarian cheeses, these are gently rounded and shaped inside a cloth which is knotted at the top and leaves a very faint imprint on the rind.</p>
<p class="indented">Guía is a region in the north-west of Gran Canaria and the cheeses are usually made with pure sheep’s milk, though the recipe allows for blended milks to a minimum of 60 per cent sheep’s milk and a maximum of 40 per cent cow’s milk and 10 per cent goat’s milk.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_532"/>The local cattle and sheep, now both known as Canaria, are a <em>potaje</em>, or mix, of breeds originally from the mainland which have adapted well and are mostly used to work on the land, but the quality of their milk is exceptional. As the animals are not continually drained of every drop of milk in the way of intensive dairy farms, it is very high in fat and protein, and so only a small quantity of it (as little as 10 per cent can be added) gives a fantastic burst of richness.</p>
<p class="indented">The cheeses are made throughout the year, but the rennets and combinations of milks will change according to the season or what is available to the cheese-maker.</p>
<p class="indented">Cheeses labelled Flor de Guía are exceptional and very rare, as they are made entirely with rennet made from the flower of the local wild <em>cardo</em> (thistle), which is harvested and then steeped in water, from January to late spring. The Flor de Guía that is made only with sheep’s milk is a real treat. Rich, squidgy and creamy, almost like a <em>torta</em> or a Reblochon, it melts in the mouth, releasing its mildly acidic, aromatic flavour, culminating in a spicy finish and the typical bitterness of thistle rennet. When the season for the Flor de Guía is over, a semi-hard cheese, Media Flor, is produced using animal and thistle rennet. Then, moving on into autumn, a longer-cure cheese called de Guía will be made using only animal rennet.</p>
<p class="indented">Families might make two or three cheeses a day from a few of their own animals, and the typical Gran Canarian home will often have caves beneath it that burrow into the mountains, where the cheeses can be cured on racks lined with cane matting called <em>cánizo</em> – a tradition that artisan makers cling to, but the big dairies want to dispense with.</p>
<p class="indented">De Guía cheeses in all their variants marry well with fruity white wines and the mineral red wines of the islands, such as Tinto Negramoll from Viña Norte in Tenerife, as well as berry jams.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec212"><a id="pg_533"/>Confitura de tomate</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Tomato jam</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is our Brindisa tomato jam, which goes brilliantly with cheese. For quick tapas, fill some bought mini pastry cases, or spread crackers with some warm Torta de Barros (see <a href="chapter_006.html#p524c">here</a>) and top with the jam.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 500g</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g white sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g brown sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">grated rind of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="method">Either grate the tomatoes, or, if you prefer, de-skin and de-seed them (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_206">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Put into a pan and cook for 20–30 minutes over a low heat until reduced by half. Add the rest of the ingredients and cook very slowly – just let the odd bubble break the surface – for 2 hours, and up to 4, stirring occasionally until the jam is really syrupy.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the cinnamon stick and either pot in sterilised jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>) or keep in the fridge for up to a month.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec213">Confitura de pimientos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Red pepper jam</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a recipe from Sandra Bascones, a friend of Ambro and Ásun in Pedrosa de Duero, who joined us for a big lunch at which everyone brought or cooked dishes and swapped ideas. One of her many contributions was a starter plate of a log of goat’s cheese accompanied by this lovely pepper jam.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 300g</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g fresh red peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g white sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g brown sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml vinegar</p>
<p class="method">Put the peppers into a food processor and blend until very finely chopped. Add the remaining ingredients with 100ml water and blend again until you have a smoothish paste. Turn out into a saucepan and cook over a medium-to-high heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick and sticky, like jam. The colour will be very beautiful, a rich red that is slightly darker than the raw peppers.</p>
<p class="method">Either pot in sterilised jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>) or keep in the fridge for up to a month.</p>
