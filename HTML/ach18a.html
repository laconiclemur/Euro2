<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_34"/>pan-seared calamari in its own broth</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">calamari affogati in brodetto</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a quick dish to prepare in the summertime. Calamari can be tricky to cook because they become tough and rubbery if they are under- or overcooked. To ensure perfection, slice the calamari into rings, sauté for no more than two minutes, and then reheat in a flavorful broth. Calamari prepared this way may be served as a first course with grilled or fresh polenta or accompanied by toasted bread rubbed with fresh garlic. It may also be served over pasta.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon red pepper flakes or 2 teaspoons seeded and chopped jalapeño peppers</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon minced shallots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound cleaned calamari, cut into bite-size rings</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups diced ripe plum tomatoes (about 3 large tomatoes)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large skillet set over high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic just begins to color, about 30 seconds (do not let it brown). Stir in the shallots and 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Cook until the shallots begin to color, about 10 seconds. Add the calamari and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to soften, about 1 minute. Season with salt and generous grindings of black pepper. Add the wine and cook until the calamari absorbs the flavor of the wine, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_35"/><span class="red">2.</span> Remove the calamari from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Stir the tomatoes into the skillet and continue boiling until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and the basil. Return the calamari to the skillet and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. For a slightly richer sauce, stir the butter into the calamari just before serving, or drizzle with the extra virgin olive oil just before serving. Serve immediately.</p>
