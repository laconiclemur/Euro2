		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="rec-intro">This classic stew is made with fish native to the rivers of Burgundy. Traditionally, there should be some rich oily fish, like salmon, while the rest can be white fish, such as pike, perch, tench or carp. Some people worry about eating freshwater species but I think if you use fish from sustainable sources it’s fine. The dish is finished with the traditional Burgundian garnish of mushrooms and glazed onions.</p>

			<p class="body">Clean and fillet all the fish, keeping the bones, or ask your fishmonger to do this for you. Cut the fish into manageable pieces, bearing in mind that this is a soupy dish and is eaten with a spoon, so the portions shouldn’t be too large. Blanch the ventrèche in boiling water for 5 minutes, then cut it into lardons, keeping any trimmings and end bits for the soup. Gently fry the lardons with a little drop of oil and set them aside for later. Slice the mushrooms, keeping any trimmings.</p>
			<p class="body">Warm a tablepoon of oil in a pan and gently cook the sliced onion with the mushroom and ventrèche trimmings until lightly coloured. Add the fish bones and trimmings, deglaze the pan with the brandy, then pour in the wine and add the bouquet garni. Add water to cover, season with salt and pepper, then simmer for 20 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, prepare the garnish. Melt a knob of butter in a pan, add the button onions and sweat until lightly coloured. Add a couple of spoonfuls of the soup and cover with a piece of greaseproof paper until cooked. Sauté the mushrooms in butter until cooked and coloured. </p>
			<p class="body">To prepare the croutons, cut some thin slices of baguette, brush with oil and rub with a cut clove of garlic. Place them on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated oven at 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 for 10 minutes or until crispy.</p>
			<p class="body">Blitz the soup and press it through a fine sieve, then add a tablespoon of butter to shine and enrich the sauce. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat a tablespoon each of oil and butter in a frying pan and fry the fish until just cooked. Arrange the portions in soup plates and garnish with the ventrèche lardons, mushrooms and button onions. Then pour in the soup and add a baguette crouton. Sprinkle with parsley and serve at once.</p>
