</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Jesús Santos was one of the chefs who pioneered the new Basque</span> haute cuisine. He opened his first restaurant, Goizeko Kabi, in Bilbao in 1982 and now has five across Spain and a cooking school. I was taken to the Goizeko in the Wellington Hotel in Madrid by Gaspar Rey (see page 309). One of the best in the city, it serves exquisite innovative dishes. During game season, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia and the local aristocracy can often be seen there.</p>
<p class="summary">It was game season, and Jesús had hurt his leg while out shooting, but he stopped to sit with us from time to time to talk about his tasting menu and the methods (steam, <span class="italic">sous-vide,</span> and so on) now used in modern establishments. We had crab and all manner of seafood, an exquisite eggplant dish, suckling pig, duck, and an absolutely heavenly <span class="italic">becada</span> (woodcock). The favorite item on the menu is always woodcock, a bird with a strong gamy taste.</p>
<p class="summary">Jesús told us that he was from a peasant family of Palencia, a mountain province of Castile and León, and had gone with his brother at a young age to work in the Basque Country, where wealthy families employed cooks. I asked Jesús if he was inspired mainly by the local Castilian gastronomy. “Yes,” he said, “and Castilian cooking was influenced by Arab and Jewish traditions—and I am a Converso.” I told him that when I came into the restaurant and heard his name, I told Gaspar I was sure he was a Converso. Santos was the name many Jews who fled to Portugal took when they were forced to convert there. Here is the story of the Jews of Palencia: By the fifteenth century, the community was so large that there were two Jewish quarters and Jewish families had spilled out into different parts of the city. After 1492, those who had not converted moved to Portugal, but five years later, they were forced to convert there. In the seventeenth century, many of their descendants found their way back to Spain as Christians.</p>
