<p class="tx2"><b>This is a simple trick to make a lining for a cake tin or a circle of paper to cover fruit when it’s poaching. It is used a lot in Italian cooking when making cakes. It also saves washing the tin! I think it is prettier to tear the circle out so that you have rough edges which protude above the edge of the tin.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Cut or tear off a piece of baking parchment larger than the surface you are going to cover. Fold the piece of paper in half and then in half again. Now fold the edges in to make a triangle. Fold again the same way. Put the pointed end of the triangle into the centre of the tin and measure out to see where you need to cut off the excess. Either tear or cut at that point. Open out the circle and use.</p>
