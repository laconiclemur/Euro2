  <p class="chap-para">In southern Italy, where the summers are hot, it is common to see trays and trays of tomatoes drying out on people’s balconies and roof terraces. The taste is amazing, much nicer than industrially made sun-dried tomatoes, and I always try to bring some back with me. In England, where the summers are not so reliable, you can recreate this way of drying by using the oven on a very low heat. These are best made towards the end of August, when plum tomatoes are plentiful. It’s worth making quite a lot seeing as the oven has to be on for such a long time. Very simple to prepare: you put them in the oven and forget about them – even if they go over the 6 hours’ cooking time, no harm will come to them. Smaller tomatoes will probably need less time. Once dried out, you can use them immediately or preserve them in oil.</p>

  <p class="ing1">2kg/4lb 8oz ripe but firm plum tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 100°C/210°F/gas mark ¼ or lower. Line a baking sheet with greaseproof (waxed) paper.</p>

  <p class="para">Slice the tomatoes in half lengthways, place on the baking sheet, skin side down, sprinkle with salt and place in the oven for about 6 hours. If after this time there is still liquid left, leave in the oven for a little longer to dry out completely; this will depend on the size of the tomatoes.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove from the oven and leave to cool.</p>

    <p class="box-head">Tips for using dried tomatoes</p>

    <p class="box-para">• Dress with extra virgin olive oil, garlic, fresh basil and dried oregano; add to a salad, top a bruschetta or pizza, or use in a pasta sauce.</p>

    <p class="box-para">• Preserve in <a href="part0015_split_002.html#pg172" class="calibre1">sterilized jars</a>; make layers of dried tomatoes, basil leaves, a pinch of dried oregano and extra virgin olive oil, making sure you cover the tomatoes completely with the oil. Cover with a sterilized lid and store in a cool, dark, dry place.</p>
