<p class="author1"><span class="txit">timpano alla big night</span></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the most impressive characters from the movie <span class="txit">Big Night</span> has no lines. It is the extravagant <span class="txit">timpano</span> that is created as the centerpiece of an excessive meal. Not only does this dish make a wonderful visual impression on dinner guests, it is intensely flavorful and well worth the process of preparing the components to fill the drum of pasta dough.</p>
<p class="indent">Timpano (as it is called in Calabrian dialect)—or <span class="txit">timballo</span>—has been prepared for feasts and festivals in Italy for centuries. It is generally believed to have entered the lexicon of traditional Italian cooking from Morocco through Sicily. The Tucci family recipe was brought to the United States by Apollonia Pisani, my father’s maternal grandmother. She grew up in Serra San Bruno, a small hill town in Calabria.</p>
<p class="indent">I can’t remember when we had the idea to use timpano as the centerpiece of the <span class="txit">Big Night</span> meal, but I’m glad we did. Structurally and creatively, it gave us a strong focus for the meal and had repercussions that we never anticipated. During the first screenings we were amazed at the audience’s reactions to this dish. They were exactly those of the characters in the film—audible gasps of awe and wonder.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a fair amount of drama associated with creating a timpano. Lots of questioning: “Is there enough sauce?” “Is this the right amount of salami, or cheese, or egg?” “Is it done?” “Should we have used the other pan?” “Will it crack when we flip it over?” “Is it cool enough to slice?” “Is it as good as the last one we made?” “Next time . . .” I can imagine generations of Tuccis past, present, and future asking those same questions, and that adds to my enjoyment of timpano.</p>
<p class="indent">You may want to consider following my parents’ example and make the preparation of the timpano into a family affair. They each take responsibility for different components. My mother cooks the Tucci Ragù Sauce, makes and fries the meatballs, and boils the eggs and pasta. My father slices the cheese and salami and prepares the dough.</p>
<p class="indent">Preparing the ingredients ahead of time will also make the process of assembling the timpano less time-consuming on the day you plan to serve it to your guests. The Tucci <a id="page_182"/>Ragù Sauce and the meatballs freeze well, so they may be prepared ahead or leftovers may be saved for future use. My family has frozen a whole timpano in the pan it will be baked in, with great success. A frozen timpano will take three days to fully defrost in the refrigerator before it can be covered with aluminum foil and baked as directed in the recipe.</p>
<p class="indent">The dough for timpano is rolled out into a thin round, the diameter of which is determined by the pan you are baking it in. Add the diameter of the bottom of the pan, the diameter of the top of the pan, and twice the height of the pan. The total will equal the approximate diameter needed. The dough may be kneaded in advance and set aside or refrigerated overnight. Return it to room temperature before rolling it out. It is important to generously grease the pan with butter and sprayed olive oil before lining the pan with the dough. Greasing and lining the pan with the dough may be done while the pasta is cooking.</p>
<p class="indent">The meat used in preparing the ragù sauce is generally served for dinner the night before the timpano is baked because no one has room for anything other than salad afterward.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 pounds ziti, cooked very al dente (about half the time recommended on the package) and drained (18 cups cooked)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 large eggs, beaten</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><a id="page_183"/><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE DOUGH</span>:</span></p>
<p class="noindentqa"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the flour, eggs, salt, and olive oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. (A large-capacity food processor may also be used.) Add 3 tablespoons of the water and process. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture comes together and forms a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead to make sure it is well mixed, about 10 minutes. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> To knead the dough by hand, mix the flour and salt together on a clean, dry work surface or pastry board. Form these dry ingredients into a mound and then make a well in the center. Break the eggs into the center of the well and lightly beat them with a fork. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the water. Use the fork to gradually incorporate some of the dry ingredients into the egg mixture. Continue mixing the dry ingredients into the eggs, adding the remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead the dough with your hands to make a well-mixed, smooth, dry dough. If the dough becomes too sticky, add more flour. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Flatten the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Dust the top of the dough with flour and roll it out, dusting with flour and flipping the dough over from time to time, until it is about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">16</sub> inch thick and is the desired diameter.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE FILLING</span>:</span></p>
<p class="noindentqa"><span class="red">1.</span> Grease the baking pan very generously with butter and olive oil so that it is well lubricated. Fold the dough in half and then in half again, to form a triangle, and place it in the pan. Open the dough and arrange it in the pan, gently pressing it against the bottom and the sides, draping the extra dough over the sides. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Have the salami, provolone, hard-boiled eggs, meatballs, and ragù sauce at room temperature. Toss the drained pasta with the olive oil and allow to cool slightly before tossing with 2 cups of the ragù sauce. Distribute 4 generous cups of the pasta on the bottom of the timpano. Top with 1 cup of the salami, 1 cup of the provolone, 3 of the <a id="page_184"/>hard-boiled eggs, 1 cup of the meatballs, and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup of the Romano cheese. Pour 2 cups of the sauce over these ingredients. Repeat this process to create additional layers using equal amount of the ingredients until they have come within 1 inch of the top of the pan, ending with 2 cups of ragù sauce. Pour the beaten eggs over the filling. Fold the pasta dough over the filling to seal completely. Trim away and discard any double layers of dough. Make sure that the timpano is tightly sealed. If you notice any small openings, cut a piece of the trimmed dough to fit over the opening. Use a small amount of water to moisten these scraps of dough to ensure that a tight seal has been made.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Bake until lightly browned, about 1 hour. Then cover with aluminum foil and continue baking until the timpano is cooked through (and reaches an internal temperature of 120°F) and the dough is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 30 or more minutes to allow the timpano to cool and contract before attempting to remove from the pan. The baked timpano should not adhere to the pan. To test, gently shake the pan to the left and then to the right. It should slightly spin in the pan. If any part is still attached, carefully detach with a knife.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> To remove the timpano from the pan, place a baking sheet or thin cutting board that covers the entire diameter of the pan on top of the timpano. Grasp the baking sheet or cutting board and the rim of the pan firmly and invert the timpano. Remove the pan and allow the timpano to cool for 30 minutes. Using a long, sharp knife, cut a circle about 3 inches in diameter in the center of the timpano, making sure to cut all the way through to the bottom. Then slice the timpano as you would a pie into individual portions, leaving the center circle as a support for the remaining pieces. The cut pieces should hold together, revealing the built-up layers of great stuff.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Light red or medium red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> The traditional Tucci timpano is baked in a round enamelware pan that is wider on top than it is on the bottom. Finding such a pan might be difficult. For this <a id="page_185"/>cookbook we tested several 6-quart containers, the size pan this recipe is written for, and found one that we recommend here. Chantal Cookware Corporation manufactures an enamel ware 8-quart lidded casserole. The principal drawbacks to this casserole are its depth and its straight sides, which make it difficult to remove the baked timpano without its breaking. Chantal’s products are widely available or can be ordered online or by calling (800) 365-4354. This recipe will serve 12 to 16 people. The proportions may be adapted to fit a smaller or larger container.</p>
