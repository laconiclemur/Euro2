<p class="author1"><span class="txit">fettuccine con gamberetti e pomodoro</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a simple, quick, and outstandingly delicious meal. If you don’t have marinara sauce in the freezer, it will take about thirty minutes to prepare before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. If you have the marinara sauce already made, just warm it on the stove before adding the shrimp.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound fettuccine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound large shrimp, shelled and deveined</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups warm <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a> or your favorite tomato sauce</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, following the package instructions.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Meanwhile, warm <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook to flavor the oil but do not brown, about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring constantly, until they turn pink, about 1 minute. Add the wine and simmer, allowing the shrimp to absorb the wine, about 1 minute. Stir in the marinara and basil, and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer the sauce until the shrimp are cooked through but not chewy, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Drain the pasta and place in a serving bowl. Toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Distribute the pasta equally among four dinner plates. Top with equal portions of the sauce, and serve immediately.</p>

Toss the pasta with the sauce, along with an additional <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil.
