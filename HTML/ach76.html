<p class="author1"><span class="txit">fusilli con ricotta, prosciutto, e spinaci</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This creamy sauce is also a <a class="nounder" href="ach87.html#page_168">tasty filling for cannelloni</a>. It may be prepared up to two days in advance. Refrigerate it and let it return to room temperature before tossing with the pasta or filling cannelloni. This sauce reheats well even after it has been tossed with the pasta: Place the leftover pasta in a saucepan set over medium heat, add <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup hot water, and cook to warm through, stirring frequently.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups finely chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound spinach, washed well and tough stems removed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup ricotta cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely chopped prosciutto (about 6 ounces)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound fusilli</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Squeeze out any liquid retained by the spinach by pressing it between your hands or by placing it in a fine-mesh sieve and pressing the spinach with the back of a spoon. Place the spinach in a food processor. Add the ricotta and prosciutto and process until smooth. Stir in the Parmesan and season with pepper. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F. In a bowl, toss the bread crumbs and extra virgin olive oil. Spread on a baking sheet. Toast the bread crumbs in the oven, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_147"/><span class="red">4.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fusilli until al dente, following the package instructions. Reserve <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the cooking water before draining well. Return the drained pasta to the pot. Stir in the sauce and the reserved cooking water. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce is creamy and evenly coats the pasta, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately, topped with the toasted bread crumbs.</p>
