<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_146"/><b>Pain de Gênes</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Rosemary</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Tonka Bean Crème Anglaise</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I have loved pain de gênes since I was a boy. It was an afternoon cake at home and often served when we had visitors, and is similar to a genoise sponge but with toasted slivered almonds on top. For an exotic twist, I’m serving it with a chili, rosemary and tonka bean crème anglaise and sprinkling it with hazelnuts. Tonka beans, by the way, are wrinkled black seeds with an aroma reminiscent of vanilla and almond. You can buy them online if they are not available in your supermarket.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PAIN DE GÊNES</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon white bread flour, sifted, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 ounces soft marzipan, ideally containing half almonds and half sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon baking powder, sifted</p>
<p class="acktxta">2 tablespoons blanched hazelnuts, toasted and chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ROSEMARY AND TONKA BEAN CRÈME ANGLAISE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 small rosemary sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small red chili, seeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tonka bean or 1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise and seeds scraped out</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 extra-large egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup sugar</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 300°F. Grease and flour a deep 8-inch loose-bottomed cake pan.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> To make the <i>pain de gênes</i>, put the marzipan and butter in a food mixer fitted with a paddle, or use a bowl and an electric hand mixer, and beat 5 minutes, or until soft and light. Add the eggs, one at a time, making sure each is properly incorporated before adding the next one. When all the eggs have been added, continue to beat at least 20 minutes until the mixture is white and fluffy. Add the flour and baking powder and fold in very gently with a large metal spoon. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and sprinkle the hazelnuts over the top. Bake 35 to 40 minutes until the cake is risen and golden brown on top. To check the cake is ready, insert a skewer through the deepest part, and if it comes out clean the cake it is baked. If not, bake 5 minutes longer and check again. Remove the pan from the oven, put on a wire rack for the cake to cool slightly, then turn the cake out of the pan and leave to cool completely on the rack.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> While the cake is baking, make the rosemary and tonka bean crème anglaise. Put the milk and cream in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the rosemary leaves, half the chili and the tonka bean and stir to combine, then cover and leave to infuse 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Put the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk until the sugar dissolves. Return the pan of infused cream and milk to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, then pass through a strainer onto the egg mixture, whisking continuously. Discard the solids in the strainer. Return the mixture to the pan and simmer over medium heat 5 to 8 minutes, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon (otherwise you’ll get scrambled eggs!) until it starts to thicken. You will be able to tell when the crème anglaise is ready if you run two fingers down the back of the spoon and the two lines don’t immediately join. Stir in the remaining chili. Serve the <i>pain de gênes</i> cut into wedges with a generous spoonful of the crème anglaise.</p>
