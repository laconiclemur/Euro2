  <p class="nonindent">“All that meat and no potatoes” would be as lamentable a situation to the average German as it was to the lyricist of that American song hit of the 1940s. Although they have a passion for dumplings and a predilection for noodles, the dietary staple of the Germans is potatoes, and they have dozens and dozens of tempting ways to prepare them. One is often served two kinds of potatoes at the same meal, and even the Swabian Spätzle and noodles Uve in a state of peaceful co-existence with potatoes—so much so, in fact, that Swabian cooks often make noodles out of potatoes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Besides being used in soups and stews, as side dishes, salads and entrees, potatoes serve as thickening agents in cooking other dishes. Raw grated or cooked mashed potatoes are used in this way, and potato flour or starch is a popular substitute for cornstarch or tapioca. You can buy this product in almost any supermarket in the United States.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page311"></a>In Germany you will most often be served fried, boiled or steamed potatoes. The last two are usually cooked in their jackets, both for nutrition and flavor, and may be served peeled or unpeeled. In either case they will be dry and fluffy, never soggy and waxy, as they are well dried over heat after being cooked and drained (see recipes that follow below). Germans also love such international potato dishes as French-fries, shoestring potatoes, waffle-fried potatoes, potato chips and pommes soufflées. Leftover boiled potatoes are added to omelettes or salads, and extra mashed potatoes may be fried the next day, pancake style, in a little butter.</p>

  <p class="indent">The most important rule of etiquette when eating boiled potatoes in Germany is that they must be broken with a fork, never, never cut with a knife. Doing so marks you as a boor and an illiterate, just the way cutting spaghetti with a knife does in Italy.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">One of the most commonly served potato dishes in Germany, these are simply potatoes that have been washed, peeled, quartered and boiled until tender in well-salted water. They should be drained through a colander as soon as they are done, returned to the empty pot and placed over low heat. Shake pot back and forth gently several times until potatoes are thoroughly dry and mealy.</p>

  <p class="indent">GARNISHES FOR SALT POTATOES</p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Melted butter with minced parsley, dill, chives or caraway seeds.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Breadcrumbs browned in butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Browned butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Minced onion, browned or lightly sautéed in butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. White Sauce, plain, or seasoned with mustard, minced parsley, chives or dill, or with bits of cooked ham or bacon).</p>

  <p class="nonindent">6. White Onion Sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Potatoes that are to be boiled in their skins must be well scrubbed so that the dirt does not penetrate as they cook. Both brown and red new <a id="page312"></a>potatoes, and medium-sized old potatoes, are cooked in jackets in Germany. New potatoes are eaten jackets and all, though often a narrow strip of skin is pared off around the middle of each before cooking. Old potatoes cooked in their jackets are generally peeled before being served and it is these that are used for potato salad and other such dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unpeeled potatoes may be boiled or steamed and the cooking water may be completely unseasoned, or flavored with salt, caraway seeds or both. Potatoes must be drained through a colander as soon as they are done. Return them to the empty pot and place over low heat. Shake pot back and forth gently several times, until potatoes are well dried and mealy.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>SNOW POTATOES (Kartoffelschnee)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Old potatoes are best for this. They should be scrubbed clean and cooked in their jackets. Peel while hot and put through a potato ricer or food mill. Season with salt and a generous lump of butter before serving, or top with breadcrumbs and/or onion rings that have been sautéed in butter.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>/MASHED POT ATOES (Kartoffelbrei)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Cook unpeeled potatoes. Peel while hot and mash well with a potato masher. Work in 1 cup hot milk and 1 to 2 tablespoons butter for 2 pounds of potatoes. Season with salt, pepper or nutmeg. Serve at once or keep warm by placing pot in a larger pan filled with hot water. Onion rings, or breadcrumbs lightly browned in butter, may be used as toppings for mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="indent">To make Baked Mashed Potatoes, mix 2 egg yolks into mashed potatoes and turn into a buttered baking dish or soufflé dish, top with sautéed onion rings, browned breadcrumbs, or both, brush with melted butter and bake in 450° oven 5 or 10 minutes, or until topping is nicely browned. To make a creamier version, whip potatoes with a litttle more milk, using a wire whisk or a rotary beater.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">A favorite dish with sautéed liver, roast lamb or mutton, this is simply mashed potatoes mixed with warm, well-seasoned applesauce, salt, and enough sugar and vinegar to give it a slight sweet-sour tang. Pour brown butter over this before serving.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is perhaps the best-known potato dish in Germany; to the rest of the world it is a classic.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>7 or 8 medium-sized old potatoes salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter, lard or bacon fat</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash and peel potatoes. They are usually cut in very thin slices, but they may be cubed instead or cut into sticks as for French-fried potatoes. Sprinkle them with salt. Heat fat in an 11″ or 12″ skillet that has a tight-fitting cover. When fat is hot and bubbling, add potatoes and cover. Steam slowly but steadily 15 to 20 minutes, shaking pan back and forth several times during cooking. Potatoes should turn a deep yellow color as they cook. Remove cover and dry for another 10 minutes, turning potatoes once or twice with a wooden spatula so that they become brown on top and bottom.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Diced onions are sometimes sautéed and cooked along with potatoes.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Cold boiled, peeled potatoes, cut in thick slices, can also be fried in butter or bacon fat, with or without diced onion. Follow recipe, but do not cover pan. Turn from time to time with wooden spatula so potatoes brown evenly.</p>

Cook about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Sprinkle with salt, parsley and paprika and toss lightly. Serve at once.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>7 or 8 medium-sized potatoes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs, lightly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons grated Farmesan cheese</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon salt (approximately)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon nutmeg (approximately)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>fresh breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>fat for deep-frying (lard or vegetable oil)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Scrub potatoes, cook unpeeled and peel while hot. Purée in a food mill or rub through a sieve. Add butter, 2 eggs, grated cheese and mix well. Season with salt and nutmeg to taste. Work flour into potatoes, a tablespoon or two at a time, until you can form croquettes—sausage-shaped rolls about 1½″ in diameter and 2″ to 3″ long. Dip each roll in egg-water mixture and roll in breadcrumbs until well coated on all sides. Heat fat in deep fryer. When it registers 375° on a fat thermometer, add croquettes, four or five at a time, and cook each batch until they are a deep golden brown. Drain on paper towel before serving. If you prefer not to deep-fry these, shape potato-flour mixture into hamburger-like patties and fry in 1″ hot fat. Drain on paper towel and serve.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>7 or 8 medium-sized old potatoes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>starch from potato water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs, separated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour, potato flour or cracker meal</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon white pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Urd or vegetable shortening for frying</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel potatoes and keep in cold water until ready for use. Potato pancakes must be made just before they are to be eaten; they cannot be <a id="page318"></a>grated in advance as they will blacken very quickly. Grate potatoes and onion into a bowl and drain in a strainer, pressing out as much liquid as possible with your hands or with a wooden spoon. Reserve liquid and let it settle. Pour away potato liquid but do not throw away the starchy sediment that has settled at the bottom of the bowl; this should be returned to the potato-onion mixture. Mix potatoes with egg yolks, flour, salt and pepper. Beat egg whites stiffly and gently fold into potatoes. Heat fat in a skillet so that you have a depth of 1″ when it is melted. Drop potato mixture into hot fat—about 2 tablespoons per pancake—and fry, turning once so pancakes are a deep golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towel.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Potato pancakes are often made without onion. At other times apple is added for flavor, an unusual and delicious touch. Grate 1 large peeled apple into potato mixture, with or without onion, and proceed.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Add 2 tablespoons minced parsley to drained potato mixture.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Instead of making small pancakes, German housewives often make a huge pan-size cake and serve one to a portion, usually as a luncheon or supper dessert-entree, after a first course of soup, a vegetable casserole or a sausage platter. If a 10″ skillet is used, this mixture will give 4 or 5 large thin pancakes. Usually onion is omitted and so is pepper. The finished pancake is sprinkled with granulated sugar or, sometimes, cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. A somewhat simplified version can be made by baking pancakes, all at once, in the oven, a dish known as Kartoffelkuchen (Potato Cake). Prepare potatoes with or without onion and/or apple. Put 3 or 4 tablespoons vegetable shortening or lard in an 8″-square cake pan and place on moderate heat until fat is quite hot. Turn mixture into pan and pour a little more melted fat over the top. Bake in a 425° oven about 45 minutes, or until potato mixture is very brown and crisp on top. Turn onto serving platter and cut into squares. This method is a little easier to handle when you have guests, as it saves you from having to fry individual pancakes just before dinner is served.</p>

Shape into a long roll and slice into flat lengthwise strips. Cut again into slim ribbon-like strips. Fry in hot butter 10 or 12 minutes, or until noodles are golden brown on all sides.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">To make Potato Patties (Kartoffelkücherl) prepare the same dough and shape into a roll about the thickness of a cucumber. Cut round slices, each about ½″ to ¾″ thick. Fry in hot butter, turning once so they become golden on both sides.</p>

Peel while hot and cut in thin slices. Fry bacon in a saucepan and when golden but not yet brown or crisp, add onions. Sauté slowly until onions become transparent but not golden. Remove from heat and carefully pour in combined vinegar and stock. Do this carefully so the liquid does not cause the hot fat to splutter. Bring to a boil and pour over sliced potatoes. Using a wooden spatula, gently lift potatoes a little so dressing runs over them evenly. Fold in a couple tablespoons of sour cream if you like, or serve without it. Sprinkle with minced parsley.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">All kinds of interesting things flavor this salad in Germany. You may add more vinegar, or you can use dry white wine throughout instead of vinegar. Minced green herbs are often added—especially parsley and chives—and so are chopped cucumber, diced peeled apple or diced cooked knob celery. Leftover meats can be chopped or slivered, as can any kind of smoked ham, tongue or wurst. Chopped anchovies or salt herring, or dill pickle, is sometimes added.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Noodles and noodle “dough-wares” (Teigwaren) are served often everywhere in Germany and most especially in Swabia. Generally they are boiled, drained and mixed with melted butter or bacon fat. They are seasoned with salt, pepper or nutmeg, paprika and poppy seeds, minced dill or parsley, crumbled cooked bacon or diced cooked ham, or a little sautéed minced onion or celery. The seasoning added depends upon the food that will be served with the noodles. Some more unusual additions are brown butter, buttered breadcrumbs, and cottage or pot cheese either of which may or may not be thinned down with a little sour cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thin noodles are among the preferred garnishes for chicken, veal or beef soup; noodles, wide or thin, are molded into rings to be filled with suitable stews, generally those that are seasoned with paprika.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sweet noodle puddings or soufflés are equally popular for desserts and entrees, or as side dishes with meats such as tongue in raisin sauce or roast pork; and cold leftover noodles are mixed into nutmeg-flavored omelettes by frugal German housewives.</p>

Set pot in a sink or pan filled with cold water and keep there until noodles and milk are cool. Milk will thicken and should be almost completely absorbed by the time the mass has cooled. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well between each addition. Add to the cooled noodle-milk mixture. Mix in raisins, which were soaked and drained, and nuts if you are using them, cinnamon or vanilla or both, according to your taste, grated lemon rind and a little more salt or sugar if you think either is needed. Beat egg whites to a very stiff snow and fold gently into mixture, using a rubber spatula and working quickly so that egg whites do not lose their airiness. Turn into a 2-quart soufflé dish that has been well buttered on the sides and bottom. (The baking dish may also be sprinkled lightly with sugar or breadcrumbs after it has been buttered if you like a stiff crust around the soufflé.) Bake in 375° oven 45 to 50 minutes, or until top is a deep golden brown and filling is set but slightly custardy.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rice is often served in Germany, either steamed or boiled, and always very dry and fluffy. Whichever way it is cooked, it is drained and set to dry in a warm oven for a few minutes. It is then seasoned with a generous lump of butter, salt, pepper or nutmeg, sometimes with grated cheese or capers, minced parsley or sautéed mushroom slices; very often a little well-seasoned tomato sauce is stirred into it just before it is served. Some cooks prefer to sauté the rice in a little hot butter until the grains become glassy, at which point they pour in some hot water or stock, add a small onion studded with 3 or 4 cloves, cover the pot and let the rice simmer slowly until it is tender. (Rice should never be stirred while it is cooking or it will become mushy.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Italian risotto (called, in German, Risotto or Gedünsteter Reis) is very often served, and rice rings filled with some sort of stew or gravy and meat dish appear on all restaurant menus. Rice is a favorite addition to chicken and beef broths and is also the basis for some of the country’s most tempting and famous desserts, hot as well as cold.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Boil water in a saucepan, then add rice and salt. Cook according to instructions on package. This will give about 5 cups of cooked rice, which is what you will need to fill the mold. When rice is tender, dry and fluffy, toss in butter with a fork, add salt if needed and nutmeg or pepper to taste. Toss in minced parsley if you want to use it. Coat inside of a 8″ ring mold with melted butter or olive oil. Be sure that all sides are well greased. Pack hot cooked rice into mold, pressing it firmly into <a id="page326"></a>place with the back of a tablespoon. Set in a warm place for 8 to 10 minutes. (I have found the most effective way of doing this is to heat the oven to 250°, turn off the heat, place the rice-filled mold in oven and leave door open for the 8 or 10 minutes.) Invert mold on a serving plate and lift mold off rice.</p>
