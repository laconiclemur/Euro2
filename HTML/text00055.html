<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">The Seven-Course Morel Festival Meal</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">We had heard about the special meals at a small restaurant in the town of Bayport, Minnesota, located east of the Twin Cities on the St. Croix River. So we made plans to attend the special Morel Festival Meal in Bayport.</p>
<p>The doors opened at 7:00 <span class="sm">P.M.</span>
 Our reservation was honored, and we selected a table in a quiet corner where we could see everything yet have privacy. Other guests silently selected their tables. Ice clinked in stemmed, sweaty glasses. The steam from the kitchen wafted over the dining room, emitting the wonderful woodsy aroma of morels that were to make their way into our every course.</p>
<p>Muffled conversations, candlelight. A quarter loaf of half-wheat bread came in a small basket that was broken and covered with a white napkin. A small crock with whipped butter flavored with morels appeared and was set beside the bread, the top scraped flat, perfectly even with the edges of the little pot. We spread the soft off-white, morel-flecked, whipped butter on torn chunks of the rustic bread.</p>
<p>Then the waiter appeared.</p>
<p>“Your wine selection?” He made the rounds asking the same question. The wines appeared on all the tables.</p>
<p>“The first course tonight,” our waitperson declared, “will be an oriental morel salad made with shredded carrots, snow peas, sweet onion, shredded napa cabbage, with lettuce, rice noodles, soy sauce and sesame oil dressing, topped with deep-fried morels and chopped cashews.” Arranged on a huge white plate, the salad itself was all of three inches in diameter. A thin strand of shredded napa cabbage dripped down my chin, and what the salad perhaps lacked in volume, it replaced with flavor.</p>
<p>A four-ounce cup of silky, creamy morel soup, its flavor exploding on my palate, left me wanting more. Our waiter whisked away the empty dishes.</p>
<p>An hour later, we’d finished the first course and the soup as well as the bread and the morel butter. Five puffs of potato gnocchi came next, arranged on a plate that had been first covered with a pureed sweet pea sauce and sprinkled with tiny bits of thin, salty Serrano ham, finely diced fried morels, and drizzled with earthy-scented truffle oil.</p>
<p>In another three-quarters of an hour a lovely plate, centered with about a quarter of a cup of Israeli couscous, which looked a little like dark whole tapioca, and mixed with sautéed sweetbreads and morels, was placed before our sleepy eyes. It was dramatically drizzled with a reduction of port wine and served alongside a tablespoonful of sautéed spinach.</p>
<p>After a few pours of wine, and two glasses of ice water, and another forty-five-minute gap between courses, we were served a thimbleful of mint sorbet as a palate cleanser.</p>
<p>The evening wore on, and whispered voices became speaking voices, became loud voices as yet another bottle of wine was delivered to tables.</p>
<p>Another three-quarters of an hour passed before a medallion of pork tenderloin a full 2½ inches in diameter perched atop a spoonful of morel sauce and glazed with a raspberry coulis arrived. We polished that off in less than five minutes. By now the noise level in the restaurant was to the point where we had to shout across the table to hear each other.</p>
<p>Three spears of asparagus, arranged in a spoke pattern on a plate thinly glazed with a pureed morel sauce and garnished with a single cashew, arrived a half hour later. We asked for more bread.</p>
<p>A round table in the corner with three couples had already consumed four bottles of wine. We calculated the cost of their wine at about $450.</p>
<p>At last dessert came. Two ounces of morel and chocolate pots de crème in a dainty little ceramic cup on a huge white plate sprinkled with chopped mint and two raspberries artfully arranged. It was gone in three minutes.</p>
<p>A hundred and fifty dollars later we were finished. We unfolded our legs slowly, which seemed to be permanently bent after almost four hours of sitting. The whole company exited the restaurant at the same time. I heard somebody say, “Let’s go to Burger King. I’m hungry!”</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Cream of Morel Soup</a>
</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">¾ pound fresh morels (more or less to taste and your hunting success)</p>
<p class="rpil">½ of a large sweet onion</p>
<p class="rpil">3 medium to small russet potatoes</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups water</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="rpil">Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup chicken stock</p>
<p class="rpill">1 cup heavy cream</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Clean and chop the morels. If they are buggy, place in a salt-and-water solution—2 tablespoons salt to 1 quart water—and refrigerate for an hour or two. Rinse, drain, and dry the morels. Chop the onion. Peel and halve potatoes. Add both to soup pot with the water. Boil moderately until tender, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">Place a 2- to 3-quart saucepan over a medium flame. Add morels and a few dashes of salt. Cook morels gently for about 15 minutes, making sure they do not dry out. Add a few dashes of wine at a time to keep moist. When nearly done, add additional dry white wine, turn up flame, and continue cooking until liquid is almost gone. Add chicken stock and stir until blended.</p>
<p class="rp">When potatoes and onions are tender, remove from heat and blend until smooth. Return to pot.</p>
<p class="rp">Add morel mix to potato/onion mixture and simmer very gently, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching. After about 5 to 10 minutes, add cream and salt and pepper to taste.</p>
