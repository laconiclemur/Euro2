<p class="author1"><span class="txit">torta salata</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This wonderful tart emerged from one of Gianni’s experiments just out of cooking school, when he would get together with friends to cook and experiment with unusual combinations of ingredients. “We’d end up with much more food than we could possibly eat, but it was a great learning experience,” he recalls. “And after trying several dough recipes, we agreed that this one was the finest.” We love the versatility of this tart. It may be filled with an infinite variety of cooked vegetable combinations, and you can serve it as a first course before roasted chicken or fish, or as the main dish of a light meal accompanied by a green salad.</p>
<p class="indent">Gianni recommends baking this tart in a springform pan. You can also roll the dough to fit a 9 x 15-inch baking sheet with a 1-inch rim; cut the baked tart into small cubes and serve it as an appetizer, hot or at room temperature.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups thinly sliced onions (about 2 mediumsize onions)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 pounds Swiss chard, leaves and stems coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups fresh or frozen artichoke hearts cut into 1-inch pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup freshly grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg, beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup light cream or milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg yolk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons water</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_18"/><span class="red">1.</span> To prepare the pastry: Combine the flour with the salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl or on a marble surface. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal. Mound the flour mixture up and make a well in the center of it. Whisk together the egg yolk, water, and white wine. Pour this mixture into the well. Slowly incorporate the liquid ingredients by working the flour into them a little at a time. When the dough comes together, compact it into a large dish, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes or up to one day. If the dough does not come together add more water 1 tablespoon at a time.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> To prepare the filling: Warm the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft but not brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley. Reduce the heat to medium and add the Swiss chard and artichoke hearts; season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine, and cook until the vegetables have softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely. (This filling may be prepared up to one day in advance. Cover and refrigerate. Return to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Stir the cheeses, the beaten egg, and the cream into the vegetable mixture. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Preheat the oven to 375° F. Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan with butter and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Cut a quarter of the dough away from the disk and reserve it in the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the remaining three quarters of the dough into a <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub>-inch-thick circle that will cover the bottom of the springform pan and come three quarters of the way up the sides. Line the pan with the dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Fill the shell with the vegetable mixture, patting it down with the back of a spoon so it is compact. Roll the remaining one quarter of dough into a circle slightly larger than the pan. Place it on top of the filling. Use your fingers to crimp together the sides and top of the dough. Pierce the top of the tart with a fork to make tiny air vents.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_19"/><span class="red">7.</span> In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolk and water. Brush this egg wash on the top and edges of the pastry. Bake until golden brown, about 1 hour. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
