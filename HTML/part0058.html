<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003023">I first ate a Scotch egg in a gastropub in England. I thought, ‘What is that?’ Then I cut into it and I saw the runny yolk … I wondered why I’d never had anything similar in Spain, as we love eggs so much, and then I thought that it would be a good idea to make a Scotch egg using Iberian pork – it has so much flavour.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003024">If you pre-boil your eggs, make sure you leave them to come back to room temperature before wrapping and frying.</p>

<h5 class="serves">MAKES 6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003025">6 medium eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003026">150g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003027">3 eggs, whisked</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003028">150g panko breadcrumbs</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003029">rapeseed or sunflower oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003030">extra virgin olive oil, to finish</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0003036">For the mince</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003037">500g Iberian pork mince (80% meat, 20% fat)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003038">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003039">2 cloves of garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003040">4 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003041">½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003042">1 teaspoon smoked paprika</p>

<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003043">Put the eggs into a pan of boiling water and cook for 6½ minutes, then remove to a bowl of ice-cold water. When cool enough to handle, peel off the shells.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003044">Mix all the mince ingredients together.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003045">Lay one-sixth of the mince mixture on a piece of cling film 15cm x 15cm, put an egg in the middle, then pull the cling film around it – this helps the meat to cover the egg evenly without falling apart. You want a layer of around 1cm. Repeat with the rest of the eggs. Dip in flour, then egg, then panko.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003046">Preheat the oven to 180°C.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003047">Pour oil into a large high-sided pan – you want enough to come halfway up the eggs – and put on a medium-low heat. When hot (but not too hot, as you don’t want the panko to burn), shallow-fry the Scotch eggs, turning them until they are golden on all sides. Drain them on a baking tray lined with kitchen paper, then remove the paper and finish cooking the eggs in the oven for 4–6 minutes, to ensure that they are cooked through and hot inside. To check that the eggs are cooked, stick a toothpick inside one for 20 seconds, then raise it to your lips (don’t burn yourself) – if the toothpick is warm, the eggs are done.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003048">Serve the Scotch eggs cut in half and seasoned with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.</p>
