<p class="first_paragraph_ch_ts" id="sab0003476"><a id="pg115" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>The longer I have been cooking, the more I have come to enjoy cooking vegetables. They are incredibly diverse and vary so much in flavour – much more so than, say, different types of fish. And you feel really good when you eat them: people are coming round to the fact that vegetables are a satisfying main course in themselves.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0003477">Peppers are perhaps the most important vegetable (though technically a fruit) in Spain, whether fresh, dried or jarred. Recently, I visited a market in Astigarraga, a village in Guipúzcoa, just a few miles from San Sebastián, and I could smell roasted peppers as soon as I got out of the car. I kept walking and finally came across this man with a machine roasting hundreds of peppers. Women came up to him and put in their orders for a kilo or five, before going off to finish their food shopping. They came back to pick up their peppers before taking them home to preserve. Basque cooking in particular uses a lot of green and red peppers, along with onions, so that as we cook, we see the white, red and green of the Ikurrina (Basque flag).</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0003478">The most important thing to consider when cooking vegetables is making the most of what is in season, as everything tastes ten times better eaten then. Spring is when I go mad with fresh asparagus, beans and everything else (see green asparagus, <em class="calibre9">romesco</em> and Idiazabal cheese, <a href="part0099.html#pg138" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>, and flat green bean, tomato and potato stew, <a href="part0088.html#pg125" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>), but in summer there are peppers (see <em class="calibre9">escalivada</em>, <a href="part0098.html#pg137" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>), autumn brings wild mushrooms (see wild mushroom rice, <a href="part0084.html#pg120" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) and roots, and winter, though less plentiful, produces very good cabbages (see braised Hispi cabbage with garlic cream sauce, <a href="part0086.html#pg122" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>).</p>
