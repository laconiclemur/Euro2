<p class="author1"><span class="txit">crocchette di patate</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">The year my family was living in Italy, I came down with a stomach flu and was instructed to eat only crackers, bananas, water, and ginger ale. After what seemed a fortnight of eating this bland diet—okay, probably only two or three days—I began to yearn for many of my mother’s and grandmother’s dishes. I remember lying on the couch and rattling off some of my favorites. My mother looked at me sadly and told me, “All in good time.” But what I wanted most of all were my grandmother’s potato croquettes. I could see, smell, and taste them so clearly. I would try to rid my mind of them and concentrate on something else, but it was no use. The potato croquettes haunted me. I swore I could see them dancing, spinning mockingly around my head, their delicate aroma taunting my nostrils. I pleaded with my mother, telling her I was desperate for potato croquettes. “Soon,” she said, “soon.” If memory serves me, she did indeed make the croquettes within the week, but it’s strange how one remembers the longing more than the eating.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 medium-size all-purpose potatoes, peeled and quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large eggs, beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil, plus more as needed</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and mash them in a bowl with a potato masher. Add the eggs, bread crumbs, flour, cheese, parsley, and salt to taste. Mix them with your hands to make a firm, dry mixture, adding more bread crumbs or flour as necessary.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_27"/><span class="red">2.</span> Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan (about 8 inches in diameter) set over medium heat. Roll tablespoons of the dough between the palms of your hands to form 3- to 4-inch-long logs. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add a few croquettes to the pan and fry until lightly browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer the cooked croquettes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain before serving. Continue to cook the croquettes in small batches. Add more oil to the pan if necessary, being sure to allow it to heat up before adding the croquettes. The croquettes are best served immediately, but they can be made ahead of time and reheated in the oven if necessary.</p>
