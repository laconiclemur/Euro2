<p class="author1"><span class="txit">frittata con peperoni</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Frittata was a staple for lunch when I was growing up—each slice was filled with different vegetables. Though I loved it, I must confess that at times I traded it for a sandwich of peanut butter and Marshmallow Fluff. Frittata is perfect when served with focaccia and a green salad.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 red or green cubanelle or bell peppers, seeded and cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-wide strips</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Warm the olive oil in a medium-size nonstick or regular frying pan set over medium heat. Add the peppers, cover, and cook until softened, about 20 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and salt and pepper to taste. Add the eggs to the softened peppers in the pan. Allow the eggs to set, about 2 minutes, then turn over and continue cooking on the other side until firm, about 2 minutes more.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Here is how my mother prepared asparagus frittata—her childhood favorite:</p>
<p class="noindenta">Cut about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound asparagus on the bias into 1-inch pieces. Blanch in boiling water for about 1 minute. Drain, pat dry, and cook in the oil to soften, about 5 minutes. Proceed with the basic recipe, adding 2 tablespoons finely grated pecorino Romano cheese to the egg mixture.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_75"/>One small potato, peeled, or 1 small zucchini, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub>-inch-thick slices (about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup each) may be used instead of the peppers.</p>
<p class="noindenta">One small onion, coarsely chopped (about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup), may be sautéed with the peppers or other vegetables.</p>
<p class="noindenta">One tablespoon finely grated pecorino Romano cheese may be added to the eggs before frying.</p>
<p class="noindenta">If you are really hungry, <span class="txit">all</span> of the above ingredients may be added to the frittata.</p>
