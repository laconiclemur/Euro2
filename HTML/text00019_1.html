 CINNAMON &amp; PINEAPPLE FRENCH TOAST</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0002418">
<em>I’m all for dishing out credit where credit is due. I once heard a conversation between my husband and his sister about how, as children, they used to eat French toast with pineapple. My initial reaction was ‘oooooh’ – it sounded sophisticated and unusual … until it turned out to be a ring of tinned pineapple in the centre, not fresh as I’d imagined. But when I took my mother-in-law’s humble tinned pineapple idea and tried it for myself, I discovered that sometimes things are best left simple. So here’s her recipe, which I’ve not changed too much, except for the addition of cinnamon just to lift it.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Drain the tinned pineapple in a colander, then take small handfuls of it and make sure you squeeze out all the excess moisture. Nothing worse than moisture and bread – bad combination! Put the pineapple into a bowl with the sugar and cinnamon, stir and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002431">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Using a large plate with sides, crack in the eggs and add the milk and sugar. Whisk lightly with a fork.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002432">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Take the 4 slices of bread and sandwich them together in pairs with half the pineapple mixture.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002433">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Put a frying pan on a medium heat, add half the butter and leave it to melt.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002434">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Once the butter has melted, dip the first pineapple sandwich into the egg mixture, turning it over so it is coated on both sides. Place in the pan with the melted butter. (Alternatively, if you have a pan big enough to cook both sandwiches at the same time, add all the butter to the pan at once and cook them together.)</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002435">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Cook on a medium heat for 2 minutes, until the bread is a golden colour and the eggy bits have cooked through.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002436">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Now turn over gently, using a spatula and a fork (for extra insurance), and cook on the other side for 2 minutes. Place on a piece of kitchen paper to drain off any excess butter.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002437">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Now do the same with the other pineapple sandwich. Add the remaining butter, dip both sides, fry both sides and drain.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002438">
<span class="red">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Cut the sandwiches in half, and serve with a tablespoon of yoghurt drizzled with a little honey.</p>
