<h3 class="h3"><em>Tomato Compote</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>A tomato compote is better described as it is in French, as a fondue. A melting, rich, sweet mixture that will go wonderfully with pasta, grilled fish or lamb. I’ve used it with sardines and baked it with creamy, melting mozzarella on top of roasted aubergines or inside soft peppers. It is also immensely practical as you can use it immediately, keep it in the fridge for three days or more or freeze it. Unless you have super, fat, juicy, ripe tomatoes, use tinned</em>.</p>
