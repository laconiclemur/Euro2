  <h3 class="section1" id="c31-s117"><a id="page412"></a><em><span class="color">Warm Salad of Small Green Beans</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Haricots Fins Chauds en Salade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds young, freshly picked green beans</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Accompaniments:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pepper, coarse salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>cold sweet butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>crusty white bread</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">For this or any other preparation of green beans served whole to be exquisite, the beans should be tiny (about 3 inches long) and freshly picked. Their great delicacy of flavor is partly lost even if one waits for 5 or 6 hours between the time they are picked and the time they are cooked. Snap off the tips, but leave them whole. If they have been picked in your own garden and have never been sprayed by insecticide, they need not be washed. Otherwise, wash them quickly in cold water. Plunge them into a large quantity of well-salted water at a churning boil and cook, uncovered, at a continued rapid boil, until tender—7 or 8 minutes. (There is a widespread theory that vegetables cooked in a large quantity of water lose in vitamin content—on the contrary, this method permits them to be cooked in the minimum amount of time, and the cooking water may, in any case, always be saved to moisten a vegetable soup. Never should they be cooked either covered or in a small quantity of water—their delicate flavor and their bright-green color are both lost.) Serve them, well drained and undecorated, accompanied by a pitcher of the finest and freshest olive oil available, a pepper mill, a salt mill (containing, if possible, coarse sea salt or, lacking that, coarse kosher salt), cold sweet butter and rough, crusty white bread. The contact of the olive oil with the hot beans produces a delicious olfactory explosion.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page413"></a>THE DAUBE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A <em>daube</em>, like most rustic dishes that require a long, slow, even cooking process, is never as good as when prepared in seasoned earthenware, which absorbs heat more slowly and more evenly and holds it longer than any other kitchen utensil. A <em>daube</em> is usually prepared in amounts sufficient for several meals. If anything, the dish improves with a gentle reheating the next day, and it also serves as a delicious cold hors d’oeuvre—<em>la daube en gelée</em>. For a more attractive presentation, it is only necessary to arrange the more presentable pieces of beef and carrot slices neatly in a simple mold and pour the remainder over before chilling. It may then be turned out and decorated with a bit of green. A <em>daube</em> is a good winter dish but has been placed here among the summer menus so that it may profit from fresh tomatoes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Perhaps the finest cut of meat for this preparation is that known in French as the <em>macreuse</em>. This is a small section of the chuck near the shoulder joint, rich both in flavor and gelatin. The other recommended cuts are equally gelatinous. In most <em>daubes</em>, the larding process is overlooked and, although the resultant sauce may be decent, the meat tends to be dreary, dry and stringy. Only the triple combination of gelatinous meat, the inserted fat, and slow and even cooking can produce pieces of meat that hold their shape, remain moist, and melt in the mouth—and the discovery of the isolated pockets of parsley and garlic flavor is a supplementary pleasure.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c31-s118"><em><span class="color">Provençal Braised Beef</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Daube à la Provençale</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3½ pounds beef without bones (heel, shank, chuck, or a mixture)</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Larding elements:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 ounces fresh fat side pork</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful finely chopped parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page414"></a><em>5 ounces pork rind</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small glass cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bottle good dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 ounces lean side pork (or bacon, if not available)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium carrots (about 5 ounces)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound firm, ripe tomatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound mushrooms</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large bouquet parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 bay leaves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 strips dried orange peel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 healthy handful (about ¼ pound) pitted black olives (unpitted if they are the tiny niçoises)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 healthy teaspoon mixed thyme, oregano, savory</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup (if available) leftover juice from roast or braised beef or veal, or veal stock, or pot-au-feu bouillon—otherwise a cup of water</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut the meat into fairly large pieces of more-or-less regular shape, respecting, as nearly as possible, the natural muscular structure. For 3½ pounds of boneless meat, you should have 15 or 16 pieces.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the rind from the fat pork and save it. Cut the fat into strips approximately ⅓ inch square and 1 to 1½ inches long. Peel the 2 cloves of garlic and reduce it to a paste in a mortar, add the chopped parsley, mix well, then add the strips of fat pork and stir well together.</p>

  <p class="indent">With a small, sharply pointed knife, pierce each piece of meat completely through, with the grain, being careful not to make a wide and messy gash. Gently force a strip of pork fat, well coated with the garlic-and-parsley mixture, into the center of each piece of meat, and place the pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle the cognac and the olive oil over, turn the pieces around until all sides are equally moistened, pour the white wine over and leave to marinate for 2 to 3 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the rind from the lean side pork, and cut all the pork rind, including the rind reserved earlier, into small pieces approximately ½ inch square. Parboil them for 5 or 6 minutes and drain them.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page415"></a>Cut the side pork into ½-inch strips across the grain, and, if it is salted, parboil it for 2 or 3 minutes. If you have been able to find only bacon, use a somewhat smaller quantity and simmer it for a good 10 minutes to rid it as nearly as possible of its smoked taste.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel the carrots and slice them thinly. Peel and seed the tomatoes and chop them coarsely. Peel and chop the onions fine, pare off the stem tips of the mushrooms, rinse mushrooms, sponge dry with paper towels, and chop them fine. Smash the 4 garlic cloves, remove their skins, chop them as fine as possible, and mix together with the onions and mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="indent">Divide the parsley into 2 bouquets, enclose a bay leaf and a strip of dried orange peel in each and tie them up with kitchen string.</p>

  <p class="indent">Choose a cooking utensil (preferably of earthenware, but enameled ironware or heavy copper will do) of approximately 4-quart capacity to hold the ingredients exactly. The lid should fit as tightly as possible.</p>

  <p class="indent">The different ingredients must now be arranged in layers—whether 2, 3 or more layers will be necessary depends on the proportionate height and width of the cooking vessel. Begin by sprinkling the bottom with pork rind pieces; remove meat from marinade and arrange on the rind a layer of meat pieces, close together but not packed in, then tomatoes, chopped onions and mushrooms, olives, carrots, side pork strips, mixed herbs and salt. Place the parsley packages on this bed and begin again with rind, beef, etc. Pour the marinade over and add sufficient meat juice (or water) to barely cover.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the lid to your chosen <em>daubière</em> should not fit tightly, tear a long strip of cloth about 1 inch wide, dip it into a thin flour-and-water paste, squeeze out the excess liquid, and, placing the lid upside down, wrap the cloth around the outside of the fitting ridge; then turn the lid right side up and carefully cover the <em>daubière</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Install the dish in a medium oven (325° to 350° F.). After about 45 minutes, it should be approaching the boiling point—you will be able to hear it beginning to bubble; turn the oven down (250° to 275° F.) and forget about it for a good 5 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Break the seal, if you have used one, lift off the lid and skim off most of the fat floating on the surface. Discard the parsley packages. At this point the dish may be put aside to be reheated the next day, or kept hot while preparing the macaroni, if served immediately.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c31-s119"><a id="page416"></a><em><span class="color">Macaroni in Braising Liquid</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Macaronade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound short macaroni (elbow, rigatoni, etc.)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salted boiling water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>cooking liquid from daube</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pepper freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or a mixture of Parmesan and Swiss Gruyère</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Plunge the macaroni into a large pot of salted boiling water and cook it at a simmer, keeping it somewhat underdone (10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and quality of the macaroni). Drain it well and return it to the saucepan. With a ladle, skim off some cooking liquid from the <em>daube</em>, being careful to take with it all the remaining fat floating on the surface, and pour it over the macaroni. Add enough, tipping the <em>daubière</em> to make it more accessible, to barely cover the macaroni. Place the saucepan, covered, over a low flame for 10 minutes or so, shaking it from time to time to prevent any possibility of sticking. Taste for salt, stir in the freshly ground pepper and a tiny bit of freshly grated nutmeg—an unaware palate should not be able to detect its presence. Pour ⅓ of the macaroni into a previously heated serving dish (an earthenware casserole is good and appropriate to the dish), sprinkle with grated cheese, and continue in layers, finishing with a layer of cheese. Serve.</p>
