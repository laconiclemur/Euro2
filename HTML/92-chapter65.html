<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Eggs are a wonderful way to appreciate the natural earthiness of mushrooms, especially wild ones. They soak up the flavors while acting as something of a binder, and offer their own fine texture and subtle taste. In making a good revuelto with them, it is important that all of the moisture from the mushrooms has been expelled before adding the eggs. If not, the eggs will be watery and the texture nubby as opposed to moist and silky. As revueltos are best prepared in smaller batches, this recipe serves two. To double, see the headnote on <a href="91-chapter64.html#page_128"><span class="red">page 128</span></a>.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Clean the mushrooms following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>. Quarter or slice them depending on their shape.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a bowl, whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt until slightly frothy.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until the moisture has been expelled and evaporated and the edges begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic and jamón. Cook, stirring continually, until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Pour the eggs into the pan. Let set for 10 seconds, and then stir six or eight large, generous sweeps around the pan with a wooden spoon, turning the eggs over, until the eggs are done but still quite moist, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Divide among two plates, lightly drizzle with oil, generously grind pepper over the top, and garnish with a dusting of parsley. Serve immediately.</p>
