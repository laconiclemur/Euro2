<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">In the nineteenth century, the wealthy bourgeoisies of Catalonia and</span> the Basque Country were in thrall to French haute cuisine, but the French influence on the cooking of its Iberian neighbor dates back a very long time. From the Middle Ages, France and Spain had fought each other and stolen colonies from each other; their royals also married each other, and they traded together and influenced each other culturally. In 778, Charlemagne, king of the Franks, invaded Catalonia and set it up as a buffer state to keep the Muslims out of France, and Catalonia remained culturally part of the Frankish world until the eleventh century. The kingdom of Navarre was under the control of French kings on and off through marriage and inheritance. French Occitania was a vassal of Catalonia-Aragon. The Languedoc, Provence, and Catalonia shared a similar language. Troubadours from Provence came to sing of love and the joys of life at the courts of northern Spain. The old Basque nobility, its merchant and banking families, clergy, and jurists, derived their wealth and titles from services to the king of France and Navarre. And the northern part of the Basque Country eventually became part of France.</p>
<p class="para">Since the ninth century, French pilgrims had been making their way to the tomb of the apostle Saint James (Santiago el Mayor) in Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia. The oldest route, the Camino del Norte, was along the Bay of Biscay, through the Basque Country, Cantabria, and Asturias. The Camino Francés, which was farther south; went through Navarre, La Rioja, Castile, and León. By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, French shopkeepers, craftsmen, and innkeepers had set up along the pilgrims’ routes. Whole quarters in towns such as Pamplona, Lograno, Burgos, León, Astorga, and Lugo were inhabited by Frenchmen, who were called Francos.</p>
<p class="para">There was an early French presence throughout the entire peninsula. Religious orders such as the Burgundian Order of Cluny established a network of monasteries. Expeditions of soldiers headed by French nobles came to help in the crusade against the Muslims. The Knights Templars, a military order of monks led by French noblemen, helped the kings of Catalonia and Aragon and were rewarded with castles and a fifth of the conquered lands. In the mid-seventeenth century, French laborers were invited to settle in Spain to make up for the loss of agriculture workers that resulted from the forced departure of Moriscos. This early presence had an influence on the cooking of Spain, but the most important influence came directly through the royal kitchens.</p>
<p class="para">The first sovereigns of the united kingdoms of Spain came from foreign dynasties through royal marriage; the Habsburgs from Austria, and the Bourbons from France. Throughout the Habsburg Dynasty (1516–1700), the kings and queens had separate kitchens. Foreign queens came with their own cooks. Philip IV’s first wife, Isabel de Borbón, brought French cooks; Mariana de Austria brought pastry cooks from Austria. There were chefs at the palace from the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, but the majority were French. The seventeenth century, a golden age of splendor and cultural flowering, was also a period of economic crisis, and the palace was forced to reduce its expenses; some of the cooks made redundant were taken on by the high nobility.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p056.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="para">In the eighteenth century, French influences pervaded the palace kitchens under the Bourbons. Philip V of Spain was the grandson of Louis XIV of France. During Louis XIV’s reign, the French had become accepted all over the world as the absolute arbiters on matters of style and taste. It was then, in the kitchens of Versailles and those of the French nobility who moved from the provinces to Paris, that the haute cuisine we know today developed, and that Paris was enshrined as gastronomy’s international capital. Philip V used chefs trained at Versailles at his Palacio Real, and a cookbook by François Pierre de la Varenne entitled <span class="italic">Le Cuisinier François</span> (<span class="italic">The French Cook;</span> 1651), which codified the new cuisine, was used in the royal and noble kitchens of Madrid. The recipes reflected a sophisticated cuisine based on elaborate techniques, expensive ingredients such as foie gras and truffles, rich butter and cream sauces, and plenty of wine and brandy. To placate the Spanish cooks who felt displaced, there were always some Spanish dishes on the menu.</p>
<p class="para">During and after the French Revolution, which began in 1789, French cooks who lost their employ crossed the border and found work with the high aristocracy and the new industrial bourgeoisie emerging in northern Spain. In the nineteenth century, French winemaking families settling in Majorca, La Rioja, and Cádiz brought their own particular regional cooking styles.</p>
<p class="para">At the end of the nineteenth century, Mariano Pardo de Figueroa, writing under the pseudonym Doctor Thebussem, teamed up with several people, including a cook at the royal palace and a recipe writer, to discover, update, promote, and popularize a true Spanish national cuisine. It was a patriotic endeavor, a reaction against cosmopolitan and French influences. Together they wrote a book that featured recipes from fourteenth-century cookbooks and from a book by the royal cook Francisco Martínez Montiño, first published in 1611, entitled <span class="italic">Arte de Cocina, Pasteleria, Vizcoceria y Conserveria</span> (<span class="italic">Art of Cooking, Pastry and Cake Making and Preserves</span>).</p>
<p class="para">But when they later researched what people were actually cooking, they found that their efforts had made no difference. French chefs had opened cooking schools for the upper classes and their cooks and taught from Carême and Auguste Escoffier’s <span class="italic">Guide Culinaire,</span> while new cookbooks aimed at middle-class housewives featured mostly recipes translated from the French.</p>
<p class="para">By the early twentieth century, there was a newfound fervor for all things regional and traditional, and efforts were made to recover old recipes and to record rural ones. A cookbook by Countess de Pardo Bazán, published in 1913, is an example of that trend, but she too featured a great number of French recipes. In Catalonia, the prosperity generated by the industrial revolution brought about a cultural renaissance and the promotion of the Catalan language and Catalan artists, but French cuisine remained all the rage. The great food writer Simone Ortega’s book <span class="italic">1080 Recetas de Cocina</span> (<span class="italic">1080 Recipes;</span> 1972) which was the bible of the middle classes for two generations, also contained in the original Spanish a majority of French dishes.</p>
<p class="para">Some classic French dishes became Hispanicized, such as béchamel sauce, for which a chopped onion is cooked in butter or olive oil before the flour and milk are added and to which white wine or tomato paste is sometimes added. The <span class="italic">croquetas</span> you find in Spanish bars today, the <span class="italic">leche frita</span> (fried cream) that you can buy in supermarkets, the <span class="italic">crema pastelera</span> much used in pastries, the <span class="italic">crêpes</span> you find in northern Spain, and the <span class="italic">flan</span> that is common all over Spain are French dishes that have become an integral part of Spanish cuisine. As early as the eighteenth century, the elite started putting <span class="italic">bouquets garnis</span> in their soups, stews, and braises, but the bunch of bay leaves, thyme, and parsley tied with string took on a Spanish character when the local herbs growing wild were included. In Catalonia, the bunch of savory, thyme, and wild oregano wrapped in bay leaves is called <span class="italic">farcellets</span>. The ubiquitous combination of chopped onions, carrots, and leeks, called <span class="italic">mirepoix,</span> that is sautéed at the start of many stews is a French touch, as are the practices of flambéing, of caramelizing the tops of desserts, and of baking <span class="italic">au bain-marie</span> (in a water bath). Until the arrival of <span class="italic">nueva cocina,</span> anyone who aspired to cook grandly in Spain cooked French haute cuisine, and that is what was taught in cooking schools.</p>
