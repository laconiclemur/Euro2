			<p class="rec-intro">This is a classic that just sings with Mediterranean tastes. I like to use lobster stock for its depth of flavour, but at a pinch you could substitute fish stock with a dash of tomato purée. Your fishmonger will clean the squid for you, but ask for them to be kept whole, with the tentacles separate.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">20 mussels</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">125ml white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500ml lobster stock (see <a href="part0010_split_009.html#Lobster-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 green pepper, deseeded and diced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g wild rice, soaked overnight in cold water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of saffron strands</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 free-range egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 medium squid, cleaned and beaks removed </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 small bunch of flatleaf parsley, finely chopped</p>

			<p class="body">Scrub the mussels well, then put them in a large pan with the white wine. Cover and steam the mussels for a few minutes until just done – discard any that haven’t opened. Pick out the meat from the shells and set aside. Add the cooking juices from the pan to the lobster stock. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Melt half a tablespoon of the butter in a heavy-based pan that can go in the oven and gently cook the chopped onion and diced peppers until tender. Add the rice and stir until it is all coated with the butter, then pour in 200ml of the lobster stock. Season with the saffron, salt and pepper, then loosely cover with foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">When the rice is cool, stir in the egg yolks to bind the stuffing together. Fill the squid with the rice stuffing, carefully pushing it in without damaging the body. Close the opening of each with a wooden cocktail stick. Bring the rest of the lobster stock to a simmer in a wide pan and gently cook the stuffed squid in the stock for 4–5 minutes until tender. </p>
			<p class="body">Transfer a few ladlefuls of the liquid to a small pan and boil until reduced to a sauce consistency. </p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter in a pan with the garlic, shallot and parsley. Toss the mussels in the garlicky butter to warm them through. In a separate pan, fry the squid tentacles in a little oil until crispy. </p>
			<p class="body">Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the stuffed squid into thick slices and serve with the mussels, fried tentacles and sauce.</p>
