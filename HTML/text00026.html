</h1>
<p class="pf">This is a story that’s hard to tell, mainly because I saw it from the beginning to the end. It’s not that we were so unusual, but in the end, love prevailed. The undying love of Mummy for my father and for our family has left us with a memory and a feeling that don’t go away. It’s as if Mummy is still with us—and she influenced not just our family but many others.</p>
<p>We all loved our Isä so much, even though he had a problem that plagued many in his family. His older brother, John, was an alcoholic who never recovered from his addiction. John had married Mummy’s sister Helen and fathered two of my cousins before they were divorced. He was such a determined drunk that he was hard to contain even in the rural county-run nursing home where he spent his last days, escaping several times and making it to Floodwood to the infamous “liquor store” where fellow alcoholics gave him what he needed and wanted. He lived well into his eighties.</p>
<p>Isä might have had the same fate if it wouldn’t have been for Mummy. Her profound love for him made her reject all advisers who recommended that she just “let him go.”</p>
<p>At one point Mummy got Isä committed to Hazelden, an alcoholic treatment center in Minnesota. He thought it was a wonderful place. He met all kinds of important people there—doctors, lawyers, professors, and even priests, and that vindicated him.</p>
<p>Isä’s love for “the bottle” was a source of both anger and entertainment for the family. I remember the boys, Rudy and Eugene especially, finding his hidden booze, emptying the bottles, peeing into them, and placing them back into their hiding spot. Isä was stuck because he couldn’t reprimand them, and that delighted the boys.</p>
<p>It was a source of laughter to see him stagger around at a wedding reception, finishing off the champagne left by guests. It was after one of those episodes that he realized he couldn’t walk if he had even so much as a drop of drink. He decided to call it quits, and it was during the last couple of years of his life that he decided he couldn’t handle alcohol at all anymore. He died at the age of eighty-eight.</p>

<p>I have a photo that shows Mummy driving the joker, the converted Model A we used for farm chores. It was the only vehicle available to her. She was determined to go the four miles into town to “get” Isä and bring him home. I took a photo with my Brownie camera.</p>
