 BROWN MUSTARD POTATO RÖSTI</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0001263">
<em>Although I often succumb to the quick fried variety when I am on the road, or when I’m just too tired to stop and make breakfast, there’s nothing quite like making rösti from scratch. Even so, nobody wants to start their day having to peel, chop and boil potatoes, especially not caffeine-free at 8 a.m.! So for this recipe, my spuds keep their skins firmly on and all they need is grating, before being flavoured with delicious brown mustard seeds and served with a crisp frilly egg. You simply need a box grater and the belief that potatoes do not have to mean faff first thing in the morning.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0001272">
<span class="red">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Coarsely grate the potatoes on your grater’s largest setting.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001273">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 By hand, take a small amount of the grated potato and squeeze all the excess moisture out of it. Getting rid of as much moisture as you can now will help the rösti crisp up later. Repeat with the rest of the grated potato.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001274">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Place the grated potato in a bowl, season with a large pinch of salt and the mustard seeds, and mix.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001275">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Place a medium frying pan on a medium heat (my pan is 28cm) and add 1 tablespoon of oil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001276">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 When the oil is hot, divide the potato mixture into two batches. Place the two mounds in the frying pan. Using the back of a spatula, flatten the mounds down and allow the potato to cook gently on a medium heat. This will take 5 minutes on one side.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001277">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Gently turn your rösti over and cook for another 3 minutes. They will be crisp on the outside. Transfer them carefully on to your serving plates – they may still be slightly fragile.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001278">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Using the same frying pan, wipe off any crumbs with kitchen paper, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and heat on a high heat until the pan is smoking.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001279">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Crack an egg directly into the pan – it should instantly start to frill around the edges. Once the egg has frilled, turn the heat down and allow the rest of the white to cook, making sure the yolk stays runny. This should take only a few minutes. Season the egg lightly with a pinch of salt. Repeat with the other egg (you can cook them both at once if your pan is large enough).</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001280">
<span class="red">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Place each frilly egg on top of a rösti, sprinkle with coriander leaves and black pepper, and serve while still warm. My kids love these with copious amounts of brown sauce, but I like the runny egg yolk to do the saucing for me.</p>
