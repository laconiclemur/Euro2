			<p class="rec-intro">Legend has it that this dish was created for Napoleon after the battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800. I love the idea that his chef scoured the vicinity for ingredients and came up with a feast fit for the Emperor. It’s always good to cook meat on the bone, as it retains its shape, flavour and moisture, and this recipe is no exception. </p>

			<p class="body">Cut the chicken into 8 pieces. Keep the breasts on the bone and cut each of them in half, leaving the wings on. Section the legs into drumstick and thigh. Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°/Gas 4. </p>
			<p class="body">Dust the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour, then pan fry them in a little oil until brown all over. Remove the chicken and set aside. Discard the oil from the pan, add a tablespoon of fresh oil and sweat the chopped onion until tender and just starting to colour. Add the garlic and wine, then simmer for 2–3 minutes, stirring to lift any sticky bits from the base of the pan. Tip everything into an ovenproof pan with the chicken, bouquet garni, tomatoes and stock or water. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover with a piece of greaseproof paper and place in the oven for 40 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Take the pan out of the oven, remove the chicken and pour the cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan, pressing well. Bring the liquid to the boil, add the crayfish and mushrooms and continue to simmer until they are cooked and the sauce has reached the consistency of single cream. </p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, crack the eggs into individual cups. Heat the vegetable oil to 160°C in a deep-fat fryer, then gently tip the eggs into the oil. Cook for 4–5 minutes, depending on size – the eggs should have runny yolks and crisp, slightly coloured whites. Drain them on kitchen paper to remove the excess oil. Quickly fry the cubes of baguette in the oil to make croutons and drain them on kitchen paper.</p>
			<p class="body">Pour the sauce back into the cooking pan or a warm serving dish with the chicken. Add the croutons and deep-fried eggs, sprinkle with chopped parsley and bring to the table to serve. </p>
