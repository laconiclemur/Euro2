<p class="tx2"><b>It’s all about the oil! Olive trees form the landscape of Tuscany and their oil fuels the people who live on it; the same pure extra-virgin liquid gold that has been valued in Mediterranean cooking for millennia. These cultures usually have good health and longevity. We trust and love olive oil.</b></p>
<p class="txc">ALWAYS BUY<br/>EXTRA-VIRGIN<br/>OLIVE OIL</p>
<p class="tx1">I remember standing in our friend’s kitchen admiring an old tile – it was painted with an image of medieval peasants collecting olives from the trees. Out of the window that day I could hear a familiar sound and looked out to see the same image of men hard at work gathering olives, only this time with electric rakes. Nothing had changed in this eternal marriage between Italians and their beloved olive oil. This is the first lesson in Tuscan cooking. Don’t try and cook Italian food with any other cooking oil; the flavour won’t be the same.</p>
<p class="tx">Tuscan food has developed around their robust and peppery Tuscan oil. In the mountainous areas of northern Tuscany where olive trees can’t be grown, pork fat is the main cooking fat.</p>
<p class="tx">Always buy extra-virgin olive oil. It is from the first pressing of the olives. It is the least processed and has to have less than 0.8 per cent free oleic acid. The lower this percentage of oleic acid, the higher the quality of the oil. It should have a fresh flavour of olives. Avoid olive oils that have been extracted with the aid of chemicals. A good-quality extra-virgin olive oil should be produced at a temperature below 30°C (86°F). If the temperature is higher it degrades the oil.</p>
<p class="tx">Check out the range of regional oils on offer in shops and delis and always bring some back if you travel in Italy. Price is a good indicator of quality. We buy one standard extra-virgin olive oil probably made from a blend of olives from Europe for cooking, and a more expensive single-estate oil from Italy for finishing food.</p>
<p class="tx">Extra-virgin olive oil loses its flavour over time. Every winter, new oil is made and this fresh oil is used where you can taste it the most: as a final flourish on tomato bruschetta; swirled into a warm soup; or drizzled over grilled meats, steamed vegetables or hot pasta, where the heat will warm up the oil and release the aroma of freshly pressed olives. Last year’s oil can be used for everything else.</p>
<p class="tx">Olive oil does have a lower smoke point than nut, seed or coconut oil, but it is only a little lower. We use it for everything apart from deep-fat frying. (For more olive oil facts see <a href="http://caldesi.com">caldesi.com</a>.)</p>
