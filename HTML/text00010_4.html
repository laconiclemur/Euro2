<span class="big">T</span>
he town of Vilafranca de Penedés in Catalonia is well known for its poultry. Every Saturday smallholders and collectors come to peruse the baskets and cages of live fowl on offer. Chickens are snapped up for breeding and egg laying while some of the more exotic cockerels and duck will strut their stuff as showpieces in the enthusiasts’ back yards. The pinnacle of the calendar comes in December at the Fira del Gall, or Cockerel Fair when discerning cooks come from afar to purchase their Christmas bird. It’s an annual tradition, greeted with enthusiasm by the entire family. More importantly it is a way of guaranteeing the provenance of the festive feast.</p>
<p class="indent">Proud farmers and breeders give first hand information about their poultry before any money changes hands. Then it is up to the customer to carry his bird to a large temporary shed where children witness cockerels, capons, hens or ducks being handed over the counter to meet their death, but there is no bloodthirsty rubbernecking. Families can go about the rest of the shopping, have a leisurely cup of coffee and return to collect their oven-ready bird a couple of hours later.</p>
<p class="indent">However, much poultry, chicken in particular, has suffered the same hideous fate in Spain as elsewhere in the western world. Tasteless factory-farmed flesh from luckless fowl packed into huge barns has sullied its good name. Many consumers have been lured into seizing a bargain at the expense of flavour, and animal welfare. It seems bizarre to consider that chicken was once the <em>fiesta</em>
 day treat, and even more unthinkable that, in Northern Catalonia, the dish was padded out with more readily available lobster and prawns to feed the crowds. Yet taste a true, free-range, farm-reared chicken and the notion no longer seems strange.</p>
<p class="indent">Many market stalls sell <em>pollo de granja</em>
 or <em>pollo de corral</em>
, free-range chicken, alongside farmed rabbit. There are countless wonderfully simple and tasty recipes for both but few make it outside of the home kitchen. The truth is that most restaurants consider such dishes far too commonplace. There is the <em>gallina</em>
, or boiling fowl too, a particularly flavoursome choice when it comes to stocks and <em>cocidos</em>
, or stews. Meanwhile, farmed quail and squab are given a more elevated status, often cooked with fruit sauces that hark back to the time of the Moors. Duck and goose are favourites in the Northeast combined with turnips, pears, figs or prunes. French influence is strong too with <em>confit</em>
 and <em>foie gras</em>
 appearing on upmarket menus with increasing regularity. Turkey is a Christmas treat for some, stuffed with apricots, chestnuts, sausage and herbs but is also available all year round.</p>
<p class="indent">In autumn the shooting season begins in earnest making the countryside a hazardous place to wander. Feathered game often adorns the poultry stall, although hanging times vary with the weather, and much is plucked and drawn within a day of being shot. The red-legged partridge is without a doubt the most plentiful game bird on offer, particularly in Castille. But wild duck, quail, wood pigeon and pheasant are sometimes available. Many game birds are pickled in escabeche, a wine and vinegar marinade that has a dual purpose, simultaneously moistening and preserving the lean flesh.</p>
<p class="indent">Much of the Spanish landscape is rugged and mountainous, making a great habitat for rabbit, hare, deer, wild boar and even the odd bear. Wild rabbit is a common sight in many markets while specialist stalls deal with the larger game. Rich game stews made with hare, venison or boar are often flavoured with wine, herbs and chocolate, while the bear stew once popular in Asturias has thankfully been relegated to the history books.</p>

pollastre a la catalana</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">catalan chicken</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Fruit is often used in savoury dishes, a hint of Spain’s Moorish heritage. Don’t be tempted to cut down on the generous quantities of apricots, sultanas and nuts in the recipe, they contrast beautifully with the salty bacon. You will need to begin this dish a couple of hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz dried apricots</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz sultanas</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>70 ml/2½ fl oz brandy</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 chicken, cut into 8 portions, or 4 chicken legs, jointed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7 oz unsmoked bacon, cut into small pieces</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 Spanish onions, diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 head of garlic, cloves peeled but left whole</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 large, ripe tomatoes, grated (see page 152)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a small bunch of fresh thyme, rosemary, parsley and a bay leaf tied with string</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>60 g/2½oz toasted pine kernels</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½fl oz dry white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>600–750 ml/1–1¼ pints chicken stock (see right)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>crusty bread, to serve (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by soaking the dried fruit in a small bowl with the brandy. Leave to macerate for a couple of hours.</p>
<p class="extract">Season the chicken pieces with a little salt. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the chicken and brown over a high heat until crisp and golden, then set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the oil from the frying pan into a terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 or cast-iron casserole. Add the bacon and fry over a medium heat until it begins to brown.</p>
<p class="extract">Next add the onions, the garlic cloves, the tomato flesh and the herbs. Give everything a good stir before adding the chicken pieces. Keep the pan bubbling over a medium heat until the onion and garlic colour, but do not let them burn.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the soaked dried fruit, pine kernels, wine and half the stock to the chicken and continue to simmer over a medium heat until the flesh is cooked through and the juices run clear, about 20–30 minutes depending on the size of the portions or joints. Add more stock if necessary, as the liquid reduces. You should have plenty of sauce so make sure you have some good bread to mop up the juices.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may like to cook the chicken in the oven, giving a crisper skin. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5 and cook for about 30–40 minutes, or until the juices run clear.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Making stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Place the chicken bones in a large saucepan and add enough water to cover. You can also use chicken wings, which are a bargain if you have no leftover carcass. You may like to add any or all of the following to the bones: carrot, leek, onion, parsley stalks, a stick of celery, or a few peppercorns. However, the bones alone will produce a good base. The only hard and fast rule – never add salt.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Bring the water to the boil and remove the frothy scum from the top. Next reduce the heat and simmer gently for 2–3 hours.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent2">Strain the stock and remove the fat, leave to cool slightly and then skim it off with a spoon or mop it up by laying kitchen paper over the liquid for a second. Reduce the liquid until well flavoured and then refrigerate for 2–3 days or freeze and use as required.</p>

pechuga rellena con pisto</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_5">stuffed chicken breast with pisto</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Stuffed chicken breasts are commonly available at the market stall, a type of ‘ready meal’ to throw in the pan or the oven when you get home. This combination takes little time to prepare yourself and is always a winner with children.</p>
<p class="indent">I like to bake the chicken breasts in the oven with the <em>pisto</em>
 to keep the meat moist, but you may prefer to simply fry them in the pan a little longer until thoroughly cooked through and then serve with wedges of lemon.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 medium chicken breasts</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 slices of ham such as <em>jamón York</em>
, cooked ham rather than cured</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 slices of mild cow’s milk cheese such as young Mahón, or the less authentic Emmental</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tsp salt and a little freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 x <strong>
<em>Pisto</em>
</strong>
 recipe (see page 152)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut each chicken breast horizontally and open it up like a book. Lay the 4 breasts on a board and cover with a sheet of clingfilm or greaseproof paper. Next, using a rolling pin, beat out the meat carefully until it is all roughly the same thickness. Place a slice of ham and a slice of cheese onto each breast and fold the chicken back over to close.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the flour on a large plate and season with the salt and pepper, then dip each breast in the mixture to coat.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the chicken and fry until golden on both sides. Next place the chicken in a small terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 or ovenproof dish. Spoon over the <em>pisto</em>
 and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken feels firm and thoroughly cooked through.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying chicken</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Always buy the best chicken you can afford – intensively farmed chicken is tasteless, never mind the welfare considerations. Free range, <em>pollo de granja</em>
 or <em>pollo de corral</em>
 or, better still, organic, <em>ecológico</em>
, is the way to go.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Buying a whole bird will give you much better value as you can use the bones for invaluable stock. If you don’t get around to making it straight away you could freeze the carcass and have a stock ‘fest’ once you have amassed a few birds.</span>

pollo con aceitunas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_7">chicken with olives</h1>
<p class="nonindent">You seldom find chicken served in a restaurant unless you plump for the bargain three-course <em>menú del dia</em>
, or menu of the day. Chicken is considered homely, comfort food. Simple roast chicken can often be snapped up from the market van, cooked on a spit and flavoured with a few fresh herbs. The smell of crisping skin wafts around the stalls, making it nigh impossible to concentrate on the rest of the shopping. Chicken also finds its way into numerous regional dishes such as this one from Andalucia with its signature hint of sherry.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1.8 kg/4 lb chicken, jointed into 4 pieces, or 4 chicken legs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tbsp fresh thyme, leaves removed from stems</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>10 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp sweet paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 onions, cut into fine slices</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 garlic cloves, left whole</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 small dried chilli</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>70 ml/2½ fl oz dry sherry</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 g/6 oz black olives</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 lemon, quartered</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5.</p>
<p class="extract">Season the chicken with salt. Heat the olive oil in a pan, a terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 is ideal for cooking this dish, but any large, low-sided pan will do. Add the chicken pieces and fry until the skin crisps and turns golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the chicken from the pan, place in a bowl and toss with the fresh herbs and paprika.</p>
<p class="extract">Return the pan to the heat and, using the same oil, fry the onions until they begin to brown. Add the garlic and chilli and continue to cook until the garlic begins to colour too. Take great care not to burn the garlic: burnt garlic tastes bitter and can ruin an entire dish.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the chicken to the pan together with any loose herbs from the bowl. Pour in the sherry and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes until the chicken is almost ready.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the black olives with the lemon quarters and return the chicken to the oven for about 5 minutes. Ensure that the chicken is thoroughly cooked before serving.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This dish is usually served with plenty of white bread, but you could choose to accompany it with rice or mashed potato to soak up some of the delicious juices.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cooking chicken</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Chicken breasts always cook more quickly than legs so, when cooking casseroles, it is a good idea to remove the breasts about two-thirds of the way through the cooking time. Place them back in the pan for the last few minutes to warm through thoroughly. I like to leave chicken with the skin on, because it keeps the meat moist during cooking. You can always remove the skin, if you prefer, before serving.</span>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_9">sautéed chicken livers</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The delectable taste of chicken liver somehow belies its economical origins. Here is a quick, delicious snack or a wonderful starter. It is worth keeping some livers in the freezer for this dish alone.</p>
<p class="indent">Grapes make a great accompaniment to the livers. They are traditionally served peeled, so I am told. Quite frankly life’s too short. In any case, have you ever been bothered by a grape skin? Ironically I have, but only when trying to guzzle my obligatory dozen grapes, in time with the chimes of the New Year’s Eve bells, as is the custom in Spain. Then the tiny cans of ready-peeled and counted grapes can prove quite an advantage.</p>

<p class="extract">When almost ready to serve, add the livers to the bacon and brown over a high heat. Add the onion together with the sherry, thyme, half of the parsley and a touch of salt and pepper and cook for about 5 minutes. Check and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve with the remaining parsley, grapes and toast or fried bread.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and preparing chicken livers</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Avoid factory-farmed chicken livers if you can; a free-range chicken such as a <em>pollo de granja</em>
 or <em>pollo de corral</em>
 will have a better liver as well as meat. Trim away any green-tinged liver, it is not off, but indicates contact with the bile and its bitterness can taint a dish. Also remove any of the white connecting threads.</span>

perdiz en escabeche</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_11">pickled partridge</h1>
<p class="nonindent">An <em>escabeche</em>
 is an ancient means of preserving poultry or fish in a highly acidic mixture of wine and vinegar. The dish not only keeps for a few days but improves with time too, making it an ideal do-ahead dish for entertaining.</p>
<p class="indent">Game birds are lean and do have a tendency to dry out during cooking if you are not careful. Sitting in this piquant marinade will ensure that the flesh becomes tender and juicy. Quail, chicken, pheasant and even rabbit are also fabulous prepared in this way (see cooking times right). You will need to prepare this dish at least 24 hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>

<strong>2 partridge, or 4 if you have large appetites, split in half</strong>

<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the partridge halves and fry until they begin to brown. Remove the partridges with a slotted spoon and add the onion and carrots to the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, then add the garlic and cook gently until it has turned pale gold. Take care not to burn the garlic.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour in the wine, vinegar and water or stock together with the peppercorns, saffron, bay leaves, thyme, paprika and a good pinch of salt. Bring everything to the boil then pop in the partridge. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Transfer the partridge and vegetables to a small dish and pour over the liquid. Now the important bit: the marinade must completely cover the partridge if it is to act as a preservative. Leave to cool and then refrigerate for at least 24 hours, or better still a couple of days.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve the partridge and vegetables with a little juice, lemon slices, chopped parsley and a dash of really good extra virgin olive oil. The dish is usually served alone, but I love to have a crisp green salad alongside.</p>

croquetas de perdiz y jamón</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">partridge and ham croquettes</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The red-legged partridge is a popular and plentiful game bird in much of Spain. During the shooting season from October to March you will have no problem procuring one from the local market, feathers on or plucked and ready to go. In summertime you may like to try this recipe with chicken instead.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes 12 croquettes</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 partridge</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 onion, quartered</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>300 ml/10 fl oz water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ small onion, very finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 ml/8 fl oz mixture of milk and stock from the partridge</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 thick slices of <strong>
<em>jamón Serrano</em>
</strong>
, about 75 g/3 oz</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>

<strong>freshly grated nutmeg</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7 oz fine white, dried breadcrumbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 medium eggs, beaten with a little water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>mild olive or vegetable oil, for frying</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a small pan or casserole, add the partridge and brown for a few minutes. Add the onion quarters, bay leaf and water, then cover and simmer until the partridge is cooked, about 20–30 minutes depending on the size of the bird.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the bird to cool slightly before removing all the meat from the carcass and chopping or mincing it very finely indeed. Strain the cooking stock and reserve.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the remaining olive oil in a saucepan, add the finely diced onion and fry until soft. Sprinkle over the flour and cook for a couple of minutes. Slowly add the milk and stock, stirring as if you were making a béchamel sauce. Boil the mixture for 2 minutes until it becomes really thick and shiny.</p>
<p class="extract">Next add the partridge and the <em>jamón</em>
. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Take care as the <em>jamón</em>
 could be quite salty already. Spread the mixture in a thick layer on a flat dish and leave to cool. Chill for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, until firm enough to handle.</p>
<p class="extract">Now for the production line: place half the breadcrumbs (once these are used up start again with the other half, as they can become quite lumpy) and beaten eggs in 2 wide dishes alongside a tray ready for the croquettes.</p>
<p class="extract">Using a knife, mark the chilled mixture into 12 bricks. Using your hands, roll each brick into a ball or cylinder. A bowl of warm water is ideal for keeping your hands damp and preventing them becoming too sticky. Dip in the breadcrumbs, then the egg and then back in the crumbs. Chill the croquettes for at least 1 hour, or freeze until ready to use.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat enough oil for frying in a deep-fat fryer or deep frying pan until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. You will need to submerge the croquettes so make sure there is enough oil in the pan. Fry them (see right) until golden brown, then drain on kitchen paper and serve at once.</p>

<strong>Frying tips</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5" style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="gray">A deep-fat fryer is the safest and most efficient way of frying, set at a medium heat of 190°C/375°F for <em>croquetas</em>
. If you are using a pan, make sure you only half-fill it, as the oil will expand upon heating. Take care to heat the fat to the right temperature, a cube of bread should sizzle and brown in 30 seconds; any slower and the food will become fatty and soggy, any faster and you will not cook the centre properly or the <em>croquetas</em>
 may burst.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1" style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="gray">Always fry food in small batches; too much in one go will drastically lower the temperature of the oil.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1" style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="gray">Strain the cooled oil after use and discard as soon as it becomes dark or cloudy.</span>

<p class="nonindent">Every year, on the last weekend before Christmas, the town of Vilafranca de Penedès in Catalonia hosts a huge poultry market: the <em>Fira del Gall</em>
, or Cockerel Fair. The region is famed for its delicious free-range poultry. Families crowd into the Ramblas, the tree lined promenade, to select their Christmas dinner. Prize birds strut their stuff in large cages and corrals: cockerels, capons, hens, geese, turkey and duck. Toddlers pose for the annual festive photograph while cooks deliberate over which bird will grace their table.</p>
<p class="indent">I was struck by the show of tearful tenderness as a small boy patted a duck farewell before it was handed over to be prepared for the pot. This is stark reality – return in an hour and the bird is plucked and drawn.</p>

<strong>1.5–2 kg/3¼ –4½ lb duck</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bay leaf</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 fresh sprig of thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ stick cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 onion, quartered</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 carrot, peeled but left whole</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 ripe tomato, left whole</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz <strong>
<em>Vi Ranci</em>
</strong>
 or <strong>
<em>Oloroso</em>
</strong>
 sherry (see page 16)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>12 ready-to-eat prunes, or dried prunes soaked for at least an hour in hot water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 g/2 oz pine kernels, toasted (see page 108)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="extract">Prick the duck all over with a fork and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the bay leaf, thyme and cinnamon inside the duck and place the vegetables into a large roasting tin with the olive oil. Put the duck on a rack in the roasting tin above the vegetables.</p>
<p class="extract">Roast the duck breast-side down for the first 30 minutes then turn it over to ensure a wonderfully juicy result. Add the sherry and water and continue to cook for a further 1 hour. Do check every 20 minutes or so to make sure there is some liquid in the roasting tin and add more water, if necessary.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the duck is cooked, drain well and cut into quarters, removing the backbone. Place in an ovenproof dish or terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
. Skim off the fat in the roasting tin, there will be plenty of it – great for roast potatoes at a later date.</p>
<p class="extract">Press the vegetables, along with the juices, through a <em>chinoise</em>
, or sieve, or <em>pasapurés</em>
, and add to the duck. Sprinkle with the prunes and toasted pine kernels and return to the oven for a further 5 minutes until piping hot.</p>

conejo al salmorejo</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_17">rabbit in salmorejo sauce</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Rabbit is extremely popular in Spain, with none of the childhood Benjamin Bunny connotations we have to contend with. Most of the farmed rabbit on offer is displayed ready paunched and skinned while the tastier wild animals are hung, fur intact, to demonstrate their origins. Never fear, once sold the specialist game dealer will have the rabbit ready for the pot in a trice.</p>
<p class="indent">You should begin this recipe a day in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 kg/2¼lb rabbit, jointed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>300 ml/10 fl oz white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 bay leaves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 fresh sprigs of thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 fresh sprig of oregano</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp hot paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Using a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic with a pinch of salt and pepper to a creamy paste.</p>
<p class="extract">Now place the rabbit joints in a large bowl together with the garlic paste, wine, sherry vinegar, herbs and spices. Turn the meat in the mixture and leave to marinate overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the rabbit from the marinade and season with a little salt. Set the marinade aside to use later.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large a terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 or cast-iron casserole, add the rabbit and fry until golden and tender.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour over the marinade and simmer gently until tender. Alternatively, bake in an oven preheated to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4 for about 45 minutes until tender.</p>

<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a popular dish in the Canary Islands where it is served with <em>Papas Arrugadas</em>
 (see page 153). You could, of course, serve it with plain new potatoes too.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Wild or farmed?</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">There is no denying that wild rabbit has a much gamier, tastier flavour than its more delicate, or some would say ‘bland’ farmed cousin. However, as some wild animals are older they can be rather lean and tough so that an oily marinade and slow cooking are often the only way to go.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Both farmed or young wild rabbit can be grilled or roasted, but care must still be taken not to dry the lean meat out, so a few hours in an oily marinade prior to cooking is a good idea.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Wild rabbit is sold ‘skin on’ so that a discerning buyer can look out for the telltale sharp claws and soft ears of a young specimen.</span>

guiso de venado</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_19">venison casserole</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Having scaled the steepest, narrowest street imaginable to reach it, Cazorla’s weekly market was rather an anticlimax – a mile long stretch of knickers, bath towels, pot plants and bedroom slippers and not a sausage in sight. Thankfully I was able to find some consolation at the <em>churros</em>
 van with a paper-full of deliciously fattening dough fritters. The view was pretty mind-blowing too, a seemingly infinite panorama of olive groves: textbook Andalucia.</p>
<p class="indent">With supper in mind the modest Mercado Municipal back in the town centre was a much better bet. One small butcher stocked game from the nearby Sierra – a reminder that wild boar and venison are not confined to Spain’s northerly peaks, but are found in the mountainous terrain of Andalucia and Extremadura too.</p>

<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 kg/2¼ lb venison, cut into large dice</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/ 4 oz <strong>
<em>panceta</em>
</strong>
 or fatty bacon, cubed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 onions, diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 leeks, sliced and rinsed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 carrot, peeled and diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 fresh sprig of thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 bay leaves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 ml/7 fl oz red wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/Gas Mark 2.</p>
<p class="extract">Season the venison with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the venison in small batches and fry briefly, so that it sears rather than stews. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the <em>panceta</em>
, or bacon to the pan together with the onions, leeks and carrot and fry until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown.</p>
<p class="extract">Next add the garlic and stir until it begins to give off its inimitable aroma. Pop the venison back in the pan. Add the herbs, the wine and just enough water to cover the meat, then cover and cook in the oven until fabulously tender. This may take anything between 1½ to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="extract">Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.</p>
<p class="extract">You may like to accompany this dish with white rice or creamy mashed potato, but I have to say that the unlikely local combination of venison casserole and chips is divine. We are not talking the spindly French variety but chunky chips of fried potato.</p>

<strong>Buying and cooking venison</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">
<em>Ciervo</em>
, or red deer, and less commonly <em>corzo</em>
, roe deer, and <em>gamo</em>
, fallow deer, are all available in Spain. The same tips apply to all of them.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Avoid shiny, wet looking meat that has probably not been hung for long enough, aged meat will have a dark, dull appearance.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Venison is extremely lean meat, so it has a tendency to dry out if not treated carefully.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Tender cuts such as the saddle, containing the loin and the fillet, or haunch, the leg, can be seared or roasted quickly and left quite pink.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Meanwhile, the neck and shoulder require long, slow cooking such as braising or stewing to tenderize the tougher meat. A wine marinade may help to tenderize the meat, but the down side is that it may draw out valuable moisture from the meat too, so I wouldn’t bother. Adequate ageing and a very low oven temperature will do the trick.</span>
