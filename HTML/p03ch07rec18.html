<p class="summary"><span class="italic">I was surprised to find this Mediterranean ratatouille-type dish in the center of Spain. Fried onions, eggplants, and zucchini comprise the old Moorish dish</span> alboronía, <span class="italic">which the Castilians adopted after they conquered Toledo. Peppers and tomatoes were added later. Some versions are without eggplants. Some people peel the eggplants and zucchini. Some add potatoes or drop some eggs on top at the end. I prefer to cook the eggplants separately, because of the way they absorb a lot of oil but then release it.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The best</span> pisto <span class="italic">that I have eaten was made by Rosemary, my friend Alicia’s young Bolivian maid in Alicante. She learned how to cook when she worked at the home of the Spanish architect Antonio Lamela, who built the modern center of Madrid and whose family created the bourgeois style in the exclusive</span> barrio de Salamanca. <span class="italic">Rosemary swam with us early in the morning, then started cooking fabulous dishes for our large group of family and friends. This is her recipe, slightly adapted.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 large onions (about 1 pound), coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">About ⅔ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">3 red bell peppers, or a mix of red and green, cored, seeded, and cut into ½-inch cubes</p>
<p class="qun">3 zucchini, cut into ½-inch cubes</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">5 to 6 tomatoes (about 1 pound), peeled and diced</p>
<p class="qun">1½ teaspoons sugar, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun1">1 large or 2 small eggplants (about 1 pound), cut into ½-inch cubes</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onions in about ⅓ cup of the oil in a large skillet or paella pan over medium-low heat, stirring often, until they begin to soften. Add the bell peppers and cook until they begin to soften. Add the zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and cook, turning them gently, until they soften. Add the tomatoes, with their juices, and the sugar and cook until the liquid has evaporated.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, fry the eggplant in ⅓ cup oil in another large skillet over high heat, stirring and turning the pieces with a slotted spoon or spatula. It will absorb a lot of oil at first but then gradually release most of it. When the eggplant is well cooked and soft, lift it out and drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the eggplant to the rest of the vegetables, mix gently, and cook for a couple of minutes more.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Rosemary also makes <span class="italic">pisto</span> with potatoes cut into cubes—they go in after the onions—and flavors it with 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano.</p>
