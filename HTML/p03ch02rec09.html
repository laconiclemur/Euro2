</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Romesco is the star at festivals in the ancient Roman port of Tarragona, where it was born, and there are competitions for the best one. It is made with ground almonds or hazelnuts or a mixture of the two, tomatoes, and, traditionally, a mild, sweet dried pepper called</span> romesco <span class="italic">or</span> cuerno de cabra <span class="italic">(goat’s horn), because of its curved shape. But these peppers are very expensive, so it is the small, round, wine-red Murcian</span> ñoras <span class="italic">(</span>nyoras <span class="italic">in Catalan), also mild and sweet but with a taste of their own, that are more widely used today.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The sauce is simple, but there are many versions. Ingredients can be toasted or fried, and proportions vary so that it is more or less thick. A variant of romesco is the</span> salsa salvitjada <span class="italic">(</span>salvitxada <span class="italic">in Catalan) served at</span> calçotadas<span class="italic">—the famous Catalan festivals where</span> calçots, <span class="italic">a type of scallion grown in a special way to become extra fat, are grilled in the open. And the sauce is</span> xatò <span class="italic">when it is used as a dressing for a mixed salad of escarole with salt cod or anchovies called</span> xatonada. <span class="italic">In the beginning, fishermen made romesco with bread, while people in the countryside who grew almond trees made it with almonds.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Ñora peppers have just started to appear in specialty shops outside Spain, and you can buy them online. You can substitute other mild dried peppers, and you can also make a perfect romesco simply using</span> pimentón dulce <span class="italic">(sweet paprika), which is the same dried pepper in powdered form.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Everybody has their own way of making romesco sauce, and nowadays chefs improvise with all kinds of ingredients. The archive collection of the Institut Català de la Cuina (Catalan Culinary Institute) gives this very basic recipe, and the variations are a matter of “do you fry or toast and do you add fried bread or not.” The quantities are to your taste.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Romesco traditionally accompanies fish, vegetables, or meat. Use it for grilled prawns and fish and for roasted vegetables including large shallots or medium onions.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 <span class="italic">ñora</span> peppers or other mild dried peppers (see the variations)</p>
<p class="qun">½ head garlic, in its skin</p>
<p class="qun">6 small tomatoes (about 1 pound)</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup whole blanched almonds or hazelnuts, or ¼ cup of each, lightly toasted</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 teaspoons wine vinegar, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup extra virgin olive oil, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Cut the peppers open and remove the seeds and stems. Soak in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, or until soft; drain.</p>
<p class="recsum1"><span>Meanwhile, put the garlic and tomatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet and cook under a hot broiler until the garlic feels soft and the tomato skins come off easily, 20 to 25 minutes. Pull the skins off the tomatoes, and squeeze the garlic out of the skins.</span></p>
<p class="recsum1"><span>Blend the drained pepper, the garlic, and the almonds and/or hazelnuts to a paste in a food processor. Add the tomatoes and blend to a light rough cream (the nuts give it a rough texture). Add the vinegar, oil, and salt to taste.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Instead of roasting them, fry the peeled garlic cloves, cut in half if large, in a little oil until soft and lightly brown; and fry the nuts in oil instead of toasting them.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• For a thicker version, add a slice of fried white bread.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• For a thinner sauce, use more olive oil.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Use 2 teaspoons <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika) instead of the dried peppers.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Add a piece of fresh hot chile or a pinch of cayenne to the processor along with the garlic.</p>
