<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">The crispness of the brittle crust, the decadence of the cream, and the acidity of the fruit combine in irresistible ways in this traditional recipe. It’s not hard to make but takes some time because of the separate steps and the need for the crust and crème filling to cool before assembly.

Add the egg until completely incorporated. Add all flour and mix with your hands, rubbing the mix together rapidly. Do not work on this dough too long, only until everything is mixed. Roll the dough into a ball and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. This will harden the dough and make it ‘spreadable’.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Preheat oven to 350°F.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, flatten the dough to about ¼ in. thick. I’m no crust goddess, so I roll all my dough between two sheets of parchment paper, which makes everything a breeze; particularly the transfer of the dough to the pie mold. And remember: when it sticks, dust with flour.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Transfer the dough to the tart pan (s) (I keep my dough on the parchment paper and plop it in the pan.) Prick the dough with a fork so that it will cook evenly and won’t bubble up.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Bake the pie crust for 10 to 15 minutes until slightly golden. Keep your eyes on it toward the end as it can go from golden to burned in an instant. Remove from the oven and let cool in dish.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="underline">Cream filling: Crème pâtissière</span></p><p class="calibre6">1- In a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil with the pinch of salt and the vanilla.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whip the sugar and eggs together until smooth and lighter in color. Add flour slowly (I like to sift it through a fine mesh colander to avoid lumps, and it’s so pretty!)</p><p class="calibre6">3- When the milk boils, pour it slowly into the bowl containing the sugar and flour mix. Adding too fast will result in the eggs cooking; you don’t want that.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Pour the entire mixture back into the pan. Turn on the heat to medium low and cook as you whip the entire time. The mix will begin to thicken. Continue to cook for a minute after the first thickening. Do not let it stick to the saucepan.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Cover your crème pâtissière. Place it in the refrigerator until cooled off completely.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Assembly time! You’ve got your pie crusts (still in the pan), your crème pâtissière, and your fruit. Layer the cream at the bottom of the crust. Arrange the fruit prettily, remove from tart pan, and serve!</p><p class="calibre6">Another option is to heat up a tablespoon of berry jam in the microwave and brush over the fruit for that magical glow.</p></div></div></body></html>
