<p class="yield">MAKES A GENEROUS 1 PINT/500 ML</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This is an end-of-the-summer marmalade, when tomato vines are at their most generous, and you find, in the markets, great stacks of brilliant red <em>tomates</em> bursting with flavors. A dollop of this marmalade is perfect spooned onto a wedge of aged sheep’s-milk cheese or with some fresh but strong-flavored goat cheese. At home, we also like it with grilled fresh pork sausages.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 POUNDS/1.4 KG RIPE TOMATOES</li>
<li>2½&gt; CUPS/500 G SUGAR</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Blanch and peel the tomatoes following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>. Working over a bowl to catch all of the juices, seed and core the tomatoes. Cut them into chunky pieces. There should be at least 2 pounds/910 g of flesh.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large, heavy saucepan, add the tomatoes and their juices along with the sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring from time to time, until thick and glazy, with the tomatoes somewhat dissolved and the liquid evaporated, about 1 hour. Remove the pan from the heat, and let cool for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Spoon the marmalade into sterilized glass canning jars, leaving one finger space at the top. Wipe the jars clean and seal. Store in the refrigerator and use within 1 month.</p>
