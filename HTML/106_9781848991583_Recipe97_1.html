<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_161"/><b>Crab Tian</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Artichoke</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Pepper Confit</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>Spring is the time for this recipe, when you can get some delicious crab, freshly cooked for you. Or, why not try cooking the crab yourself? If you like, you can also use a little of the brown meat and mix it with the white, which will give the dish more strength and flavor. The red bell peppers need to be roasted, which is very easy, but if you’re short of time, just use some from a jar of roasted Spanish piquillo peppers. These ingredients make a brilliant combination with a light mayonnaise with a touch of tarragon for freshness.</b></p>

Take a spoonful of the crab mixture and put on top of each piece of red pepper, then top that with a piece of artichoke, then another piece of red pepper, another spoonful of crab, and finally another artichoke. Divide the arugula leaves among the plates. Whisk the Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces into the French dressing, then drizzle over the tops to serve.</p>
