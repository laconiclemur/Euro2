<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Galicians make this soup with what they grow in their vegetable patch—beans, potatoes, cabbage, and turnip greens. (They feed the turnips to their pigs.) Their cabbages grow very big and long. They use them young and small for this soup; when the cabbages get big and tough, they boil them for their animals. Smoked salt pork fat, called</span> unto, <span class="italic">gives the soup a distinctive flavor. Because the climate was too wet to cure the pork in the attics of their little farmsteads, peasant farmers cured it in their fireplaces, and that is why a smoky flavor is one of the characteristics of many Galician dishes. Cristobo Ramírez, a journalist on</span> La Voz de Galicia <span class="italic">who writes about gastronomy, said that when he was young, they ate</span> caldo <span class="italic">every day. These days, grand versions are made with chicken, veal, or ham broths rather than the traditional water. I loved the one I ate at the Hostal de las Reyes Católicos, the</span> parador <span class="italic">opposite the great Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela that has lodged pilgrims since 1499.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">8 cups chicken or ham stock (or 8 to 9 cups water plus 2 bouillon cubes, and a ham bone if you have one)</p>
<p class="qun">8 thin slices smoked bacon</p>
<p class="qun">2 baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound green cabbage leaves, spring greens, or turnip tops, cut into 2 to 3 pieces each</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun1">One 14-ounce can small white beans</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the stock, bacon, potatoes, and cabbage, greens, or turnip tops in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Add salt and pepper to taste and simmer gently, covered, over low heat for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the beans and cook for 5 minutes more.</p>
