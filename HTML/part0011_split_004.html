  <h3 class="h3a">Mashed potato cake with porcini and speck</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">The <em class="calibre4">gattó di patate</em> is a typically Neapolitan dish whose name derives from the <em class="calibre4">French gâteau</em>, meaning ‘cake’. Apparently it was first made in Naples in 1768 for the wedding of Marie Caroline (sister of Marie Antoinette) to Ferdinand, King of Naples; French cuisine was highly influential in Europe at that time. In southern Italy, <em class="calibre4">gattó</em> is traditionally made with mozzarella and pieces of leftover salami and prosciutto. This is a south-meets-north version, a southern speciality using northern ingredients – dried porcini mushrooms, speck (smoked cured ham) and Taleggio cheese. Of course, if you prefer, you can use mozzarella and a mix of prosciutto and salami. Once baked, it is left to rest in the warm oven for at least 30 minutes – this way all the flavours come together for maximum taste – and enjoyed at room temperature. It tastes even better the next day, eaten cold. This is a meal in itself, served with a mixed side salad.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz floury (starchy) potatoes, such as red Desirée, scrubbed</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/7 tbsp butter, plus extra to grease</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz piece of speck or Parma ham, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp dried breadcrumbs, plus extra to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz button mushrooms, halved</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</p>

  <p class="ing2">200g/7oz Taleggio cheese, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="para">Boil the potatoes in their skins until cooked through, drain, leave until cool enough to handle, then peel off the skins. Mash the potatoes together with 75g/2¾oz/5 tbsp of the butter. Add the speck, Parmesan, eggs and yolks and combine well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Grease an ovenproof dish with butter and dust with breadcrumbs.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and cook on a medium heat for a couple of minutes, then discard the garlic. Drain the porcini, add to the pan and stir-fry for 4 minutes. Add the button mushrooms, parsley, salt and pepper to taste and cook for a further 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Put half of the mashed potato mixture in the prepared dish, cover with the mushroom mixture and the Taleggio cheese, and then the remaining potato mixture. Dot with the remaining butter and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Bake in the oven for 1 hour, until the top is golden brown.</p>

  <p class="para1">Switch the oven off and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes before serving.</p>
