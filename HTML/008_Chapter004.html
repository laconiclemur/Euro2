    <p class="noindent1"><a id="page_147"/><span class="small">I USUALLY DREAD THE FIRST BARBECUE OF THE SEASON</span>, which is almost always a spur of the moment thing. What will we find stuck on the grill grate this year? Last year’s pork loin? Or perhaps a bit of leftover corn-fed chicken? And the bowl that I’ve been looking for all winter can always be found under the grill, filled with a bunch of frozen insects that got trapped when the cold came. Here I’ve included some silly tips and ideas for the grilling season, as I take you over a few grilling basics. <span class="italic">Lump charcoal or briquettes</span>? Lump charcoal comes from wood and doesn’t make too much dust, which makes for easy cleaning. It also lends your food a nice flavor. Lump charcoal can reach high temperatures quickly, which is good for certain kinds of grilling. Briquettes consist of compressed wood by-products and hold temperatures both longer and more evenly than coal does. The downside is that they’re messy and made with chemicals. My way is to not choose sides, but rather to use both coal and briquettes. I use the briquettes for the even heat and the coal for the high heat and taste. To <span class="italic">marinate or not to marinate</span>? Many people marinate… and marinate… and marinate… and as the summer draws to an end, they’ve become marinated as well. <a id="page_148"/>Truth be told, the marinade doesn’t make that much of a difference. If you do marinate, you should make sure the meat is fatty, and it should be left to marinate for a few days; this allows the fibers to break down, and the meat tenderizes. If you do want a marinade, it’s better to apply it while the meat is on the grill, meaning that you glaze the meat several times during the grilling process or afterward. Glazing meat with chimichurri right before serving is something I love to do! You can also <span class="italic">rub</span> the meat with a spice mix right before you grill it.</p>

    <p class="noindent1"><span class="italic">Direct grilling</span>. This is the way I usually do it—right over the heat/live coals. It’s hot enough and the cooking time is short.</p>

    <p class="noindent1"><span class="italic">Indirect grilling</span>. This is a little like using the oven. You don’t place the food to be grilled right on top of the heat but rather around it. The grill lid should be closed to let the heat come from both below and above.</p>

    <p class="noindent1"><span class="italic">Asado grilling</span>. This is when you grill over an open fire. This originally comes from the South American kitchen. Sometimes, the burning coal is just thrown in a big pit.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_1"><a id="page_151"/>79. Grilled Watermelon with Peanut Sauce</p>

  <p class="noindentl">When I grilled watermelon at Torekov’s camping grounds one summer, many people frowned at me. But watermelon really does taste delicious when grilled. You can also grill it ahead of time. Just add the peanut sauce and serve it at a big buffet dinner.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">6–8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 small watermelon (approx. 4½ lbs [2 kg])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil for glazing</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">PEANUT SAUCE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) roasted and salted peanuts</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">possibly ½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Mix the peanuts and about ½ tablespoon water into a smooth mixture. Add the rest of the water and all the other ingredients for the sauce and mix some more. If needed, season with some salt.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Cut the melon into wedges or whole slices as in the picture on the previous page. Glaze them with olive oil and grill for 2 minutes on each side. Let them get a charred grill pattern.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_2">80. Lobster with Dill and Lemon Butter</p>

  <p class="noindentl">With all due respect to the lobster, in this dish the butter steals the show. It’s super tasty with any kind of seafood. Or spread some of the butter on a piece of toast. Lobster is expensive, so make sure you treat it well and don’t burn it or make it tough.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">2–4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 live lobster (approx. 12 oz [350 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DILL AND LEMON BUTTER:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 sticks (200 g) butter, room temperature</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 small red onion, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) coarsely chopped dill</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon, zest + 2 tbsp juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Mix all the ingredients for the butter. Let it rest in the fridge. The butter is pictured on <a href="../Text/008_Chapter004.html#page_161">page 161</a>.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Split the live lobster down the middle with a sharp knife (start by cutting the head with the tip of the knife and work your way down the body). If you do this quickly and decisively, the lobster will die right away.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Put the lobster halves meat-side-up in aluminum foil and spread the butter on top of each piece. Wrap them up and place them on the grill grate. Grill the lobster halves until their shells turns red. Cook them on the edges of the grill for another 10 minutes so the meat springs back after you touch it.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Plate the lobster and drizzle the delicious butter from the pan on top. Serve with a dollop of green pea guacamole (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_252">page 252</a>). Enjoy!</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_3"><a id="page_155"/>81. Grilled Oysters with Lemon and Green Tabasco</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Eight oysters are enough for four, unless you’re oyster crazy and end up eating them all on your own! Watch your tongue, though, when you slurp the hot oysters, since I actually burned mine the first time I ate one. Blow, blow, and then blow some more. And yes, the oysters are definitely alive when you eat them raw and don’t die until they’re in your stomach. That’s just the way it is! The ones that are already dead should be thrown away. Also, green Tabasco is milder than the red version.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 oysters</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a few dashes of green Tabasco</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Open the oysters by sticking in a knife through the hinge between the two valves and twisting until you hear a popping sound. Continue to open the oyster by following the edge with your knife.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Put the oysters right on top of the burning coals. Grill them for 2–3 minutes, until they’re hot and the liquid starts to bubble.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Place the oysters on a serving platter, squeeze some lemon juice on top, and season with Tabasco. Serve right away.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_4">82. Grilled Whole Salmon with Green Pea Guacamole</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dish is really great if you have a nice piece of wood to place the salmon on—a piece of birch, for example. It’s a nice way to serve the fish. I’ll usually put the wood on a tray so guests can serve themselves. Serve this dish with the Caesar salad on <a href="../Text/006_Chapter002.html#page_28">page 28</a>.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">6–8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¾–2¼ lbs (800 g–1 kg)</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">TERIYAKI MARINADE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) Teriyaki sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp green curry paste</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp turmeric</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">GREEN PEA GUACAMOLE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">See recipe on <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_252">page 252</a></span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Begin by soaking a piece of wood in water for 24 hours—this is important—otherwise it’ll catch on fire!</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix all the ingredients for the marinade.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Cut the salmon to fit the piece of wood you’re using as a platter. Put the salmon on the wood with the skin side down and glaze with plenty of marinade. Then place the wood on top of the glowing coals and cover it with the grill lid. Since the smoke will give the fish some of its flavor, it’s important to be patient and not to lift the lid when it starts to smoke.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   After 15 minutes, lift the lid. If the sides of the salmon are done (and if you prefer your salmon a little on the rare side), you can remove it. If you want it more well-done, just leave it in for another 5 minutes. The core temperature should be between 113ºF (45ºC) and 118ºF (48ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Serve the salmon as is on top of the wood with some green pea guacamole and some boiled new potatoes.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_5"><a id="page_157"/>83. Texas Burger with Blue Cheese Cream</p>

  <p class="noindentl">An awesome burger made with ground wild boar meat, but you can, of course, use whatever meat you like. The blue cheese cream and the roasted onion make this a burger with a capital B. The cheese cream is also delicious as a dip for carrots or to serve with pie.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¾ lbs (800 g) ground beef or wild boar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp Dijon mustard</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tbsp paprika powder</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp ground nutmeg</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp cayenne pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp smoked Ancho chili powder</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">BLUE CHEESE CREAM:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) crème fraîche (or sour cream)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) crumbled blue cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, zest and juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FOR SERVING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 small yellow onions</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 hamburger buns</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil for drizzling over the bread</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 slices prosciutto</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">romaine lettuce</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Wrap each onion in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped onions on top of the hot coals and turn them over every so often. Let them stay on the coals until the onions turn soft, about 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix all ingredients for the blue cheese cream and season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the minced meat with mustard and spices. Shape into patties and place them on the grill. If you use beef, the meat can still be pink in the middle. If you do use wild boar, however, it needs to have a core temperature of 155ºF (68ºC) or be thoroughly cooked.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Split the garlic clove and rub it on top of the hamburger buns. Drizzle some olive oil on top and put them on the grill until they get a nice color.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Grill the prosciutto slices very quickly. They should turn a little crispy.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Remove the onions from the grill and squeeze out the middle part, which should now be soft and buttery.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Smear some blue cheese cream on the bottom of the buns with a leaf of lettuce, the burger, onion, and lastly the grilled prosciutto. Cover with the top of the bun and serve.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_6">84. Feta Cheese Salad with Mint and Maple Syrup</p>

  <p class="noindentl">For this salad, get a high-quality Greek feta cheese. This dish has just a hint of mint.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅓ lbs (600 g) Greek feta cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 handful fresh mint leaves (approx. 1 oz [30 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2–3 tbsp maple syrup</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Break the cheese into small pieces and spread it out on a plate. Squeeze the lemon juice over the cheese and shred the mint leaves on top. Season with some freshly ground black pepper and top with a drizzle of maple syrup. Serve with grilled meat or poultry.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_7"><a id="page_160"/>85. Cinnamon-glazed Pork Belly</p>

  <p class="noindentl">My inspiration for this recipe comes from the restaurant Heberleins in Förslöv. Sometimes I used to sneak in there before I went to work at Torekov to have a piece of pork and a slice of dark rye bread. It was absolute heaven! In this recipe, I’m preparing the pork in one whole piece, but sometimes I’ll cut it up into cubes and leave out the apricots and thyme. The pork makes a great addition to a barbecue buffet, along with all the other grilled meats.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 ⅓ lbs (600 g) whole smoked pork belly with rind</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) dried apricots</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp maple syrup or honey</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp white wine vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp cinnamon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 bunch of fresh thyme</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist1">1.   Score the pork rind deeply until it is “ribbed” throughout. Stuff the scores with apricots.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   With a sharp knife, score across and grill the pork with the rind down.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Remove the pork from the grill and put it on a double-folded square of aluminum foil. Pour syrup and vinegar over it. Season with cinnamon and spread some thyme on top.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Put the pork back on the grill and let it cook for about 30 minutes until it has gotten really hot, and then turn it over so the marinade soaks in on both sides.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Cut the pork into slices and serve.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_8">86. Bulgogi with Sides</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Bulgogi is a Korean dish that is eaten with the side dishes seen on the next page: kimchi, sesame sprouts, and pickled chili cucumber. This is a recipe that requires some preparation and is the only dish I preach that you marinate.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 lbs (1 kg) whole entrecote</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MARINADE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) Japanese soy sauce</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) sherry, sake, or red wine</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tbsp sesame oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 garlic clove, shredded</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FOR SERVING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">kimchi, sesame sprouts, and pickled chili cucumber (see <a href="../Text/008_Chapter004.html#page_160">page 160</a>)</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Cut the entrecote into slices ¼–½ inch (½–1 cm) thick.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the ingredients for the marinade in a spacious bag. Put the meat in the bag and tie it up. Massage the marinade into the meat. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Remove the meat and lightly dab it with a paper towel. Flash-grill it on both sides over live coals.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve right away with kimchi, sesame sprouts, and pickled chili cucumber.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">AN EASIER WAY TO CUT THE MEAT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">The entrecote will be easier to cut into thin slices if you put it in the freezer and let it cool down for about 30 minutes before cutting it.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_9"><a id="page_161"/>87. Kimchi—Fermented Cabbage</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Kimchi is the Asian answer to milk-fermented vegetables and is a very common, everyday dish. Milk-fermented is the same as fermented.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 head of Napa cabbage</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">BRINE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 quarts (2 liters) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">KIMCHI MIXTURE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp sugar</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Mix the ingredients for the brine and let the Napa cabbage soak in it overnight.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Drain the brine and rinse the cabbage under cold water for about 10 minutes until most of the saltiness has disappeared.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the ingredients for the kimchi mixture. Smear the mixture onto each leaf, and then put the cabbage in a plastic bag and seal it shut. Let the bag rest at room temperature for 24 hours and then place the bag in the fridge for at least five days—the longer it rests, the better it will taste.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Cut the cabbage into slices and serve with the bulgogi and other side dishes.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_10">88. Sesame Sprouts</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Sprouts and beans are cheap, and they make great side dishes to pretty much everything. Try flavoring the sprouts with some finely chopped dill and lemon juice instead of sesame seasoning.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cup (400 ml) mung bean sprouts</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ leek, finely sliced</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tsp sesame oil + 1 tbsp canola oil</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_11">89. Pickled Chili Cucumber</p>

  <p class="noindentl">A twist on traditional pickled cucumber.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cucumbers</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp white vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_12"><a id="page_164"/>90. Grilled Lamb Shoulder, Apple Vinaigrette, and Tomato Salad with Breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Lamb shoulder is not usually found on a grill. It can be bought at a great price, but you’ll have to go to a store with a meat counter. If you find it difficult to de-bone, just ask the staff at the counter to do it for you. The apple vinaigrette is the headliner in this recipe. Let it become one of your favorites.

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 shallots, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp raw dark brown sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon, juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Begin by grilling the meat on all sides until the outside is browned. Put the lamb in a baking dish and rub the meat with garlic, rosemary, salt, black pepper, and half of the olive oil.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Push the live coals to the side of the grill and place the baking dish on top of the grill grate—this is indirect grilling. Close the lid and open the valve. After 10 minutes, begin glazing the lamb with the rest of the oil. Flip the meat over from time to time.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Grill the lamb until it reaches a core temperature of 136ºF (58ºC) (if you are using a digital thermometer) or for 20–30 minutes. Let the meat rest on a platter for about 10 minutes before you cut into it. Save the grilling juices for the tomato salad.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Put onion, oil, sugar, lemon juice, and water for the apple vinaigrette in a pot. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Add applesauce and mustard. The vinaigrette should be runny but with a slight thickness to it. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Split the tomatoes in half. Place them in a bowl and mix with 3–4 tbsp of the lamb juices and the vinaigrette.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Cut the bread into thick slices and grill it until golden brown and crispy. Crumble the bread and mix it into the tomato salad.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Serve the lamb shoulder cut into slices with the tomato salad.</p>
