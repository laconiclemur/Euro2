<h2 class="h2b">FRICASSEE DE GAMBAS, MOULES ET COQUES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Fricassée of Prawns, Mussels and Cockles</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is a mixture of all that’s good about cooking simply in the Provençal way. All you’re really doing is opening the shellfish and giving them a little more punch with the tiger prawn stock. Each flavour stands out individually, but they all merge into a feast for the nose and palate</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
20 raw tiger prawns in their shells<br/>
1 tbsp tomato concentrate<br/>
4 dozen mussels<br/>
4 dozen small clams<br/>
1 onion, peeled and finely sliced<br/>
2 small carrots, peeled and finely sliced<br/>
1 medium leek, washed and sliced<br/>
4 tbsp olive oil<br/>
1 small bunch basil, leaves picked from the stalks, finely chopped</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Remove the heads and shells from the tiger prawns, keeping the prawns to one side. Put the heads and shells in a pot with the tomato concentrate, just cover with water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes, then strain and reduce by half. Reserve.</p>
<p class="normala">De-beard all of the mussels and rinse them and the clams very well. If any are slightly open, tap them lightly and if they don’t close, discard them.</p>
<p class="normala">In a large shallow pan with a tight-fitting lid sweat the onion, carrot and leek in the olive oil for 10 minutes, without colouring, until totally soft. Pour the tiger prawn stock over the vegetables and bring to the boil. Add the prawns, mussels and cockles, and boil until all of the mussels and clams open (discard any that don’t), about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="normala">Toss with the basil and serve.</p>
