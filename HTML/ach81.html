<p class="author1"><span class="txit">linguine all’aragosta arrabbiata</span></p>
<p class="noindent">What makes these lobsters angry comes after they’re cooked: the spicy red pepper flakes, garlic, and herbs. Gianni perfected this scrumptious recipe, which provides the home cook with the opportunity to present a restaurant-worthy dish—served in the main part of the lobsters’ shell—that can be prepared with surprising ease.</p>
<p class="indentb">The lobster may be cooked and the meat removed from the shells one day in advance. Cover and refrigerate the meat and shells overnight, bringing them to room temperature before finishing the dish. After cooking the lobsters and removing the meat, cut each lobster in half lengthwise with a heavy, sharp knife. Place each lobster half, with the cavity facing up, on a serving plate and then fill the cavity with the cooked pasta.</p>
