<p class="summary"><span class="bold">Cocido, olla, puchero, pote,</span> <span class="bi">and</span> <span class="bold">escudella</span> <span class="bi">are all general terms for stews</span> that rural families kept on the simmer in huge pots hanging in the fireplace, or sitting on a tripod over burning coals. Based mainly on legumes, with some vegetables and tiny bits of ham or sausage, they represented for the peasantry in every region of Spain the main meal of the day almost every day. For special occasions, great quantities were made with a variety of meats and cured pork, including pig’s ears, tails, snouts, and trotters. These dishes still appear at festivals where cooks compete for excellence awards.</p>
<p class="summary">Beans were characterized in traditional lore as “the meat of the rural poor.” In the Basque Country, not so very long ago, the term <span class="italic">babazorro,</span> bean eater, was an insult meaning “country bumpkin.” In the hungry years during the civil war, when there was no meat in the cities, people ate beans, chickpeas, and lentils. In the postwar days of rationing in the 1940s, legumes were part of the one-dish meal, the <span class="italic">plato único,</span> that people in the cities ate once a day. They ate that at two-thirty in the afternoon, at news time, when children came home for lunch and everybody listened to the radio together.</p>
<p class="summary">I have never been to a country that has as great a variety of legumes and as much respect for and pride in them as Spain. You can see displays in shops and markets of more than twenty types of beans, lentils, and chickpeas, with cards giving their provenance, down to the name of the village where they were grown. Beans—small or huge; round or flat; white, black, red, pale green, or speckled—are grown in many different parts of Spain. Apart from black-eyed peas and broad beans, they all came from the New World. By the sixteenth century, farmers were selling the dried legumes at markets. Generally referred to as <span class="italic">alubias</span> or <span class="italic">judías,</span> they also have regional names, such as <span class="italic">garrafón, judión, fabes, mongetes,</span> and <span class="italic">caparrones.</span> Every region has its beloved favorites. Some, such as the <span class="italic">judiones de la Granja de San Ildefonso,</span> the <span class="italic">judías del Barco de Ávila,</span> the <span class="italic">alubias de La Bañeza-León,</span> the <span class="italic">fabes</span> of Asturias, and the Galician <span class="italic">faba de Lourenzá,</span> are covered by a Protected Geographic Identification (PGI). The pale green <span class="italic">lentejas</span> (lentils) <span class="italic">de la Armuña,</span> the brown <span class="italic">lentejas Pardinas de Tierra de Campos,</span> and the <span class="italic">garbanzos</span> (chickpeas) <span class="italic">de Fuentesaúco</span> also have the same protected badge of guaranteed quality that links them with the soil and location.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p498.png" class="calibre8"/></p>
<p class="summary">People wonder why the word for beans, <span class="italic">alubia,</span> comes from an Arabic word and why <span class="italic">judías,</span> the other general word for them, literally means “Jewish,” since beans arrived in Spain after Muslims and Jews were officially expelled. One explanation is that cooking with black-eyed peas was early on associated with Arabs, who called them <span class="italic">lubia.</span> The Jews cooked black-eyed peas on their New Year as a symbol of plenty and fertility (in my family we still do). The Jewish Sabbath meal-in-a-pot <span class="italic">adafina</span> (see page 29) contained chickpeas; the Jews who converted and stayed behind in Spain substituted beans from the New World in the regions where chickpeas were not available. The general formula of the Spanish <span class="italic">cocido,</span> the boiled stew that is found in every region in different forms, follows the pattern of the <span class="italic">adafina,</span> including the way the broth was traditionally eaten first, with vermicelli or rice.</p>
<p class="summary">Despite the traditional importance of legumes in the Spanish diet, consumption and production have dropped dramatically since the 1980s, because people have little time to cook and are concerned with putting on weight. Dried beans and lentils represent hearty traditional fare and rarely feature in modern dishes, except as an accompaniment or garnish for baby kid, partridge, and quail or in salads. Some of the varieties had almost disappeared because they were too expensive to grow, but efforts are being made to restore them as a crop. And now legumes are sold ready-cooked and vacuum-packed. Although they are not eaten very often, the substantial dishes affectionately called <span class="italic">platos de cuchara</span>—dishes that you eat with a spoon—are loved everywhere in Spain with special nostalgic intensity. But whereas once cooks put everything—meats, sausages, beans, vegetables—in the stew pot at the same time, now, inspired by modern chefs, they put the ingredients in according to how much cooking they need; or they cook them separately, so as to get rid of some of the fat from the pork products, before reuniting them at the end.</p>
<p class="summary">I happened to see on YouTube a video of the <span class="italic">gran pucherada</span> that took place on October 23, 2007, in San Severino in the Basque Country. The main event of the fiesta was a competition of bean dishes—<span class="italic">alubiadas.</span> Dozens of men (there were no women that I saw) were lined up behind their <span class="italic">pucheros</span>—tall cylindrical metal pots on tripods with a compartment with glowing embers burning underneath. This type of pot, still used in the area of Las Encartaciones, in the Basque Country in the province of Vizcaya, was famously used by railwaymen who worked on the old coal-fired steam trains and utilized burning coals to cook stews during their long journeys. The background song about beans and <span class="italic">txakoli</span>—the wine the revelers were drinking—that played as they cooked made me dance in front of my computer.</p>
<p class="summary">For us outside Spain, <span class="italic">pucheradas, alubiadas,</span> and the like might not bring the same joy to our hearts as they do in Spain, but they can provide a great meal in a pot to enjoy with friends in the winter. If we cannot buy the same legumes, we can always find an equivalent. In Spain, I was told that beans should be a year old at most, and that I should look at their age—the date when they were harvested—because the soaking and cooking times depend on age as well as on type. Beans that are less than a year old do not need soaking. But we do not have the privilege of knowing the harvest date—we only know the sell-by date that is written on the packet, so there is no way of telling how long they will take to cook. You just have to bite into one every so often. I was also told that if the water in your area is hard, it will lengthen the cooking time; that is why some cooks advocate using bottled water. A Spanish trick that is supposed to stop the beans from falling apart is to “scare” (<span class="italic">asustar</span>) them by pouring a little cold water on them from time to time during the cooking, but I am not sure that works, and Spain is the only country I know of where people do that. Some people now use pressure cookers to cook their beans, but as they can so quickly overcook and fall apart, they make purees out of them.</p>
