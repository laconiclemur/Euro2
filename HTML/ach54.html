<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pasta fresca fatta in casa</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Tender homemade pasta is a real treat. My grandmother never used a machine to mix the dough or to roll it out. She kneaded the dough by hand and then rolled small pieces into strips and spread them out to dry on a clean sheet she had placed across a bed. This family recipe has been adapted so it can be made in a food processor.</p>
<p class="indentb">My parents like to make pasta together. My mother mixes it in the food processor and my father rolls it through the pasta machine. They arrived at this efficient method when they were both working and still wanted to make fresh pasta for dinner.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon water (optional; add if dough does not blend)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place 1 cup of the flour and the salt in food processor and pulse to combine. Add the eggs, egg yolk, and olive oil, and mix until the dough comes together to form a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gradually knead the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup flour into the dough by hand. The dough should be smooth, not sticky. Break the dough ball in half to test the center of the dough. If the center is sticky, continue to knead more flour into the dough. Knead for an additional 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Wrap the dough in plastic and set it aside to rest for 20 minutes. (Or wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for several hours. Return to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Line a large table or work surface (or bed) with a clean sheet or towels. Lightly flour the surface.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_115"/><span class="red">4.</span> Break off one third of the dough. (Rewrap unused sections.) Sprinkle it lightly with flour and pass it through a pasta machine, following the manufacturer’s instructions. (Stan’s procedure with a hand-crank machine is to begin with the machine set at the widest opening by one notch, dusting with flour each time so it does not stick to the machine. He continues to narrow the opening one notch at a time until the dough is the desired thickness. For lasagna and cannelloni it is best to stop one short of the narrowest setting on the machine.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Cut the pasta into 12-inch lengths as wide as you wish. For lasagna, the pasta may now be spread out on the table to dry. For long strands of pasta, pass the dough through the cutting portion of the machine and then lay the strands out to dry. (Scraps may be passed through the machine to make shorter strands that may be dried and cooked that day.) Or spread the strands on baking sheets and freeze. Once the strands are stiff, they may be packed in airtight containers and frozen for up to 1 month.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Roll out the remaining two thirds of the dough, one third at a time, following the same procedure.</p>
