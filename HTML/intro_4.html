<h3 class="h3">JOAN TROPIANO TUCCI</h3>
<p class="noindent">Over the years as our children established homes of their own, I found that I was regularly receiving calls from them asking how one or another of their favorite dishes was made. When Stan and I retired, we had the time to compile a list of our combined family favorites using a software program that formatted recipes—even giving you the breakdown of calories for each ingredient. At first we shared these recipes with just our children, but after <span class="txit">Big Night,</span> we received requests for recipes from far and wide.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, when we had the opportunity to create a cookbook, we already had many of the Tucci and Tropiano recipes written up. To personalize the book further, we decided to tell the stories of our two families and how their individual histories came together in the meals we share, whether at special occasions or as simple weekday dinners. I relied on my memories of stories that I had been told and, when in doubt, consulted my siblings as I wove together this family chronology.</p>
<p class="indent">My father, Vincenzo Tropiano, was born in 1896 in Cittanova, Italy. After serving as a battlefield medic during World War I, he emigrated to the United States in 1917 in search of work. He wound up living in Verplanck, New York, near Peekskill, leaving behind his parents, four sisters, two brothers, and fiancée, all of whom he hoped would join him in America once he got settled. But only his sister, Anna, ended up coming to New York. His other three sisters—Carmela, Giovanna (for whom I was named), and Concetta—stayed in Calabria and married local boys, while his brothers found work in France. Throughout his forty years working at the Trap Rock Corporation, Pop, as we called him, was the breadwinner for both the family he was raising and the one he left behind, regularly mailing money, clothing, and other items back to Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">Concetta Trimarchi, my mom, was born in 1908 and came to the United States with <a id="page_xviii"/>her family when she was six years old. Her family opened a boardinghouse in Verplanck, where my mom worked—she worked so hard as a young girl that she only completed school through the sixth grade. But she continued to teach herself at home, writing in Italian and English, reading avidly, and eventually taking care of all the household finances.</p>
<p class="indent">Even after she married, Mom continued to work hard—both at raising her five children and at her job on the assembly line at Standard Brands. Yet somehow, in addition to her eight-hour workday, she still found time to pickle green tomatoes, can pears and peaches, bottle eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes, make beer and root beer, bake her own bread, and, in her spare time, do the laundry, sewing, cooking, and baking.</p>
<p class="indent">My parents met through mutual friends—Verplanck had a large Italian population—and in 1926 decided to marry, but first Pop had to send a letter to his fiancée in Italy to let her know. Needless to say, she wasn’t happy about the news, and when she wrote him back she enclosed a pair of scissors to symbolize the severing of their relationship. I don’t know if it’s an Italian tradition or not, but in my family whenever we give someone a knife or scissors as a gift, we always put a shiny new penny in with it to show that it is given with good intentions.</p>
<p class="indent">Vincenzo and Concetta had a long and happy marriage, celebrating more than sixty wedding anniversaries together and raising five children: Grace, Joseph, Angelina, Giovanna (me), and Vincent. Our first home was a two-family house set on a large piece of property on Verplanck’s Point—my family lived downstairs, my cousin Katherine lived with her family upstairs, and my grandmother lived with us and helped raise us while my parents were at work.</p>
<p class="indent">The house on the Point was basically a mini-farm. Fruit trees were in abundance—cherry, mulberry, peach, plum, pear, fig—and Pop cultivated a wonderful grape arbor. We raised rabbits, pigs, turkeys, a cow, goats, and chickens. Everyone helped in the garden, tilling the soil and planting in the spring, harvesting and canning in the fall. Pop worked a full day at Trap Rock and then, during the long days of the warmer months, he worked another half day in the garden. That was his health club.</p>
<p class="indent">We were surrounded by relatives and neighbors and shared each other’s happiness and grief through good times and bad. As children we felt safe and secure in this environment. <a id="page_xix"/>Around 1958, my parents moved into another two-family house on Broadway, closer to town, where I lived for two years before I married Stan. I thought Pop was very brave to undertake building a house at the age of sixty. The garden was smaller but large enough for the two of them, and there was always extra if any of us needed vegetables. Pop planted several fruit trees, including wonderful fig trees. All the animals were gone, except for a few rabbits, which he enjoyed raising. He built a big outdoor fireplace for grilling and for boiling the large vat of water they used to bottle tomatoes every fall. We have photographs of our son, Stanley, around age three, helping Pop to build this fireplace.</p>
<p class="indent">Pop brought cuttings from the original grape arbor on the Point to the new house, building a new arbor that expanded as our family grew. Tables were arranged beneath the grapes and the makeshift awning that Pop fashioned out of a tarp to protect us from the hot sun or rain when we gathered to celebrate occasions at my parents’ house. Everyone brought food, and in most of the photographs of these gatherings you can see coolers lined up against the side of the house, filled with each family’s contribution to the meal. Those coolers hardly ever went home empty. They were usually refilled with loads of freshly picked fruits and vegetables from my parents’ garden.</p>
<p class="indent">One of our most important family gatherings was held every July for the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Pop was a charter member of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Society, and my brothers, Joe and Vinnie, are still members. The feast began on Thursday night and ended on a Sunday evening with a tremendous fireworks display, attracting people from all over the area.</p>
<p class="indent">On Sunday there was a special mass—my sister Angie, who has a beautiful operatic voice, sang at it—followed by a procession, where members of the society, accompanied by visiting marching bands, carried a statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel through the village. Every year my sisters and I got new dresses for the occasion; we would always march behind Pop, carrying our flags and following the band. For many years, he had the honor of carrying the statue. It was draped with a sash that people would pin money to as the parade passed by. This always brought tears to the eyes of my family members, although I’m not sure why—emotional Italians, I guess!</p>
<p class="indent">What I looked forward to was the celebration after the parade. My parents would <a id="page_xx"/>invite friends, neighbors, and visiting band members to share in the feast and help us celebrate this wonderful saint’s day. Forty people were nothing to feed! We all helped with the cooking and cleaning and were happy to do it.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the feast, we had our traditional family bocce game. The competition was fierce—my sister Grace especially hated to lose. The family game always ended with cries of “Wait until next year” and hugs all around. Then the game was turned over to the children and non–family members.</p>
<p class="indent">When Stan and I were first married, we lived in Peekskill, New York; shortly after Stanley was born, we moved to an apartment in Mount Kisco, which was close to Stan’s new job at Horace Greeley High School. We got to know our landlords, Mary and Angelo Cascioli, very well. Angelo enjoyed fishing in the nearby reservoirs. When he caught perch, Mary would flour and pan-fry the fillets. She always sent some upstairs for Stanley, who, at age two, greatly enjoyed them.</p>
<p class="indent">Occasionally Mary and Angelo would invite us downstairs to join them, their granddaughters, Pam and Maria, their son, Vincent, and daughter-in-law, Mary, for dinner. Mary would place a huge oval board in the center of the table, onto which she would pour cooked polenta. The polenta was then topped with a ragù sauce of stewed meat and meatballs. Each person was given a fork and we ate toward the center, incorporating a little polenta in the sauce for each bite. At the beginning of the meal one of the children would ask for a meatball, but Angelo would tell them they had to eat their way in before they could have one. Young Stanley and I enjoyed this fun and delicious meal, but Stan had a hard time sharing at the communal board and usually opted to eat something else.</p>
<p class="indent">Our daughter Gina was born in 1964, and the following year we bought a house in Katonah, New York, where Christine was born in 1967 and where we still live today. Our lives were busy and full of family activities. As often as possible we got together with my family and Stan’s, so this generation of children got to know one another very well.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1973, Stan had an opportunity to take a year’s sabbatical in Florence, Italy. Little did we know what a lasting influence it would have on us as well as on our three small children. Stan studied sculpture, the children attended school, becoming fluent <a id="page_xxi"/>in Italian, and I went to bookstores to learn about the wonderful northern Italian food. Although my Italian was limited, I knew enough to read recipes. Tortellini, <span class="txit">lasagne verde,</span> rice salad—I wanted to eat like a Florentine and taught myself to cook like one. Today I still enjoy making those recipes.</p>
<p class="indent">My parents came to visit, and we all traveled to Calabria together. My mom had returned to Italy only a few times before, but Pop had gone back as often as he could, traveling by boat on a round-trip journey that took four weeks to complete. It was not easy for him to leave his wife and five children for such a long stretch; I always thought he was very brave.</p>
<p class="indent">Our visit to Calabria to see Pop’s sisters and their families was quite an adventure. We slept on straw mattresses and were awakened by a donkey braying early in the morning, and Stan shaved looking into a broken mirror hanging in the chicken coop. I recall the children being mesmerized by the photographs of relatives in their coffins that lined the bedroom dresser. And of course, we ate really well—grilled rabbit, goat, homemade crepes, bruschetta made with home-pressed olive oil as green as spring trees—and we laughed a lot. I would not have missed it for the world.</p>
<p class="indent">When Pop retired after forty years of working for the Trap Rock Corporation, the company honored him for all his hard work by naming a barge after him, the <span class="txit">Vincenzo Tropiano.</span> For several years we saw it on the Hudson River; now my nephew Joseph sees it in Long Island Sound, near his home in Greenwich. Pop enjoyed his retirement and continued to work hard in his garden. He loved to experiment with grafting different fruit trees—always trying new things, like splicing a branch of a peach tree onto a pear tree in an attempt to come up with some exotic fruit!</p>
<p class="indent">After Pop died in 1987 at the age of ninety-one, Mom continued to garden, along with my brothers, and she continued to cook, but she complained about being lonely. This usually meant that only five people had come to visit instead of eight or ten. Her neighbors teased her, claiming Mom had so much company she needed valet parking!</p>
<p class="indent">Mom had always been very independent. She had tried to teach Pop to drive, but he almost hit the garage and that ended it. She continued to drive until her early eighties although her eyesight was failing, and eventually my brother Vince had to take her keys <a id="page_xxii"/>away. This cramped her style because when she baked something she wanted it to be delivered right away. My brothers and their wives lived nearby, and they helped Mom out during the week. On the weekends she would go to stay with her daughters. I always knew we would be cooking a lot when Mom came to visit.</p>
<p class="indent">Mom was a great storyteller. All the children came around when she was visiting, and my daughter Gina especially enjoyed spending time with her just to listen to her stories about growing up. Mom was proud of all her grandchildren and was anxious to share her words of wisdom with them. She never understood how we ended up with two actors in our family, and she often suggested to Stanley and Christine that they get regular office jobs. They laughed and told her not to worry. But how Mom bragged when Chris was on a soap opera or Stanley was in a movie—especially when they were on TV and all her friends could watch. She had to sit very close to the television, but just hearing their voices made her happy. It was especially thrilling for her to see her grandsons Stanley and Joseph sharing the limelight at a special viewing of the movie <span class="txit">Big Night</span> that was held in the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill. The performance was sold out and the audience was full of family, friends, and neighbors from the community where we had all grown up.</p>
<p class="indent">When Mom died in 1997, at age eighty-eight, she had twenty-three grandchildren and twenty great-grandchildren. She and Pop taught us the significance of family and we all understood that preparing and sharing food together would continue to be a central part of our family life.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1997, Stan and I had the opportunity to return to Italy with his sister Rosalinda and her husband, Lee. We again traveled to Calabria to visit many of the same family members we had seen with Mom and Pop in 1973. Pop’s sisters Carmella and Concetta are still alive, maintaining the family traditions. Fig trees and homemade soppressata, salami, pasta, and wine are still a big part of their lives, and our family still figures in the stories they tell. Carmella, Concetta, and their families were like drapes around us, smothering us with their love.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that Stanley, Gina, and Christine have grown up, it seems that we never have enough time together—but we do still get together for holidays and dinners on most weekends. Our extended family has grown to such an extent that it is difficult to find a home where we all fit. <a id="page_xxiii"/>My sister Grace and her husband, Tony, have a large enclosed, heated patio, reminiscent of the tarp-covered arbor my father built on the Point, where we have held many a great Easter egg hunt. The entertainment at these events was often provided by Stanley on drums, my nephew Joe (who cowrote the <span class="txit">Big Night</span> screenplay with Stanley) on keyboard, and occasionally my daughter Christine, who would sing for us—followed by tears and applause from all the adults as usual. But when they wanted to form a union and get paid, we fired them! I still keep a collection of instruments in the house so that during festive dinners we can take a break between courses, improvising while working up an appetite.</p>
<p class="indent">The Tucci and Tropiano children love to cook, and several of them are very inventive chefs. Food remains central in their lives as they establish their own families and households. The telephone calls requesting recipes continue to this day. For this book we selected recipes from our families, others we picked up during our year in Italy, some grew out of Stanley’s friendship with Gianni Scappin in preparation for <span class="txit">Big Night,</span> and many recipes we have created on our own. Part of the fun of collaborating with Gianni was the conversations we had comparing the variations between dishes both our families made. Sometimes these could be attributed to the different parts of Italy where our families came from—his from the north, and mine and Stan’s from the south—and sometimes it was just personal preference. What we share is a tendency to improvise; if I am missing one ingredient, such as an herb or a type of cheese, I substitute with what I have on hand. I hope you will find the recipes gathered in this book an inspiring beginning as you create your own family traditions.</p>
<h3 class="h3">STAN TUCCI</h3>
<p class="noindent">My family’s history has always fascinated me. Over the years, I have researched the Tuccis’ ancestry, adding information and gradually tracing our lineage back to the 1600s. It’s very satisfying for me to put together the puzzle pieces that add up to our particular story, and I enjoy sharing the information I’ve gathered with my children and grandchildren. In writing this, I didn’t think it was necessary to go back to Greek and Roman <a id="page_xxiv"/>times to trace my family’s love for food, so I will begin the Tucci family history with my grandparents.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1905 my mother’s parents, Domenico and Apollonia Pisani, left their mountaintop village of Serra San Bruno in Calabria, Italy, and traveled to Naples, where they planned to board the ship <span class="txit">Sicilia</span> that would take them to America. They were accompanied by a relative and their five children: my mother, Teresa, and her siblings, Ralph, Dominic, Henry, and Candida. When the family arrived in Naples, they discovered that something was wrong with Henry’s eyes. He returned to Serra San Bruno with the relative who had accompanied them to Naples and remained in Italy with his grandparents for two years until he was finally reunited with his family in America.</p>
<p class="indent">The Pisani family settled in Northfield, Vermont, joining Apollonia’s brother, Emilio Politi, who was already established there. Northfield was one of several Vermont hill towns around Barre where work could be found cutting granite, marble, and slate. Drawn by the promise of work, hundreds of Italians journeyed there every year. The community my grandparents joined was so heavily populated by Italians that the area was nicknamed “Spaghetti Square” because of all the fresh pasta drying on outdoor racks.</p>
<p class="indent">My grandfather Domenico moved to America to find work and because he wanted his sons to avoid Italy’s mandatory military service. He had spent four unhappy years in the Italian cavalry and did not want his boys to suffer as he had. Ironically, time and circumstances conspired and his two oldest sons, Dominic and Ralph, served in the U.S. Army during World War I. Henry was too young for World War I and too old for World War II. However, Edwin, the youngest son, served in World War II, and three of Domenico’s grandsons served in the armed forces during World War II and the Korean conflict.</p>
<p class="indent">My father, Stanislao, was born in 1889 in the small town of Marzi in Consenza, Italy, the second son of Francesco and Rosa Tucci. Pop had three brothers: Rosario, Angelo, and Vincenzo, and a sister, Marina. My grandfather Francesco was a stonecutter all his life. His search for work in the mid-nineteenth century took him to Egypt, India, and the United States. In 1904 Pop, at age fifteen, sailed from Italy to the United States on the <span class="txit">Neckar</span> with a cousin and joined his brother Rosario in Vermont. Upon his arrival, Pop <a id="page_xxv"/>lived for a short time in the crowded community of Little Italy in New York City. He was fond of telling us that the apartment he shared with other Italians was so crowded that there was no more sleeping space, even on the floor, so he slept on the fire escape. Pop soon left the city and headed north to Northfield, Vermont, where he had heard that he could find stonecutting work.</p>
<p class="indent">In advance of his moving to Northfield, Pop arranged to take a room in a boardinghouse run by Emilio and Maria Politi. The Politi boardinghouse was located next door to that of my grandparents, the Pisanis. My mom, Teresa, heard a lot of gossip about the crazy Cosentino who was coming to board next door. When she first saw Pop she thought the comments were true because he walked into the house carrying a rifle!</p>
<p class="indent">Pop apprenticed as a stonecutter. Within a few years he had gained a reputation and respect among his peers as a master of carving and lettering in stone. When I was a young man we would travel together to New York City and Pop would proudly point out the facades of various buildings that displayed his stone carving, including the Corinthian column capitals of the Soldier’s and Sailor’s Monument on Riverside Drive and some of the window tracery on the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually Pop and my mom began a chaperoned courtship. Mom was working in a clothing store in Northfield. Pop would visit her during his lunch break from his stonecutting job at Cross Brothers, which was located one block away. Pop tended to overextend these visits, which made him late getting back to work. He had a friend whose job it was to blow the factory horn, the signal that everyone should be back at work. He told Pop, “I’ll blow the horn five minutes before the actual time and that will be a warning to you. This way you will not be late when the second and final horn blows.” When I visited Northfield about thirty years later, the tradition of blowing two horns was still in practice—although no one seemed to know why.</p>
<p class="indent">My parents were married in February 1914. Pop recalled that it was so cold that day that the top hinge of the front door was frosted over. He used the frozen hinges as a type of thermometer. If the lowest hinge on the door was frozen, the temperature was 10 degrees below freezing; a frozen middle hinge meant 20 degrees below; a frozen top hinge indicated a temperature at least 30 degrees below freezing.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xxvi"/>Shortly after my parents were married, they moved to Peekskill, and in 1915 my brother Frank was born. There were quarries in Peekskill where Pop found work, and a few years later, he and his brother Rosario purchased a retail monument business in nearby Van Cortlandtville, establishing the Tucci Brothers Monument Works.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1936, the two brothers decided to go their separate ways. Rosario named his business “Tucci Memorials” and Pop named his “Stanley Tucci and Son.”</p>
<p class="indent">After a series of moves, the Tucci and Pisani families purchased a duplex home on Washington Street in Peekskill. This is the house I grew up in, along with my brother, Frank, and my two sisters, Dora and Rosalinda. My mom’s parents lived in the other half of the house with my two unmarried uncles, Edwin and Henry, and my unmarried aunt, Emilia.</p>
<p class="indent">Our extended family of uncles, aunts, and cousins lived either within walking or short driving distance from this duplex. Our home served as a center for innumerable large family gatherings. Actually, most of the family stopped by every evening. I was nurtured by this intense family life throughout my elementary and high school years.</p>
<p class="indent">When I graduated from high school, I pursued a degree in art education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and then went on to receive a master’s in art education from Columbia University. In 1953, I volunteered for the draft, requesting an August or September induction so I could more easily apply for a teaching position after completing the two years of compulsory service in the army.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1955, I was living at home and began to teach art at the Drum Hill Junior High School in Peekskill. At the end of the school year, I enrolled in a two-month art study tour that was part of Columbia University’s summer program. We toured the ancient art centers of eight western European countries, including Italy. This was my first trip to my parents’ native land, and no city captivated me more than Florence. I knew that somehow I would return there to live. I continued to teach at the junior high for five more years. In an effort to return to Italy, I decided to apply for a teaching position at the U.S. military base in Naples.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly before accepting the position, I attended a local church picnic. I was alone, and Joan was there with a date who spent most of his time playing cards. Joan and I walked together to watch another picnic group that was dancing to the rhythm of empty beer cans <a id="page_xxvii"/>knocked together. From that August day on, we spent some part of every day together. When we decided to marry, I discovered that the military could not guarantee that Joan would be allowed to join me in Naples. I was not as adventurous as my Italian ancestors who had bravely left Italy and their families behind when they came to America, so I chose to stay in the United States with Joan and we were married six months after we met.</p>
<p class="indent">Eighteen years went by before I had another opportunity to return to Italy. In 1973, while teaching at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York, I received a sabbatical to study figurative sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. Our year in Italy was probably the most important move my family and I ever made. The effects are evident in so much of our lives today—the language, culture, art, music, family, and food, food, food!</p>
<p class="indent">Our trip to Italy strongly influenced Joan’s cooking. When Joan and I got married she did not have any cooking experience to speak of. I don’t know if this is universally true, but in the homes of the Italian American families I knew, the girls never did any cooking prior to marriage. All the cooking was done by the mother, and often the father participated in the preparation of meals. Yet all these young girls, upon marriage, became wonderful cooks. My guess is that food, family, and tradition are such an integral part of the Italian heritage that there is a subconscious obligation and a desire to cook as well as their mothers did. Joan has an endless curiosity about food paired with a willingness to test new ideas, ingredients, and techniques that has resulted in her becoming an excellent, confident home cook.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the most important consequence of our trip to Italy was that our children had an opportunity to understand that our family traditions extended beyond ourselves and are connected to a complex, strong, and ancient culture. Stanley and Gina continue to speak Italian today. Gina majored in Italian at college, and currently teaches English as a second language in New York State’s Valley Central School District. Christine, who was only six the year we lived in Florence, was somewhat less influenced by the trip, but she did have the best Italian pronunciation of the three children. However, all three of the children remember our frequent visits to museums, churches, and galleries in Florence, Venice, and Rome. When we returned to America, I suggested going to visit a <a id="page_xxviii"/>museum and they ran from the room shouting “No!” But their love of art and culture is strong today and surely must be rooted in our time in Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">The influence of our trip is also, I believe, evident in Stanley’s first directorial effort, <span class="txit">Big Night</span>. This story of two immigrant Italians running a restaurant in New Jersey in the 1950s uses food as a metaphor for the conflict between art and commerce. Stanley’s preparation for <span class="txit">Big Night</span> led to our meeting Gianni Scappin, whom Stanley apprenticed with after he and his cousin Joseph finished writing the movie’s screenplay. Our conversations with Gianni always came around to food, and we found that, despite the different parts of Italy that our families came from, we shared a common appreciation for the traditions that shaped the meals we prepared for our families and friends. Joan and Gianni’s collaboration has resulted in a cookbook that brings together wonderful examples of northern and southern Italian family cooking. The recipes Joan has contributed to this book—at least half of which originated with my family—focus on vegetables and pasta. Their preparation always involves the use of olive oil, a reflection of the southern Italian agricultural tradition. Gianni’s recipes include the use of dairy products, which are in abundance in the north of Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">Joan and Gianni brought together very different qualifications to the process of creating this book. Gianni is professionally trained and has had a wide range of experiences, while Joan’s many years as a home cook were defined by her compulsive desire not only to learn but to create new recipes. They both have a wonderful sense of humor that is displayed when they are working together in the kitchen. Joan loves to tease Gianni about his English (which he speaks very well!) and Gianni loves to tease Joan about anything from our electric stove to the size of our frying pans. But when we are together we mostly enjoy discussing food.</p>
<p class="indent">While we are in the midst of cooking a meal, we talk about variations on those recipes, critique other meals we have eaten, talk about meals we are looking forward to, wonder what we should eat the next time we are together. I think it is no exaggeration to say that when two Italians get together, within five minutes they will be discussing food. It is from this environment that Joan began her cooking journey, and this book is infused with that spirit.</p>
