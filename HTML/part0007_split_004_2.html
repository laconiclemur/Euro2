<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003436"><span class="small"><a id="pg24" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>OLIVE OIL</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003437">When you open olive oil, try to use the bottle as soon as possible. It’s like perfume: by the time you have a few centimetres left, the flavour is gone.</p>
<p class="c_head" id="sab0003438">Arbequina olive oil</p>
<p class="bhead_rt1" id="sab0003439">Arbequina is a type of very tiny olive from the Catalonia area and Majorca. This is the main olive oil that I use. It is very elegant and clean – some olive oils can be too peppery or bitter, and change the flavour of whatever you add them to. Arbequina complements other ingredients, enhancing their flavour rather than obscuring it. If you can’t find it, use a good extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p class="c_head" id="sab0003440">Pomace olive oil</p>
<p class="bhead_rt1" id="sab0003441">This is a type of oil made from the second pressing of the olive. It allows you to cook at a slightly higher heat without burning or killing the properties of the olive oil. It’s widely available, but if you can’t find it you can use any light olive oil.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003442"><span class="small">VINEGAR</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003443">When I was a child, I used to take the bottle of vinegar and hide from my mum when she was cooking. I’d pour it out into its lid and drink it, I loved it so much. I used to have white lips! My mum never let me dress the salad because I would add too much vinegar. I still love it now, but I don’t drink it straight, and though I’m generous with it when I make dressings, I don’t add quite as much as I used to.</p>
<p class="c_head" id="sab0003444">Moscatel vinegar</p>
<p class="bhead_rt1" id="sab0003445">My favourite vinegar, Moscatel’s sweetness is balanced by its acidity. I almost always use it for dressing salads or raw ingredients.</p>
<p class="c_head" id="sab0003446">Jerez vinegar</p>
<p class="bhead_rt1" id="sab0003447">Stronger and with more of an oaky taste than Moscatel, sherry vinegar is great for cutting through other flavours – I tend to use it when dressing roasted, smoky vegetables.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003448"><span class="small">ARAGÓN OLIVES</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003449">I’m not very keen on black olives but I do like Aragón olives, which have a soft and almost creamy texture. I always buy them unpitted.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003450"><span class="small"><a id="pg25" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a><em class="calibre9">CHORICEROS</em></span> <span class="small">(DRIED PEPPERS)</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003451">Every kitchen in Spain has a string of dried <em class="calibre9">choriceros</em> hanging up. We use them a lot to make sauces like <em class="calibre9">romesco</em>, or when marinating or braising. I can’t imagine cooking without them – the flavour they give is nutty and rustic and lifts everything else. They keep for a few months. <em class="calibre9">Ñora</em> peppers are similar to <em class="calibre9">choriceros</em> but smaller and rounder in shape. Their flavour is less smoky, but you can of course use them in place of <em class="calibre9">choriceros</em> if you have some.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003452"><span class="small"><em class="calibre9">GUINDILLAS</em> (DRIED PEPPERS)</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003453"><em class="calibre9">Guindillas</em> are a type of pepper grown in the Basque country. Long and slim, they add a subtle extra layer of spiciness but are mild enough not to overpower other flavours. Whenever I use dried <em class="calibre9">choriceros</em>, I add a <em class="calibre9">guindilla</em> too. You can also buy them jarred and pickled: preserved in this way, they make a perfect <em class="calibre9">pintxo</em> to have with a drink (see <em class="calibre9">banderilla</em>s, <a href="part0015.html#pg36" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>).</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003454"><span class="small">SMOKED PAPRIKA (<em class="calibre9">PIMENTÓN</em>)</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003455">It’s most common to use smoked sweet paprika, although for a few recipes, like the octopus <a href="part0112.html#pg156" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>, for example, I use smoked hot paprika.</p>
<h3 class="b_heads" id="sab0003456"><span class="small">SALT</span> <span class="font">&amp;</span> <span class="small">PEPPER: A NOTE ON SEASONING</span></h3>
<p class="bhead_rt" id="sab0003457">It’s a simple thing but, whatever you’re cooking, seasoning each ingredient slightly as you add it to the pan (rather than seasoning everything at the very end) means it’s easier to gauge how much salt you’re adding and to ensure that the dish is neither under- nor over-seasoned. It’s really difficult to get it right when seasoning large quantities – the key is just to add a little bit as you go.</p>
