<h1 class="chapter1">CIOCCOLATO CALDO</h1>
<h1 class="chapter">hot chocolate</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This decadent, intense hot chocolate has been served in Florence’s best cafes for centuries. The bittersweet flavour comes from using really good-quality chocolate. Vestri in Borgo degli Albizi is a small shop stuffed with chocolate treats including huge slabs of pistachio or gianduja chocolates as well as an urn constantly warming dense hot chocolate that is slowly trickled into a small cup. This is our version, which is rich so we serve it in warm espresso cups (see <a href="9781784881757_Split43.html#page_70">picture</a>). It can be topped with a dollop of whipped cream.</b></p>
