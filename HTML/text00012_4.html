loor to ceiling cans and jars; the grocer seems to spend half his life teetering up a stepladder plucking items from the top shelf. The <em>tienda de comestibles</em>
 or <em>ultramarinos</em>
 holds the contents of an average shop in a space no bigger than a wardrobe. The variety of stock is often astounding, especially in smaller markets where, as well as the customary canned foods and preserves, you may also find dried fruit and nuts, olives, pickles and spices.</p>
<p class="indent">Canned foods, <em>conservas</em>
, so often regarded as second-class substitutes for the ‘real thing’, enjoy a high reputation in Spain. Shellfish is a prime example. Mussels, Venus clams, razor clams and cockles are stacked high on the shelves in their slim colourful cans. Even coastal dwellers tuck into them with gusto along with a glass of wine or sherry; they are considered to have an entirely different taste and texture from their fresh counterparts. When it comes to fish, the cured anchovies from both Catalonia and Cantabria have their passionate followers. Meanwhile, the cans of white albacore tuna, <em>bonito del Norte</em>
, can make the fishmonger seem cheap. Preserved vegetables such as white asparagus, artichokes, beans and tomatoes are great store-cupboard standbys while <em>piquillo</em>
 peppers are an absolute must; ideal for stuffing with whatever comes to hand as a fabulous starter.</p>
<p class="indent">Oil and vinegar are key ingredients to snap up, especially if the stall has a selection of the local brew. Many Spanish olive oils lack the chichi packaging of their Italian or French neighbours, but customers know their stuff and have no problem buying top quality oils in huge cans or unlikely looking plastic jerry cans. Large quantities of second pressing, <em>Aceite de Oliva</em>
, are purchased for cooking and frying, while the more expensive <em>Aceite de Oliva Virgen Extra</em>
 is usually reserved for using raw. Excellent wine and sherry vinegar is available too for everyday salad dressings and pickles.</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Salazones y encurtidos</em>
, pickles and cures, often occupy their own stall, particularly in Andalucia, the world’s largest olive grove. Vast pots of table olives, predominantly green, sit side by side. They each look remarkably similar to the unenlightened but locals all have a favourite. Some are stuffed with almonds, garlic, peppers or anchovies while others are quite simply pickled in brine. Capers, gherkins, onions and sweet pickled peppers, <em>guindillas</em>
, all make excellent nibbles, or accompaniments to cured meats.</p>
<p class="indent">Spices are often sold loose by weight – cumin and cinnamon, part of the Moorish legacy, are particularly popular. Strings of dried peppers, the sweet round <em>ñoras</em>
 and larger <em>choriceros</em>
, festoon the walls of the stall, ready for sauces and stews. In Murcia’s municipal market an entire stand is devoted to selling the quaint little cans of local paprika, and the costly saffron, so key to the regional rice dishes, is painstakingly weighed out on miniature scales.</p>
<p class="indent">Autumn brings in a new stock of nuts. Almonds and hazelnuts from the terraces of Mediterranean Spain are toasted and eaten just as they are, or are used for sweets and sauces. In the north, freshly gathered chestnuts and walnuts are sold straight from the sack. Dried fruit such as the favourite apricots, commonly known as <em>orejones</em>
, or ‘big ears’, figs and prunes make great accompaniments for seasonal game while Elche dates and Málaga raisins are ideal for simple desserts.</p>

almendras saladas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_4">salted almonds</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The terraced hillsides of Mediterranean Spain take on a magical air in early spring, veiled in a lace of almond blossom. The nuts are collected in late summer and will keep for months in their shells. They are a key ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes, but one of the best ways to eat an almond is surely this one; simply roasted and salted, accompanied by a glass of chilled dry sherry.</p>
<p class="indent">Almonds have recently been hailed as one of the great antioxidants, packed with vast quantities of Vitamin E, so there’s a good reason to eat double the quantity and feel no guilt at all.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes a small bowlful</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 g/9 oz whole, blanched almonds</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the almonds on an oven tray and roast for 10–15 minutes, or until golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, pound the salt to a fine powder in a mortar with a pestle. Toss the roasted almonds in the salt and olive oil and return to the oven for a minute or two. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. The almonds will crisp up once cool.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may like to add a pinch of hot or sweet smoked paprika with the salt.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing nuts</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Nuts can turn rancid in a matter of weeks once they are shelled, so purchase them in small quantities from a supplier with a good turnover. Buying whole nuts is the best idea since exposure to air is the great enemy. Then you can chop, flake or process them yourself as and when you need them.</p>
<p class="indent2">Blanched nuts keep much better than roasted, so roasting your own nuts is worthwhile.</p>
<p class="indent2">If you have large quantities of nuts keep them in an airtight container in a cool dark place, or better still in the freezer.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing olives</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Olives that are picked before they are truly ripe are green, firm and quite sharp in flavour. Black olives are the fully ripened fruit and will usually have a mellower, oily character. In general, when it comes to Spanish table olives the tastiest varieties are green. The <em>Manzanilla</em>
 olive is perhaps the best known. It is excellent bought ready-stuffed with anchovies or peppers. Huge <em>Gordal</em>
 or <em>Sevillana</em>
 olives are wonderful with almonds while the tiny green to purple <em>Arbequina</em>
 olives have a mild smoky flavour and are usually eaten alone. However, there are reputedly over 200 varieties of olive grown in Spain, so do experiment – buy them loose from the market stall and do ask to taste first.</p>
<p class="indent2">Once purchased the best way to keep olives for any length of time is to cover them with olive oil. Feel free to spice them up by adding chillies, dried spices, bay leaves and citrus zest to the oil.</p>

<span class="gray">Canary Island mojos</span>
</h1>
<p class="nonindent">There are countless varieties of <em>mojo</em>
, or sauce, in the Canary Islands; the most well-known are the spicy red <em>mojo picón</em>
 and the fresh green <em>mojo verde</em>
. Visitors usually come across these served with the traditional wrinkly potatoes (see page 153), but they often accompany simple fish or meat dishes too. <em>Illustrated on page 103</em>

<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 ml/2 fl oz red wine vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Grind the chilli, paprika, cumin and salt together in a mortar with a pestle. Add the garlic and crush the mixture to a paste before adding the olive oil and vinegar. You may need to do this in a separate bowl if your mortar is not the large Spanish variety.</p>
<p class="extract">Give everything a good stir, adjusting the oil, vinegar and salt to taste. If you are serving this sauce with the wrinkly potatoes you will definitely not need to add any more salt.</p>

<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Breadcrumbs soaked in a little vinegar may be added to thicken the sauce.</p>

<p class="extract">Grind the salt and cumin to a powder in a mortar with pestle. Add the garlic and pound to a paste, before adding the coriander and chillies. Once you have a fairly smooth sauce stir in the olive oil and vinegar, tasting and balancing the sauce as you go.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may like to mash a ripe avocado into the sauce or substitute the coriander with parsley. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to a mojo.</p>

<h1 class="section0" id="heading_id_12">xató</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13"><a id="page105"></a>
romesco salad dressing</h1>
<p class="nonindent">There is certain risk involved with including this controversial recipe. Half a dozen towns between Barcelona and Tarragona defiantly claim it as their own, each with a slightly different rendition. I am bracing myself for letters of disapproval from the <em>Mestres Xatonaires</em>
, Master <em>Xató</em>
 Makers, of Vilanova or the <em>Ambaixador de la Ruta del Xató</em>
, the <em>Xató</em>
 Route Ambassador, contesting the presence of the hazelnut or the exclusion of the chilli, and as for using a blender… Well, here you have it, my favourite take on the <em>xató</em>
 sauce.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4–6</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ head of garlic</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tomatoes</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz blanched almonds</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>50 g/2 oz hazelnuts, blanched</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 <strong>
<em>ñoras</em>
</strong>
 peppers (see page 15) or</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tsp sweet non-smoked paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 slice of white bread, toasted</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 tbsp red wine vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>large pinch of salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 ml/5 fl oz extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the garlic cloves (skin on) and tomatoes on a baking tray and roast for about 20 minutes until just beginning to soften. Set aside to cool. The almonds and hazelnuts can toast at the same time, on a separate tray. They will take anything between 10–15 minutes to turn golden. Do take care, burnt nuts taste bitter and these should be lightly toasted. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, place the <em>ñoras</em>
 peppers, if using, in a small pan of boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Toast the bread and soak it in the vinegar.</p>
<p class="extract">Now it is finally time to make the sauce – use a large mortar and pestle or a blender (see below). Squeeze the garlic from the skins and pound to a smooth paste with a large pinch of salt. Add the nuts and continue to work with the pestle until they are finely ground.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut open the peppers and scrape out the thin layer of flesh from under the skin, add to the nuts with 2 tbsp of the cooking water. If you are using paprika instead, then now is the time to add it with a little water. Continue to pound until the sauce becomes smooth and velvety.</p>
<p class="extract">Slowly add half the olive oil, as if you were making a mayonnaise, stirring all the time, then break the soaked bread into small pieces and pound into the sauce. Finally, add the remaining olive oil, continuing to stir as you go. You should have a thick, creamy sauce.</p>
<p class="extract">And, if this all seems too much like hard work, you could throw caution to the wind. Toss everything, but the olive oil into the blender and whiz until smooth, then with the motor running, gradually add the oil until you have your deliciously velvety sauce.</p>
<p class="extract">Check the seasoning, the sauce should taste sharp – you may need more vinegar. Serve as a salad dressing</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Traditional <strong>
<em>xatonada</em>
</strong>
 salad</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Huge crowds gather in local town squares around Tarragona at Carnival time to eat a traditional salad with the delicious <em>xató</em>
 dressing.</p>
<p class="indent2">Here is a quick throw-together salad recipe to serve four: One head of curly endive, a large 200 g can of tuna, 12 salted anchovies, a large handful of <em>Arbequina</em>
 olives, or other tasty black olives such as the French <em>Niçoise</em>
 and 2 boiled eggs, all topped with the <em>xató</em>
 sauce. The real thing has strips of salt cod too. Do add some if you’d like (see page 44) and halve the number of anchovies.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">This dressing makes a fabulous accompaniment to prawns, simply grilled fish, asparagus and the local speciality of <em>calçots</em>
 (see page 140).</p>

piquillos rellenos de queso de cabra</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_15">goat’s cheese stuffed piquillo peppers</h1>
<p class="nonindent">A jar of <em>piquillo</em>
 peppers makes a fabulous store-cupboard standby. <em>Piquillo</em>
 peppers can be served in a myriad of ways; they are often stuffed with seafood, minced meat or offal. Here I have chosen a less traditional recipe for its stunning simplicity and also the fact that it is vegetarian. It is always useful to have a few meat-free dishes up your sleeve in the predominately carnivorous Spanish kitchen.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>225 g/8 oz jar of <strong>
<em>piquillo</em>
</strong>
 peppers, about 16 peppers</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 onion, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp double cream</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>250 g/9 oz goat’s cheese, such as Montenebro</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp capers, well rinsed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp toasted pine kernels</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp finely chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil or thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="extract">Select a dozen of the peppers, checking that they are not ripped, and set aside for stuffing.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and fry until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and the remaining peppers and stir over a medium heat until you can smell the garlic, then pour in the cream.</p>
<p class="extract">Transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Chop the goat’s cheese finely and mix together with the capers, pine kernels, black pepper and herbs. Taste and add more black pepper and herbs, if necessary. Stuff the reserved peppers carefully with the cheese mixture.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the sauce in a large terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 or ovenproof serving dish. Or you could use smaller individual serving dishes and arrange the stuffed peppers attractively on top.</p>
<p class="extract">Bake the peppers for 5–10 minutes, or until just heated through. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You could serve the peppers at room temperature without cooking them at all but I prefer the more pungent flavour of warm goat’s cheese.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Ready-roasted peppers</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Cans and jars of roasted peppers are a boon: they are instant, taste wonderful and make an excellent accompaniment to simply grilled meat and fish or a great addition to a salad.</p>
<p class="indent2">
<em>Piquillo</em>
 peppers have a glorious flavour that really seems to come to life once they are heated briefly in the oven, or in a frying pan with a splash of olive oil and garlic.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_17">pork fillet with prunes and pine kernels</h1>
<p class="nonindent">My great friend Cheche insists that she loathes cooking and yet always manages to prepare the most delicious fuss-free food. This dish was as good cold the following day as on its première at the dinner party – a fabulously sweet sauce with delicate slices of melt in the mouth, pink pork fillet. Of course, Cheche couldn’t remember exactly how she made it, but this is my closest approximation yet.</p>
<p class="indent">Feel free to substitute apricots for the prunes and almonds for the pine kernels, if you wish. The sauce would heaven with chicken breast too.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4–6</p>

<strong>a small handful of dried mushrooms, such as ceps</strong>

<p class="extract">Soak the dried mushrooms in the water for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the pork fillets and fry until browned, then remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Reduce the heat and, using the same pan, add the onions and fry very gently until golden and wonderfully sweet, at least 30 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until you can smell its delicious aroma.</p>
<p class="extract">Drain the wild mushrooms, keeping the soaking water, and add them to the onions together with the prunes and peppercorns. Stir to cover in the oily onion juices, then add the wine and reserved mushroom water. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Taste and season with salt and sugar.</p>
<p class="extract">Next place the pork back in the pan and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes until the pork is just cooked through. The secret is to leave it a little pink and juicy (see page 60).</p>
<p class="extract">Add the extra virgin olive oil and the pine kernels and serve with silky-smooth mashed potato or white rice.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Toasting nuts and seeds</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Nuts and seeds are given a new lease of life once toasted. Seeds such as cumin, coriander, sesame or sunflower take a matter of seconds to roast in a dry frying pan over a medium heat, so do have a bowl ready to tip them into. Spices will begin to give off their characteristic aromas while sesame, pumpkin and sunflower seeds will jump and pop once ready.</p>
<p class="indent2">Large nuts such as whole almonds or hazelnuts are best roasted in the oven (see page 102) while pine kernels and chopped nuts can be browned in the pan. Just remember to shake the pan and keep a watchful eye over them because they can easily burn. Remove from the hot pan as soon as they are ready.</p>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 g/5 oz sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 ml/7 fl oz water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 stick cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>pared zest of 1 orange or lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3.</p>
<p class="extract">Line the base of a 24 cm/9 inch cake tin with baking paper and oil or grease the sides of the tin with a little olive oil or butter.</p>
<p class="extract">In a clean, grease-free bowl, beat the egg whites until firm, as if you were making meringues (see page 122), then slowly add half of the sugar whisking all the time.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, in another large bowl, whisk the remaining sugar with the egg yolks until pale and fluffy. Fold the meringue mixture into the yolks then fold in the almonds, sifted flour, cinnamon and zest. The idea is to preserve as much of the valuable air as possible.</p>
<p class="extract">Spoon the mixture carefully into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until firm to the touch and beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tin.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, make the syrup. Place the sugar, water, cinnamon stick and citrus zest together in a saucepan and heat slowly until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat and boil the mixture for about 5–10 minutes, or until thick and syrupy but by no means caramelized. Take the pan off the heat, remove the cinnamon stick and citrus zest and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="extract">Turn out the cake and cool on a wire rack placed over a plate. Puncture the top of the cake with a skewer and slowly pour over the syrup. Serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Grind your own nuts</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">The flavour of your cake, or any other dish for that matter, will be so much fresher if you purchase whole, blanched almonds and grind them yourself. Just place the nuts in a food processor, brace yourself for a hideous racket and pulse until you have a fine powder.</p>
