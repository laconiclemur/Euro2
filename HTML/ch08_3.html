<h2 class="h2" id="ch08"><a id="page_228"/>MEAT<br/><span class="blue"><small>PORK, LAMB, AND BEEF</small></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Spain is Europe’s most macho country: Where else would you see old blue-haired señoras nibbling on ham canapés while gleefully watching a <em>torero</em> being bested by a bull? And eating meat—prodigious amounts <a id="page_229"/>of it—has always been seen as an expression of the culture’s vigor. <em>Madrileños</em> make weekend excursions to old Castilian towns like Segovia and Sepúlveda to savor stupendous roast suckling lamb and pig. Andalusian bullfighting aficionados indulge in rich, long-braised oxtail stews at old <em>taurino</em> taverns during bullfighting season. Basque and Galician grill houses ply beef lovers with two-pound rare rib steaks, while many restaurants in La Rioja serve little more than sublime baby lamb chops grilled over vine cuttings. And the entire country is mad for <em>cocido,</em> a delicious orgy of boiled meats, sausages, and tender chickpeas preceded by a strong, clear broth.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_230"/>Above all, Spain is a nation of pork eaters, a preference with deep historical roots. From the eighth century to the fifteenth, much of the Iberian Peninsula was dominated by Muslims. When the last Moorish kingdom fell, all Muslims and Jews who refused to convert were expelled by orders of the Catholic monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand. Suspicious of false converts and infidels, Catholic authorities saw eating pork—a meat forbidden by Jewish and Muslim laws—as an affirmation of Christian faith. No doubt you’ve heard of the Inquisition? Fearing persecution, converts hung sausages or hams on their doors or carried pork bones with them on their travels. “Spanish cooking reeks of garlic and Catholicism,” notes a Spanish writer.</p>
<p class="indent">Spain’s penchant for pork has economic underpinnings as well. The <em>matanza</em>—the fall slaughter of the family hog—was central to rural life. For days, entire villages labored around the clock, transforming every inch of the pig into hams, sausages, salt-cured ribs, blood puddings, and lard. To this day, the hog is valued in Spain as much for fresh meat as for smoky charcuterie: the luxurious cured <em>ibérico</em> ham, chorizos powered with paprika, dark, rich blood sausages, and the aristocratic cured loin. You know you’re in Spain when you enter a bar and see a huge ham dangling from a rafter.</p>
<p class="indent">Trailing right behind pork, Spanish lamb tends to be gorgeous: young, pale pink, lush meat tasting sweetly of the grasses on which the sheep grazed. At temples of modern cuisine I’ve tasted lamb in a gauzy veil of espresso; lamb vacuum-cooked at a low temperature and presented in a sherry broth laced with candied lemon; lamb served with an intriguing sheep’s milk foam. In this chapter, traditional dishes—lamb braised with dried and fresh peppers or baked with five heads of garlic—mingle with contemporary preparations, such as baby lamb chops with a sweet marmalade of piquillo peppers or Ferran Adrià’s rack of lamb roasted in a crust of pistachios.</p>
<p class="indent">Travelers to Spain often ask where the beef is. One answer—visit a Basque or Galician steak house. But while presently northern Spain produces some excellent beef, Spain is not known for its cattle pastures. It’s a culture more interested in raising bulls for <em>corridas</em> than for red meat. Not to say that you won’t find delicious beef recipes here, including smoky Asturian beef stew with beans and succulent steak with Cabrales butter. And meatballs! Balls of minced meat bound with eggs can be found in the recipe books of Al-Andalus and are appreciated today just as much as they were in the thirteenth century. Some things never change.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">CATALAN BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH DRIED FRUIT</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PORC GUISAT AMB FRUITA SECA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Moist, slow cooking brings out the best in a humble cut like pork shoulder, making it fit for the most festive occasions. The sauce, enhanced with dried fruit and a whiff of cinnamon, is classically Catalan. Try to get best-quality organic dried cherries and apricots, ones that have some tartness. If you’re using ordinary dried fruit, you might want to reduce the amount slightly, so the dish doesn’t come out overly sweet. Alternatively, you can add a splash of red wine vinegar to the sauce at the end. The dish is best made ahead; cool the pork in the sauce and slowly reheat it. Spinach with Raisins and Pine Nuts (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_388">page 388</a>) makes an ideal accompaniment. For a savory counterpoint, I also like Smoky Mashed Potatoes from Extremadura (<a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_323">page 323</a>) alongside.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 boneless pork shoulder roast, such as Boston butt (about 4 pounds; see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note1">Note</a>), trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fat carrot, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup peeled pearl onions, thawed if frozen</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup kirsch or brandy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups full-bodied dry red wine with a lively acidity</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup beef or chicken stock, or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup pitted dried sour cherries</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dried apricots, preferably Californian, halved or quartered if large</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small piece of cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fresh rosemary sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Using kitchen string, tie the pork shoulder crosswise, spacing the ties 1 inch apart. Rub the pork generously with salt and pepper and the garlic.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 5- to 6-quart flameproof casserole or Dutch oven over high heat until almost smoking. Add the pork and cook until richly browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Add the remaining oil while the pork browns, if the casserole looks too dry. Transfer the pork to a bowl. Add the chopped onion, carrot, and pearl onions to the casserole and brown well, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the kirsch and cook over high heat until it is reduced to about 1 tablespoon, about 1 minute. Add the wine, beef stock, cherries, apricots, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and rosemary sprigs <a id="page_233"/>and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the casserole to dislodge the brown bits. Season the sauce with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Return the pork to the casserole. Cover the casserole tightly and transfer it to the oven. Bake the pork, turning it once or twice, until it is very tender and an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165°F, about 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Transfer the pork to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil to keep warm. Remove and discard the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and rosemary sprigs. Transfer the casserole to the stove top and cook the sauce over high heat until it is slightly syrupy, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Remove the string from the pork and discard it. Cut the pork into slices and arrange on a serving platter. Pour the sauce over the pork and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">PORK TENDERLOIN WITH LIGHTLY SEARED STRAWBERRIES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOLOMILLO DE CERDO CON FRESAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_232"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p_232fig01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Pork Tenderloin with Lightly Seared Strawberries</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Playing off the tart-sweet-aromatic flavors of sherry vinegar and seared strawberries, this modern Spanish dish is outstanding—as sophisticated and striking as it is easy to make. The amount of sugar you use will depend on how sweet you’d like the sauce and the tartness of your sherry vinegar. The strawberries likewise need some acidity; choose berries that are fragrant and seasonal but just a touch underripe. They should be tangy-sweet and seared very briefly. The pork is best when slightly pink and moist; a meat thermometer is indispensable here.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 pork tenderloins (each about 1 pound)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 2 tablespoons crumbled dried rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing the griddle</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 to 12 large aromatic but firm strawberries, hulled and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup chicken stock or broth or water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 4 teaspoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh chives, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rub the pork generously with salt, pepper, and rosemary. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet <a id="page_234"/>over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until richly browned on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the pork, turning several times, until it is tender and an instant-read meat thermometer registers 155°F, about 15 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, while you prepare the strawberries and the sauce. The internal temperature will rise as the meat stands. Set the skillet aside; you’ll use it to make the sauce.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub an unridged rimmed griddle pan or a large, heavy skillet with an oiled paper towel and heat until almost smoking. Add the strawberries and sear for about 45 seconds, turning once. They should be cooked until slightly softened but should not release too much juice.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the chicken stock to the skillet in which the pork cooked and place it over medium-high heat, scraping the bottom of the skillet to dislodge the brown bits. Cook until the stock is almost syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and 2 teaspoons of the sugar and continue cooking until the sauce is almost thick enough to coat a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes longer. After about 1½ minutes, taste the sauce and add more sugar to taste if it seems too tart.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Cut the pork into thick slices and arrange them decoratively on dinner plates. Spoon some seared strawberries beside the meat and drizzle the sauce on and around the meat and the strawberries. Sprinkle flaky salt over the pork and garnish it with chives. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 OR 5</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro">SALT-BAKED PORK IN ADOBO</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>LOMO EN ADOBO A LA SAL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The zesty <em>adobo</em> marinade in this recipe is a blend of smoky <em>pimentón,</em> garlic, oregano, and parsley that’s straight from the Spanish heartland. While <em>adobo</em> pork is usually sliced and fried in oil or lard, baking the pork in a salt crust produces a fabulously moist, tender, and original dish, minus the fat. Because the salt acts as a kind of pressure cooker, start checking the temperature of the meat after it has baked for about thirty-five minutes. The Tangy Cilantro Mojo goes perfectly with the pork, which is delicious hot, warm, or cold.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 large garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon hot paprika or cayenne</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons best-quality white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pork loin (2½ to 3 pounds)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups coarse kosher salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large egg whites, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Tangy Cilantro Mojo (<a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_235a">recipe follows</a>), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the garlic, parsley, oregano, sweet and hot paprikas, peppercorns, vinegar, and olive oil in a mini food processor and process until a coarse paste <a id="page_235"/>forms. Place the pork in a glass bowl and rub the spice paste all over it. Cover the pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 to 6 hours. Let it come to room temperature before baking.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the salt and egg whites in a large bowl and stir until evenly moistened. The paste should just hold together. If it doesn’t, sprinkle in a little water.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the pork on it. Coat the pork completely with the salt paste. Bake the pork until cooked through, about 35 minutes. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer through the salt crust into the center of the loin; it should register 155°F. If it’s not quite there yet, bake the pork 7 to 10 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, tap the salt crust to crack it and lift it off in large pieces. Using a paper towel, gently wipe off any excess salt from the meat. Cut the pork into slices and serve with the Tangy Cilantro Mojo. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>
<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_235a"/><small>TANGY CILANTRO MOJO</small></h3>
<p class="noindent">Spicy and tangy, this sauce is inspired by the ubiquitous mortar-pounded <em>mojos</em> of the Canary Islands. It makes a terrific accompaniment to roasts or cold meats. If you want the sauce hot, leave the seeds in the serrano pepper.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ cups fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 green serrano pepper, seeded (optional) and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup best-quality white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt">Place the cilantro, garlic, serrano pepper, oregano, black pepper, vinegar, and olive oil in a blender. Add ¼ cup water and pulse to a medium-fine puree. Season with salt to taste.

<h3 class="h3">GYPSY PORK STEW</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ESTOFADO DE CERDO A LA GITANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Light but full-flavored, this stew of pork and spring vegetables touched with mint is a perfect treat for a cold April day. The recipe is adapted from a delightful book called <em>La Cocina Gitana de Matilde Amaya</em>—<em>Matilde Amaya’s Gypsy Cooking.</em> The author, Matilde, is the wife of the flamenco guitarist Juan Carmona (aka Habichuelo or Bean) and mother of Juan and Antonio, members of the <a id="page_236"/>popular band Ketama. In the <em>cocina pobre</em> tradition, this is more of a vegetable ragout flavored with meat than a meaty stew. You can serve it with rice, but the best accompaniment is a slice of dense country bread, grilled, rubbed with garlic, and brushed with olive oil.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1¾ pounds pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 1-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¾ cups shelled fresh fava beans (about 2 pounds unshelled), or 1¾ cups frozen baby lima beans (from a 10-ounce package), thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large artichokes pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_370">page 370</a>) and quartered, or 1 package (9 ounces) frozen artichoke hearts, thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (3 to 4 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 canned peeled tomatoes, chopped, with ¼ cup of their juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 3 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup slivered fresh mint leaves</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the pork generously with salt and pepper and let stand for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add the fava beans and cook until just tender, 2 to 4 minutes. (If you are using lima beans, there is no need to precook them. Add them in Step 5.) Drain the fava beans in a colander and place it under cold running water until the beans are cool enough to handle. Gently peel the skins off the beans and set the beans aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a 5-quart ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Working in two batches, brown the pork lightly all over, about 5 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a bowl. Add the artichoke hearts to the pot and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the artichokes to another bowl and set aside. Add the ham to the pot and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the tomatoes with their juice and the chicken stock, wine, and sugar and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pot to dislodge any brown bits. Stir in the saffron. Return the browned pork to the pot.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Bake the pork, covered, for 1 hour. Add the potatoes and bake until they are almost tender, about 25 minutes. Stir in the artichokes and bake, covered, for 10 minutes, then add the fava beans and continue baking until the pork and the vegetables are very tender, 10 minutes more. The stew should be a little soupy, but if you like a little thicker sauce, uncover the pot, increase the oven temperature to 400°F, and let the stew bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Remove the stew from the oven and let it rest, covered, for about 15 minutes. Sprinkle the mint on top before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_237"/>HAM I AM</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><em>Jamón ibérico</em> is the pig’s proudest moment—a cured ham so luxurious and unique the Spanish venerate it as if it were a religious cult or a pleasure-inducing drug. Who can blame them? Not even Italy’s best prosciutto or Spain’s own formidable serrano ham can come close to <em>ibérico,</em> with its ultrasilky texture, its deep purple-red hue, its dusky-sweet-salty-fatty-funky mystique. It’s to porcine products what Château Pétrus or Vega-Sicilia Unico is to the grape universe. It’s a delicacy that ranks up there with Iranian caviar and Périgord truffles.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">What sets <em>ibérico</em> ham apart is the hog, the black-bristled, boarlike <em>ibérico</em> pig that is descended from an ancient Iberian race. Eager to meet these elusive porkers, I roamed the bucolic countryside of western Andalusia and Extremadura for years. One day I saw them. It was dusk, and my friend and I were driving on a deserted back road in Jabugo, where some of Spain’s best ham is produced. In the distance, we spotted a herd of black, long-snouted pigs grazing lazily in their fenced-off field. We approached them. Suddenly, the pigs turned into monsters—scratching wildly against the fence and emitting such hellish oinks and squeals we felt catapulted into a scene from Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>. We ran.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Anyway, back to the ham . . . Breed and feed are what contribute to the pigs’ sublime flavor. While <em>ibérico</em> hogs eat very little in summer, from October to February they are let loose in <em>dehesas,</em> sylvan pastures covered with oak trees. The trees provide wild acorns—the pigs’ favorite food. During the winter fattening stage, they gobble up some twenty pounds of acorns a day, increasing up to 60 percent in weight. Thanks to a combination of the acorn diet and exercise, the meat acquires gorgeous streaks of luxurious ivory fat. The fat has the unique nutty flavor of sun-ripened acorns and coats the mouth with a long-lasting aftertaste of pure pleasure. <em>Jamón ibérico de bellota</em> is the label given to the tiny fraction of hams from hogs fattened only on acorns. After the hogs meet their fate, the hind legs are salted and cured according to centuries-old artisanal methods; aging takes fourteen to thirty-six months at carefully controlled temperatures. Besides <em>jamones,</em> the pigs yield delicacies like chorizo, <em>paleta</em> (forelegs), and <em>lomo</em> (boneless loin). Fresh <em>ibérico</em> pork meat is quite a treat.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The consumption of <em>ibérico</em> ham is a highly ritualized business. Most decent tapas bars have yellow waxy <em>jamones</em> hanging from the rafters. Yet true connoisseurs favor establishments where the owner not only chooses hams from the most respected producers (Joselito, for instance) but also goes himself to the factory to handpick his wares. The ham is carved into precise rectangular slices by hand with a special long razor-sharp knife, usually wielded by a guy who’s been doing this for most of his adult life. The ham is served at room temperature, sometimes on lightly warmed plates. The best—the only!—way to eat it is unadorned, with bread on the side.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Long banned in this country by the USDA, <em>ibérico</em> ham is finally due to legally arrive in the United States in 2007 or 2008. Get on a waiting list! And while you wait, consider serrano ham. Meaning from the mountains—cool mountain air is essential for the curing—<em>serrano</em> is the generic term applied to dry-cured Spanish hams. When not labeled <em>ibérico</em> (less than 10 percent of Spain’s hams are), serrano ham will likely come from white pigs not fed on acorns. But the meat is still exquisite. Somewhat similar in texture and taste to <em>prosciutto di Parma,</em> it’s considered superior because of its lean suppleness and depth of flavor. High-quality sliced serrano ham (usually labeled <em>reserva</em>) is a must at any good tapas bash. Use lesser-quality serrano ham for cooking; it’s an essential flavor in many of the recipes in this book.</p>

We have more than once been caught in one of these pig-deluges, and nearly carried away horse and all.”</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">BRAISED AND GLAZED PORK RIBS WITH APPLESAUCE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COSTILLA DE CERDO LACADA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Slowly cooked until they fall apart at the mere touch of a fork, these ultradelicious ribs are crisped with a glaze of reduced balsamic vinegar. The recipe is from La Cuchara de San Telmo, an innovative tapas bar in San Sebastián where small, neat slabs of ribs make a substantial tapa. In a process that takes two days, the owners slow-cook the ribs for many hours, let them cool in the liquid, debone them completely, then press them into a mold for twenty-four hours so the meat forms a kind of terrine. I’ve simplified the procedure considerably (my version is extremely easy and takes far less time), while keeping the essence intact. Flaky sea salt is a small but important final touch to offset the sweet-tart glaze.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 to 5 pounds baby back pork ribs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds (about 4) Golden Delicious or Gala apples, peeled, cored, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup beef stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup balsamic vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons soy sauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons honey</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3c">LAMB</h3>
<h3 class="h3">SEVEN HOUR LEG OF LAMB</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GIGOT DE XAI A LES SET HORES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Who said that roast lamb must be rare? Mouthwatering recipes for slow-cooked lamb abound in the Mediterranean and are becoming increasingly popular in the States. Few, however, deliver the moist, you-can-eat-it-with-a-spoon meat of this one. The best slow-cooked lamb I’ve ever eaten was at Les Cols, a stunning restaurant in the Pyrenees where a space-age décor happily coexists with incredible neotraditional Catalan cooking. Fina Puigdevall, the chef-owner, cooks the lamb <em>al vacio</em>—vacuum-packed in plastic in a type of high-tech bain-marie. This didn’t seem practical for home kitchens, so I’ve adapted Fina’s technique, slowly roasting the lamb tightly bundled in aluminum foil in a very low oven, with a little liquid to release steam and keep the meat wonderfully moist. For a crisp crust, the lamb is browned at a high temperature before being served. The cooking time here is pretty approximate: The lamb will be delicious after about six and a half hours and can easily cook for as long as eight.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_240"/><strong>½ cup crumbled mixed dried herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, and mint</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons cracked black pepper</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>8 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 leg of lamb (7 to 8 pounds; see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note2">Note</a>), trimmed of all but a thin layer of fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry red or white wine</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the herbs, pepper, salt, and garlic in a bowl and add enough olive oil to make a spreadable paste. Spread the herb paste all over the lamb and set it in a large roasting pan. Bake the lamb for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 275°F. Pour 1 cup water into the roasting pan and cover and seal the pan very tightly with a double layer of aluminum foil. Bake the lamb for 3 hours. Uncover the pan and carefully pour out the liquid (there will be quite a lot). Set the liquid aside. Add the wine to the pan, cover it again with aluminum foil, return the lamb to the oven, and continue roasting for 3½ hours more.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Increase the oven temperature to 475°F. Uncover the lamb and carefully pour the liquid that has accumulated in the roasting pan into the reserved pan juices. Return the lamb to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the top is nicely browned and crisp, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Meanwhile, skim the fat from the pan juices, transfer them to a medium-size saucepan, and boil over high heat until reduced by one third, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Remove the lamb from the oven and let rest for about 10 minutes. Cut it into thick slices, place these on a platter, drizzle some of the reduced pan juices on top, and serve with the remaining pan juices on the side. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch08_note2"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If you want to prepare a 5- to 6-pound shank half of a leg of lamb, reduce the cooking time to about 5 hours. A whole unboned lamb shoulder also lends itself wonderfully to this cooking method.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">BRAISED LAMB SHOULDER WITH TWO WINES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CORDERO CON DOS VINOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Adolfo Muñoz, the Toledo chef who created this recipe, is also a winemaker—which means that the guy <em>really</em> knows about cooking with wine. For braising the lamb in this rustic but elegant recipe, he uses white wine, which doesn’t overshadow the flavor of the meat. After the lamb is cooked, he makes a red wine reduction from his syrah Pago del Ama to add depth to the sauce. Though your butcher might not necessarily have lamb shoulder on display, if you call ahead and ask, most will happily reserve one for you. Moist and tender, it’s the ideal cut for braising.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_242"/><strong>1 boneless lamb shoulder roast (about 6 pounds)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups dry red wine, such as syrah</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Using kitchen string, tie the lamb shoulder crosswise, spacing the ties 1 inch apart. Rub the lamb generously with salt and pepper. Heat ¼ cup of the olive oil in a very large flameproof roasting pan set over 2 burners at medium heat. Add the lamb and brown it all over, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the lamb to a large plate and pour off all the fat from the roasting pan.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Return the lamb to the roasting pan, add the white wine and 1 quart water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the rosemary, thyme, sage, and marjoram, cover the lamb with parchment paper, then cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil.

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Most tourists come to Toledo to gaze at the florid Gothic cathedral, visit El Greco’s house, gorge on marzipan (a local specialty that goes back to the days of the Moors), and hastily soak up nine hundred years of Spanish history—a melding of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures. Me? I traveled there to meet Adolfo Muñoz, owner of one of Spain’s best restaurants, Adolfo. The introduction came from my friend José Carlos Capel, the revered food critic of the newspaper <em>El País</em>. “Not only will you eat and drink stupendously,” Capel promised, “you’ll also meet a remarkable character: a great chef, host of a daily cooking show, caterer to Spanish celebrities, winemaker, and olive grower.” I packed my bags.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Walking down Toledo’s cobblestoned lanes flanked by ocher facades with an occasional arabesque arch or lattice-work window, I finally reached Adolfo. Muñoz greeted me at the door with a vigorous handshake. Minutes later we were heading a few blocks up a moonlit street to his wine cellar. Wine cellars can be a musty yawn, but not Muñoz’s. It isn’t just that the collection of bottles includes complete verticals of cult Spanish labels like L’Ermita and Pingus. The cellar itself is amazing, a ninth-century house, once owned by a Jewish family, that later served as an ancient water-storage facility. “In Toledo everybody is an archaeologist by default,” Muñoz said, pointing to a hearth used for baking bread and marzipan—1,100 years ago.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Adolfo, Muñoz’s restaurant, started life as an <em>asador</em> (a rustic roast house) more than a quarter century ago, gradually evolving into one of the most sophisticated kitchens in Spain, highlighting regional ingredients such as saffron, oil made with cornicabra olives, Manchego cheese, and Alto Tajo truffles. The delicious results are dishes like a new-wave Strawberry and Fennel Gazpacho (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_100">page 100</a>), a light Warm Salad of Cod and Oranges (<a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#page_117">page 117</a>), the incredible Braised Lamb Shoulder with Two Wines (<a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_240">page 240</a>), and ethereal Adolfo’s Warm Chocolate Soufflé Cakes with Thyme Ice Cream (<a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_418">pages 418</a> and <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#page_437">437</a>). King Juan Carlos once declared Adolfo’s partridge to be the best in Spain. Julio Iglesias is another fan.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Not content just to wear a chef’s toque, Muñoz also makes wine: a ripe, fruity red called Pago del Ama, which elegantly blends syrah grapes with cabernet and merlot. The next afternoon, Muñoz took me to his wine estate near his house, high in the hills above Toledo. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a prettier spot. Centered around a <em>cigarral</em>—a traditional villa—the plot was lush, with grapevines and olive groves, juniper bushes and three-hundred-year-old oak trees. Scattered about were a few <em>tinajas,</em> huge earthenware jugs that have been used for fermenting and storing wine in the area since Roman times. As the setting sun bathed everything in a golden-pink light, Muñoz pointed to the vista of Toledo below. Perched on a craggy bluff across the river Tagus, the delicate cathedral spire and the somber towers of the <em>alcazar</em> (fortress) rose above a jumble of houses with terra-cotta roofs spilling down the hill. This could well be, he mused, the vantage point from which El Greco had painted his masterpiece <em>View of Toledo</em>.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Lamb Shanks with Five Heads of Garlic</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">It was at a country luncheon in the Aragon region that I first tasted these lamb shanks. They had a deep burnished flavor and came with whole garlic heads that had been cooked with the meat—plus there was more garlic flavoring the delicious pan juices. The combination of roasting and braising is a winning one, eliminating the fuss of browning the meat and contributing rich roasty notes. The pan juices are thin but extremely flavorful, more like <em>jus</em> than sauce. Large chunks of lamb shoulder, with some bone and trimmed of most fat, would also be good here.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_244"/><strong>4 large, meaty lamb shanks (about 1¼ pounds each)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, cut in half, each half cut into 4 or 5 wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small, slender carrots, cut into chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 small heads of garlic; 4 heads with the outer layer of skin removed, 1 head separated into cloves, each clove peeled and lightly smashed</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 large fresh rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 475°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the lamb generously with salt and pepper. Choose a heavy, deep, flameproof baking dish that can hold the lamb and vegetables in one snug layer and can be tightly covered. Scatter the onion, carrots, and smashed garlic cloves on the bottom of the dish, season them with salt and pepper, and toss with some olive oil. Brush the lamb shanks all over with olive oil and place them on top of the vegetables. Tuck the heads of garlic and the rosemary sprig between the lamb shanks and brush them with a little more olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Bake the lamb shanks, uncovered, turning once, until the meat and the vegetables are nicely browned, about 45 minutes. Check after 25 minutes, and if the vegetables in the bottom of the baking dish are beginning to burn, add a little water and reduce the oven temperature to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> After 45 minutes, add the wine to the baking dish and enough chicken stock to come about halfway up the meat (the garlic heads should stick out from the liquid). Cover the baking dish tightly (if it doesn’t have a close-fitting lid, seal it with a double layer of aluminum foil) and reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. Bake the lamb shanks until they are extremely tender and begin to pull away from the bone, about 2 hours. Turn the shanks once or twice as they bake and add more chicken stock, if necessary, to maintain the level of liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Transfer the lamb, vegetables, and garlic heads to a serving platter.

<p class="noindent">Here’s a quick and elegant recipe, adapted from Ferran Adrià’s cookbook <em>Cocinar en Casa</em> (<em>Cooking at Home</em>). Though something as conventional as rack of lamb will never, ever find its way to the hyper-experimental kitchen of his restaurant, El Bulli, in this recipe Adrià demonstrates his ability to turn a few simple ingredients into much more than the sum of their parts. The pancetta is a substitute for Spanish bacon, but if it’s unavailable regular bacon will also work, keeping the meat nicely moist as it roasts.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_245"/><strong>⅓ cup raw unsalted pistachios</strong></p>

<p class="box-title">SHEEP THRILLS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Spaniards might have the world’s most evolved modern cuisine, yet their palates remain uncorrupted by globalization. Not for them are overwrought menus that span the globe in the course of one meal. What appeals to their purist taste is the quality of ingredients and the rigor of preparation. And they love making food pilgrimages—clocking in miles to sample famous regional specialties at their source. Topping all Spanish food journeys is the quest for <em>lechazo,</em> the roast suckling lamb that’s to the parched plains of Old Castile what barbecue brisket is to central Texas. Rafael García Santos, a prominent food critic, calls <em>lechazo</em> the gastronomic banner of Spain.</p>
<p class="sb-indent"><em>Lechazo</em> is the speciality of <em>asadores,</em> or roast houses, normally dark, burnished taverns, suffused with the scent of smoldering coals from the vaulted adobe brick ovens where the lamb roasts. Some <em>asadores</em> start you off with grilled chorizo, blood sausage, and roasted pepper, and there’s always a salad. But lamb’s the thing. Though shepherding has always been a way of life in Castile, in the last century wool-producing merino sheep gave way to the Churra breed—slender long-legged animals that yield milk and meat. The sheep for <em>lechazo</em> are a few weeks old, weigh about fifteen pounds, and have fed exclusively on their mother’s milk. A regular order for two is a whole quarter, preferably a front one, which has plusher meat and crisper bones. The roasting is done in unglazed earthenware <em>cazuleas</em> with minimal seasoning: perhaps a smear of lard to keep the skin extra crunchy, lots of salt, and splashes of water that turn into light, amber juices as the lamb roasts. The <em>lechazo</em> is a thing of beauty, with sweet, white buttery flesh soft enough to eat with a spoon, tasting subtly of the wild grasses on which the mother sheep grazed. On top is a thin sheet of crackling skin; in your glass, a young, slightly coarse Ribera del Duero red produced somewhere down the road. No distance is too far to travel for such a meal.</p>

Almost as tiny as lollipops, with sweet white meat, they are either fried until crisp or grilled <em>al sarmiento</em>—over aromatic vine cuttings. Usually you get an order of slowly sautéed piquillo peppers to start or as a side dish. But here, cooked down to a marmalade with garlic, rosemary, and a touch of orange, the peppers make a delicious relish for the meat.

Of course, a bonus not encountered in Muslim cuisines is the brandy and wine that lend the dish oomph.

<h3 class="h3">LAMB WITH DRIED AND FRESH RED PEPPERS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CORDERO AL CHILINDRON</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Where would Spanish cuisine be without the New World’s tomatoes and peppers? This is a good question to contemplate over a warming bowl of <em>chilindrón,</em> a dish associated with the Navarra region but also popular in nearby La Rioja, as well as in parts of Aragon and the Basque Country. Nobody can pinpoint where the name <em>chilindrón</em> comes from—it is also used for a card game—and everyone argues over whether an authentic <em>chilindrón</em> should or should not include tomatoes. The main flavor here comes from a combination of red bell peppers and the dried smoky-sweet <em>pimientos choriceros</em> (or anchos, if you can’t find the authentic item). Some versions of the stew include serrano ham or potatoes, and <em>chilindrón</em> is also popular (and delicious) prepared with chicken.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_249"/><strong>4 pimientos choriceros (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_384">page 384</a>), or 3 ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded, and torn into pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup boiling chicken stock or broth, plus 1 cup room-temperature stock</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large onions, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size fleshy red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ pounds boned lamb shoulder, cut into 1½-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the lamb</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup chopped canned tomatoes, with about ¼ cup of their juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the <em>pimientos choriceros</em> in a heatproof bowl, add the 1 cup boiling chicken stock, and soak until the peppers are soft, about 30 minutes. Place the peppers and their soaking liquid in a blender and blend to a very smooth puree, then set the puree aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until softened but not browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the red peppers and cook for 5 minutes, stirring. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and continue cooking until the onions and peppers are very soft, about 15 minutes longer, adding a tablespoon of water from time to time if the skillet looks too dry.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the onions are cooking, season the lamb generously with salt. Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate, and lightly dust the lamb with it. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy 5-quart casserole over medium-high heat. Working in batches, brown the lamb all over, about 5 minutes per batch, transferring the browned pieces to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Once all the lamb has been browned and removed, add the wine, the remaining 1 cup chicken stock, the tomatoes with their juice, and the pepper puree to the casserole. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, scraping the bottom of the casserole with a wooden spoon to dislodge the brown bits. Add the onion mixture, stir to mix, and return the lamb to the casserole. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Cover the casserole, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the lamb is tender, 1½ to 1¾ hours, stirring often, as the stew tends to stick to the bottom. Alternatively, the lamb can be braised in a 325°F oven, in which case you don’t need to stir it. (Braised in the oven, the juices are more concentrated, so you might want to add an extra ½ cup stock.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the garlic, peppercorns, and a pinch of salt in a mortar and, using a pestle, crush them into a paste. Add the vinegar, then stir the paste into the stew. Cook until the flavors blend, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and/or pepper as necessary. Serve the stew at once, sprinkled with the parsley. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro">COCIDO: SPAIN’S FAMOUS BOILED DINNER</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COCIDO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Cocido</em> is a big multi-ingredient feast that will feed an army—soup, meat, vegetables—and still leave leftovers. The ingredients list and instructions might look involved, but there’s not much more to it than throwing a bunch of stuff in a pot.</p>
<p class="indent">Spanish cooks tend to be militantly chauvinistic about their <em>cocidos,</em> insisting that <em>their</em> region, province, city, neighborhood, or household makes the best. Not being bound by regional rules, I have the freedom to combine the best features of <em>cocidos</em> from all around Spain. In the Catalan manner, a hefty veal knuckle flavors the broth, giving it depth. From the Alicante region, I’ve borrowed deliciously delicate meatballs studded with pine nuts and subtly scented with lemon peel. The thin noodles belong to Castile, while green beans (instead of the usual cabbage) are an Andalusian touch. Call it a composite <em>cocido.</em></p>
<p class="indent">This recipe makes a rather large amount, so you can enjoy the yummy dishes made with <em>cocido</em> leftovers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_254">page 254</a> for some dishes to make with them).</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_251"/><strong>FOR THE MEATS, CHICKPEAS &amp; BROTH:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves, lightly smashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and drained (not quick soaked)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds veal shanks or knuckles, rinsed well</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound beef marrow bones or knucklebones, rinsed well</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (6 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (½ pound) smoky, meaty slab bacon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds boneless beef shin, shank, chuck (preferably arm or shoulder), or brisket</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 chicken (about 3½ pounds), rinsed well a nd trimmed of excess fat</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large carrot, scraped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion stuck with a few cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces morcilla or other blood sausage (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note3">Notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE MEATBALLS (OPTIONAL):</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 slice white sandwich bread, crust removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ pound ground pork</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ pound chicken or turkey sausages, casings removed</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of ground cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE VEGETABLES AND SOUP:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 2 pounds small new potatoes, scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ pounds green beans, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup fideo noodles or thin vermicelli, broken into 1-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR SERVING:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minted Tomato Vinaigrette (<a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_rec1">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>A green salad dressed with lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Prepare the meat, chickpeas, and broth: Place the bay leaves, peppercorns, garlic, and parsley sprigs in a small piece of cheesecloth and tie it closed. Wrap and tie the chickpeas in a large square piece of cheesecloth, so you can easily remove them later.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the veal shanks, beef bones, serrano ham, bacon, beef shin, and chicken in a very large, heavy stockpot. Add 4½ quarts (18 cups) water and bring to a boil over high heat. Thoroughly skim off the foam. Add the cheesecloth bags of herbs and chickpeas and the carrot and onion and bring back to a boil, skimming. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour (the liquid should barely bubble). Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a large bowl and cover it with aluminum foil. Cook the broth for another 45 minutes, then transfer the ham and bacon to the bowl with the chicken. The beef and bones should still be in the pot.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil. Add the chorizo and blood sausage and blanch for 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausages to the pot with the beef. Keep the water in which you blanched the sausages at a simmer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Make the meatballs, if using: Place the bread and a little of the liquid from the meat pot in a small bowl and let soak for a few minutes. Drain, squeeze out the excess liquid, and finely crumble the bread. Finely chop enough of the reserved bacon to measure ¼ cup; set the remaining bacon aside. Place the chopped bacon, bread, ground pork, chicken sausages, egg, pine nuts, lemon zest, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and parsley in a food processor. Pulse until well combined but not minced or pureed. Scrape the mixture into a bowl. Wet your hands, then shape the meatball mixture into 2½-inch ovals, gently tossing them between two cupped hands to give them shape. Add the meatballs to the simmering water and cook for 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat-balls to the pot with the beef and bones. Simmer until the beef shin is extremely tender, 45 minutes. The total cooking time for the meat should be 2½ to 3 hours. (The <em>cocido</em> can be prepared to this point 1 day in advance; see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note3">Notes</a>.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> While the beef and meatballs are simmering, prepare the vegetables and soup: Place the potatoes in a large pot and add cold water to cover by 4 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, add salt, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, partially covered, until the potatoes are almost tender, about 15 minutes. Add the green beans to the pot and cook until the potatoes and beans are very tender, about 7 minutes. Drain the vegetables and transfer them to a large serving platter, leaving room for the chickpeas. Carefully remove the cheesecloth bag with the chickpeas from the meat pot. Working over a sieve, cut the bag open to release the chickpeas. Add the chickpeas to the vegetable platter. Sprinkle the vegetables with a little of the hot broth from the meat pot, season them with salt, and keep warm, covered with aluminum foil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Skim off as much fat as you can from the broth in the meat pot. Line a sieve with cheesecloth. Ladle by ladle, strain about 8 cups of the broth through the cheesecloth-lined sieve into a clean pot. (Figure on about 1 cup broth per person.) Bring the strained broth to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the noodles and cook until just tender, about 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> While the noodles are cooking, using a slotted spoon remove and discard the bones, carrot, onion, and cheesecloth bag of herbs from the meat pot. Return the reserved chicken, ham, and bacon (all or what remains, if you used some in the meat-balls) to the pot and cook until warmed through.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken, sausages, meatballs, bacon, ham, beef, and veal to a big bowl. Keep the broth in the meat pot hot. Cut or slice all the meats, sausages, chicken, and meat-balls into serving pieces, removing and discarding any gristle and bones. Arrange the meats on a large platter, sprinkle with hot broth from the meat pot, and keep warm, covered with aluminum foil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">9.</span></strong> Serve the <em>cocido</em>: Ladle the soup and the noodles into shallow soup bowls and serve this first. Follow it with the meat and the vegetables platter, accompanied by Minted Tomato Vinaigrette and a pitcher of hot broth from the meat pot for moistening the meat and the vegetables. Follow with salad to cleanse the palate. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 WITH LEFTOVERS</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch08_note3"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTES:</strong></span> If blood sausage is unavailable, increase the amount of chorizo to 18 ounces or substitute 6 ounces of fresh pork or turkey sausages for them.</p>
<p class="indent">I suggest preparing the <em>cocido</em> a day ahead through Step 4, so you can strain and degrease the broth for the soup at your leisure. Let the <em>cocido</em> cool down a bit, then ladle out 8 cups of the broth from the meat pot. Strain it through a cheesecloth-lined sieve into a storage container. Cover and refrigerate. Pick through the meat pot, discarding the bones, the bag of herbs, and the vegetables. Remove the chickpea bag, wrap it in aluminum foil, and refrigerate. Prepare the meats as described in Step 8, return them to the remaining broth in the meat pot, and store, covered, in the refrigerator. The next day, continue with the recipe, degreasing and reheating the 8 cups of broth separately from the broth in the meat pot. Reheat the bag of chickpeas in the pot with the meat, and add them to the vegetable platter as described in Step 5.</p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">When making <em>cocido</em>, feel free to be flexible about the specific ingredients and amounts. The meatballs are delicious but optional. To flavor the broth, you’ll need some good gelatinous bones and something smoky, like serrano ham, bacon, salt pork, pancetta, or a ham bone. The best meat is a marbled cut, like shin or chuck, but you can use oxtails, short ribs, a two-pound hunk of pork shoulder, and/or a small, meaty veal breast. Poultry can be a whole chicken or just a few thighs. For the vegetables—besides the obligatory chickpeas and potatoes—consider cabbage, pumpkin, or leeks. If Spanish chorizo and <em>morcilla</em> (blood sausage) are unavailable, use good pork and/or chicken sausages. Many Spanish cooks insist that the chorizo and <em>morcilla</em> sausages “corrupt” the taste of the broth and should be cooked separately. Personally, I like the flavor they impart to the cooking liquid, but purists can cook them in the pot with the vegetables.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_253"/>EVERY SPAINARD LOVES A BOILED DINNER</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Paella belongs to Valencia and gazpacho to Andalusia, while <em>fabada</em> is the specialty of Asturias. <em>Cocido,</em> however, is truly Spain’s national dish, a one-pot feast enjoyed in every part of the country. Most <em>cocidos</em> include sturdy vegetables, legumes, and an assortment of meats and char-cuterie ranging from modest to regal. Simmered in water for hours, they yield two courses: first, a rich amber broth with pasta or rice, then platters of meats and vegetables. Meaning boiled, <em>cocido</em> is the offspring of the mythical <em>olla podrida,</em> or rotten pot (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_317">page 317</a>), the mother of all Spanish one-dish meals. While the exact composition varies somewhat from region to region, the essence of a <em>cocido</em> remains the same: a hearty multi-ingredient pot that was once weekly fare but these days is mainly served for special occasions and always eaten for lunch.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Catalan <em>cocido, escudella i carn d’olla</em> (<em>escudella</em> means bowl) is a Christmas tradition. Besides the prerequisite chickpeas and bacony things, it has veal, mild <em>butifarra</em> sausages, big fluffy meatballs <em>(pilotas),</em> and a broth afloat with pasta shells called <em>galets</em>. An Andalusian <em>cocido</em> consists of <em>berzas</em> (vegetables such as cardoons, pumpkin, and chard) and <em>pringá</em> (a collective term for meats like blood sausage, chorizo, bacon, and pork), with a broth tinted yellow by saffron and often speckled with mint. In the Mediterranean Alicante, the pot might contain turkey along with extra-succulent meatballs scented with cinnamon and grated lemon peel and wrapped in cabbage leaves. In a Galician <em>cocido</em> you will find salt-cured pork ribs, pork shoulder, and possibly turnip greens. In the Canary Islands, corn on the cob, tropical tubers, pears, and seven different meats flavor the pot. And don’t forget the scrumptious <em>cocido maragato</em> of the Castilian province of León, which is served in reverse order, starting with meat, progressing to vegetables, and ending with soup. As for the meatballs that feature in so many <em>cocido</em> recipes—variously called <em>bolas, relleno, pelotas, farcedures</em>—one could write a whole book about these!</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In Madrid, <em>cocido</em> remains a grand luncheon tradition maintained by old institutions like Lhardy. There you indulge in it surrounded by somber oil paintings, ornate cupboards laden with what looks like church silver, and frail old couples who vigorously devour blood sausage and tripe. And there’s La Bola, an ancient folksy <em>taberna</em> where the smoky (and very heavy) <em>cocido</em> simmers over hot coals and is served in potbellied earthenware jugs. The three courses of classic <em>cocido madrileño</em>—broth with fine noodles, chickpeas and vegetables, and finally meats—are known as <em>sota, caballo,</em> and <em>rey</em>. These can be roughly translated as jack, queen, and king, meaning that the dishes you’re dealt get more noble as the meal moves along. And when the huge heaps of vegetables and meats are gone, you fall into a <em>cocido</em>-induced stupor. Siestas were invented for dishes like this.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="page_254"/>COCIDO: A SECOND TIME AROUND</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><em>Cocido</em> is a big hearty family feast meant to be enjoyed for a Sunday lunch and then provide light meals for days to come. Not surprisingly, <em>cocido</em> leftovers are legion. Here are seven favorite ways of using them.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>BAKED RICE:</strong></span> For Spaniards, rice baked in the rich <em>cocido</em> broth is the ultimate comfort food. Heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil with a few minced garlic cloves in a medium-size casserole and stir for a minute. Add a large grated tomato, cook for a few minutes more, then add some paprika. Stir in 1 cup short-grain Spanish rice or Italian risotto rice along with some chickpeas from the <em>cocido</em> and diced chorizo and blood sausage. Add 2 cups of strained <em>cocido</em> broth, some minced parsley, and a pinch of crumbled saffron; bring to a boil. Cover and bake in a 400°F oven until the rice is tender, about 18 minutes. Uncover, and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>CROQUETTES:</strong></span> The first thing a Spanish cook will do with <em>cocido</em> leftovers is make delicious crispy, fluffy <em>croquetas</em>. Shred, mince, and mash enough of the beef, chicken, veal, chorizo, and potatoes from the <em>cocido</em> to measure 1 heaping cup. Then make croquettes, following the recipe on <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_64">page 64</a>, omitting the mushrooms and truffle oil.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>HASH:</strong></span> This is an Andalusian specialty called <em>ropa vieja,</em> or old clothes (in Cuba, the name describes a shredded flank steak braised in tomato sauce). Heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet with a few cloves of minced garlic. Add some chopped meats, sausages, and vegetables from the <em>cocido</em> and stir for a few minutes. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce and a little <em>cocido</em> broth and let simmer for a few minutes more. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with fried or poached eggs—my favorite breakfast!</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>OMELET:</strong></span> <em>Tortilla de ropa vieja</em> was an unforgettably succulent specialty at Bar Astelena in San Sebastián. Alas, the bar has closed, but the recipe lives on. Thinly slice 2 medium-size yellow onions and cook them in olive oil over low heat until very soft but not browned. Transfer to a bowl and let cool, then toss with 2 cups of shredded beef, veal, and chicken from the <em>cocido</em>. In a separate bowl, beat 6 large eggs. Stir the eggs into the meat mixture, add some minced parsley, 2 tablespoons of <em>cocido</em> broth, and salt. Fry the tortilla as directed in the Potato Tortilla recipe (<a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#page_139">page 139</a>).</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><a id="page_255"/><span class="blue"><strong>PRINGA:</strong></span> The very best thing one can order at an Andalusian tapas bar is a <em>pringá:</em> a toasted <em>chapata</em> roll filled with mashed-up meats and sausages from a <em>cocido</em> and cooked in a press. Mince skinned blood sausages and chorizo, bacon, ham, and a bit of veal or beef from the <em>cocido</em> and fry them briefly in a little olive oil, moistening them with a little broth. Split a small, dense flat roll (an Italian <em>ciabatta</em> is best), brush it with olive oil, and toast or griddle it split side down. Fill the roll with the meat mixture, sprinkling on a little hot sauce or some julienned piquillo pepper, if you wish, then heat in a sandwich press. If you don’t have a sandwich press, you can improvise one by placing a flat plate weighed down with something heavy, like a 28-ounce can of tomatoes or beans, on top of the sandwich.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>SALAD:</strong></span> <em>Cocido</em> leftovers also make a tasty salad called <em>salpicón</em>. Shred or dice about 3 cups of beef, chicken, and veal from the <em>cocido</em>. Add a handful of cooked chickpeas and some diced boiled potatoes and string beans. Toss with thinly sliced red onion and lots of minced parsley. Dress with a good olive oil and some sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>TERRINE:</strong></span> Tear or cut the beef, chicken, bacon, and ham from the <em>cocido</em> into enough bite-size pieces to measure 2 cups. Toss in some capers and chopped cornichons, diced boiled potatoes and string beans, a handful of cooked chickpeas, lots of minced parsley, 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice; and 2 crushed garlic cloves. Line a 4-cup loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving some overhang, and place the mixture in it.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Place a packet of gelatin and 2 tablespoons of cold water in a small saucepan to soften. Add 2 cups of strained <em>cocido</em> broth and heat, stirring to dissolve the gelatin. Let cool slightly, then pour the gelatin mixture over the meat mixture. Cover with aluminum foil, chill until set, and unmold onto a plate. Serve for supper with an assortment of mustards and a salad of peppery greens.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GUISO DE TERNERA A LA ASTURIANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you see a recipe for a folksy dish that features turnips, meat, and smoked porkstuffs, you can pretty much bet it’s from the mountainous region of Asturias. This stew is great rib-sticking fare for a cold winter night.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 pounds well-marbled beef chuck, cut into 1½-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ounces best-quality smoky slab bacon or pancetta, cut into medium-size dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size white onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fat carrots, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dried white beans, such as cannellini or navy beans, soaked overnight and drained or quick soaked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_309">page 309</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 canned plum tomatoes, chopped, plus ⅓ cup of their juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces turnips (2 medium-size), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note4">Notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups chopped, well-rinsed turnip greens, tough stems removed (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note4">Notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Season the meat generously with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy, wide 5-quart ovenproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add half of the beef to the casserole and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned beef to a bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the casserole. Brown the remaining beef, then transfer it to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the bacon to the casserole, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until the bacon begins to render its fat, about 2 minutes. (If it seems to be rendering too much fat, spoon some off.) Add the onion, garlic, and carrots, increase the heat to <a id="page_257"/>medium-high, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Add the flour and stir for a few seconds. Gradually add the wine, stirring to combine thoroughly with the flour, then add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the casserole to dislodge the brown bits.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Return the meat and any accumulated juices to the casserole and add the beans and the tomatoes with their liquid. Return to a boil, skim if necessary, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the casserole and bake for 2 hours. Stir in the turnips and 1 cup water and bake until the meat and the beans are very tender, 30 to 50 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the turnip greens and blanch until wilted and just tender, 2 minutes (sturdier greens such as kale or collards will take a little longer). Drain the greens in a colander, pressing against them to squeeze out excess moisture.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Taste the stew for seasoning, adding more salt and/or pepper as necessary. Stir the greens into the stew and let rest for about 5 minutes before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch08_note4"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTES:</strong></span> Turnip greens are sold on their own at some markets or you can simply snip a bunch off turnips or daikon radish. If they’re not available, use another sturdy green, such as mustard greens, kale, or collard greens.</p>

<h3 class="h3">MEATY OXTAIL STEW TORERO STYLE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>RABO DE TORO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Enjoyed all over the country, the macho, full-bodied dish <em>rabo de toro</em> is most closely associated with Andalusia, a region particularly crazy for bullfighting. Connoisseurs insist that the best time to indulge in oxtail stew is the day after a <em>corrida,</em> and that it should be ordered at a <em>taurino</em> tavern near a bullring, where it will be prepared with the tail of a fallen bull. By eating it, one absorbs some of the heroic bravery of the animal—at least that’s the theory.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_258"/>Long, slow cooking is the secret to a good oxtail stew. “Just put the pot on the stove and forget it exists,” suggested one cook in Seville. Spanish oxtails are incredibly meaty and rich; if you can’t find excellent oxtail, try short ribs. The dish is best prepared ahead; that way you can easily skim off the fat and the flavors get a chance to develop. My favorite side dish for this is the Potato and Onion Gratin with Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_320">page 320</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4½ to 5 pounds meaty oxtails</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the oxtails</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size carrots, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small leek, white part only, rinsed thoroughly, cut in half lengthwise, and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 ounces cremini or portobello mushrooms, wiped clean with a damp paper towel and coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup brandy, preferably Spanish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh thyme sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ cups full-bodied dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups plum tomatoes, chopped, with ½ cup of their juice</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the oxtails in a large bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of flour on a plate and, working in batches, dust the oxtails with flour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a heavy 5- to 6-quart casserole over medium-high heat. Working in batches, brown the oxtails all over until richly browned, 8 to 10 minutes per batch, transferring the browned oxtails to a large bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the onion, garlic, carrots, leek, and mushrooms to the casserole. Cook until the vegetables are softened and browned, about 7 minutes, adding the remaining oil and adjusting the heat so the bottom of the casserole doesn’t burn. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the brandy, scraping the bottom of the casserole to dislodge the brown bits. Add the bay leaf, thyme, 2 cups of the wine, the chicken stock, and tomatoes and bring to a boil, skimming any foam off the surface. Season with salt to taste, then return the oxtails and their accumulated juices to the casserole. Reduce the heat to very low, cover the casserole, and simmer until the oxtails are very tender, 2½ to 3 hours. (The stew can be prepared to this point up to 1 day ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Skim as much fat as possible off the top of the stew, then, if it has been refrigerated, reheat it slowly. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the oxtails to a large bowl. Add the remaining ½ cup wine to the casserole, increase the heat to high, and cook until the pan juices are nicely thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Return the oxtails to the casserole, turning them to coat with the pan juices, and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_259"/>GRILL GRAILS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">If in Castile you go to an <em>asador</em> to indulge in roast lamb, in the Basque Country <em>asadores</em> are grill restaurants specializing in fish at the shore and meat in the hinterlands. The meat to eat at an <em>asador</em> is <em>chuleta</em>: a heroic rib chop cut from a Galician or Danish cow. And one of the best places to eat it is Casa Julián in the town of Tolosa. You enter through a fabulously ramshackle garage, claim one of the six tables, and watch the burly, mustachioed proprietor tend to his bovine masterpieces sizzling on a specially constructed sloped grill. The indelible aroma of fatty, dark-juiced expert grilling wafts over you from just feet away. Then the steak lands on your table—beautifully rare, thick as <em>War and Peace,</em> profoundly charred, and gorgeously crusted with salt. There are no heaped fries or hash browns in sight, no salads chockablock with tomatoes and onions, no steak sauce. Casa Julián, in fact, serves only four things: steak, stalks of white Navarra asparagus as big as cigar tubes, fruity-sweet sheets of roasted piquillo peppers, and some of Spain’s best <em>ibérico</em> ham. With a dusty bottle of Rioja <em>reserva</em> for company.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Casa Julián’s steak is pretty transcendent, but the region’s greatest <em>asador</em> is Etxebarri in the village of Axpe. Etxebarri is Spain’s premier <em>restaurante de producto:</em> with each morsel of food brought by the grill to its ultimate expression, a state of almost surreal perfection. It’s to a rustic grill house what Einstein is to your high school physics teacher. Víctor Arguinzoniz, the owner, grew up on a farm with the aromas of woodsmoke; in his youth he eked out a living gathering firewood. In his quest to push barbecue to a higher plane, he makes his own charcoal from various woods—oak for fish; old vines for meat—and invents new techniques and equipment, such as a movable rack used to regulate the food’s distance from the smoldering coals. Each millimeter counts; each new dish brings a distinct nuanced smokiness. The <em>chuleta</em> here, aged for three weeks, and grilled by a novel technique that cooks both sides simultaneously—is as much a miracle of engineering as it is an awe-inspiring slab of protein.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">GRILLED T-BONES WITH CABRALES BUTTER</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CHULETONES CON MANTEQUILLA DE CABRALES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Making a trip to a country <em>asador</em> (grill restaurant) that specializes in T-bone steaks is a sacred ritual in the Basque Country. It goes without saying that the dish is only as good as the meat: If you want something transcendent, get dry-aged prime T-bones. Can’t find Cabrales cheese for the butter? Use Roquefort, which is one of the most popular cheeses in Spain. Serve this steak with grilled or roasted red peppers, simple sautéed greens, such as spinach or chard, and a baked potato—all of which taste delicious with a pat of the Cabrales butter. A bottle of good Ribera del Duero is fairly obligatory.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons Cabrales cheese or Roquefort, finely mashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 T-bone steaks (about 12 ounces each)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_260"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the butter and Cabrales in a small bowl, stir to blend, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the Cabrales butter on a piece of plastic wrap, shape it into a log, and wrap it in the plastic. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the steaks in a large, shallow dish and rub them generously with salt and pepper and the olive oil; let stand for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Light the grill and preheat it to medium-high.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Grill the steaks until done to taste, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. (An instant-read meat thermometer inserted diagonally into the thickest part of a steak but not touching the bone will register 125°F for medium-rare.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Transfer the grilled steaks to a platter and let rest for about 5 minutes. Cut the Cabrales butter into 4 slices. Top each steak with a piece of butter and serve with a small bowl of flaky sea salt alongside. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATION:</strong></span> Steaks are also delicious cooked <em>a la plancha</em>—seared in a dry cast-iron skillet or griddle that’s been preheated over high heat for 6 to 7 minutes (turn off your smoke alarms). If you’re searing rather than grilling, I recommend a boneless cut, such as rib eye, as the bone in a T-bone prevents the meat from searing evenly. Sear the steaks without crowding them for 3 to 4 minutes per side.</p>

<h3 class="h3">GRILLED SKIRT STEAK WITH ALMOND &amp; CAPER SALSA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>FALDA DE TERNERA CON VINAGRETA DE ALMENDRAS Y ALCAPARRAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Though grilled skirt steak isn’t particularly Spanish—the huge popularity of Argentinean steak houses in Spain notwithstanding—this one, with its zestful salsa of almonds, olives, capers, and parsley, does taste Iberian. The salsa, inspired by a recipe from the great Basque chef Juan Mari Arzak, is also delicious on grilled chicken or firm fish, such as swordfish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SALSA:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup lightly toasted blanched almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons chopped pitted dark olives, such as niçoise or Gaeta</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons drained capers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons balsamic vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_261"/><strong>FOR THE STEAK:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds skirt steak, cut crosswise into 4-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the salsa: Place the almonds in a mini food processor and grind them medium-fine (they should have some texture), then transfer them to a bowl. Add the parsley, olives, capers, garlic, paprika, pepper, red wine vinegar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the olive oil to the processor. Pulse until all the ingredients are finely chopped but not pureed. Add the parsley mixture to the bowl with the almonds, along with the remaining olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. Stir to combine, season the salsa with salt to taste, and let stand for about 30 minutes for the flavors to develop.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the steak: Light the grill and preheat it to medium-high or heat an oiled, ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until almost smoking.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Rub the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Working in two batches, grill the steaks, turning once or twice, until done to taste, 6 to 8 minutes total per batch for medium-rare, depending on thickness.

<p class="box-title">CATALAN CUISINE<br/><small>FROM SOFREGIT TO PICADA</small></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Countless Catalan stews begin with a <em>sofregit</em> and end with a <em>picada,</em> the two basic elements that, according to Catalan writer Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, define the final flavor of the region’s cuisine. An authentic <em>sofregit</em> (<em>sofrito</em> in Castillian Spanish) is a mixture of onions and often tomatoes, garlic, and parsley, traditionally cooked down for hours until rich and caramelized. <em>Sofregit</em> is the base that lends Catalan stews and soups their typical burnished depth. When the dish is nearly ready, it’s usually finished with a <em>picada,</em> a mortar-pounded paste that both enlivens and thickens it. <em>Picadas</em> can be as elemental as a blend of fresh garlic and parsley. Or they can include nuts, fried bread, butter biscuits, chicken or game livers, wine, saffron, even chocolate. Both <em>sofregit</em> and <em>picada</em> go back to medieval Catalan cooking.</p>

<h3 class="h3bro">VEAL FRICANDO WITH MUSHROOMS &amp; HAZEL NUTS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>FRICANDO DE VEDELLA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Veal cooked in a soulful sauce fragrant with wild mushrooms, <em>fricandó</em> is Catalan bourgeois home cooking par excellence. It is a preparation that exists in several European cuisines—usually as a fricassee. But the Catalans, who have been making <em>fricandó</em> since the eighteenth century, have elevated and enshrined it. The meat, they insist, should be cutlets from a tough economical cut, like shin, which benefits from slow cooking. The classic <em>fricandó</em> mushrooms are moixernons, tiny <a id="page_262"/>and earthy and available only in the spring. Taking a cue from Carles Abellan, the inventive Barcelona chef who offers tweaked versions of Catalan classics at his restaurant, Comerç 24, I add rosé wine to the sauce and serve the dish sprinkled with some of the ground toasted hazelnuts that go into the <em>picada</em> (here, one that also includes a touch of chocolate for extra richness and depth). <em>Fricandó</em> is classically served with Spinach with Raisins and Pine Nuts (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_388">page 388</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ ounce dried porcini mushrooms</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup boiling chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound small chanterelles or other delicate wild mushrooms, wiped clean with damp paper towels and chopped if large</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds veal cutlets (⅓ to ¼ inch thick) cut from the shoulder or leg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the veal</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size carrot, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size tomatoes, cut in half and grated on a grater, then skins discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dry but fruity rosé wine, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup hazelnuts, lightly toasted and skinned (<a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon grated bittersweet chocolate</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the dried porcini and the boiling stock in a small heatproof bowl and let soak until softened, 30 minutes. Drain the porcini in a small sieve lined with a coffee filter or cheesecloth, setting aside the soaking liquid. Chop the porcini and set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chanterelles and cook, stirring, until they are lightly browned and release and reabsorb their liquid, 5 to 7 minutes. Season the cooked mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Season the veal generously with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate and lightly dust the veal in the flour. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook the veal cutlets until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side, transferring the browned cutlets to a bowl. When all the cutlets have been browned, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the onion, carrot, garlic, and the chopped porcini to the skillet. Cook until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, increase the heat to high, and cook until the tomatoes are slightly thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes. Add the ½ cup wine and the reserved mushroom soaking liquid and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the skillet to dislodge the brown bits. Add the veal and turn to coat it with the sauce. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the sauce is rich tasting and the meat is extremely tender, about 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> While the veal is cooking, make the <em>picada</em>: Place the hazelnuts in a mini food processor and coarsely grind them. Remove half of the hazelnuts from the food processor and set aside for garnish. Finely grind the remaining hazelnuts. Add the chocolate and the 2 tablespoons parsley and pulse to combine.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> When the veal is done, transfer the cutlets to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add the cooked chanterelle mushrooms to the sauce and cook until warmed through, about 1 minute. If <a id="page_263"/>the sauce seems too thick, add more wine. Stir the <em>picada</em> into the sauce and cook, stirring, over medium-low heat until the chocolate melts and the sauce is rich and flavorful, about 1 minute. Return the veal to the skillet, turn to coat it in the sauce, and cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the veal to a serving dish, pour the sauce on top, and sprinkle the reserved coarsely ground hazelnuts and the parsley over it. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATION:</strong></span> <em>Fricandó</em> is also delicious made with beef: Use ½-inch-thick chuck or round steaks and cook them for about 1½ hours, adding a little extra stock to keep the sauce moist.</p>

<h3 class="h3">VEAL SHANKS WITH BABY TURNIPS AND PEARS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>JARRET DE VEDELLA AMB NAPS I PERES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Veal, turnips, and pears—what could be more Catalan? This deeply delicious dish comes from a small restaurant in Catalonia’s Puigcerdà region (close to the border with Andorra), famous for its ungainly looking but fabulously flavorful pears. In typical Catalan fashion, the dish begins with a <em>sofregit</em> (a <em>sofrito</em>) and ends with a <em>picada</em> of ground hazelnuts that enlivens the sauce. If you love osso buco, you’ll go nuts for this dish (do make sure to scoop out the delicious marrow and spread it on toast). Rather not tackle veal shanks? Try the recipe with a tied four-pound boneless veal or pork shoulder (if you’re using a boneless cut you won’t need quite as much liquid).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 meaty crosscut (osso buco cut) veal shanks (about 1 pound each)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fat carrot, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 can (14½ ounces) tomatoes, drained and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh rosemary sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 fresh thyme sprig</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small cinnamon stick</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 whole baby turnips, or 6 small regular turnips, peeled and halved</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 slightly under-ripe small baby pears, such as Forelle or Seckel</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large pinches of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 hazelnuts, toasted and skinned (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tea biscuit, such as a Maria, or 2 Ritz crackers, broken into pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons medium-dry sherry or brandy</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the veal generously with salt and pepper. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 5-quart flameproof casserole over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Working in two batches, cook the veal shanks until richly browned, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer the browned meat to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_264"/><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the onion and carrot to the casserole and brown, stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the tomatoes are thickened and reduced, about 7 minutes, scraping the bottom of the casserole to dislodge any brown bits. Return the veal to the casserole, add the wine, chicken broth, rosemary and thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick, and bring to a boil, skimming any foam off the surface. Cover the casserole and bake for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> While the veal is baking, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Working in two batches if necessary, cook the turnips and pears, adding 1 pinch of the sugar to each batch and stirring, until nicely browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully remove the casserole from the oven and stir the cooked turnips and pears into the pan juices. Cover the casserole, return it to the oven, and continue baking until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour longer.</p>

Transfer the casserole to the stove top and stir in the <em>picada.</em> Return the veal to the casserole, stir to coat with the sauce, and cook over medium heat until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Let the dish rest, covered, for about 5 minutes. Transfer the veal shanks to a large serving platter, spoon the vegetables, pears, and sauce over them, and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3bro">THE MEATBALLS OF MADRID TAPAS BARS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALBONDIGAS EN SALSA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">These are the robust, saucy meatballs served in small earthenware <em>cazuelas</em> at old Madrid tapas bars and <em>tabernas</em>—the sort of places that transport you to a different era with their long, weathered marble bars, vermouth on tap, and walls plastered with bullfighting photographs. White wine is more commonly used for the sauce, but I prefer red for a more robust color and flavor. The sauce is also delicious served over rice or fried potatoes.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound ground pork (not too lean) or veal</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound ground beef</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup grated onion, plus 1 large onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ teaspoons coarse salt (kosher or sea), plus more for the sauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 gratings of fresh nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size carrot, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 canned peeled tomatoes, drained and chopped, plus ¼ cup of their juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons brandy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dry red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ cups chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the meatballs</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the bread and milk in a small bowl and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain, squeeze out the excess liquid, and finely crumble the bread.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the crumbled bread and the pork, beef, grated onion, eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and parsley in a large bowl. Gently knead the meatball mixture with your hands just until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined; do not overknead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make the sauce, about 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the meatball mixture is chilling, make the sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and carrot and cook until the vegetables are softened and very lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the tomatoes and their juice and the brandy, increase the heat to high, and cook until the liquid is reduced slightly, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the wine and chicken <a id="page_266"/>stock, partially cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are very tender, 30 to 40 minutes. (The sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead up to this point.) Using a slotted spoon, remove about 1 cup of the solids from the sauce and transfer to a blender along with about 1 cup of the liquid. Puree the mixture in pulses until medium-fine. Stir the pureed mixture back into the sauce and add a little more chicken stock if it seem too thick. Keep the sauce warm while you finish making the meatballs.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate. Wet your hands, then break off a piece of the meat-ball mixture and shape it into a ball the size of a large walnut (about 1¼ inches in diameter). Roll the meatball in the flour, shaking off the excess, then gently toss it between cupped hands to give it shape. Repeat with the remaining meatball mixture, placing the floured meatballs on a small baking sheet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat. Add half of the meatballs and brown all over, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned meatballs to a bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and cook the remaining meatballs in the same fashion.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Add about ⅓ cup water to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge the brown bits. Stir this liquid into the sauce. Gently stir the browned meatballs and any accumulated juices into the sauce and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and cook until the meatballs are completely cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the heat and let cool for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley just before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 AS A TAPA, 4 AS A MAIN COURSE OVER RICE OR FRIED POTATOES</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">CATALAN MEATBALLS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALBONDIGAS CON MANZANAS Y SETAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Meatballs, <em>albóndigas,</em> have been elevated to an art form in Spain, served at tapas bars in earthenware <em>cazuelas,</em> passed around at cocktail parties, and enjoyed at home. While I’m pretty addicted to the robust Madrid-style meatballs (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_265">page 265</a>), I’d be the first to admit that the Catalans are the true <em>albóndiga</em> masters. Take these, for example. They are juicy and light, with the veal and pork mixture rendered extra special by <a id="page_267"/>the addition of applesauce, wild mushrooms, and some pancetta for juiciness. They are compulsively edible on their own as a tapa, perhaps with <em>allioli</em> or <em>romesco</em> sauce (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a> or 210) on the side, or finished in the Almond and Saffron Sauce that follows. If you’re serving the meatballs in the sauce, have plenty of crusty bread on hand for mopping it up.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE MEATBALLS:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup finely chopped white onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 very large portobello mushroom (about 4 ounces), wiped clean with a damp paper towel and finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 ounces ground veal</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 ounces ground pork</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 ounces sliced pancetta, minced (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note5">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus chopped parsley for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons coarse salt (kosher or sea), or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the meatballs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Crusty bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE ALMOND AND SAFFRON SAUCE (OPTIONAL):</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup finely chopped white onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Reserved chopped portobello mushroom (see Step 1)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size ripe tomato, cut in half, peeled, and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons medium-sweet sherry, or 1 large pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 slice (about 3 inches round and ½ inch thick), baguette, cubed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 toasted almonds (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_box1">box</a>), coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 2 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_268"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the meatballs: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add 2 cups of the chopped mushroom, reserving the rest for the sauce, if making. If not making the sauce, add all the chopped mushroom here. Cook, stirring, until it releases and reabsorbs some of its liquid, about 5 minutes. Let the mushroom mixture cool.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the bread and milk in a small bowl and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain, squeeze out the excess liquid, and finely crumble the bread.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the crumbled bread and the veal, pork, pancetta, egg, applesauce, parsley, paprika, pepper, salt, and the mushroom mixture in a large bowl. Gently knead the meatball mixture with your hands just until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined; do not overknead.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Spread a thin layer of flour on a large plate. Wet your hands, then break off a piece of the meat-ball mixture and shape it into a 1-inch ball. Dust the meatball in the flour, shaking off any excess, then gently toss it between cupped hands to give it shape. Repeat with the remaining meatball mixture, placing the floured meatballs on a small baking sheet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a very large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat. Add half of the meatballs and brown all over, shaking the skillet so that the meatballs brown evenly. If you plan to serve the meatballs in the sauce, cook them for 3 to 4 minutes. If serving without sauce, cook them until cooked through, about 7 minutes, adjusting the heat so that the meatballs don’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat-balls to a bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet and cook the remaining meat-balls in the same fashion. If serving the meatballs without the sauce, let them cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve with crusty bread. If you are making the sauce, don’t clean out the skillet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Prepare the sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the reserved chopped mushroom and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato and cook, stirring, until it begins to caramelize, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the sherry and wine, increase the heat to high, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock, stir, then stir in the meatballs. Reduce the heat to very low, cover the skillet, and cook for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Meanwhile make the <em>picada:</em> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the bread cubes and cook until they begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and almonds and cook until fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 1½ minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bread, garlic, and nuts to a mini food processor. Add the parsley and saffron and pulse until the mixture is ground.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> Gently stir the <em>picada</em> into the skillet with the sauce. Cook until the sauce is flavorful, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Garnish with additional parsley, if desired, and serve with crusty bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10 AS A TAPA, 4 TO 6 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">TOASTING NUTS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Toasting nuts and seeds brings out their nuttiness and intensifies their flavor. If you’re using nuts often, you can toast them in batches larger than you’ll need for a single recipe and store them in an airtight container. To prevent nuts from turning rancid, I suggest keeping them on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">To skillet-toast almonds, pine nuts, or sesame seeds, heat a medium-size skillet without oil over medium heat (do not use a nonstick skillet for this). Add the nuts and cook them, stirring, until golden and fragrant, about 4 minutes for almonds, two minutes for pine nuts, and slightly less for sesame seeds.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">To toast nuts in the oven (which is preferable for larger amounts), place them in a single layer in a small rimmed baking sheet. Bake in a 350°F oven until they’re golden and fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice. Do not let the nuts burn—start checking after about three minutes.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">To toast and skin hazelnuts, place them in a single layer in a small rimmed baking sheet. Bake them in a 350°F oven until the skins are several shades darker and look blistered, about 10 minutes. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel and let them stand for about 5 minutes. Rub the nuts vigorously in the towel to loosen their skins, then discard the skins (don’t worry if not all the skins come off).</p>

<h3 class="h3bro"><a id="page_269"/>MINTED LAMB MEATBALLS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALBONDIGAS DE CORDERO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The tiny <em>calle</em> Gamazo is my favorite street in Seville. Not for its landmarks, architecture, or shops, but for what has to be the city’s highest concentration of first-rate tapas bars. Each one specializes in something particular, and you can make a full meal by zipping from place to place. The thing to order at Enrique Becerra is a <em>cazuela</em> of these juicy meatballs smothered in a rich tomato sauce. Most Spanish meatball recipes are based on pork or beef, but these taste quite Moorish with their combination of lamb and mint. In my adaptation of the recipe, I add fresh mint to the meatballs and dried to the sauce, as it stands up better to slow simmering.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds lean ground lamb (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08_note6">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup chopped canned tomatoes with some of their juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup dry sherry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons finely crumbled dried mint</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the bread in a bowl, add cold water to cover, and soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and squeeze out the excess liquid, then finely crumble the bread.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the crumbled bread and the lamb, fresh mint, garlic, 1½ teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and the egg in a large bowl. Gently knead the meat-ball mixture with your hands just until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined; do not overknead. Wet your hands, then break off a piece of the meat-ball mixture, shape it into a 1-inch ball, gently tossing it between cupped hands to give it shape. Repeat with the remaining meatball mixture, placing the meatballs on a small baking sheet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a deep, 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the meatballs and brown all over, 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the skillet so that the meatballs brown evenly. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned meatballs to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining meatballs.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> If the meatballs have released too much fat, drain off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons. Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat until soft and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until they are thickened and reduced, about 7 minutes. Add the sherry and the chicken stock and cook to blend the flavors, 6 to 7 minutes. Let the sauce cool a little, then puree it in a food processor.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Return the sauce to the skillet, season it with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in the dried mint. Return the meatballs and any accumulated juices to the skillet and turn to coat with the sauce. Simmer over low heat, partially covered, until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has reduced a little, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the meatballs and sauce to an earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or another rustic serving dish, let cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8 AS A TAPA, 4 AS A MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>
