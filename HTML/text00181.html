 CARDAMOM RICE PUDDING BRÛLÉES WITH MANGO, COCONUT &amp; LIME</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0001524">
<em>Lots of people seem to have bad memories of tepid rice pudding, full of huge uncooked grains of rice and with a dollop of cold jam in the middle. Well, that was my school dinner through and through, and that’s how I thought rice pudding was meant to be. Until I tried the tinned stuff and then I thought, ah, that’s how it’s meant to be. Until I ate my little brother’s jar of baby rice and thought maybe that’s what it was meant to taste like. Until I discovered a third way. My sister and I were at a wedding where they served these delicious tiny cold pots of rice pudding, and after devouring our own we set off around the room to see who might want help with theirs. With those pots in mind, I created this recipe. It’s a smoother rice pudding with a delicate hint of cardamom, set until cold, then topped with sugar and blowtorched for a crisp caramel top. If you don’t like rice pudding, this might change your mind.</em>

 Soak the rice in the water for 1 hour. Transfer the water and rice to a jug, then, using a stick blender, blitz until the rice is ground to tiny pieces.</p>

<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the rice and water mixture into a non-stick pan and turn the heat up to high. Add the cream and the ground cardamom seeds and bring to the boil, stirring continuously over a medium heat until thickened. This should take only 15–20 minutes.</p>

 <em>If you don’t have a blowtorch you can place the ramekins under a grill to caramelise the tops, but be sure to watch them all the time.</em>
