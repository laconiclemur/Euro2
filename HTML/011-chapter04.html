<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">A</span></span><span class="italic">s early as the 14th century, trade, agriculture and strategic geographic placement made Emilia-Romagna one of Italy’s wealthiest regions. For the area’s aristocracy food was status and creativity was encouraged. Pasta became more than a single food; it became the region’s most celebrated first course</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although each region of Italy takes pride in its own special pastas, Emilia-Romagna’s, made solely of flour and egg, are admired throughout the country. For many cooks all over Italy, they set a standard of excellence</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">That excellence was no accident. It was born of wheat, trade and wealth. The region’s fertile Po River plain nourished a particularly soft and fine wheat. When blended with the area’s abundance of eggs, it became a tender pasta, best eaten fresh. Its moderate protein and starch content separated this pasta from its counterpart in southern Italy. There, wheat high in protein and low in starch produced a pasta that dried and stored well. Emilia-Romagna’s wheat yielded pasta too brittle for successful drying and storing. Hence the region’s tradition of fresh pasta began</span>.</p>
<a id="page72"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Pasta in Emilia-Romagna speaks of many things—traditions of birth, marriage and even death; centuries of Christmases, Easters and saints’ days, each celebrated with its special dish. Pasta speaks of geographic origin and even of a family’s social status. Pasta wittily expresses anticlerical sentiments without a word being spoken. It is steeped in legend, sometimes quite sensuous legend at that. And pasta often is so entrenched in tradition that one misstep in its preparation or presentation can outrage the most accommodating diners</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Those traditions have passed from hands to hands, through centuries of daughters watching mothers make pasta. Pasta is the food of women. Until very recently, while a woman in Emilia-Romagna could command accolades for many achievements, making superb pasta headed the list</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Almost every restaurant in the region, no matter how small or simple, has its <span class="underline">sfoglina,</span> a woman who comes in every morning, pours out a mountain of flour onto her work board, blends in eggs, kneads, and then hand-rolls <span class="underline">la sfoglia,</span> the sheet or “leaf” of golden dough. From this she fashions all the pasta served that day. She often creates enough to feed hundreds. If you showed her a food processor or a pasta machine, she would think you were mad</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The sfoglina tradition may be approaching its twilight. For years shops selling handmade pastas have supplemented the efforts of busy home cooks. As elderly sfoglinas retire and fewer young women take their places, those shops are beginning to supply restaurants. Certainly the pasta is still fresh and made by talented craftswomen; nothing less is acceptable in Emilia-Romagna. But with waning interest in the craft among young people, the region’s great culinary heritage is threatened. Handmade pasta could become a curiosity tasted only on holidays</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">To celebrate the past, if not the future, this chapter reflects 500 years of Emilia-Romagna’s pasta making. You will find both classic and modern dishes. But to savor them fully, you need to understand the lively culture they evolved from</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Myth has it that pasta was poor man’s food, implying that for centuries Italian peasants survived on plates of spaghetti. Sadly that was not so in much of Emilia-Romagna. During the all-too-frequent poor harvests and famines, wheat became the exclusive property of the wealthy. The poor could get wheat only when it was abundant. Wheat pastas stretched with ground chestnuts and cornmeal still survive from <a id="page73"/>those times. Polenta and beans, now eaten more out of nostalgia than necessity, were what much of Emilia-Romagna’s peasantry survived on. Pasta was really the food of the affluent until the Industrial Revolution</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Bologna’s first pasta factory was chartered by the city council on November 20, 1586. Shortly after New Year’s Day, 1587, Giovanni dall’Aglio started making “Vermicellos, Lasagnas, Macarones as they are made in Rome, Naples and Venice.”</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Cookbooks of the time document court banquets where pastas with the same names were served. Recipes from those books describe doughs often flavored with rosewater, sugar, saffron and/or butter. Maccheroni “in the style of” Naples or Rome seemed to be especially chic</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Renaissance pastas often accompanied meat dishes. In Italy today, serving pasta as a side dish is culinary heresy. With very few exceptions, pasta is always a separate course. But during the 16th and 17th centuries, filled and ribbon pastas often garnished roasts and stews. Then, most pasta dishes were topped with a blend of sugar, cinnamon, and grated Parmesan-style cheese. Believe it or not, the mixture can be quite delicious, as the chapter on Renaissance pastas proves</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Sugar was a prime status symbol, displayed and used with abandon by the aristocracy. Sweet and savory flavorings were intermixed from the first courses to the last on Medieval and Renaissance menus, and were often combined in pasta fillings. Some of these still survive, like Ferrara’s cappellacci filled with sweet squash and Parmigiano-Reggiano and Parma’s old recipe for pillowlike tortelli filled with spiced fruits and chestnuts. The spirit of sweet/savory dishes lives on in the many elaborate pies of the region, pies that are seen in those magnificent still-life paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries. With their sweet crusts and fillings of savory pastas, sauces and meats, they might have been handed straight out of those old picture frames</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In the 18th century, savory and sweet parted company, with most sugared dishes presented at the end of the meal. By the early 19th century, pasta had its own place on the menu. Marie Louise, the Duchess of Parma and wife of the exiled Napoleon, prized elegant renditions of baked maccheroni cooked in the style of Naples and Spanish Aragon and served in fancy molded shapes</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Another dish favored by Marie Louise was <span class="underline">Tortellini alla Bolognese.</span> This is possibly the most famous and remarkable of Emilia-Romagna’s filled pastas, the centerpiece of Bolognese cuisine. First made to be served <a id="page74"/>in broth, the doughnut shape allows flavorings not only to surround the <span class="underline">tortellino,</span> but also to flow through it for a perfectly even distribution of tastes. The meat and cheese filling needs little embellishment. Good homemade broth or a simple tossing with butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is more than sufficient. Some Bolognese prefer tortellini tossed with their meaty ragù others claim the ragù overwhelms the pasta. But if pasta as a side dish is heresy in Italy, for the Bolognese tortellini salad, so common in the United States, is barbarism</span>.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/74.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption" style="text-indent:0%;">A wreath of tortellini surrounds pig and mortadella in this early 20th-century magazine cartoon of Bologna the Fat.<br/> Il Collectionista, Milan</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although tortellini are eaten in other parts of Italy, Bologna claims them as her own. An old Bolognese legend tells of the days when the gods walked the earth, and Venus and Zeus paused for the night at a small inn near Bologna. The innkeeper was so enchanted by the goddess that just before dawn, he peeked into her bedroom. There she lay on the bed, with sheets tossed aside, sprawled in exquisite disarray. The humble man wondered how he, an illiterate, a mere cook and innkeeper, could pay compliment to such beauty. He went to his kitchen, and shortly after sunrise he emerged with a tribute to the goddess. He had modeled the little tortellino after Venus’s navel. Even now in Bologna, the pasta’s nickname is “sacred navels” <span class="underline">(umbilichi sacri)</span></span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">To this day, Bologna honors outstanding achievement in tortellini making with the Golden Tortellino, the pasta maker’s Oscar. Tortellini are stuffed with a varying blend of sautéed pork, veal, beef, and/or <a id="page75"/>capon, along with prosciutto, mortadella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Their delicacy is easily overpowered by complicated or highly seasoned sauces. One exception is Bologna’s tortellini pie. This holdover from the most baroque era of the Renaissance combines the pasta with an array of sauces and meats, all enclosed in a decorated sweet crust. The result brings alive an extraordinary taste of the past. Grand pies like these are reserved for holidays and special occasions</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The intricacy of the tortellino’s shape and the rich ingredients of its filling suggest the pasta began as court food. Eventually tortellini filtered down the economic scale to the middle class of merchants, land owners and professionals, and finally to the tables of laborers and peasants.  Until roughly 50 years ago, the poor ate tortellini only during holiday celebrations. They usually saw meat (other than pancetta, salt pork and salami) only at Christmas and Easter. Even then, quantities were small, the meat was tough, and it needed long simmering. For these people who had so little, tortellini were a way of stretching limited amounts of precious meat. A half pound of boiled meat fills enough tortellini to feed twelve, and the meat’s broth is a delicious cooking medium for the pastas. The combination must have been more than merely filling and satisfying, it must have tasted of pure luxury</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Some Italian writers claim tortellini existed as far back as the early 10th century, but actual evidence is hard to come by. Cookbooks of the 16th and 17th centuries mention filled pastas called <span class="underline">tortelletti</span> and other variations on the word <span class="underline">torta,</span> which means cake or turnover. But thus for none of the early recipes describe its unusual shape. Tortellini shaped as we know them today were definitely eaten in Bologna by the 1830s. Vincenzo Agnollotti, Marie Louise’s cook, gives a recipe for <span class="underline">tortellini alla Bolognese</span> in his 1834 cookbook. Late-19th-century cookbook author Pellegrino Artusi describes three different tortellini in detail (<span class="underline">“all’ Italiana,” “alla Bolognese,”</span> and a last one stuffed with pigeon) in his <span class="underline">Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well.</span> He even supplies an illustration of the pasta’s actual size: the pasta was cut into discs 1½ inches in diameter before stuffing</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Tortellini’s much larger cousins are called <span class="underline">tortelloni.</span> Traditionally they are meatless, stuffed with ricotta, parsley, Parmesan, egg, and nutmeg. But greater liberties are taken with this filling. Tortelloni lend themselves to imaginative treatments inspired by a cook’s mood and inclination</span>.</p>
<a id="page76"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Mood and inclination combine with strong local tradition to confound anyone set on standardizing pasta in Emilia-Romagna. For the past 2,000 years so much of the region was broken up into separate and ever-changing political entities. Every province, often every town, has its own history and its own renditions of the region’s pastas. Sometimes the name changes while the pasta stays the same. Or the pasta and its filling, shape, or sauce change while the name remains the same. Hopeless but delicious confusion takes hold for anyone trying to decipher all the local subleties</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">For example, tortellini and tortelloni keep their names as you go north to Modena. To the east of Bologna in Ferrara, big tortelloni become <span class="underline">cap</span>p<span class="underline">ellacci</span> (“big hats”), always filled with sweet squash, nutmeg, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">South of Bologna, in Romagna, the same shape becomes <span class="underline">capp</span>e<span class="underline">lletti</span> (“little hats”—even though, confusingly, the pasta may be large or small). The filling changes with location. There are at least four versions of cappelletti between the Romagna towns of Ravenna, Rimini, Forlì and Faenza, a distance of 37 miles. Some are totally meatless; others blend several meats with cheese. Each is supported by strong local tradition. Never tell a Riminese that his meatless cappelletti remind you of Bologna’s meat-filled tortellini. By regional reasoning they are two entirely different pastas</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">No matter what the local variations are, however, making tortellini or cappelletti on Christmas Eve is a rite that has united women from Modena to Rimini for at least 150 years. The ritual begins when the entire family gathers for an afternoon of stretching, filling, and shaping pasta. The finished pastas are then spread on a cloth-covered table where they will rest—as though on an altar, as one chronicler of regional folkways put it. On Christmas afternoon they “die nobly” in capon broth. When the big tureen of tortellini/cappelletti is brought forth from the kitchen, the feast of Christmas officially begins</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Tortellini are not found north of Modena. In Parma rectangular tortelli have some of the significance of Bologna’s tortellini. They can be filled with sweet squash, cabbage, potato, spiced fruit or chestnuts, but <span class="underline">Tortelli d’Erbette,</span> rectangles of pasta stuffed with ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and mild greens, are the most popular</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic"><span class="underline">Anolini</span> are Parma’s other specialty. These small discs or half moons are filled with the braising juices of a beef pot roast cooked up to three <a id="page77"/>days, butter-toasted bread crumbs, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Anolini are always served in broth</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">When anolini move north to neighboring Piacenza, they pass through several mutations. Out on the banks of the Po in Piacenza province, they are stuffed with roast veal, pork and brains, cut with zigzag edges instead of smooth ones, and called by a new name, <span class="underline">marubei</span></span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Reggio adds chicken giblets to Piacenza’s filling and calls the same disc shape <span class="underline">cap</span>p<span class="underline">elletti</span>. These look nothing like Romagna’s cappelletti, but they too have always been holiday food. An old saying indicates how special meat-filled pastas were: “Making love and cappelletti are the paradise of the poor.” Along Reggio’s Po embankment paradise includes a little local Lambrusco added to a deep soup plate before the hot broth and cappelletti are ladled in. The dish now tastes like an entire meal</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Strozzapreti look like thick, twisted tagliatelle. They were first made in Romagna long ago, when the village priest always ate for free at the local trattorie. A thick, heavy pasta was served to fill him up so he could not devour too much of the next course, which was a far more expensive commodity—meat. <span class="underline">Strozza</span>p<span class="underline">reti</span> translates as “priest stranglers.” They have different dialect names and slightly different shapes all the way from Romagna down to southern Italy</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic"><span class="underline">Gram</span>i<span class="underline">gna</span> (“little weeds”) are small wiry cords of pasta with a narrow hole running through them. The process of making them by pressing dough through a hand-operated extruder has not changed in 200 years. Braised sausage is the traditional accompaniment</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">It has been said that garganelli makes slaves of women. The first time I made them, I understood why. An egg pasta flavored with Parmigiano-Reggiano and nutmeg is cut into small squares. Each square is shaped into a ribbed hollow tube with points at either end by rolling two opposing corners of the square over each other around a dowel. The ribs are pressed into the dough by rolling the dowel over a small grooved board. The result resembles a ribbed quill (p<span class="underline">enne</span>) pasta. Garganelli are delicious, but imagine a woman rolling one or two at a time when hundreds are needed for family dinner!</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Garganelli owe their creation to hemp. They were first made near Castel Bolognese, about 25 miles south of Bologna, and are rarely eaten much farther south. Hemp flourished on that particular part of the Po plain, and every house had its hemp loom. Originally, the ribs were pressed into garganelli by rolling the pasta over the loom’s comb</span>.</p>
<a id="page78"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Modena, to the north, had hemp too. There garganelli are called <span class="underline">maccheroni al pettine</span> (“maccheroni of the comb”). Sometimes the comb was replaced by a little square frame with rough hemp cording stretched across it. Today small plastic washboards are sold to achieve the same result</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic"><span class="underline">Stricchettoni</span> are rectangles of pasta pinched in the center to make bows. Like garganelli, they are made with egg, nutmeg, and Parmigiano-Reggiano, along with pepper, and in some parts of Romagna, lemon zest. Near Modena parsley is used instead</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In Romagna stringhetti are made the same way, with the addition of lemon zest, and are cut on the diagonal before pinching</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although not native to the region, <span class="underline">s</span>p<span class="underline">aghetti</span> are well liked in Romagna. The people of Emilia rarely eat them. The pasta will always be purchased dried and boxed, made only with durum wheat and water</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although maccheroni (today defined as dried commercial pasta made of flour and water, often in hollow shapes) have never approached the popularity of fresh egg pasta, they have been used in the region since at least the 16th century</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic"><span class="underline">Ta</span>g<span class="underline">liatelle</span> are cut into long ribbonlike strips from rolled and thinned sheets of dough. They are one of the few pastas that retain the same name throughout the region. This golden egg pasta was supposedly first created in the 16th century by Bolognese cook Maestro Zefiramo, who was inspired by Lucrezia Borgia’s blond tresses. The infamous beauty was entertained in Bologna to honor her marriage into Ferrara’s illustrious Este family. The most versatile of pastas, tagliatelle (from <span class="underline">ta</span>g<span class="underline">liare,</span> to cut) are the traditional partner to meat ragùs. One of the earliest mentions. I have found of them is in 1557, but no doubt they existed before then. When sheets of egg pasta are cut very thin they become <span class="underline">ta</span>g<span class="underline">liarini,</span> <span class="underline">ta</span>g<span class="underline">lioline</span> and other diminutives of <span class="underline">ta</span>g<span class="underline">liare</span></span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In the early 1970s, Bologna’s chapter of Italy’s gastronomic society, the Italian Academy of the Kitchen (Accademia Italiana della Cucina), attempted to define and standardize tagliatelle’s dimensions. No two cooks cut them the same size, and Italy’s pasta manufacturers have sidestepped standardization of shapes for centuries. After much research and debate, the Academy declared to the world that tagliatelle are 8 mm wide and .6 mm thick (<sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch wide and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub> inch thick). To ensure that there could be no doubt about its proper measurements, the official <a id="page79"/>tagliatelle was cast in solid gold. On April 16, 1972, pasta’s “golden rule” was given a place of honor in Bologna’s city hall</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">But this is only half the story. Eight millimeters wide is the easy expression of the real measurement. Bologna’s symbol to the world is her two leaning Medieval towers. Out of respect for the early origins of the tagliatelle, its true measure is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12,270</sub> the height of the tallest of the two towers, La Torre degli Asinelli</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Exacting measurements or no, pasta in Emilia-Romagna is pure pleasure. I can think of no more enticing way of sharing the region’s culinary heritage than by inviting you to enjoy these recipes</span>.</p>

<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">M<span class="italic">aking pasta by hand is simplicity itself—blend flour with eggs, knead the dough, stretch it or roll it into thin sheets, and then cut it into any shape you want. Pasta is also the most forgiving of doughs. You can easily correct most problems that arise as you go along</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The mystique of fresh pasta has been exaggerated to the point that many cooks feel it must be made at the very last moment. Pasta is far better made an hour or more ahead, as it settles and collects itself with standing, resulting in a better texture</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In Emilia-Romagna pasta is often made in the morning, to be eaten later in the day. I prefer using filled pastas the same day they are made, but when pressed I have found that refrigerating them for 12 to 24 hours did no harm, except with very moist fillings that can make the pasta gummy. Unfilled pastas taste freshest when eaten within 6 to 8 hours of being rolled and cut, but are still delicious and light after drying for a week at room temperature</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Light, delicate pasta comes from working the dough as much as possible to develop the elasticity of the flour’s protein, or gluten. Kneading and then gradually rolling, stretching, and thinning the dough lengthens the gluten strands, producing tender and resilient pasta. Shortcutting the process results in heavy noodles. There is nothing difficult here, but like any craft the pleasure of achievement comes from learning a few basics and then practicing. Take time to work the dough well and it will pay you back tenfold in dining pleasure.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Measuring the Flour:</span> Weighing flour on a scale is easier and more accurate than measuring by cups. Pour the flour onto the scale and you are done. If your scale is too small to neatly hold all the flour, set a medium-size paper bag on it and pour flour into the bag. There is no mess, and the bag can be used again and again.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If measuring flour by the cup is the only method available, keep in mind the following: Spoon it from the flour sack into your measuring cup and then level with the flat side of a knife blade. Resist the temptation to tamp or tap the cup before you level. A leveled cup of untamped flour weighs 4 ounces, the measure used in these recipes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">On wet and humid days a little more flour may be needed; on dry days a little less. Judge this by the feel of the dough: it should be pliable, elastic, and not too stiff.</p>
<a id="page83"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">It is better to err on the side of too much liquid than too much flour. Kneading extra flour into an overly moistened dough is much easier than working in more liquid. If you think your flour is particularly dry because of the climate or time of year, add an additional tablespoon or two of beaten egg</span>.</p>

In Italy, pasta makers use one about 35 inches long and 2 inches thick. The shorter American-style pin with handles at either end can be used, but the longer it is, the easier it is to roll the pasta. Long dowel pins and long American-style rolling pins can be found or ordered at kitchenware shops.</p>

<p class="para1" style="text-indent: 5%;"><img alt="image" src="Images/dia.jpg"/> <span class="italic">Plastic wrap</span> to wrap the resting dough and to cover rolled-out pasta waiting to be filled. It protects the pasta from drying out too quickly.</p>

Ribbon or filled pastas can be spread on <span class="italic">large flat baskets</span> (inexpensive, and usually sold as cheese servers) that have been covered with a single layer of kitchen towel. The porosity of the basket and cloth helps the pasta dry evenly and protects pastas with moist fillings from becoming gummy.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Mixing the Dough:</span> Mound the flour in the center of your work surface. Make a well in the middle. Add the eggs, along with any liquids and flavorings. Using a wooden spoon, beat together the eggs and any flavorings. Then gradually start incorporating shallow scrapings of flour from the sides of the well into the liquid. As you work more and more flour into the liquid, the well’s sides may collapse. Use a pastry scraper to keep the liquids from running off and to incorporate the last bits of flour into the dough. Do not worry if it looks like a hopelessly rough and messy lump.</p>
<a id="page84"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Kneading:</span> With the aid of the scraper to scoop up unruly pieces, start kneading the dough. Once it becomes a cohesive mass, use the scraper to remove any bits of hard flour on the work surface—these will make the dough lumpy. Then knead the dough about 3 minutes. Its consistency should be elastic and a little sticky. If it is too sticky to move easily, knead in a few more tablespoons of flour. Continue kneading 10 minutes, or until the dough has become satiny, smooth, and very elastic. It will feel alive under your hands. Do not shortcut this step. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and let it relax at room temperature 30 minutes to 3 hours (when I am rushed I skip this step, with no ill effect on the pasta).</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Stretching and Thinning:</span> If using an extra-long rolling pin work with half the dough at a time. With a regular-length rolling pin, roll out a quarter of the dough at a time. Keep the rest of the dough wrapped. Lightly sprinkle a large work surface with flour. The idea is to stretch the dough rather than press down and push it. Shape it into a ball and begin rolling out to form a circle, frequently turning the disc of dough a quarter turn. As it thins out, start rolling the disc back on the pin a quarter of the way toward the center and stretching it gently sideways by running the palms of your hands over the rolled-up dough from the center of the pin outward. Unroll, turn the disc a quarter turn, and repeat. Do twice more.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Stretch and even out the center of the disc by rolling the dough a quarter of the way back on the pin. Then gently push the rolling pin away from you with one hand while holding the dough sheet in place on the work surface with the other hand. Repeat three more times, turning the dough a quarter turn each time.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Repeat the two processes as the disc becomes larger and thinner. (If you make pasta frequently, your body will develop a rhythm with the dough. You’ll find that your instincts will take over, with your hands and the pasta leading the way while your mind is freed for relaxation. It is a calming experience, and for some as soothing as meditation.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The goal is a sheet of even thickness. For lasagne and filled pastas such as tortellini, anolini, and Tortelli of Cabbage and Potato the sheet should be so thin that you can clearly see your hand through it and can see colors, for instance a bright photograph. For tagliatelle, tagliarini, and other flat ribbon pastas, the dough can be a little thicker. Do not take too long in thinning and stretching as the dough starts drying out. Too-dry dough stiffens, stretches poorly, becomes lumpy, and cooks unevenly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cutting:</span> Once the dough destined for tagliatelle or other ribbon-style pastas reaches its desired thickness, spread it out on a flat surface and dry 20 minutes, or until leathery in texture (turn it over several times to encourage even drying). To cut, roll up the pasta jelly roll fashion and slice it to the desired width. For special shapes, see Pastas. Instructions for filled pastas can be found in their respective recipes.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Reliable Old Formula: An “Egg of Pasta”</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Many old regional recipes simply refer to so many “eggs of pasta,” meaning 1 egg and the flour it absorbs, enough for a very generous serving of ribbon pasta. The most commonly used formula is 100 grams, or 3½ ounces (¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons), flour per egg. Of course this varies slightly with the flour’s moisture, the climate, the size of the egg, and its absorption capabilities.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">I use 1 jumbo egg, instead of the more usual “large,” per 3½ ounces of flour. This moister dough builds up greater elasticity, making lighter pasta. One “egg” of my dough makes 1½ to 2 servings of ribbon pasta and much more of filled ones.</p>
<hr/></div>
<div class="pb"/><br/>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Working with Machines</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Using a food processor to mix the dough and a pasta machine to thin and stretch it shortens the work time by about 30 percent. I am referring to the type of pasta machine, made of stainless steel, that has two parallel rollers with adjustable settings for thinning the dough, a hand crank (that can be fitted with an electric attachment if desired), and cutters for making wide or thin pastas.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It is true that the pebbly texture of hand-rolled pasta combines beautifully with sauces. For example, a juicy ragù melts into and joins with hand-rolled tagliatelle but slips off the slicker surface of machine-thinned noodles. Pasta purists in Emilia-Romagna consider it heresy to use a machine for stretching and thinning. But my goal is to coax you into making fresh pasta. If you find rolling by hand tedious or daunting, by all means use the pasta machine.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Note:</span> Please do not use machines that take the dough ingredients in at one end, blend them, and then extrude finished pasta out the other end. The dough is rarely worked enough to form light, supple pasta.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Equipment:</span> You will need the same tools as outlined in Working by Hand, with the exception of the blending implements and the rolling pin. In selecting a pasta machine, look for a sturdy one whose narrowest setting produces a very sheer pasta. Some machines’ thinnest settings still yield pasta that is too thick (Atlas brand is one). Two brands I have had success with are Altea and Imperia.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">More pasta can be thinned at one time in a pasta machine equipped with extra-wide rollers. These machines are expensive and often must be ordered through commercial kitchenware suppliers. But if you make pasta often and want to cut work time, the wider rollers are handy to have.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Mixing the Dough in a Food Processor:</span> Make sure the ingredients are cool, because a processor can overheat the eggs and the flour. Place the liquids and any <a id="page86"/>seasonings in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. With the machine running, add the flour through the feed tube. Process until the dough forms a ball on the blade. It should be a bit sticky. (If it is too sticky, break it up into small clumps, sprinkle it with flour, and process again.) Now process 30 seconds, wait about 1 minute so the dough can cool, and process another 30 seconds. Remove the dough from the processor and knead it by hand a few moments to check the consistency. It should be satiny, smooth, and very elastic. At this point the dough can be stretched and thinned immediately, or covered in plastic wrap and left at room temperature up to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Stretching and Thinning with a Pasta Machine:</span> Work with a quarter of the dough at a time, keeping the rest wrapped. Lightly flour the machine rollers and the work surface around the machine. Set the rollers at the widest setting. Flatten the dough into a thick patty. Guide it through the rollers by inserting one end into the space between the two rollers. Turn the crank handle with one hand while holding the upturned palm of your other hand under the sheet emerging from the rollers. Keep your palm flat to protect the dough from punctures by your fingers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As the emerging sheet lengthens, guide it away from the machine with your palm. Pass the dough through the rollers five to six times, folding it in thirds each time. Then set the rollers at the next, narrower setting and pass the dough through three times, folding it in half each time. Repeat, passing it through three times at each successively narrower setting. Repeated stretching and thinning builds up elasticity making especially light pasta. If the sheet becomes too long to handle comfortably, cut it in half or thirds and work the pieces in tandem.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Don’t worry if at first the dough tears, has holes, is lumpy, or is very moist. Just lightly flour it by pulling the dough over the floured work surface. (Take care not to overdo the flouring, or the dough may get too stiff.) As you keep putting it through the rollers, it will be transformed from slightly lumpy and possibly torn to a smooth, satiny sheet with fine elasticity.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">How Thin?:</span> Different machines have different numbers of settings. Tagliatelle and ribbon pastas should be a bit thicker than lasagne and pastas for fillings. Usually the thinnest setting on a machine will be thin enough for you to see color and shape through it; this is perfect for lasagne and filled pastas. If it is so thin that the dough tears easily, however, stop at the next to last setting. The setting above the one for filled pastas is fine for tagliatelle and tagliarini.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">For each recipe of fresh pasta or pound of dried boxed pasta, you will need 6 to 8 quarts of boiling water seasoned with about 2 tablespoons salt (if salt is a health concern, omit it). Make sure the water is bubbling fiercely. Drop in the pasta and boil, stirring frequently, about 30 seconds to 2 minutes for fresh pastas and anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes for dried boxed examples. Taste for doneness. Perfectly cooked pasta is called <span class="italic">al dente</span>, meaning “to the tooth,” or still a little firm to the bite—never soft and mushy.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Once the pasta is done, drain it immediately in a large colander. Toss to rid it of excess liquid, and then blend with the sauce. Pasta, other than lasagne or others destined for baking, should never be rinsed, nor should it be partially or fully cooked ahead.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Oil in the Water?:</span> Adding oil to the water does not protect large pastas from breaking or sticking. Rather than clinging to the pasta and making it slippery so pieces slide past each other, the oil remains on the boiling water’s surface. The best way to protect delicate pastas from breaking or big ones from sticking is to cook them in generous amounts of water, about 6 quarts per 8 ounces. Individual recipes provide specific cooking instructions.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Serving Pasta</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Emilia-Romagna today pasta is always a course unto itself, never a side dish. Even at its simplest, its texture and flavor are too complex for pairing with another dish. Whether you decide on pasta as a first course, as is traditional in Italy, or as a main dish, which is often done there as a light lunch or supper, let it stand on its own. Celebrate the pure pleasure of eating pasta with these simple guidelines:</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">First and foremost, pasta must be hot, so heat the dishes. The pasta will keep hot longer in shallow soup dishes than on flat plates. That traditional soup dish also makes eating the often singleminded noodles easier. Ribbon or string pastas are twirled, a few strands at a time, on the fork into neat bite-size bundles. Bracing the fork against the side of a soup dish instead of on a flat plate makes for neater dining and more elegant twirling.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If you are serving more than one pasta (as is so often done in Emilia-Romagna), offer them one after another in separate plates. Restaurants’ penchant for serving three or more pastas in tiny portions on the same plate is dining overkill. Textures and flavors become a meaningless blur.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A succession of small portions of pasta presented at a leisurely pace lets you savor each one to the full. And the cook need not be imitating an acrobatic act in the kitchen in an attempt to get several pastas out at once. Decide on the order by going from simple to complex and light to robust. For instance, start with small bowls of <a id="page92"/>garganelli in Poultry/Meat Stock, then Tagliarini with Fresh Figs Franco Rossi, and finish with small portions of Pappardelle with Game Ragù.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Buying Pasta</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although logic says store-bought fresh pasta (or pasta made locally and dried) should be next best to homemade, often it is not. Do some trial tasting of fresh pastas available in your area. You may find, as I have, that some are good, but many disappoint. Doughs are often insufficiently kneaded and the stretching is done with such speed that the pasta never develops body and spring. Fresh extruded pastas like spaghetti and linguine are often heavy, as most machines in stores seem unable to work the dough with enough time and vigor to fully develop the gluten. When buying ready-made filled pastas, the dough should be sheer enough to detect the filling inside, and fillings should be delicious.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Boxed dried pasta from Italy is often preferable to commercially made fresh noodles. In Italy, dried commercial pasta and fresh pasta are not compared as better or worse, they are simply different. Having high-quality dried pasta on the pantry shelf ensures good eating when there is no time to make fresh.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The finest dried pastas are made from durum wheat (semolina is ground durum). Durum in the pasta is not the whole story, however. High-quality durum makes a springy, lively pasta, but low-quality durum produces a slack noodle.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The roughened surfaces of many dried commercial Italian pastas help hold the sauce, a characteristic much admired. When eating a good pasta, the noodle is lively and resilient in the mouth, with no sense of starchiness or heaviness. The best examples exude a wheaten flavor and are fragrant while cooking.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Flour-and-water commercial pastas are usually associated with southern Italy, while egg-and-flour pastas more strongly suggest the north. Emilia-Romagna’s dried commercial pastas are made solely with durum flour and egg.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Several excellent brands come to America from the region and can be found in specialty food stores or ordered by mail. Barilla of Parma is one of Italy’s largest manufacturers, making a wide range of shapes in a resilient, flavorful pasta. Dallari makes rough-textured, very thin, light tagliatelle, lasagne, and linguine (which, in this case, is really a tagliarini). Fini and Armando Scapinelli &amp; Figli are two Modena companies creating pastas a bit bolder in substance, pebbly in texture, and with excellent “spring.” Although not from Emilia-Romagna, Delverde, Rusticella, Cara Nonna, and De Cecco are all good pastas. More exports should be available as our country’s interest in all things Italian keeps burgeoning. Sample new brands as you discover them to decide which are the most satisfying.</p>

<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">T<span class="italic">he people of Parma have been eating their famous ham with homemade pasta and the local sweet butter for centuries. Lightening this classic combination by substituting reduced stock and a little wine for most of the butter brings out the prosciutto’s deep meaty taste. Its natural sweetness is enhanced by whisking a little unsalted butter into the sauce at the last moment. Here butter becomes a flavoring rather than a cooking medium, with fine results</span>.</p>

</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Sauce:</span> Trim the white fat from the edges of the prosciutto slices; chop and reserve the fat. Cut the meat into bite-size squares (do not stack the slices to cut them, as they’ll stick together), and set aside. In a large heavy skillet set over medium heat, swirl the 2 tablespoons of butter until melted and bubbly. Add the chopped prosciutto fat and the onions. Sauté the onions 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat, or until the onions are a deep golden brown. Stir often with a wooden spatula. Stir in half the prosciutto and cook 1 minute. Add the wine and simmer, uncovered, 3 minutes, or until it has totally evaporated, scraping up the brown glaze from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in the stock and heat to bubbling. Remove the pan from the heat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta and Finishing the Sauce:</span> Warm a serving bowl and shallow soup dishes in a low oven. Bring the salted water to a boil. Drop in the pasta and <a id="page95"/>cook until tender but it still has some bite. Taste for doneness. Fresh pasta will cook in 30 seconds or more. Dried pasta takes up to 8 minutes or so. Turn the pasta into a large colander, and drain. Once the pasta is draining, quickly reheat the sauce to bubbling. Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter until creamy but not fully melted (30 to 45 seconds). Add the pasta to the skillet, tossing over medium heat until thoroughly coated with sauce. Blend in the remaining prosciutto, season with pepper (salt should not be necessary), and immediately turn into the heated serving bowl. Serve, passing the cheese with the pasta.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span>   Wine:</span> In Parma only one wine is sipped with prosciutto: fresh white Colli di Parma Malvasia Secco from Parma’s hills. It is low in alcohol, with some fizz, lots of fruit, and a hint of sweetness. The wine rarely leaves Parma province, and no doubt would prove too fragile to cross an ocean. Drink it there and enjoy. In the United States pair this dish with a nutty white with enough substance to back the onion sauté and stock reduction. Try a Pinot Bianco or Chardonnay from the Trentino—Alto Adige or Friuli regions.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> Serve before Pan-Roasted Quail, Balsamic and Basil Veal Scallops, or any roasted or grilled meat or poultry dish not made with prosciutto.

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">I wish I had a nickel for every pound of fresh tagliatelle made in Bologna to go with Ragù Bolognese. Although ragùs are eaten with maccheroni, pappardelle, garganelli, and lasagne, tagliatelle is its most popular partner. These ribbons of egg pasta are just the right width to hold the nubbins of meat and vegetable, absorb the ragù’s juices, yet not be overwhelmed by it. In the mouth, tagliatelle and ragù taste right together; they occupy equal space on the palate and blend perfectly. Chunkier sauces often balance better with bigger maccheroni or pappardelle, and in other parts of Emilia-Romagna such choices are not questioned. But when dining in the style of Bologna, where tagliatelle was first created, only this pasta will do.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan (the bigger the better, as the radicchio needs plenty of room), and cook the pancetta over medium to low heat. Stir occasionally, and adjust the heat so the pancetta slowly gives off its fat while barely browning. After about 10 minutes the pancetta will be tinged with gold and almost transparent. Turn the heat to high. Add the onion and radicchio (except the reserved portion), and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the radicchio has wilted and a dark brown glaze has formed on the bottom of the pan. Stir in the garlic and basil, and cook a few seconds. Keep the heat high and add the stock or meat essences.

Add the onions and a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. Stir them to lightly coat with the oil, then cover the pan, and lower the heat to the lowest possible setting. Cook 25 to 30 minutes, or until the onions are soft and almost transparent. Once the onions’ natural sweetness has been accentuated by slow cooking, you can bring out their rich, savory side with browning. Uncover and raise the heat to medium-high or high. Sauté the onions to deep golden brown, stirring often with a wooden spatula and scraping up the brown glaze collecting on the bottom of the pan. Take care not to let the glaze burn. If necessary, lower the heat slightly. Onions will resemble a thick, amber marmalade.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To finish the sauce, reheat the onion mixture over medium-high to high heat and add the cream. Stir until the cream begins to bubble. Before going to the next step, have the cooked pasta draining and hot. Warm soup dishes and a serving bowl. Stir the prosciutto, parsley, scallions, and herbs into the sauce. Cook only long enough to heat through—the fresh, uncooked taste of the herbs is important here. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and then quickly toss the sauce with the pasta and about <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup of the cheese.

Offer as a first course before Lamb with Black Olives, Mardi Gras Chicken, or Rabbit Roasted with Sweet Fennel.</p>

The trick is not overcooking the figs. You must be cooking and draining the pasta just as the sauce is ready to be blended with it.

</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta:</span> Bring the salted water to a fierce boil. If you are using dried pasta, cook it about halfway, 4 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat. If you are using fresh pasta, drop it into the water once the butter has melted.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Sauce:</span> Just before starting to cook the sauce, taste the pasta for doneness. If you feel it might be ready within a few moments, keep your eye on it and wait to cook the figs. Better to have the pasta draining a few extra minutes than to have overcooked, mushy figs.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In Italian this sauce is <span class="italic">bagnabrusca</span>, meaning tart marinade or seasoning. Dating back to the Middle Ages, the sauce came to Ferrara and Modena with Jews who were fleeing persecution in other parts of Italy and in Spain. They sought the protection of the Este dukes, who had petitioned the Pope, requesting freedom for the Jews living in their duchy. Eventually Ferrara’s Jewish community became one of the largest in northern Italy, bringing a wealth of new dishes to Emilia-Romagna and changing the face of Ferrara’s cooking. Proof of the recipe’s Medieval origins is found in old renditions requiring not tomatoes but <span class="italic">agresto</span> (the juice of unripe grapes), a favorite seasoning of the Middle Ages. Then <span class="italic">bagnabrusca</span> was spooned over poached meats and seafood rather than pasta. Try it today over poached or baked bluefish, mullet, or cod and over grilled chicken and lamb.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Garganelli originated on Romagna’s plain. Most homes had a hemp loom for working the coarse fiber that flourished in the thick clay soil north of Cesena. Around Castel Bolognese and neighboring Imola, women used the loom for hemp, and the loom comb, or little plaques of hemp woven on a frame, to fashion garganelli. They made the hollow ribbed pasta by rolling small squares of pasta around a dowel and over the comb or woven hemp plaque at the same time.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">I think about those women’s hands, coarsened and thickened over years of working with the wiry hemp, that then shaped such delicate pastas. Now the looms are all but gone. But the combs remain, and today regional women gather to gossip, laugh, and make great piles of garganelli for special occasions.</p>

The exception is when substituting pieces of pappardelle for the handmade bow tie pasta sometimes used in this dish. Commercial bow tie pasta is too heavy to properly balance with the lentils, whereas 2- to 3-inch lengths of pappardelle work well.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Is It in the Pasta?</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Tallying the musical talent that has come out of Emilia-Romagna in just the last two centuries could easily have you speculating over whether there may be some secret ingredient in the pasta. Parma has been especially gifted. Its opera house is said to be one of the most challenging in Italy. Arturo Toscanini, the fiery and perfectionistic conductor, was born in Parma. Soprano Renata Tebaldi did not have the good luck of being born in the region, but she did have the good sense to begin her musical training in Parma. Most famous is composer Giuseppe Verdi, born on the Parma plain in 1813 in the tiny village of Roncole, near Busseto. Strongly linked with Italy’s unification movement, Verdi created his name from the initials of the freedom movement’s hoped-for king, Vittorio Emmanuele, Re d’Italia. In his later life Verdi settled near Busseto, at his beloved farm estate of Sant’Agata. With him was another musicial great, the diva Giuseppina Strepponi. You can still feel the power of Verdi’s charisma in Busseto, where even the butcher shop has a corner devoted to the composer. Yet another native son, tenor Carlo Bergonzi, runs Busseto’s Il Due Foscari, the hotel named for a Verdi opera.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Composer Gioacchino Rossini began life in the neighboring Marche region during 1792, but he studied and lived in Bologna for many years. There, while writing comic operas, he nurtured a passion for Emilia-Romagna’s foods. When he moved to Paris, Rossini’s longings constantly surfaced in his prolific correspondence with Italian friends. He spoke of the tranquility induced by balsamic vinegar, the succulence of zampone and the rest of Emilia-Romagna’s <span class="italic">salume</span>, and how the French knew nothing of making pasta. Of course, good food and Luciano Pavarotti are synonymous. In his beloved hometown of Modena, the singer’s passion for local dishes is as much admired as his voice. One afternoon a neighborhood <span class="italic">salumeria</span> became the site of an impromptu opera history lesson as shoppers discussed Pavarotti’s career. Critiquing twenty years of performances drove one woman to dash out for her cassette player. Clicking on a recent Pavarotti recording, she defied anyone to prove his voice was not richer than ever. The response was the silence of ardent listening. That same recording featured another Modenese, soprano Mirella Freni. She and Pavarotti share years of friendship and of performing together throughout the world.</p>

</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing and Cooking the Clams:</span> Purge the clams of sand by first scrubbing them with a stiff brush under cold running water. Then put them in a large glass or <a id="page125"/>stainless steel bowl, cover them with the cold water, and sprinkle with the salt and cornmeal. Refrigerate about 1 hour. Drain the clams and arrange them in a single layer in a large skillet. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil, and cook over medium heat 5 minutes, or until they open (discard any that do not open). Saving the pan liquid, remove the meat from the clams and set it aside in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Strain the cooking liquid into a saucepan through a sieve lined with paper towels. Boil down 2 minutes, or until reduced by half (do not worry if the quantity is small). Reserve the clam meat and reduced liquor separately in covered glass or stainless steel bowls. Refrigerate if holding more than an hour or so.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Braising the Squid:</span> In a medium-size skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and parsley, and sauté until the onion begins to color. Turn the heat to high, add the squid, and toss for 1 minute. Then stir in the garlic, the pepper, and half of the basil. Cook a few seconds. Add the wine and boil down to almost nothing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Turn the mixture into a 3- to 4-quart saucepan. Add ¼ cup of the stock and all the tomatoes. Partially cover, bring to a very slow bubble, and cook 1 hour, or until the squid is tender and the sauce is rich in flavor. Keep the pan partially covered and stir occasionally, checking for sticking. If you are working ahead, let the mixture cool, then refrigerate in a covered glass or stainless steel container.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta and Finishing the Sauce:</span> Have a serving bowl and shallow soup dishes warming in a low oven. When you are ready to serve, bring the salted water to a vigorous boil. Drop in the pasta. Blend the reserved clam liquor and the remaining ¼ cup stock into the squid, cover tightly, and simmer very slowly while you cook the pasta. Fresh “Priest Stranglers” take about 4 minutes to cook, while dried spaghetti needs 7 to 9 minutes. Test the pasta for doneness. It should be tender but still a little firm to the bite. Drain in a colander. Add the remaining basil and the reserved clams to the sauce. Turn the drained pasta back into its pot, pour in the sauce, and toss. Taste for seasoning; add enough pepper to make the sauce piquant. Serve at once in the heated bowl and soup dishes, garnishing the pasta with sprigs of basil.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In the days before hollow pastas were extruded by forcing dough through a pierced plate, as they are now, making tubes of maccheroni was a tedious business. Renaissance chronicles tell of cooks wrapping pasta doughs around iron dowels, sealing them, and then cutting the long hollow tubes into stubby pieces. After pulling the dowel out, the pasta was left to dry. Imagine heaps of maccheroni drying in Renaissance castle kitchens throughout Emilia-Romagna, and hundreds of hands endlessly rolling and sealing sheets of dough to form a kind of pasta that today we think of as labor-saving. In those times the dough might have been flavored with rosewater, saffron, sugar, or even butter, like the Rosewater Maccheroni Romanesca found in The Sweet Pastas of the Renaissance. The Renaissance passed, but making maccheroni by hand continued, especially in southern Italy. Maccheroni traditions are part of local lore, with shapes and names changing from one town to the next. In those settings—usually rural—old-time cooks are often insulted by a box of pasta. They continue winding thick strands of pasta around rods for corkscrews of <span class="italic">fusilli;</span> wrapping dowels in dough for all sorts of hollow pastas; and dimpling pea-size lumps of dough to produce discs of <span class="italic">orecchiette</span>, or “little ears.”</p>

Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook 8 minutes, or <a id="page131"/>until the anchovies break down and dissolve into the onions. Stir frequently. Once the anchovies are done, turn off the heat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta and Assembling the Dish:</span> Slip a serving bowl and shallow soup dishes into a warm oven to heat up. Bring the salted water to a fierce boil. Drop in the spaghetti and stir to keep it from sticking. Cook at a full boil 7 to 8 minutes, or until tender but pleasingly firm to the bite. Just before draining, add about ¾ cup pasta water to the sauce. Drain the cooked pasta in a colander. As it is draining, quickly turn the heat to high under the sauce. When the sauce comes to a boil, scrape up the brown glaze from the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spatula. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss over medium heat until it is coated with the sauce. Season generously with black pepper. Turn into the warmed serving bowl, sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and serve right away.</p>
