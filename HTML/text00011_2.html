 tramezzini</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">snacks</h2>
<p class="parab1">Everyone snacks in Italy. Known as <em>merende</em>
 in my day, snacks are part of the fabric of life. Many people only drink a small black coffee before leaving the house in the morning but then stop in a bar on their way to work and buy a croissant or a sandwich. Mid-morning and mid-afternoon, they like to have a little something, quite apart from lunch. There have been <em>rosticcerie</em>
 – shops dedicated to snacks – in Italy for as long as I can remember, and certainly long before fast food became a way of life in Britain and the USA. <em>Rosticcerie</em>
 fall half-way between a restaurant and a coffee bar and sell a whole assortment of delicious nibbles: little pizzas, salami, potato and mozzarella croquettes, endless freshly made sandwiches, hot sausages and roast quail, all ready to eat.</p>
<p class="parab1">The Italian equivalent of the kebab is a million times more delicious. We love <em>porchetta</em>
 , or spit-roast suckling pig, which is sold from specialist shops and stalls. The succulent slices of pork are served on hunks of rustic bread all over Italy.</p>
<p class="parab1">All the towns and villages around Minori had a feast day for their patron saint. It was a great excuse to travel all over the region and sample local delicacies. Because there were so many villages scattered over the mountains, there was sure to be a feast day within a few kilometres every weekend during the summer. Local farmers would bring their produce to sell, housewives prepared the village speciality to serve to visitors, and local shops put on their best displays of gastronomic delights. I would meet up with a gang of friends and we would visit as many as we could reach. We called them <em>merende</em>
 days because we set out to try as many different delicacies as we could find.</p>

 spiedini aromatici di mozzarella e acciughe</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">mozzarella and anchovy skewers</h3>
<p class="para1">This is a very tasty snack using stale bread, mozzarella and anchovies. The hot bread is nice and crisp and the anchovies add a tangy taste, making these snacks ideal to serve with pre-dinner drinks.</p>
<p class="para1">Use the cheaper mozzarella, such as <em>fior di latte</em>
 , which is ideal for cooking and melting. There is no point using the more expensive buffalo mozzarella, which should only be eaten fresh.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">12 slices of stale baguette, cut about 1cm/½in thick</p>
<p class="ingre">4 slices of mozzarella cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">5 anchovy fillets, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">a few fresh chives, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4. Take 4 wooden skewers and thread 3 slices of bread through the crusts on each one, placing a piece of mozzarella on the middle slice. Put the skewers on a baking sheet and place in the oven for about 10 minutes, until the mozzarella has just melted and the bare slices of bread become crisp.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the anchovy sauce. Melt the butter in a small pan, add the anchovy fillets and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour a little anchovy sauce over each bare slice of bread. Sprinkle chopped chives over the mozzarella, grind over some black pepper and serve immediately.</p>

 bruschetta</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">bruschetta</h3>
<p class="para1">Bruschetta is a classic Italian snack that has become increasingly popular in restaurants and pizzerias in the UK. I suppose it is Italy’s answer to garlic bread. It is very simple to make and is an extremely nutritious snack at any time of day.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>1–2 slices of bread per person</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">slices of stale, leftover bread (ciabatta is good)</p>
<p class="ingre">a few garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="ingre">abundant extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">chopped ripe tomatoes (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre">fresh basil leaves, roughly torn (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt</p>
<p class="para1">Toast the bread on both sides, or grill it on a ridged chargrill pan. Remove and immediately rub the garlic cloves over one side of the bread while it is still warm – you will see the garlic melt into the toast. Sprinkle with salt, drizzle with lots of extra virgin olive oil and top with a few chopped tomatoes and fresh basil, if desired. Serve immediately.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h3 class="h3">crostini</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">crostini</h3>
<p class="para1">Crostini are slices of bread (baguette is ideal) that have been grilled or slowly baked in the oven, then topped with almost anything you like. In Italy, people often serve a selection of crostini as a starter or with pre-dinner drinks. Alternatively, they are a handy way of using up stale bread to serve as a snack instead of the usual sandwich.</p>
<p class="para1">Good ideas for toppings include olive paste, artichoke paste (both available in good delicatessens), chicken liver pâté (a favourite in Tuscany), a little <a href="text00010.html#page_142">Salsa alla Crudaiola</a>
 or a few <a href="text00010.html#page_139">preserved vegetables</a>

 carpaccio di scamorza</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">carpaccio of smoked mozzarella cheese</h3>
<p class="para1">I dedicate this recipe to Kate Adie, journalist and war correspondent. While at Passione for dinner one evening, she was talking about the various meals she had eaten around the world and mentioned her favourite Italian dish, which she had had about 20 years ago – a salad of very thinly sliced cheese dressed with raw vegetables and olive oil. She had had this only once, in a restaurant in Bologna, and had never found it on other menus. I quickly went downstairs to the kitchen and recreated the dish. When I took it upstairs, wow, it certainly brought back memories for her!</p>
<p class="para1">It’s extremely simple to prepare and makes a wonderful light snack or a sophisticated starter. You can get hard-smoked scamorza cheese at most good Italian delicatessens. Just remember you will need a good sharp knife, as everything has to be sliced wafer-thin. If you have a mandoline, use that, or the finest slicer on your food processor.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 small scamorza cheeses</p>
<p class="ingre">½ small shallot, very finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small celery heart, very finely sliced (including the leaves)</p>
<p class="ingre">4 button mushrooms, very finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Remove and discard the hard skin from the scamorza and cut them lengthways into extremely thin slices. Don’t worry if you don’t get a whole slice, as long as the pieces are wafer-thin. Arrange them evenly on serving plates and top with the shallot, celery and mushrooms. Grind over some black pepper, then drizzle over the lemon juice and olive oil. Leave to marinate for 5–10 minutes and serve with good bread.</p>

 crochette di fave</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stuffed broad bean cakes</h3>
<p class="para1">Broad beans are good not only eaten whole but also when mashed and made into a dough. This recipe takes a little time to prepare but the result is worth the work. The little cakes are delicious hot or cold, or they can be made in advance and reheated in the oven.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes 36</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">300g/11oz fresh or frozen broad beans</p>
<p class="ingre">250g/9oz plain flour</p>
<p class="ingre">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz butter, softened</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp dried yeast, dissolved in 1 tbsp lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre">olive oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">250g/9oz ricotta cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">1 egg</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp fresh chives, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">a pinch of nutmeg</p>
<p class="para1">Blanch the broad beans in a large saucepan of boiling water for 1 minute, then drain well and plunge in cold water. Peel off the skins. Place the beans in a food processor and whiz until mushy. Transfer to a large bowl, add the flour, eggs, butter, yeast mixture and some salt and pepper, and mix well with your hands to form a smooth dough. Cover with a clean kitchen cloth and leave in a warm place for about 30 minutes, until slightly risen.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the filling. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix to a smooth paste. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="para1">Shape the dough into balls the size of golf balls. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each ball of dough out into an oval shape about 3mm/⅛in thick. Place a tablespoon of the filling on it and roll it up, pinching the edges together to close.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large, deep saucepan or a deep-fat fryer. Deep-fry the croquettes, a few at a time, for 2–3 minutes, until golden brown. With a sharp knife, cut in half on the diagonal. Drain on kitchen paper and serve hot or cold.</p>

 pasta fritta</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">pasta snacks</h3>
<p class="para1">This is my version of crisps! When you make a batch of fresh pasta and have some left over, roll it out, cut it into a taglierini or tagliolini shape and deep-fry. Flavoured with some salt, it makes a fun snack for children or can be served with drinks. You could also flavour it with freshly ground black pepper, a little crushed dried chilli, some dried oregano or anything else you like.</p>

<p class="para1">Roll out the dough with a pasta machine to make very thin sheets. Then cut out the thinnest spaghetti shape you have on your machine. As each batch comes out of the machine, roll it into neat nests.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat plenty of olive oil in a large saucepan or a deep-fat fryer. Add the pasta nests a few at a time and fry for about 1 minute, until golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with some salt and serve warm or cold.</p>

<em>The school friends I used to share my merende with: Gennaro, Alfonso, Franco, Geraldo, and the taller boy at the back is Pepino.</em>
</p>
<p class="paraba1"><a id="page_161"></a>
 <span class="big">‘</span>
 All my friends had nicknames, and they were all called after a food or snack. Alfonso was named Muscione, which means something soft, because when we raided the fig trees in the afternoons he would clamber to the top and feel the figs until he found a soft one. Then there was Sperlungone, named after a long bread, because his mother never made ordinary bread. Hers was always very long, and his roll used to reach from his mouth to his stomach. There was Muzecatella, which means little bite, named because he always took tiny bites of his snack. Biscotti earned his nickname because he liked his snacks very sweet. A very dear friend of mine is nicknamed Melanzana, which means aubergine. In all the years I knew him, he ate an aubergine sandwich every afternoon. A few years ago, someone sent me a postcard of my village. Melanzana was in the background perched on a wall, eating what I would swear was an aubergine baguette.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Lupino got his name from his love of lupins, a type of bean. To give them their flavour, lupins used to be dried and put into big cloth sacks, which were then suspended by chains from the cliffs and rocks that overhung the sea. Lupino famously jumped off the rocks armed with his penknife, with the idea of helping himself to an illicit serving of beans. He made tiny little holes in the sacks and filled his swimming trunks with the lupins. It was a very dangerous mission. The waves crashed against the rocks and he could easily have drowned.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I can remember eating all day long. We certainly weren’t starving. We learned about food by talking to the local bakers, butchers and restaurateurs. We couldn’t help but learn about food because the knowledge was all around us.<span class="big1">’</span>

 arancini di riso</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">deep-fried stuffed rice balls</h3>
<p class="para1">These typically Sicilian snacks are a great way of using up leftover risotto. Traditionally they are filled with different stuffings, such as minced meat or mixed vegetables, and sold as take-away snacks, but to make them simpler you could omit the filling. I have chosen a simple filling of peas and mozzarella. When deep-fried, the mozzarella melts and tastes wonderful as you bit into the <em>arancino</em>
 . I suggest you make lots, as once you start eating them you can’t stop!</p>
<p class="para">

<p class="ingre">100g/4oz frozen peas</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp water</p>
<p class="ingre1">75g/3oz mozzarella cheese, diced</p>
<p class="para1">Make the risotto following the <a href="text00007.html#page_58">basic recipe</a>
 , omitting the butter (or use any leftover risotto you have). Spread the risotto evenly over a baking tray and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the olive oil in a small pan, add the onion and sweat until soft. Then add the peas, water and some seasoning. Cover with a lid and cook for a few minutes, until the peas are tender. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Take a little of the risotto and form it into a ball, roughly the same size as a golf ball. You will find it easier if you wet your hands with cold water. Make an indentation in each ball and place a few peas and a couple of cubes of mozzarella in it. Reshape the ball so the filling is in the centre and completely covered by the risotto. Dust with a little flour, then coat with beaten egg and finally coat in breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat plenty of olive oil in a large, deep saucepan or in a deep-fat fryer. Add the risotto balls a few at a time and fry for 2–3 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper and serve hot or cold.</p>

 la vera pizza napoletana</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">genuine Neapolitan pizza</h3>
<p class="para1">You get so many varieties of pizzas these days that I don’t blame the Italians for wanting to make it DOC (quality controlled) like wine. Everyone has their own taste and I respect that, but recently I saw chicken tikka pizza on an Indian take-away menu. I do think that this is going a bit far – let’s leave pizza to the Italians and chicken tikka to the Indians!</p>
<p class="para1">I once had the opportunity of spending some time at the Pizza Academy in Naples, where they are really strict about how the dough is made and what toppings can be used. This is my recipe for the original Neapolitan pizza, which started off as a means of using up the housewife’s leftovers: bread dough, tomatoes, cheese and whatever else they had in their cupboard – which I am sure was not chicken tikka!</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes 2 large pizzas<br/>
for the dough:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/1lb 2oz strong bread flour plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tsp salt</p>
<p class="ingre">10g/¼oz fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingre">325ml/11fl oz lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre1">a few dried breadcrumbs or some semolina for sprinkling</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>for the topping:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">300g/11oz tinned plum tomatoes, drained</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre">a few fresh basil leaves, plus extra to garnish, or dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingre">150g/5oz mozzarella cheese, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Make the dough by putting the flour and salt in a large bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and gradually add to the flour, mixing well until you obtain a dough. If you find the dough too sticky, just add a little more flour. Shape the dough into a ball and leave to rest, covered with a clean kitchen cloth, for 5 minutes. Knead the dough for 8–10 minutes, until smooth and elastic, then split it in half. Knead each piece for a couple of minutes and then shape into a ball. Sprinkle some flour on a clean cloth and place the dough on it, then cover with a slightly damp cloth. Leave to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, place the tomatoes in a bowl, crush them slightly with a fork, season with salt and pepper, and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/Gas Mark 10 (if your oven doesn’t go this high, just heat it to its highest setting and cook the pizzas for a few minutes longer if necessary).</p>
<p class="para1">Sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and, with your fingers, spread one piece of dough into a circle about 35–40cm/14–16in in diameter. Make the dough as thin as a pancake but be careful not to tear it, making the border slightly thicker. Repeat with the other ball of dough, then sprinkle some breadcrumbs or semolina over 2 large, flat baking trays and place the pizza bases on them.</p>
<p class="para1">Spread a little of the tomato evenly over each base – not too much, or the pizzas will be soggy. Drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle over the Parmesan, add a few basil leaves or some oregano and top with pieces of mozzarella. Place in the hot oven for 7 minutes (a couple of minutes longer if you prefer your pizza crisp). Remove from the oven, drizzle with a little more olive oil, scatter with extra basil leaves if using, and eat immediately.</p>

 frittata di cipolle e porri con crosta di parmigiano</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">leek and onion omelette rolls in a Parmesan crust</h3>
<p class="para1">This is a fun and unusual omelette recipe. Once the omelette is cooked, you make a cheese crust by lining a good-quality non-stick frying pan with grated Parmesan and letting it cook until it melts into a whole piece but is still pliable. The omelette is placed over it and the whole thing rolled up like a swiss roll.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes 10–12 slices</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small onion, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 leek, finely sliced (the white part only)</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick 20cm/8in frying pan, add the onion and leek, and sweat until softened. Pour in the beaten eggs and cook gently until golden brown underneath. Flip over and cook the other side. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Wipe out the frying pan so it is dry and clean. Place over a very low heat and sprinkle the Parmesan evenly over the base. Cook for 1 minute. You will notice the Parmesan sticking together and forming a crust. Gently, with a spatula, lift out the Parmesan crust and place it on a chopping board or a clean work surface. Immediately place the omelette on top, carefully roll it up with the crust and cut into slices with a sharp knife. It is important to do this quickly or the Parmesan will be too hard to work with.</p>
<p class="para1">Either eat straight away or serve cold as part of an antipasto – or take it on a picnic.</p>

 Not only was I the only boy in the family, I was also extremely skinny when I was young. My mother was determined to build me up, and she went out of her way to bring me <em>merende</em>
 throughout the day. She would embarrass me daily by tracking me down when I was out playing with my friends and calling me over to drink a concoction of freshly beaten eggs and sugar, which she prepared in front of us all. I remember my face burning as I felt my friends watching us.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Another daily ritual was the afternoon snack. But this I shared with my friends. When we met up to play after school, we all carried a paper parcel from our mothers – precious bundles ready for the inevitable moment when all of us were starving. Somehow it was always at five o’clock, and whether we were on the beach, in the mountains, in the village or the fields, all play would stop. Frantic bartering went on until everyone had the snacks they fancied, then there was a moment of silence. We were like an orchestra. Once we started to eat you could hear a symphony of appreciative ‘mmms.’ We even looked like musicians, holding our baguettes carefully as if they were flutes and clarinets.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I learned a great deal about food from these snack sessions, because as soon as we had eaten the first few mouthfuls, stories would begin about where the food came from. ‘I killed the pig’ or ‘My father milled this flour’ and ‘My mother grew these vegetables’ or ‘I preserved these fruits’. We educated each other about food. Many of my childhood friends have since become chefs. I realise now that the quality of those simple afternoon snacks was outstanding. We had bread with all sorts of fillings: pork dripping and sea salt, salami, aubergine and tomato, mozzarella and fruit.<span class="big1">’</span>
