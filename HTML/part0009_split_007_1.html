  <h3 class="h3a">Mixed boiled <a id="pg61" class="calibre1"></a>meats served with salsa verde</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This typical Piemontese dish is usually made for special occasions involving large numbers of people. Traditionalists insist on seven prime cuts of beef and veal, seven lesser meats such as chicken, ox tongue and sausage, served with seven sauces, boiled vegetables and a bowl of the broth in which the meats were cooked. However, the recipe is adapted by different families to suit their needs. <em class="calibre4">Zampone</em> or <em class="calibre4">cotechino</em> sausage is usually included in <em class="calibre4">bollito misto</em> – you will find it in Italian delis. Here is my simplified version of this dish, with a tangy salsa verde (green sauce). You can also serve it with <em class="calibre4">mostarda di Cremona</em> (a traditional condiment of candied fruits in mustard, sold in Italian delis), horseradish sauce, mustard and pickled vegetables. The meats are simmered together in a large pan; the resulting broth is served as a starter with tortellini pasta (or kept as a stock for other dishes), and the meats are served as a main course.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 10</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz ox tongue</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz piece of beef brisket</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small chicken, weighing about 1.2kg/2lb 10oz</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large onion</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 celery stalks with leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 carrots</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, including stalks</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">10 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 potatoes, peeled and left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 vacuum-packed zampone or cotechino sausage</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the salsa verde</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large handfuls of parsley</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz baby gherkins (cornichons)</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz capers</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 anchovy fillets</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz bread, soaked in a little lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">yolk from 1 hard-boiled egg</p>

  <p class="ing2">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="para">Wash the ox tongue under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen paper. Place in a large saucepan with cold water to cover, bring to the boil, skim off the scum, then reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook gently for 1 hour, removing the scum from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the beef brisket and continue to simmer for 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the chicken, onion, celery, carrots, tomatoes, parsley, salt and peppercorns and cook for 30 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook for another 30 minutes. At the same time, bring another saucepan of water to the boil, add the zampone or cotechino and cook according to the packet instructions.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the salsa verde: very finely chop the parsley, gherkins, capers, garlic, anchovies, bread and egg yolk – you can do this in a food processor, but I prefer the slight crunchiness you get by chopping with a knife. Put the chopped ingredients into a bowl and combine with the olive oil. This can be made 2–3 days ahead and stored in the fridge, but serve at room temperature.</p>

  <p class="para1">When the meats are cooked, remove from the liquid and set aside. Leave the tongue to cool a little before peeling off the skin, then slice. Slice all the other meats and arrange on a large serving dish. Serve with the salsa verde (you can also serve the potatoes and vegetables).</p>
