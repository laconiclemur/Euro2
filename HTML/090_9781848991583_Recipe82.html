<p class="normal"><b>I’ve chosen my favorite fruit for this recipe—including yellow peaches, which I love—but be adventurous, because this is a great way of using up any surplus pitted fruits or apples or pears you might have. You can also use a vanilla bean instead of star anise, or even black pepper instead of the cinnamon, but use them with care to avoid overpowering the fruit. I like to use Drambuie but you can use Scotch instead, if you like.</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 plums, halved and pitted</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 greengages, halved and stones removed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 yellow peach, quartered and pitted</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 nectarine, quartered and pitted</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 figs, quartered</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup light soft brown sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small cinnamon sticks</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 star anise</p>
<p class="acktxt">4½ tablespoons Drambuie</p>
<p class="acktxt">juice of ½ lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 extra-large eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 slices brioche loaf, each about ⅝ inch thick</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">Real Vanilla Ice Cream (see <a href="025_9781848991583_Recipe19.html">page 23</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fruit in a single layer, cut-side down, and cook 1 minute. Sprinkle one-third of the sugar over the top and add the cinnamon and star anise, then continue to cook 3 to 4 minutes longer until the fruit start to release their juices and become slightly soft; they should still keep their shape.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Pour the Drambuie into the pan and immediately set it alight (it should burn for a few seconds), then turn the heat down to low so some of the Drambuie remains in the pan and cook 1 to 2 minutes longer, taking care not to let the fruit become too soft. Stir in the lime juice and remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan to keep the fruit warm while you cook the brioche.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Beat the eggs with the remaining sugar in a large, shallow bowl until thick and creamy. Dip each side of the brioche briefly into the egg mixture until it is just coated, then leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Melt the butter a second large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When it is foaming, add the brioche and cook for a few minutes on each side until just golden brown and slightly crisp. Serve with the fruit and their juices spooned over the top and with vanilla ice cream.</p>
