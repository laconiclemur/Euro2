<p class="tx2"><b>This is a way of steaming foods but it also traps in the flavours and juices. I think it is a lovely way to cook; it’s clean and simple. I used to get our boys to make their own parcels of food to cook so that they took part in cooking. They would write their names on the outside so they knew whose ‘present’ was whose.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">To make a cartoccio, cut a rectangle of baking parchment at least 10 cm (4 in) larger than the food you are about to cook. Lay the food in the centre of the paper. Fold the long ends up to meet each other above the food. Make a fold of both pieces together of around 2 cm (¾ in) then fold again. Keep folding down until the fold is around 4 cm (1½ in) above the food. Now fold the short ends inwards to seal the parcel and trap any juices. Place the parcels on a baking tray to cook. I find this is enough to cook and hold the juices when steaming vegetables. However, if you are cooking fish <i>al cartoccio</i>, it is a good idea to wrap the paper parcel again in foil to be sure that no steam or juice leaks out.</p>
