<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><small>HESE DAYS, CHEFS</small> aren’t the only ones who have access to the best local ingredients—so do you. Scout out the farmers’ markets where you live. It might take a little time, but once you do, it will change for the better the way you cook and eat.</p>
<p class="indent">There is such simplicity in using the freshest ingredients, and it makes your food taste that much better. Supporting local farms and local purveyors is something I think is really important to do. And, if you take the time to get to know the farmers who come to your local markets, they will keep you in mind when they’ve got something new or have something extra-special on hand.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, I’m focusing on sources of protein and calcium that taste really, really good—I’m talking eggs and cheese. Fresh eggs, pulled from the chicken coop that morning or just days before, are like nothing else. If the chickens roam and feed off the land, the yolks of their eggs will be a deep, dark golden yellow or orange, and they’ll sit up high when you crack the egg open into a bowl or sauté pan. Eggs are inexpensive, nutritious, and can be prepared so many different ways. I have two different poached egg recipes in this book, because there are few things in this world that can’t be made better with a poached egg on top.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_42"/>This chapter will also show you how simple it is to make your own cheese. I make my own cheese at my restaurant, Graffiato, and we use fresh milk and cream from a local dairy. When making the mozzarella, burrata, and ricotta in this book, be sure to use good, fresh milk and cream. Believe me, you’ll be able to taste the difference, and you’ll never want to eat store-bought cheese again.</p>

It’s probably the easiest cheese in the world to make. You’ll need cheesecloth, but if you can’t find it or you’ve run out, you can MacGyver a coffee filter to do the cheesecloth’s job. You can find cheesecloth in most grocery stores, large department stores, or kitchen goods stores.</i></p>

Despite the fact that we ate well for hours, all I could think about at the end of the night was this one egg dish with the sweetest sea urchin and confited potatoes. It's one of the best things I’ve ever eaten in my whole life. Sea urchins are popular in the Mediterranean region and used in many Italian cuisines.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Sea urchin roe is orange-pink and resembles the appearance of a tongue. It has a fresh, briny flavor, but isn’t overly salty or fishy. It’s slightly sweet and buttery, with a smooth custard-like texture. You can order urchin roe or whole urchins from a fishmonger or sushi restaurant. There are videos online demonstrating how to open the urchin and remove the roe, or you could ask the fishmonger or sushi chef to do it for you.</i></p>
