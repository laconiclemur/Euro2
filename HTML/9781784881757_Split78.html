<p class="tx2"><b>My first experience of Tuscan family food was with Giancarlo’s Zia (aunt), Agnese, who showed me how to eat slivers of Pecorino drizzled with honey and slices of peeled ripe pears. It was a combination I will never forget and now in our restaurants we serve Pecorino on wooden boards with pears, honey, walnuts, celery and grapes, mixing the sweet and salty flavours together. In this way, the selection makes a great antipasto with drinks, or works in place of a dessert.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Pecorino cheese-making, from the word pecora, meaning ‘sheep’, dates back to Etruscan times when it was made with vegetable rennet, sometimes derived from artichoke flowers until the Sardinian farmers arrived and brought with them techniques for using animal rennet. You will find a huge selection of Pecorino in Pienza, which has DOP status. It is fascinating to try cheeses covered in ash, wrapped in walnut leaves or washed with wine.</p>
<p class="tx">Our favourite selection of Tuscan cheeses to serve together would be a young (fresco) Pecorino; an older, more mature Pecorino known as Stagionato; a freshly made sheep’s ricotta and a soft goat’s cheese from Mugello. All of these go with runny honey of varying strengths, from the mild, delicate acacia to the powerful, farmyard-flavoured chestnut honey. Our friend Antonella Secciani told us to try soft goat’s cheese with cocoa powder and chestnut honey. And you will often see cheeses served with a soft-set sweet marmalade as well as more modern chilli jam.</p>
