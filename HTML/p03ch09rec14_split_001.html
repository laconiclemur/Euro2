<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The elusive (and expensive)</span> becada <span class="italic">is considered the most desirable of game birds, succulent with the most fat and a strong gamy flavor. It is a migratory bird that winters in the mountain woodlands of northern Spain, where it is stalked by hunters who love the challenge of shooting it. When the bird is apprehended, it bursts out of the grass and soars upward almost vertically before racing to safety in a high, swirling flight pattern. It looks haughty, with its very long beak, and it is always cooked with the head and beak left on except at times when shooting it is forbidden, and it appears illicitly in restaurants unrecognizable, with the beak cut off. It is cooked undrawn—that is, with the liver and entrails still inside, like berry-eating songbirds—so that its full flavor can best be appreciated. The bird’s entrails are choice bits. Buy birds with the heads left on and the eyes removed. Woodcock are at their best from October to December but can also be bought frozen.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">I asked Basque restaurateur Jesús Santos for several recipes, which his assistant Martine Beaulieu sent me. A recipe for</span> becada <span class="italic">came with step-by-step photographs showing how the chef prepares it. I tried it, but it was incredibly complex, with too many ingredients and too many steps. Instead, I give a simple traditional way that hunters and gourmets have eulogized in verse.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Quail are also cooked in the same way. For instructions on roasting quail, see the variations.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1½ large onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup brandy, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun">4 woodcock</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">8 slices pancetta or bacon</p>
<p class="qun1">4 large slices firm white bread, crusts removed and fried in olive oil or toasted</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the onions in 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large covered skillet or casserole, over low heat, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until very soft. Then cook uncovered over medium-high heat, stirring often, until golden brown and caramelized. Heat the brandy in a small pan. Using a long match, carefully set it alight. When the flames die down, pour it into the onions, stir, and remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="summary">For the woodcock, singe off any remaining feathers over a flame. Rinse the woodcock and rub them with salt and pepper and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cover each one with 2 slices of pancetta or bacon. Truss the birds by tying their legs together with kitchen twine, and bend the heads around so that the beaks lie to the side. Arrange them in an oiled baking dish and roast in a preheated 450°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on their size, or until tender and done to your taste. To test, cut into the thickest part of a thigh: the flesh should be pink and juicy. (Many chefs these days like their <span class="italic">becada</span> almost rare. One told me he turns off the oven after 5 minutes and leaves the birds in for another 5.)</p>
<p class="summary">Scoop out the innards from each bird and discard the gizzard. Chop the intestines and liver, add them, with the drippings, to the onion sauce, and heat through.</p>
<p class="summary">Serve the woodcock on the fried or toasted bread, with the sauce poured over.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Place a slice of <span class="italic">mousse de foie gras,</span> or duck liver pâté, on each slice of toast.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• A suggestion from Pepe Iglesias (see page 328): Instead of serving the woodcock on toast, accompany them with chestnuts boiled in milk and sautéed in butter, mashed or left whole (page 408).</p>
<p class="bl-last">• To use quail instead of woodcook, cover each bird with 2 slices of pancetta or bacon and roast in a preheated 425°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes—they must not be rare, only slightly pink.</p>
