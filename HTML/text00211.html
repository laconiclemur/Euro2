 JAFFA BAVAROIS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_Dlavd" id="nad0002089">
<em>Are they cakes or are they biscuits? Should they be dunked or should they not? Can you eat them with a spoon? Well now you can, because this is my interpretation of the famous Jaffa combination, with light cake, zesty orange jelly and whipped chocolate, combined into a pudding version of the classic treat, just to add to the confusion of how it’s ‘supposed’ to be eaten. I say that if something can’t be answered, you might as well keep adding more questions.</em>

<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 This has a few stages, all quite simple, but let’s begin with the jelly. First, soak the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002113">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Place the orange juice in a small pan and bring to a gentle simmer (not a boil), then turn off and take off the heat.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002114">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Squeeze the excess water out of the gelatine, add it to the orange juice in the pan and mix to allow it to dissolve. (If you did accidentally bring the juice to a boil, wait for it to cool before adding the gelatine. Boiling liquids can make gelatine much less effective.)</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002115">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Place the mixture in a shallow bowl or container and place in the fridge to set.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002116">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Now to get started on the bavarois cream. Put the gelatine leaves into a bowl of cold water and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002117">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the milk into a pan and just bring to a simmer, then take it off the heat.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002118">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Whisk together the eggs and sugar in a bowl. Slowly add the warm milk in a steady stream, until you have added it all.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002119">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Now pour the mixture back into the pan and place on a very low heat. The lowest setting you have is best. Stir continually until the mixture is thicker and coats the back of the spoon. Don’t be tempted to speed up the process by turning up the heat, or the mixture will curdle. This is the perfect opportunity to catch up on social media, news or family with your free hand. The whole process can take 20–25 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002120">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Once the mixture has thickened, put it back into the bowl and leave for 10 minutes, just to cool. Add the gelatine and mix through. Put into the fridge and leave to cool completely.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002121">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Once the mixture is cold, whip the cream to soft peaks and fold into the egg mixture, making sure any lumps have gone. Add the orange zest, then put into the fridge.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002123">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 For the Genoese sponge, preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. <a id="pg256"></a>
 Line the sides and base of a deep 24 x 30cm rectangular baking tin with baking paper, leaving a bit of an overhang.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002124">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>12.</strong>
</span>
 Whisk the eggs and sugar for 8–10 minutes, until the mixture is light and three times its original volume. When the whisk is swirled and lifted out, a trail should remain in the mixture for longer than 8 seconds. Add the sifted flour to the mixture and fold through carefully, making sure to get rid of all the pockets of flour without knocking out too much air.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002125">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>13.</strong>
</span>
 Pour the mixture into the baking tin, then, using a spatula or the back of a spoon, spread it into the corners to make an even layer. Bake in the oven for 8–10 minutes, until the sponge is very light golden and slightly risen.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002126">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>14.</strong>
</span>
 Once baked, remove from the oven. Take the sponge out of the tray, using the paper to help you, and leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002127">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>15.</strong>
</span>
 As the sponge cools, grease the same baking tin and line the base and sides generously with cling film. Grease lightly.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002128">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>16.</strong>
</span>
 Chop up the orange jelly into small cubes and sprinkle them all over the base of the tray.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002129">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>17.</strong>
</span>
 Pour over the bavarois cream, then put the Genoese sponge on top. The sponge will be slightly smaller now, as it will have shrunk during baking. But this is absolutely fine. Place in the fridge to chill for at least 3 hours.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002130">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>18.</strong>
</span>
 While it chills, you can get started making the whipped chocolate topping. Put the cream cheese and mascarpone into a bowl with the milk and mix together so they are well combined and viscous. Add the sifted icing sugar and cocoa and mix through. Whisk for 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002131">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>19.</strong>
</span>
 Take the bavarois out of the fridge and tip it over so the sponge is on the base and the bavarois on top. Cut into portions.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002132">
<span class="Dlavd">
<strong>20.</strong>
</span>
 Place the chocolate cream in a piping bag with a star tip attached, and pipe out one large chocolate star for each portion.</p>
