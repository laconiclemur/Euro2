<p class="author1"><span class="txit">polpettone alla romana</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Enjoy this meat loaf thickly sliced for dinner or thinly sliced on a sandwich the following day. This meat is also delicious cooked as individual hamburger patties. I like to form the mixture into two small loaves so the meat holds together when sliced. One large loaf may require 20 minutes additional baking time. This meat loaf may also be prepared using ground pork, adding 1 tablespoon of fennel seeds to the mixture along with the fresh herbs.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound day-old crustless white bread</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup ricotta cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon ground nutmeg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter, melted</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons canola oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Three 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes. Place in a bowl and cover with the water. Allow the bread to absorb the water and become very soft, about 5 minutes. Gently squeeze all the water out of the bread. Place the bread in a large bowl (discard the water).</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Add the veal to the bread and use a wooden spoon to blend them together to form an even mixture. Stir in the ricotta and Parmesan cheese and mix well. Add the eggs and mix well. Add the nutmeg, parsley, sage, rosemary, salt to taste, and generous grindings of pepper. Mix well.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_264"/><span class="red">4.</span> Divide the mixture in half, and shape each half into a loaf measuring approximately 10 inches long by 3 inches wide. Pour the melted butter, canola oil, and wine into a large baking dish. Place the meat loaves in the baking dish, leaving at least an inch between them. Distribute the rosemary sprigs in the dish. Bake until browned and cooked through, about 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Remove the loaves to a warm platter, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside. Strain the liquid left in the baking dish through a fine-mesh sieve into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook to reduce by half, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Cut the meat loaf into 1-inch-thick slices and arrange on a platter or dinner plates. Spoon some of the sauce over each portion and serve immediately.</p>
