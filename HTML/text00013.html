<em>Waking up to breakfast pancakes</em>
</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Pancakes were always a highlight of mornings at home. On weekends, I used to go to sleep very late because I loved to watch the lights from the houses of the city slowly turn off one by one. During the day, the sights, smells and sounds of the city could almost swallow you, but at night, for a brief few hours, you were finally able to be alone. I remember, after one late night, being woken in the morning by the dappled sunlight on my face that was creeping into my room through the leaves of a large tree that stood beyond my balcony. Still half asleep, I could hear my mother’s hushed voice talking in the kitchen and smell the aroma of delicious pancakes cooking on the stove; sizzling in oil and slowly turning crispy and golden, ready to be laid down in snowy yogurt with honey and fruit. I remember the excitement and the amazing feeling of expectation that the smell gave me – the best possible start to a fresh new day, with every possibility that something incredible could happen in the hours ahead.</strong>

<p class="para1">
<strong>Growing up, these pancakes were always on the table at weekend breakfasts and I still associate them with relaxing mornings at the end of a busy week. They puff up during cooking and their texture is beautifully light and soft, somewhere between a doughnut and a pancake.</strong>

<strong>My aunt Eteri was renowned locally for her cakes and desserts.

<p class="side">200 g/7 oz chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="side1">200 g/7 oz raisins</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4 and line four shallow 20-cm/8-inch cake pans with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the cake, place the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until pale and well combined. Place the bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) in a small bowl and dissolve in the vinegar. Place the yogurt and dissolved bicarbonate of soda in a bowl or jug (pitcher) and stir to combine. Add this mixture to the sugar and butter mixture and stir to combine. Gradually sift the flour into this mixture, mixing between each addition. Once all of the flour has been added, knead to bring everything together into a thick dough. Divide the dough into 4 equal-sized pieces and press one piece into the base of each prepared cake pan, ensuring the base of the pans are well covered and the dough is evenly distributed.

<p class="para1">To make the cream, sift the flour and potato starch into a large bowl and add the sugar. Add enough of the milk to make a smooth paste, then set aside. Place the remaining milk in a large pan over a medium heat. Heat the milk until it just starts to bubble, then immediately remove from the heat and stir the flour paste into the milk. Return the pan to the heat and reduce the heat to low. Cook the mixture, stirring continuously, until the mixture is thick and is just starting to bubble. Remove from the heat and set aside until almost at room temperature. Once the cream has cooled, transfer to a mixing bowl and add the butter. Using an electric beater, beat the mixture until the butter is well combined. Set aside.</p>

Scatter over one-third each of the walnuts and raisins and top with another layer of cake. Repeat this process until all of the cream filling, walnuts and raisins are used up, then top with the final layer of cake.</p>
<p class="para">Pour the topping mixture over the top of the cake, using a hot knife to ensure and neat finish. Transfer the cake to the fridge overnight to set, then serve chilled from the fridge.</p>

<p class="para1">Meanwhile, place the walnuts, sugar, raisins (if using), cinnamon and salt in a bowl and stir to combine.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the dough has rested, working with one piece of dough at a time, place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into a large rectangle measuring approximately 5-mm/¼-inch thick. Spread the sugar mixture over the surface of the dough, then, working from the widest edge of the dough rectangle, roll the dough into a long cylinder.</p>
<p class="para1">Transfer to the preheated oven to cook for 20–30 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.</p>
<p class="para">Dust with icing (confectioners’) sugar just before serving and slice into portions.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">-GEORGIAN APPLE PIE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Similar to an American cobbler, this delicious dessert is topped with a soft sponge on a bed of sweet apple purée. Warming and comforting, this is delicious served with ice cream or custard.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 20 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 45 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 8</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">6 cooking apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1-cm/½-inch chunks</p>
<p class="side">200 g/7 oz/1 cup plus 1 tsp granulated sugar</p>
<p class="side">250 g/9 oz sunflower spread</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp vanilla sugar</p>
<p class="side">3 eggs</p>
<p class="side">300 g/10½ oz/2¼ cups plain (all-purpose) flour</p>
<p class="side">60 g/2¼ oz/½ cup potato flour</p>
<p class="side">2 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</p>
<p class="side">250 g/9 oz/generous cup low-fat natural yogurt</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp lemon salt, dissolved in a little cold water</p>
<p class="side1">double (heavy) cream or ice cream, to serve</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4 and grease a large rectangular cake pan (approximately 32 x 24 cm/12½ x 9½ inches) with oil and line with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the apple in a medium pan with enough water to cover the base of the pan and bring to a simmer over a low heat. Cook until the apples have broken down into a smooth purée and have taken on a light golden brown colour. Just before ready, add 1 teaspoon of sugar and the vanilla sugar. Set aside in the pan to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Cream the sunflower spread and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer, then add the eggs one and a time, beating with the mixer to combine between each addition.</p>
<p class="para1">In a separate bowl, sift both flours and the bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), then add the yogurt and lemon salt to the bowl and mix to combine.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour the flour and yogurt mixture into the bowl with the butter, sugar and eggs, then fold everything together until you have a smooth batter (do not use the electric mixer for this stage).</p>
<p class="para1">Pour the cake batter into your prepared cake pan and level the surface with a spatula. Pour the cooled apple purée over the batter, then use the spatula to gentle ripple it through the cake batter.</p>
<p class="para1">Transfer the cake to the oven and cook for 30 minutes, until golden and well risen. The cake is cooked when an inserted wooden skewer comes out clean — be careful when checking as the apple purée remains quite wet when the cake is cooked, so you are looking for residual cake batter only.</p>
<p class="para">Slice the cake in the pan and transfer to serving plates. Serve hot with double (heavy) cream or ice cream.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">-GRAPE JELLIES-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>These grape jellies are perhaps the most recognizable Georgian dessert and always go down well in the restaurant. They are set with flour rather than gelatine and need to be left for several hours to set. They look especially pretty if you use small decorative moulds.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus at least 3 hours for setting</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 15 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="side1">
<strong>Makes 1 large or 6 small jellies</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">6 tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour</p>
<p class="side">2 tbsp sugar</p>
<p class="side">1 litre/4 cups 100% grape juice (dark)</p>
<p class="side1">roasted hazelnuts, to serve</p>
<p class="para1">Sift the flour into a small bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Add a little of the grape juice and stir to make a loose paste.</p>
<p class="para1">Place three-quarters of the remaining grape juice in a pan over a medium heat. Pour in the paste and cook, stirring continuously, until just boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to cook, still stirring, until thickened. Add the remaining sugar and grape juice to the pan and cook for around 8 minutes more — if the mixture is too thin, add a little more flour to thicken.</p>
<p class="para">Transfer the mixture into individual moulds or serving glasses and place in the fridge for at least 3 hours to set. Serve scattered with roasted hazelnuts.</p>
