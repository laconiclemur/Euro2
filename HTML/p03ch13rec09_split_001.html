<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This ice cream is fabulous. Because it is a custard, it does not need an ice cream machine or regular beating by hand to prevent crystallization. The base is a rich vanilla ice cream, which is frozen until it is almost firm, and then raisins and the sweet, dark Pedro Ximénez sherry or Málaga Moscatel wine are mixed in.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 10 OR MORE</span></p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup black raisins</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sweet Pedro Ximénez sherry or Málaga Moscatel, plus extra for drizzling</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups heavy cream</p>
<p class="qun">1½ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1 small cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="qun">8 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun1">½ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">Soak the raisins in the sherry or wine in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, heat the cream and milk with the cinnamon stick and vanilla in a large saucepan until almost boiling. Remove from the heat and let stand for 30 minutes to infuse. Remove the cinnamon stick and reheat the milk mixture.</p>
<p class="recsum1">With an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar in a medium bowl to a pale, thick cream. Gradually add a ladleful of the hot milk, beating constantly, then pour this into the saucepan, stirring vigorously preferably with a heatproof spatula. Continue to stir constantly over low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the spoon. Do not let it boil, or it will curdle. (If it does curdle, you can save the ice cream by beating it with the electric mixer until smooth.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the custard into a serving bowl and let it cool. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 3 to 3½ hours, or until it is firm but not yet hard.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Take the ice cream out of the freezer and thoroughly mix in the raisins, with their sherry or wine. You must do this before the ice cream becomes too hard to mix, but it must be firm enough so that the raisins remain suspended evenly and do not sink to the bottom. If you do not mix thoroughly, there will be little white patches in the ice cream (but that too is lovely). Return to the freezer and freeze until it firms.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Take the ice cream out of the freezer 10 to 15 minutes before serving, then cut into slices. If it proves difficult to dislodge the pieces from the bottom, dip the bowl in a bowl of hot water for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pass the bottle of Pedro Ximénez or sweet wine so everyone can drizzle a little over their ice cream.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary">To shape the ice cream into a dome that is easy to turn out, line another bowl with plastic wrap, pour the semifrozen mixture with the raisins in, cover with another piece of plastic wrap, and freeze overnight. To serve, remove the plastic wrap from the top, then turn out the ice cream onto a serving platter and remove the other piece of plastic wrap.</p>
