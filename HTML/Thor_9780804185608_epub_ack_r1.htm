</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div3">THANK YOU TO:</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div4">Oddur, for your beautiful photographs, strong hand, and good advice, and for making me move to the countryside … and thanks to all the dogs that made you want to move.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div5">Gunnhildur, Þórir, Tiger-Mia, Hudson, Louise, and Gaïa, for eating everything and liking most of it, for bearing with me when dinner was late and when tempers were flaring. And thanks for putting up with your father’s demanding photography and for being so helpful with each other.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div6">Johanna and Þórir, your encouragement means everything to me.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div7">My aunt Francine; without you, I might never have started to cook.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div8">My fellow Médocains: the generous Fabien and Florence Courrian; Pierre and Marie-Noëlle Aubert, whose kindness is as organic as their vegetables; Monsieur Manenti—how could I cook without your excellent meat?; Francis and Françoise Pion, our snail farmer friends who have saved the day more than once; and Sheyenne, David, Naturel, and Balkis, our constant models.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div9">Jane Butler, for your keen wit and impeccable taste.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div10">Berta Treitl, my agent, for believing in me.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div11">Jenny Beal Davis, for being instrumental in the making of this book.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div12">Everyone at Clarkson Potter, you have been an absolute dream team, especially Rica Allannic, my editor—I am so glad we are on the same page.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div13">And my parents, who, it must be said, made me love food with a deep passion.</div>
