<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This warm and soothing soup brings the earthiness of wild mushrooms to the bowl. This really tastes like wild mushrooms—not the bland “cream of mushroom soup” found in cans on supermarket shelves. Use some button mushrooms for body, but be sure to blend in at least a handful of chanterelles or another bold-flavored wild variety. This is a perfect dish to use those imperfect and broken mushrooms from the bottom of the basket (they will be puréed anyway).</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 POUND/455 G ASSORTED WILD OR CULTIVATED MUSHROOMS</li>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>2 CUPS/200 G FINELY CHOPPED LEEKS, WHITE AND TENDER GREEN PARTS ONLY</li>
<li>4 GARLIC CLOVES, CHOPPED</li>
<li>3 CUPS/720 ML MILD CHICKEN STOCK <a href="238-chapter174.html#page_336">(PAGE 336)</a>, VEGETABLE STOCK <a href="236-chapter172.html#page_335">(PAGE 335)</a>, OR WATER</li>
<li>¾ CUP/180 ML HEAVY CREAM</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Clean the mushrooms following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>. Set aside a handful of the nicest ones for the garnish. Roughly chop the remaining ones.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a heavy soup pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring frequently, until they are golden and nearly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are very tender. Remove the pot from the heat, uncover, and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Working in batches as needed, purée the soup in a food processor or blender, until creamy smooth. Or, purée in the pot itself, using an immersion hand blender.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Return the puréed soup to the pot, stir in the cream, and season with salt. Slowly heat over medium-low heat and stir frequently, without letting it reach a boil, 5 to 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Meanwhile, quarter or thinly slice the reserved mushrooms depending on their shape. In a skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat and sear the mushrooms until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with the seared mushrooms, and generously grind black pepper over the top. Serve hot.</p>
