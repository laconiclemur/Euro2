<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_249"/>milanese casserole</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">casseruola lombarda</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Gianni generally considers most variations of this type of stew to be too heavy, and that is what inspired him to create a recipe that is rich in flavor and won’t leave you feeling overly full. Be sure to tightly pack all of the ingredients into a heavy-bottomed casserole so the broth is absorbed by the meat and vegetables and does not just boil away. Serve this one-dish meal with polenta or crusty bread to dip into the sauce. It may be prepared a day in advance and reheated before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 lean beef short ribs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 links sweet sausage</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups water or 1 cup water and 1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 Idaho potatoes, peeled, halved, and each half cut into 6 pieces.</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a flameproof casserole set over medium-high heat. Stir in the bacon and continue cooking until it has softened and begun to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the onions and shallots and cook, stirring, until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in the parsley, paprika, bay leaves, cabbage, and carrots, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Season the short ribs with salt and pepper, then add them to the casserole. Add the sausage, pressing down on the meat to tightly compact all the ingredients into the pan. Pour in the broth and water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a low boil and <a id="page_250"/>cook, skimming off any fat that accumulates on top of the stew, until the meat begins to become tender, 1 to 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours. Then add the potatoes and continue cooking until they are soft and the meat is cooked through, about another hour.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Country-style pork spareribs may be used in place of beef ribs. They will take about half as long to cook through. Also, parsnips or turnips may be cut in the same manner as the potatoes and added to the stew, or in place of them.</p>
