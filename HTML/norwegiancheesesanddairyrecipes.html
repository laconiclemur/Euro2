<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg80_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Our way of purchasing cheese at the supermarket differs greatly from the days when the Norwegian dairy maids labored on the mountain farms from before sun up until late evening. In Anders Sandvig’s book <i>Seterliv og Seterstell</i>, he says that the dairy maid’s workday could last from 12 to 16 hours. The cattle would often get to lick a few grains of salt from the dairy maids hand before she began the milking which took place in a shed or <i>utsel</i>, a building on the mountain farm.</p>
<p class="indent">She used wooden pails, which were made from pine, or juniper. The height of the bucket could be about 8 inches (20 cm) and the breadth between 12–13 inches (30–30 ½ cm). Usually bands made from hazel held the wooden staves together, seldom did they use iron for this. The pails had no handles, but a protruded pole to hold onto. Following the milking, the milk was strained through a wood strainer. In the center it had a round, cross shaped hole. A knitted hair strainer was placed in the center of this utensil and the milk then poured through the outlet hole. In later years the strainer was made from tin metal netting. If the milk was to be poured into a separate container they used a funnel also made from wood. After the containers were filled they placed these <i>melkekoller,</i> low milk bowls, on top of each other in 4 to 6 rows where they were left standing until they skimmed the cream  off. Many would place the <i>koller</i> on top of each other on a stone bench, in pyramid fashion.</p>
<p class="indent">In the olden days, it seems the milk was left standing a week before it was skimmed. By this time it would be quite sour, and thick, it would have consolidated and was viscous, and it could be skimmed off like a piece of skin. Then the cream stood another week before they began to churn the cream. In later years they began to churn the cream after 4–5 days. The left over sour milk was used in cooking or made into <i>gamalost</i> or other sour milk cheeses.</p>
<p class="indent">Gradually the cream was poured into the sour cream tubs. The sour milk was poured into <i>skjørkolken</i>, the sour milk container, where it would stand until they made cheese of it, or it was brought back into the valley on the pack horses.</p>
<p class="indent">Subsequently the dairy maid now had to clean the vessels used. First they all needed to be rinsed in lots of cold water from the streams. Then they were scrubbed inside out in warm water. Following which juniper branches were placed in the vessels and boiling water poured over, this was left standing until it cooled. The water was then poured out and the vessels were overturned onto cloth, ready for use the following morning.</p>
<p class="indent">The dairy maid’s work continued through the day making rennet and the many different cheeses, and painstakingly preparing the food for other dwellers on the mountain farm.</p>
<p class="indent">When I contemplate on the work of the dairymaids, I cannot help but think how fortunate we are to be able to pick up almost any cheese we desire in a grocery store or a Scandinavian delicatessen.</p>
<p class="indent">You may not live in an area where Norwegian cheeses are readily available, but many are now obtainable by mail in the United States. Knowing a little about them and their content will help you choose the proper cheese for the right occasion.</p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>Norway is a cheese-loving nation. In Norway, cows thrive in sparsely<b> </b>populated areas. By crystal clear rivers and unspoiled mountain sides they produce first grade milk for raw material all important in cheese making.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg81_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Aged Cheese (Gamalost)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">It has been said that the name <i>gamalost</i> (aged cheese) was the name given to the cheese because the old technique and method of making it had been handed down for generations. Other explanations are that since an abundance of newly made cheese was eaten in earlier times, and <i>gamalost</i> was the only cheese that was stored, it got its name because it was the oldest cheese on the farm.</p>
<p class="indent">Today <i>gamalost</i> is ready for sale within 5 weeks. It was, and is, an art to make good <i>gamalost.</i> In the past hand skimmed milk was used and special utensils and tools were needed. During the ripening process the cheese was kept in a chest or box that was only used for <i>gamalost</i>. Blessed the homemaker who had good <i>gamalost</i> mold in her coffer. This mold would be on the tools and in the chests for years. The storage temperature was important and who knows, maybe the stories of some having kept the cheese in their straw mattresses were true.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Gamalost</i> is not produced outside of Norway, yet the Norwegians have made <i>gamalost</i> for hundreds of years. It truly is a distinctive cheese and authenticly Norwegian.</p>
<p class="indent">In days past nearly every farm and <i>seter</i> produced its own <i>gamalost</i>, but with the advancement of time, the imported cheeses made with rennet  <a id="page_81"/>became more popular. The dairies took over the production of <i>gamalost</i> in the 1890s, the making of which is quite a sight.</p>
<p class="indent">The cultivated <i>gamalost</i> mold grows fast, and within a few days the cheese looks like huge, longhaired balls of yarn. The mold is then brushed back into the cheese, and it ripens from the outside in, which is the reason the cheese is lighter in color toward the center and darker on the outer edges. The cheese should have a light golden color, be firm and moist, and have a piquant appetizing flavor. If the cheese has an unpleasant odor it has become too ripe. The cheese should be kept cool and well wrapped or in a covered cheese dish.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Serving gamalost:</b> It is best sliced thin, preferably served on rye or any dark bread, maybe with an extra dab of butter. Some use dark syrup with it; others spread a thin layer of honey on top or a little lingonberry jam.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Lefser</i> or flatbread makes a good accompaniment. Thin slices of <i>gamalost</i> with a little sour cream and good butter rolled up in a scroll is a delicacy.</p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>Gamalost is more than food, it is a part of the Norwegian culture. </i></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sharp, Creamy Cheese (Pultost)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2"><i>Pultost</i> is also a very old cheese and extremely easy to make. It is made from soured skimmed milk or <i>kefir</i>, with the addition of caraway being the most popular. It is said that Norway has ten varieties of <i>pultost</i> with a thousand delicate distinctions. The cheese is known for being rich in protein and has a low fat content. Many feel it has not attained the acclaim it deserves. It is reasonable and goes along way. Served with butter on coarse bread it truly wakes up your appetite.</p>
<p class="h1b"><a id="page_82"/><span class="red">Norwegian Swiss Cheese  (Norsk Sveitse-rost)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>The Norwegian Swiss cheese is matured for at least five months. By then the sweet nut-like flavor characteristic to Swiss cheese is developed.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg82_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">In 1856, more than 150 years ago, when the first Norwegian Dairy, Rausjødalen Dairy, was established in Tolga, they hired a Swiss to head it. Being aware of the Swiss people’s knowledge of cheesemaking, the Norwegians wanted to learn the very best method. The dairy’s first year production consisted of 140 cheeses. Hundreds of Swiss came to Norway in the 1800s; they had a great influence on Norwegian cheese production in the beginning stages. It was only natural then that Swiss cheese would be among the first produced in Norway.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg82_02.png"/></p>
<p class="indent">From that period until the 1950s the Norwegians made Swiss cheeses weighing 155 pounds (70 kilos). They were as big as a mill-wheel and extremely difficult to produce, as well as unwieldy. Finally the size was changed to the smaller Norwegian <i>sveitser</i> of today.</p>
<p class="indent">Of utmost importance in the production of Swiss cheese is the quality of the milk. The cheese should have a firm consistency with large holes. Many believe if there is a drop of salt water in the holes, the cheese is fully ripe.</p>
<p class="indent">The Norwegian Swiss cheese is above all intended for sandwiches and cheese trays but may also be used in cheese dishes. In fondue, for example, this Swiss cheese is top.</p>
<p class="image1"><span class="red">Jarlsberg (Jarlsberg)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Most of the Norwegian cheeses have forerunners in foreign lands. Jarlsberg is genuine Norwegian. This distinguished, world-renowned cheese is of a soft, pliable texture and has a mild nut-like flavor making it excellent for cooking and  in salads.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg82_03.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">This cheese was first produced in the early 1800s on the old Jarlsberg estate—its namesake—on the western shore of the Oslofjord. Difficult times and reasonable cheese imported from Holland abated the cheese production at Jarlsberg. Nonetheless, its reputation and unusual qualities was not forgotten over these years, and more than 100 years later the cheese specialists at Norway’s Agricultural School, under the direction of Professor Ola Martin Ystgaard, set out to reconstruct the Jarlsberg cheese. It took several years and hundreds of experiments before Professor Ystgaard would allow the cheese on the market in the early 1960s. Anyone who has tasted the exquisite Jarlsberg cheese knows Professor Ystgaard succeeded with his goal. The cheese is exported around the world as well as thoroughly enjoyed at home in Norway. Cheese experts worldwide have searched for the secret, but so far in vain.</p>
<p class="indent">Jarlsberg is made into 22.5 pounds (10 kilos) round wheels with rind and rind-free cheeses. </p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg82_04.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_83"/>Foremost it is a marvelous party and sandwich cheese but lends itself remarkably well to warm cheese dishes.</p>
<p class="image1">  <img alt="image" src="../images/pg83_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Edam Cheese (Edamerost)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>The Norwegian Edam cheese has become the Christmas cheese and feast cheese for important celebrations in Norway. It has a mild, rich, and a refreshing piquant taste. It keeps well under controlled temperature. </i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg83_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Originally this cheese came from the town of Edam, Holland. It is round, it is said, because in days of old they used to roll the cheese in small wooden chutes onto the ships that transported them around the world.</p>
<p class="indent">It takes four months to prepare Edam cheese. The homemakers in olden days began the preparations for their Christmas cheese in August, four months ahead. Today it still takes four months to produce Edam cheese but homemakers buy the cheese in the stores except for rare exceptions. Cut the Edam cheese in layers, in little triangles from the top down. It tastes best thickly sliced and is delicious with grapes.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Normanna (Normanna)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Norway’s Normanna is somewhat similar to the French Roquefort cheese, both in flavor and looks. Originally one would allow mildew to grow on slices of <i>loff</i>, a white bread similar to French bread. The bread would then be dried, crushed, and added to the cheese containers. Today, the fungus needed is cultivated and added. The cheese is made from cow’s milk. It has a sharp aromatic taste. A versatile cheese, it is appetizing both as a sandwich spread and as an addition to soups, sauces, lamb chops, and in salads. As a snack with red grapes, radishes, and celery it is excellent. On a buffet or in cheese trays it is a must.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Nøkkelost (Nøkkelost)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>The Norwegians think of the nøkkelost as an everyday cheese, but with a flair! </i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg83_03.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">In times past when nøkkelost was imported from Holland, the cheese factory in Leyden stamped the city emblem, two crossed keys, on it, hence the name <i>nøkkelost</i>, or “key cheese.” Today the <i>nøkkelost</i> made in Norway is typical Norwegian. The dairies began producing this as early as the middle of the last century. Since then there have been many renditions and variations.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Nøkkelost</i> is delicious on an open-face sandwich, served on dark bread, and accompanied with fruit. The cheese is elegant when used in cooking. Its aromatic spices of cumin and cloves open the door wide for any creative cook. Try it in salads, sauces, soufflés, or cakes. Its unique flavor is loved by everyone. The Americans, in time, insisted on a softer and more pliant cheese. The Norwegians solved the problem by making a gouda-type cheese with the <i>nøkkelost</i> spices. This delicious cheese now has gained popularity in<b> </b>Norway as well. The <i>nøkkelost</i> matures for three months before it appears in the grocery stores.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Ridder Cheese (Ridder)</span></p>
<p class="indent3">This is a true aristocrat. <i>Ridder</i> literally means knight. It is a cheese of our times created for those who relish a generous slice. It is produced from rich,  <a id="page_84"/>high quality milk in a small dairy by one of the most beautiful fjord arms in Norway. It came on the market in the late ’60s, is round, and measures approximately 8 inches<b> </b>(20 cm.) in diameter. It weighs about 3 lbs. (1 kg. 350 g.). It is surface ripened for 5–6 weeks and has a soft texture.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg84_01.png"/></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Ridder</i> is a distinctive dessert cheese. When served, <i>Ridder</i> should be accompanied with the season’s berries and fruits, such as strawberries, kiwi, and ripe grapes.</p>
<p class="indent">The cheese gets its full aroma at room-temperature, has an aromatic, piquant flavor, and should be cut with a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Tilsiter (Tilsiter)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">The Belgian Limburger cheese is thought to be the forerunner to the <i>Tilsiter</i> cheese now produced in many countries. The orginal went to Holland, Germany, and Austria. Some Dutch emigrants brought the cheese with them to East Prussia; among the emigrants there was a lady who made a cheese she named after Tilsit, the town in which they settled.</p>
<p class="indent1">The production of Norwegian <i>Tilsiter</i> began in the 1950s, when the opportunity presented itself to export cheese to Germany and the continent, including Holland. The production of <i>Tilsiter</i> was started because it was a cheese much loved in many countries. Before the European import restrictions started, Norway produced some two-thousnad tons of <i>Tilsiter</i> yearly, half of which was exported.</p>
<p class="indent">The Norwegian <i>Tilsiter</i> differs from the <i>Norvegia</i> in that it is more pliant and of a very different texture. It is by covering the cheese with a special culture during the ripening process that gives it its unique flavor. It is a marvelous cheese for sandwiches and lends itself well to be served with milder cheeses on cheese trays. It has a strong aroma and is therefore not suitable in warm dishes.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Goat Cheese (Gjetost)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>The Norwegian Dairy Association (Tine) says gjetost is as native to Norway as trolls and fjords. It all started, they say, more than 100 years ago on a small summer farm high up from the Gudbrandsdal valley, famous for its rich farming traditions. </i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg84_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">The milk maid had just made the curd cheese from cow’s and goat’s milk. The left over whey was boiling in a great iron kettle in the fireplace. Usually she would allow almost all the liquid to evaporate. The golden paste that was left at the bottom of the kettle was used for a sandwich spread. On one particular night she expected visitors and wanted to serve them something special. She added cream and some goat milk and poured the hot mixture into a mold. Unbeknownst to her, that night she probably served the very first golden <i>gjetost</i> ever made. This is how the sweet golden <i>gjetost</i> became the staple breakfast treat in every Norwegian home.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Today <i>gjetost</i> still is made the same way, but modern techniques and equipment have taken over. The Norwegians’ appetite for goat cheese, however, is insatiable.</p>
<p class="indent">As children in Norway we were all fed school breakfasts. In memory, they never varied. A glass of milk, <i>skonrok</i>, a hard roll or hardtack, or a course of dark rye bread with <i>gjetost</i>, and an apple or orange. Every morning it tasted just as delicious, especially when in the freezing winter mornings we entered heated schoolrooms with our breakfasts ready for us on the <i>pult</i>, school desk.</p>
<p class="indent">The goat cheese is a 100 percent natural product—no sugar or color is added. The sweetness comes from the milk sugar caramelizing when cooked.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember to serve the cheese in wafer-thin slices. Here, nothing but a Norwegian cheese slicer will do (you need one anyway) available in any Scandinavian shop or fine department stores.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg84_03.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb">  <a id="page_85"/><span class="red">Take Care of the Cheese  (Ta vare på osten)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Cheese keeps well but certain guidelines should be followed. A cheese that is vacuum-packed keeps for about two months. Never keep several kinds of cheese together in one package as they will take on the different flavors. Wrap tightly and with care. Air, moisture, and acid causes mold to appear.</p>
<p class="indent1">Mold should be cut off if it appears and the cheese wrapped in new foil. White cheese should not be frozen—the texture is easily destroyed. Shredded cheese, however, lends itself to freezing. Wrap in small portions. Cream cheeses, <i>Gamalost</i>, and Normanna freeze well. All cheese tastes best when close to room temperature. Keep in mind that cheese is a superb food product to have in reserve.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Mountain Dairy Maid’s Favorite  (Seterjentas favoritt)</span></p>

<p class="noindent6">Cinnamon and sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 small egg, or a half one</p>
<p class="noindent2">In a heavy-bottomed pan bring the milk to the boiling point. Beat kefir and egg together and add in a thin stream to the milk, stirring continually. Let stand until whey separates from the cheese mass. Strain through a cheesecloth placed in a strainer. Press the cheese into a mold or spring-form pan,  with layers of raisins in between. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg85_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Egg Cheese from West Agder  (Egg ost fra West Agder)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>A cheese served with sugar and cinnamon. It is simple to make and tasty. </i></p>
<p class="noindent8">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 qt. (liter) milk</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">6 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) kefir or cultured milk</p>
<p class="noindent2">In a heavy pan bring the milk to a boil. Let it cool slightly. Beat eggs, sugar, and cultured milk together. While stirring vigorously pour the egg mixture, a little at a time, into the warm milk, and bring to a boil. (Strain off the whey, and use in your bread baking.) Serve with sugar and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Creamy Sharp Cheese (Pultost)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>You choose the flavor. Caraway is what I remember best, but dill, chives, or leek is also delicious. </i></p>

<p class="noindent6">1 qt. (liter)  kefir or unflavored non-fat yogurt</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">Caraway seed, dill, or chives</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ cup (½ dl) sour cream</p>
<p class="noindent2">In a heavy saucepan over low heat, heat the milk or yogurt until it separates; it is very important to let it do so slowly. Do not stir. Strain the cheese mass through double cheese cloth placed in a sieve over a bowl. When most of the whey has drained  <a id="page_86"/>off, pick up the four corners of the cheese cloth and squeeze out the remainder. Do not discard the whey but use in bread-baking or as a healthy drink. Place the cheese in a bowl and add sour cream and seasoning of your choice. I use ¼ cup (½ dl) of caraway to a quart; you might want to use less. Let the cheese stand for 24 hours to develop flavor. It keeps in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</p>

<p class="noindent2">However, dairy maids, whose day often lasted sixteen hours, may not have enjoyed the mountain top views as much as I, a mountain hiker. And yet, I still hope for the time when I will have the experience of a few weeks on a mountain farm. For a glimpse of what the <i>seter</i>, used to be, I have translated an excerpt from Hans Aanrud’s book, <i>Sidsel Sidserk</i>:</p>
<p class="noindentt">“Across the valley a procession is working its way up the mountain path. Kjersti Hoel watches through the chamber window, following the procession with her eyes until they disappear over the grassy mountain side far into the interior of the mountain plateau. It is the livestock leaving for the <i>seter</i> today. <i>Budeia</i>, the dairy maid, leads, riding the <i>jegerhest</i>, Chasseur horse, dressed in her Sunday best. With a white kerchief, she rides high on the horse in a lady’s saddle with a high frame resembling an arm chair. She is rosy, round, and self-asserting. Today she is in charge and is the one who feels important.</p>
<p class="indent">Following her are two fellows, each leading a horse positively straining under its heavy burden. The livestock follows as in a grand parade. First, the lead cow, then Brandros with her crooked horn, then Krokhorn and Morkhei, followed by others (except Farskall and Litage who remained at the farm in the valley to train the calves to follow). The large bull, as if to watch over all, comes last.</p>
<p class="indent">The goats followed the cattle closely and would love to pass by them. Then the sheep in a close clump, followed by four large hogs. At the end are the assistant (second) dairy maid and Sidsel Sidserk with her filled rucksack. This is the first time Sidsel Sidserk was allowed to come to the <i>seter</i> with the cattle. From our childhood we had remembered we anxiously wondered if she could manage her job this summer…”</p>
<p class="noindent2">(At the <i>seter</i>) “Sidsel Sidserk stood atop the turf covered roof ridge of the cow stable and scanned the view. With her birch bark hat, shepherd rucksack, goat horn bugle tied to a string around her neck, and her stick in hand she was ready for work…</p>
<p class="indent">When summer ended, the animals penned inside the enclosure rambled impatiently about and understood that <i>bufarsdag</i>, the day for leaving the <i>seter</i>, had arrived. Laced panniers with butter and cheese tubs stood in a row. Horses loaded with panniers and packed saddles stood by the <i>seter</i> walls. In front the Chasseur horse with the lady saddle should be stood.</p>
<p class="indent">Men who herded the animals stood by with a pipe in the mouth waiting for the dairy maid, busy  <a id="page_89"/>making <i>bufars</i> cheese with the last milk milked this morning, which could not be left behind.</p>
<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Visiting a Mountain Farm  (En setertur)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Bjarne is an expert rømmegrøt maker and a lover of Norwegian food traditions. We watched by the lake the bright rays of the setting sun, while relishing every mouthful of Bjarne’s steaming hot sour cream porridge, served with sugar, cinnamon, and black currant juice. And as we did, we sent grateful thoughts up to Mr. Soløst on his little summer mountain farm…</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg89_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">It is impossible for me to think of Norway in the summer time without thinking <i>rømmegrøt</i>, sour cream porridge. Like the summer my cherished friend, Else Aas, had heard of a mountain farm not too far from her family cottage at Gullverket, where we could buy fresh sour cream for our porridge. Else, Bjarne Nordli, another treasured friend, my sister Gro, and I drove a short distance, parked the car, and then started our hike into the mountains to find the little <i>seter</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Our hike was slowed by picking the wild raspberries, blueberries, and lingonberries that grew in profusion, as if beckoning us to partake. The climb to the <i>seter</i> was beautiful and invigorating. As we made our ascent, the view below increased in magnificence, filling us with joy and anticipation to reach the <i>seter</i>. We took a few wrong paths, after which the little mountain farm came into view. Mr. Soløst, its friendly owner, a trump of a “homemaker,” welcomed us.</p>
<p class="indent">His simple cottage had a living room, kitchen, and bedroom. The sun shone brightly through spotless windows framed by checkered curtains. And on the floor we admired the polished wood stove by a stack of logs, the ends cut evenly and appearing to be part of the wall. There also were a few unpretentious pieces of furniture in the room.</p>
<p class="indent">His small kitchen was filled with gleaming pans neatly arranged on wall racks, equipment to make butter, cheese, and sour cream, a wood stove and small sink left just enough room for one or two people to turn around.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Soløst showed us around the <i>seter</i>, the chicken coop, and the barn for his sheep and twenty-six cows that was as clean as his cottage. After our tour he showed us how he made cheese, butter and his delicious sour cream. We bought two quarts of sour cream and began our descent. Later, in the evening of the same day, we visited Bjarne’s quaint cottage at Hol Lake.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sour Cream Porridge (Rømmegrøt)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Rømmegrøt, sour cream porridge, has always held a hedersplass, high esteem, in Norwegian food culture. It was and in many places still, is used at celebrations to commemorate certain days, such as Misummer, Olsok, weddings, births, and so on.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg89_02.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">In the past, though the recipes were similar, the porridge was given different names like <i>slåttegraut</i>, usually served to celebrate the end of haying. It was customarily cooked with thick sour cream and served with flatbread and milk. Or if the porridge was served the day the cattle were moved to or from the summer mountain farm, it was called <i>bufarsgraut</i>. Some used <i>dravle</i>, simmered curds and whey. The dairy maid  <a id="page_90"/>either cooked the porridge at the <i>seter</i> or on her return to the farm. The curds and whey, served as accompaniment, were always prepared at the summer farm. Even at weddings and at births the sour cream porridge was a welcome <i>sending</i>, contribution.</p>
<p class="indent">These offerings would arrive in intricately carved, or rosepainted wooden vessels made especially for the porridge, and delighted and nourished the happy recipients. The porridge itself, in some areas, was decorated with diamond shapes of sugar and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Rømmegrøt</i> was a must for Midsummer festivities, June 24, and for <i>Olsok</i>, July 29, this holds true as well today. Today it is usually served with <i>spekemat</i>, salt-cured smoked meat, and flatbread as accompaniments.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Rømmegrøt</i> is a heavy meal, but our forefathers, whose day began before sun up and continued long past sun down, were more concerned with nourishment than calories. The porridge is not recommended for everyday use but rather to be saved for celebrating special days.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Rømmegrøt</i> cannot be made in a hurry—patience is the key to success. Ingredients used must be the very best quality.</p>
<p class="indent">Today much of the butter fat, a necessary ingredient for this porridge, has been removed from the cream. If sufficient butter does not ooze out while cooking, supplement with 2–3 tablespoons of unsalted butter.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sour Cream Porridge I  (Rømmegrøt i)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">This <i>rømmegrøt</i> cannot be made with our commercial sour cream, which is processed to prevent butter separation and is so essential to the dish. If noncommercial sour cream is not available, make your own as described below.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) heavy cream, or non-commercial</p>
<p class="noindent6">sour cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. lemon juice </p>
<p class="noindent6">2 cups (5 dl) milk, hot</p>
<p class="noindent2">The milk is a minimum amount. You could need as much as 1 cup more to achieve proper consistency. Pour cream into a saucepan and stir in lemon juice. Let stand for 15 minutes. Bring cream to a boil and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with ½ cup (1 ¼ dl) of the  flour and blend thoroughly. Continue cooking for 10 minutes or more, or until butter comes to the surface. Beat constantly. According to your taste the butter may stay in the porridge, or you may skim it off and keep hot in a separate pan. When no more butter oozes from the mixture, under constant stirring, sprinkle in the remaining  flour. Add hot milk one tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly until porridge is thickened and smooth. Salt mildly to taste. Serve hot with butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Serve delicious fresh currant or raspberry juice as an accompanying beverage. Some people prefer milk with <i>rømmegrøt</i>, but I feel that a refreshing fruit drink is a must with such a rich, though delectable, porridge.</p>
<p class="indent1">In certain places in northern Norway they serve their <i>rømmegrøt</i> with a little grated mild goat cheese.</p>

Many are huge, and some have several heads with but one eye between them. They are incredibly stupid, and are easily outwitted by the smart Norwegian children. Their troll hags are also giant, lazy, and not very creative in preparing meals. Porridge is a favorite among trolls.</i></p>
