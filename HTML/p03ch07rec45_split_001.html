<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Eggplants are favorite vegetables on the Balearic Islands. This dish is not at all greasy, the way some eggplant dishes can be, because the eggplants are not fried. The recipe is Rosa Tovar’s.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 AS A STARTER; 2 AS A MAIN COURSE</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 medium elongated eggplants (about 1 pound)</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup fresh bread crumbs</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium tomato, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound ground pork</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="qun">¾ teaspoon cumin</p>
<p class="qun">1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun1">Heaping ¼ cup grated cheese—Manchego, Mahón, or even cheddar</p>
<p class="recsum">Trim the stem ends of the eggplants and cut them lengthwise in half. Pour ⅔ cup water and 1 tablespoon of the oil into a wide casserole or skillet, and put in the eggplant halves, cut side up. Season with salt and pepper, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat and let the eggplants steam for 5 to 8 minutes, until slightly softened (check with the point of a knife). Add a little water if it evaporates too quickly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When they are cool enough to handle, hollow out the eggplants with a large pointed spoon, leaving just enough pulp for a thin wall; reserve the pulp. Return the eggplant shells to the casserole, or, if you used a skillet, transfer them to a baking dish, along with any remaining water. Coarsely chop the pulp.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Soak the bread crumbs in the milk.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Fry the onion in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it just begins to color. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds, or until aromatic, then add the tomato and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the pork, season with salt and pepper to taste, the cinnamon, and cumin, and stir, turning the meat and breaking it up, for 5 to 8 minutes, until it changes color. Add the eggplant pulp and bread crumbs in milk and cook, stirring, until any liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat, add the egg, and mix very well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Spoon the mixture into the eggplant shells. Sprinkle with the grated cheese and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 20 minutes. Serve hot.</p>
