Large old turnips can be bitter and stringy, yuck.)</p><p class="calibre6">3 large tomatoes (finely chopped) or one 14-oz can crushed tomatoes</p><p class="calibre6">1 large onion, chopped</p><p class="calibre6">1 cup fresh cilantro leaves (remove stems)</p><p class="calibre6">1 tsp salt</p><p class="calibre6">1 tbsp ginger powder</p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp cumin powder</p><p class="calibre6">½ tsp pepper</p><p class="calibre6">¼ tsp red pepper flakes</p><p class="calibre6">5 or 6 saffron threads</p><p class="calibre6">3 cups dry couscous grains (with ¼ tsp salt when cooking)</p><p class="calibre6">Optional: Spicy Merguez sausages can be cooked separately and placed them on top of the completed dish.</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre18"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- In a 4 to 6 quart pan (Dutch oven or French oven style), heat the oil and butter until the butter starts sizzling, then add all the meat and brown on all sides. (You might have to do this in several batches.)</p><p class="calibre6">2- Add the finely chopped onion and stir until it is slightly translucent.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Add all the spices and the salt, cook for 3 minutes while stirring. Hmmm...is it me or is your kitchen beginning to smell deliciously North African?</p><p class="calibre6">4- Add fresh cilantro and tomatoes and continue to cook for 3 minutes while stirring.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Add the carrots.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Add just enough water to cover the meat and vegetables and bring to a boil. Lower the temperature and cover so that the stew simmers gently for one hour.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Add turnips and cook for 15 more minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">8- Add unpeeled zucchini and cook for 15 more minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">9- 15 minutes before serving, bring 4 cups of salted water to a boil. As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat and add the dry couscous. Stir, cover tightly with plastic wrap so that no water evaporates. (The ‘right’ way to cook couscous is to steam it. I’m personally unable to taste the difference.) It should take about five to seven minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">10- Separate the cooked couscous with a fork, then place it in a mound in the center of a large platter.</p><p class="calibre6">11- Strain the meat and vegetables through a fine sieve, saving the liquid. Delicately place the vegetable and meat all around the couscous grains. Serve the liquid in a separate dish (such as tureen).</p><p class="calibre6">12- Tell your guests that they must help themselves from the dish with their bare right hand (never the left!), ‘because that’s how you’re supposed to eat couscous’, and enjoy the mortified look on their faces. Once you’ve had your fun, hand them utensils.</p></div></div></body></html>
