<p class="author1"><span class="txit">risotto di zucca con aragosta e salvia</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This was the first dish Gianni ever cooked for me while I was doing research for <span class="txit">Big Night</span> at Le Madri. I knew then I was in the hands of a master.</p>
<p class="indentb">Naturally sweet butternut squash and seafood create the unique flavor of this beautiful, creamy risotto. Adding pumpkin puree to enrich the chicken broth saves the time of preparing a vegetable broth, and the small amount of seafood called for makes this dish a relatively inexpensive way to serve lobster to a group. Serve this risotto with a green salad, a loaf of bread, and a dry white wine.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 cups chicken or vegetable broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup canned pumpkin puree</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup diced onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and diced into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch cubes (about 3 cups)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups Arborio rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound cooked lobster meat, cut into small bite-size pieces (about 1 cup)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons brandy or cognac</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a large saucepan, whisk the chicken broth and pumpkin puree. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and leave the broth at a gentle simmer.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large high-sided sauté pan, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Stir in the onions and cook until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the squash and cook to flavor with the onions, about 2 minutes. Stir in the rice, sage, and 2 cups of the simmering broth. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, then reduce the heat to a simmer.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_201"/><span class="red">3.</span> When the rice has absorbed the liquid, add half the lobster meat and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the simmering broth. Stir the rice until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding the remaining broth, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup at a time, stirring after each addition and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. After 15 minutes, taste a grain of rice. It should have a slight resistance to the bite. If it seems too hard, add a little more broth and continue cooking for another minute or two. When the rice has absorbed the last of the broth, add the remaining lobster. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the brandy, parsley, butter, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Whip with a wooden spoon to bring out the creaminess of the rice and to incorporate all the ingredients. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
