<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In Valencia, I ate a seafood pasta made in a paella pan with short, thin macaroni. Another I had in Catalonia with a vermicelli-type pasta was especially memorable. They were both wonderful, with glorious-looking seafood. This recipe, called</span> fideuà del señorito <span class="italic">(literally, “of the young gentleman”), is less messy to eat because the seafood is peeled or out of its shells, but if you want to make a spectacular one, see the variations.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">You can use either crushed vermicelli or thin spaghettini broken into small pieces instead of</span> fideos <span class="italic">(see previous page). I have used scallops here because they are easier for me to get hold of, but you can put in clams or mussels, which are more commonly used in Spain. If you cannot make or buy a good fish stock (page 126), use a good chicken stock.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">14 ounces monkfish fillet, cut into ¾-inch cubes</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">4 cleaned baby squid, bodies cut into rings</p>
<p class="qun">12 jumbo shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">12 small scallops</p>
<p class="qun">5 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste or finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="qun">A good pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun">5½ cups fish or chicken stock, or as needed</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound <span class="italic">fideos</span> (size 1 or 2), or vermicelli nests or thin spaghettini, broken into 1¼- to 1½-inch pieces</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">6 lemon wedges</p>
<p class="qun1">1½ cups <span class="italic">Alioli</span> (page 141) for serving</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a 16- to 18-inch paella pan. Add the monkfish, sprinkle with salt, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally. Add the squid and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, then add the shrimp and scallops and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, turning them, until the shrimp are pink and the scallops just seared. Transfer the seafood to a platter, and pour the cooking liquid into a small bowl, to add to the fish stock for extra flavor.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the paella pan, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the aroma rises. Add the tomatoes, <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (or paprika), saffron, and a little salt and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until much of the liquid has evaporated and the oil is sizzling through (you can do this in advance).</p>
<p class="recsum1">Fifteen minutes before serving, bring the stock with the liquid from the seafood to a boil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the pasta to the sauce in the paella pan and cook, stirring, until it is well coated. Pour in the boiling stock, and arrange the monkfish and seafood on top. Cook until the pasta is al dente—from 2 minutes, if using vermicelli, to about 10, if using spaghettini; add a little more stock or boiling water if the liquid dries up before the pasta is done. It should still be moist.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve sprinkled with the parsley and garnished with the lemon wedges, accompanied by <span class="italic">alioli.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Substitute dry white wine or oloroso sherry for 1 cup of the stock.</p>
<p class="bl-last-new">• For a more spectacular dish, omit the monkfish and scallops and use seafood in their shells.</p>
<p class="bl-last-new">      Sauté 4 baby squid, bodies sliced into rings, in the paella pan as above; remove from the pan. Sauté 12 or more jumbo shrimp in their shells, turning them once, for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are pink all over; remove from the pan. Put 24 or more clams or mussels (to prepare them, see page 127) in a pan with a finger’s depth of water, put the lid on, and bring to a boil; they will open and be cooked in the steam in a minute or so. If you can afford to be lavish, use 6 langoustines instead of the shrimp and boil them in water for 4 minutes. Arrange all the seafood over the pasta to heat through.</p>
