			<p class="rec-intro">Sheer extravagance, this recipe is as old as the more well known tournedos Rossini. Both were created by Antonin Carême, one of the most famous 19th century French chefs, in honour of the Italian composer Rossini, who famously loved his food. Both are rich, luxurious dishes fit for a special occasion. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 thin slices of brioche</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 slices of cooked foie gras </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp clarified butter (see<a href="part0010_split_018.html#butter-sauce" class="calibre4"> here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp white wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 duck eggs</p>

			<p class="for-the">Sauce</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 button mushrooms, wiped and sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp cold unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">125ml port</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">125ml Madeira wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500ml veal stock (see <a href="part0010_split_005.html#Veal-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp truffle juice (available in cans)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">sherry vinegar</p>

			<p class="body">First make the sauce. Put the shallots in a saucepan with the sliced mushrooms and a little of the butter and cook over a medium heat until the shallots are caramelised. Then add the port and Madeira, bring to the boil and cook until reduced by half. Add the stock and truffle juice and simmer for 20 minutes until syrupy, skimming regularly. </p>
			<p class="body">Remove the pan from the heat and pass the sauce through a fine sieve, pressing well to extract as much flavour as possible. Cut the remaining butter into cubes. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring it to the boil and add the cubes of cold butter to thicken the sauce and give it a lustre. Season with salt and pepper and a few drops of vinegar to balance the sweetness, then set aside and keep warm.</p>
			<p class="body">Cut the brioche into rounds of about 8cm and trim the slices of foie gras terrine to fit – devour the trimmings as you do this. Warm the clarified butter in a pan and lightly fry the brioche slices. Drain and set aside.</p>
			<p class="body">Bring a pan of water to the boil and add the vinegar. This helps to set the white part of the egg so that it has an elegant shape – salting the water has the opposite effect. Crack the eggs into separate bowls. Swirl the water with a spoon, gently add the eggs and poach for 5 minutes or until cooked but with soft yolks. Carefully remove the eggs with a slotted spoon.</p>
			<p class="body">While the eggs are cooking, place a slice of foie gras on each piece of brioche. If necessary, you could warm these briefly in the oven at 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4. Trim the eggs neatly and place them on top of the foie gras. Decorate with thin slices of truffle and serve with the sauce.</p>
			<p class="body">If you’d like to get everything ready in advance to put together at the last minute, poach the eggs, then refresh them in iced water and set aside. When you’re ready to serve, reheat the eggs for 30 seconds in a steamer over a pan of simmering water.</p>
