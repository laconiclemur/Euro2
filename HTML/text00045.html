</h1>
<p class="pf">During our year in Finland, I wrote a half dozen columns for my hometown newspaper, the <i>Floodwood Forum,</i>
 about our experiences while traveling. When cleaning out my parents’ home some time ago, I found three of the articles packed away in a stash of papers. I had totally forgotten that I had written them.</p>
<p>What follows here are those three missives from Finland. The first scene takes place during the few days after Christmas while we were visiting relatives in Kauhajoki. Kerttu Risku was an English teacher in the village school and had a good command of the language. She volunteered to help me find and read the records in the Kurikka church. Finland, at the time, kept all the records of births and deaths in church archives. Here is the article as published in the <i>Floodwood Forum.</i>
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqf">In the last “News from Finland” I told you about our Christmas in Etelä Pohjanmaa with Lilja and Kerttu Risku. This is the part of Finland where most of Dick’s and my grandparents came from. We took advantage of the time we had to check up on the family tree.</p>
<p class="bq">Kerttu and I went to Kurikka, which is about ten kilometers from Kauhajoki, where Dick’s grandmother was born. My mother’s mother was born in Kurikka. We didn’t have much of a clue where to start from, when we first entered the modern building where the church records are kept.</p>
<p class="bq">We started with the records of 1880. There we found Amanda Aurora Tassi, born May 27, 1883. Her father, my great-grandfather, was Jaakko Tassi, and his lineage we traced back to 1700 (there were fires at that time that destroyed church records).</p>
<p class="bq">We visited the farm where Amanda Aurora was born. The people living there [in 1960] had the name of Aarne Rinta-Tassi and were my mother’s cousins. It was a thrill to meet such lively, friendly people, and they were thrilled to meet “American relatives.” There were many stories told about the Tassi family.</p>
<p class="bq">After that, we drove to Kokkola, where a cousin of my mother lived. Under her direction we found the town of Sievi, where an old aunt was still living in an “old folks’ hospital.” I was impressed with the way Finland cares for the elderly.</p>
<p class="bq">“Eliina Täti” was in a room with two other old ladies. One was ninety-six years old—a Carelian, and still as spry as ever, but had a broken hip bone. We took pictures of them and you’d have thought we gave them a million dollars, they were so impressed.</p>
<p class="bq">The most exciting moment of this visit was when Eliina Tati looked at me and said that somehow I looked like her sister, Ruusu (Amanda Aurora). We found old photos of my grandmother and were amazed at the resemblance between her and my mother.</p>
<p class="bql">I don’t think anything can be more thrilling than to find out about ancestors. We have looked into other branches of the family tree too, but they are more difficult to locate.</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">I also wrote articles about my time traveling around Finland, courtesy of the United States Information Service, to talk to Finnish women about American food.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqf">I’ve had the most interesting few days again, giving demonstrations at Rovaniemi.</p>
<p class="bq">The most striking thing about Rovaniemi, which is in Lapin lääni, the farthest north of Finland’s cities, was the sparkling, absolutely brilliant sunshine. I have never experienced such a beautiful winter sun—not even in Minnesota!</p>
<p class="bq">One of the first things that came up in my conversation with the teachers at the school I visited was the exact location of the Arctic Circle. According to the map, Rovaniemi is exactly on the Arctic Circle. But I was told that the Arctic Circle changes, according to the occasion. The most prominent change (and the best-kept secret of the time) was the time Eleanor Roosevelt visited Rovaniemi. It was a big occasion for her to see the Arctic Circle. But she didn’t know that until that time, not much was made of the Arctic Circle except that people knew it was there. It was “moved” to a convenient spot, and a special hut was constructed and special markers made. There was some “last-minute rush” I was told. The last nails were driven and fresh paint was drying as Eleanor’s plane landed.</p>
<p class="bq">The people who “made” the Arctic Circle had to rush and clean up and then dress up in their Lapp costumes and greet the gal! I guess Rovaniemi is much like the typical American town where there are a few people who do everything.</p>
<p class="bq">The Finns and Lapps were much taken by Eleanor. They liked her. In fact, last fall when Dick was in Rovaniemi, he met a Lapp who had proposed to her and if she wasn’t married the next time she came to Rovaniemi he would marry her. At last report they were both still unattached. By the way, this fellow has a brother in Minnesota.</p>
<p class="bq">Well, the Arctic Circle was not moved for me (sigh). I did go to see the markers, though, and had my picture taken next to it. I demonstrated hamburgers, apple pie, lemon pie, and popcorn to the Rovaniemians. Again, popcorn stole the show.</p>
<p class="bq">I had had plans to visit a relative near Rovaniemi, my uncle Frank’s wife’s sister. But alas, I found that she lived about forty miles out of Rovaniemi, southward, toward Kemi. So, we must leave that visit until next summer.</p>
<p class="bq">One of the funniest things happened in Kajaani, the other city I visited. The director of the school had reserved a hotel room for me under the name “Ojakangas.” Well, another Ojakangas walked in just before me and took the room! It was sheer coincidence as even in Finland our name is an odd one. The most pleasant thing was that for the first time, we met another Ojakangas. Are we related?</p>
<p class="bql">The hotel quickly got me another room with apologies!</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">In another article later that year, I wrote about our experiences with the wonderful Finnish tradition of Vappu.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqf">Finland has burst into springtime!</p>
<p class="bq">It’s May 5 and the grass has been green already for a couple of weeks, crocuses are blooming, pussy-willows are almost little leaves, and the kids have eliminated their heavy winter clothes. It all seemed to happen the weekend of May Day. In Finland it is called “Vappu” and is a very big celebration. It is like our homecomings and proms and Fourth of July all in one. People just go crazy. Downtown was as colorful as it ever is during the whole year. Mostly, it was due to the people selling balloons. The bunches of balloons are the biggest things I have ever seen; they are at least twice as tall as the people selling them. There were hundreds of balloon salesmen all over town—balloons of all colors. Every little kid had one. We ended up buying a new balloon every day, expensive as they were. The cheapest balloons sold for 100 marks (about 32 cents) and the price ranged all the way up to 1,000 marks! Besides balloons, colorful shakers, streamers, party masks and hats added to the scene.</p>
<p class="bq">Sunday night was “Vappu Eve”—always the night before May 1st and is the traditional University Student holiday. The order of the day is to stay up all night. We hadn’t planned on doing much but looking around downtown, seeing “Haavis Amanda” (a statue of a woman in the center of a fountain) get crowned with a white University Student’s cap, at midnight, and to see all of the students put on their white caps, too. Luckily, we have a friend who used to be a student and he got us into a couple of student dances, one before midnight and one after—for the sake of seeing student life in action.</p>
<p class="bq">All I can say is that UMD was never like this. The holiday spirit added to the atmosphere, but these dances were really wild. We couldn’t help but think what our “chaperones” at dances really stop.</p>
<p class="bq">The next day we saw Finnish humor in action. May Day during the day is meant for the kids, so we took ours to the traditional spot “Ullanlinna” where the students have a program. There, an “ooompa German band,” as we would call it, made up of university students was playing. It was a beautiful warm day and the band started from the top of a hill in a park, played a couple of pieces and the students would dance until they stumbled on a stone or on a stump, and laugh. This “rickety” band meandered all over town stopping here and there, sometimes climbing a tree or onto the top of a car and then they would play there.</p>
<p class="bq">Finns are usually reserved, but not on May Day. That is their one day to let off steam and be as goofy as they wish and do everything to excess. The next day they settle down to be their usual reserved selves.</p>
<p class="bq">There was a Communist parade somewhere in town. Nobody bothered to attend when it was in downtown Helsinki. A few marched around displaying medals and Russian flags.</p>
<p class="bql">Now, the next day, the town is quiet, the balloons are gone and the people are exhausted. But it was during this holiday that spring sprang!</p>

<div class="recipe">
<p class="rph" id="rcp25">
<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">May Day Tippaleipä</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">These fritters are served in Finland during the May Day celebrations along with a homemade sparkling beverage called Sima.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 cup milk</p>
<p class="rpil">2 eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">Hot oil or fat for frying</p>
<p class="rpill">Powdered sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Stir the milk, eggs, salt and flour until smooth.</p>
<p class="rp">Heat the fat or oil to 375°F. Pour about 1 cup of the batter into a small, heavy-duty plastic bag with a zip-top closure. With scissors, cut a tiny hole in one corner, about 1/8 inch in diameter. Drizzle the batter into the hot fat, swirling the bag in a continuous round to form a bird’s nest shape, three or four inches in diameter.</p>
<p class="rp">Fry 1 minute on each side. Remove from fat and drain on paper towels. Sift powdered sugar over.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 15 tippaleipä</p>
<p class="rph" id="rcp26">
<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Sima</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This is a non-alcoholic, lemon-flavored fizzy drink.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">4 quarts water</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup brown sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup granulated sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">2 lemons, washed and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rpil">1/8 teaspoon dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpill">1 tablespoon raisins plus extra sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Heat the water to boiling and stir in the sugars. Add the lemon slices. Cool to lukewarm. Pour into a non-metal container such as an ice-cream pail. Add the yeast. Let stand at room temperature overnight or at least 8 to 10 hours until little bubbles appear around the edges of the liquid.</p>
<p class="rp">Strain the liquid into sterilized bottles (8 pints or 4 quarts). Add 1 teaspoon sugar and a few raisins to each bottle. Cork tightly. Let stand at room temperature until the raisins have risen to the top of the bottle, indicating that the sima is ready to drink. In warm weather this may take only about 8 hours. Serve chilled.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 8 pints or 4 quarts of beverage</p>
