</h1>
<p class="pf">When I found I could enroll in a week of classes with Simone Beck, the renowned French chef and cookbook author also known as Simca, I was truly excited. I had gathered enough frequent flyer miles and saved enough money to apply for admission and cover my airfare to and from France.</p>
<p>After writing to Simca and confirming dates, I committed to a week in her kitchen. I was so thrilled, and anticipation covered the days and weeks before I left. When the day to leave finally arrived, it felt unreal. I had so many mixed emotions. I felt like I was deserting those who needed me at home. I felt a little selfish for taking the time and the money for this trip. Yet I felt privileged that I could go, in spite of the fact that I had to rely on credit cards for incidental expenses. I prayed for lots of inspiration to come to me because of the trip.</p>
<p>Simca and her husband, Jean Fischbacher, met me and another cooking student named Geraldine at Charles de Gaulle Airport. Bags safely in the trunk of their car, we had a hair-raising ride through the winding roads and villages to Bramafan in Provence, where La Pitchoune (the “little one”) sat with its red tile roof and white stucco exterior. This was to be our home for the next few days. Our quarters and the instruction kitchen were in “La Campanette,” a nearby five-year-old building made to house cooking school students such as us.</p>
<p>We were greeted with a tray of snack bits, little radishes, and one-inch squares of duck pâté. This was going to be a week of fabulous eating. After the snack, we were given a lunch of a gratin of celeriac and potatoes, French bread with sweet butter and home-cured olives, terrine of pork, and a green salad. Dead tired from the overnight flight and feeling like a zombie, after we ate I plopped onto the bed in the room assigned to me. Even though I hated to miss a beautiful afternoon, I slept for almost three hours. When I awoke, we were invited to the château for a raspberry aperitif and sandwiches of prosciutto on large croutons spread with mustard.</p>
<p>What followed was a planning session for the week ahead. On Monday we boned chicken, stuffed and rolled it, and made pastries (pâté brisée) for quiches and tarts. And that was just Monday. All the steps were worked out in great detail. Because I didn’t speak French, Geraldine, who could, captured Simca’s attention. That was fine with me, as I had time to observe and realize that there was nothing really new to me in any of the lessons.</p>
<p>The kitchen assistant, Jeanette, was a funny, fat, squat little lady who wore tennis shoes and chewed on a violet stem all the time, the blossom end drooping from her mouth. I was totally entertained as I observed the dynamics of the characters in the kitchen. When I’d ask a question, Simca faced Geraldine to give the answer. Jeanette, who spoke no English, was kind and never wrong about anything. Geraldine kowtowed to Simca, and I was like a fence post in the corner, soaking it all in.</p>
<p>We also traveled. We were taken shopping in nearby Cannes, and to St. Paul de Vence and Tourrettes-sur-Loup to visit two old medieval cities and to a little charcuterie in Plascassier to learn how to make chicken ballotine.</p>
<p>We made terrines, brioche with a pâte in the center, apple tart, tart de Nancy, and many other wonderful dishes based on pastry. We also prepared poached foie gras, quenelles, mousseline of fish, a terrine with macaroni and sorrel sauce, crème caramel, chocolate soufflé, stuffed sole paupiettes, among many other things.</p>
<p>The highlight of the week was a five-course dinner at Le Moulin de Mougins arranged for us by Simca and prepared by the world-famous chef Roger Vergé himself. He greeted us with a basket of truffles with an aroma so intoxicating, it is still implanted in my psyche. I slept that night with my hand perfumed by one of the prized truffles, a “food of the kings” that the chef had allowed me to hold. I didn’t wash that hand until the next day. And the dinner was a bargain at 511 francs for the two of us.</p>

</p>
<p class="rpf">This special almond dessert tart was a specialty of Simone Beck’s. It is kind of sweet and rich, so I like to serve it in very small pieces. The white wine gives a nice, flaky texture to the pastry. If you prefer, you can substitute fresh lemon juice.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 recipe pâté sucrée (recipe follows)</p>
<p class="rpil">5 heaping tablespoons apricot jam</p>
<p class="rpil">2 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">¾ cup pulverized toasted almonds</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p class="rpil">3 tablespoons milk</p>
<p class="rpil">Pinch of salt</p>
<p class="rpill">Powdered sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Make the pastry and line an 8- or 9-inch tart pan (preferably with removable bottom) with the pastry. Chill about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spread the pastry with the jam and bake for 10 minutes. Put the egg whites into a separate bowl and the yolks into a saucepan (not aluminum). Gradually beat the sugar into the yolks, waiting after each addition until the mixture is runny before adding more sugar. Beat in the pulverized almonds, vanilla, and milk. Mixture will be very thick. Set over low heat, stirring, until sugar has melted. Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff but not dry. Stir a bit of the whites into the yolk mixture; then fold all back into the whites. Fill the tart shell with this almond cream. Bake for 18 minutes until top is puffed and browned. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Increase oven heat to 450°F and bake until the sugar is lightly caramelized.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 8 servings</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Pâté Sucrée</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This is a very slightly sweetened butter pastry that is ideal for a dessert tart, as it isn’t really sweet but makes the flavors blend well.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">½ cup (1 stick) chilled butter, preferably unsalted, plus 1 tablespoon more</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 egg, slightly beaten</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon white wine or lemon juice</p>
<p class="rpill">3 to 5 tablespoons ice water</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Cut the butter into tiny bits and drop into bowl containing the flour, salt, and sugar. Using a pastry blender, two knives, or a pastry fork, cut in butter until the mixture resembles dry oatmeal. Be careful not to overblend. Beat the egg, white wine or lemon juice, and 3 tablespoons of the ice water together using a fork. Make a well in the flour mixture and stir in the egg mixture. Stir with a fork until flour is moistened and add a tablespoon or so more water if necessary. Press mixture into a ball. Flour the heel of your hand and knead lightly just a few times. Wrap the pastry in foil or plastic wrap and chill 20 minutes. To line a tart shell, roll the pastry to about 1/8 inch thick, fit it into the pan, and trim to the edge of the pan.</p>
