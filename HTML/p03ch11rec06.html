<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Here is a homey dish made with the cultivated mushrooms that are available all year round. It is easy and delicious. The rice absorbs the flavors of the mushrooms and of the almost caramelized onions, as well as of the chicken stock and sherry. I like it with the larger quantity of mushrooms, but you may prefer the lesser amount. Use white button mushrooms or the brown creminis, which have a stronger flavor.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">10 ounces to 1 pound mushrooms, trimmed and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups chicken or vegetable stock (or 2 cups water plus 1 bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="qun1">½ cup dry oloroso sherry</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a large casserole. Put in the mushrooms and sauté over medium-low heat, adding salt and pepper and turning them occasionally for 8 to 10 minutes, until they have given up their juices. Take them out, leaving the oil and juices behind.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the onion and cook, uncovered, stirring often, over high heat for 3 minutes to evaporate the juices, then lower the heat and cook for about 20 minutes, until golden brown and almost jammy. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for a minute or so, until aromatic. Return the mushrooms, add the rice, and stir so that the grains are well coated with the oily juices. (You can prepare the dish in advance up to this stage and set aside at room temperature; reheat before continuing.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, bring the stock and sherry to a boil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the stock mixture over the mushrooms and rice, add salt to taste, and stir well, then cook, covered, over medium heat, without stirring, for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, covered, for another 10 minutes, or until the rice is tender, adding a little boiling water if the rice seems too dry. Let stand covered for 5 minutes before serving.</p>

<p class="summary1">If you are lucky enough to have wild mushrooms, you can use them, cut in half or in quarters if they are large, instead of the cultivated ones.</p>
