</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This sublime Minorcan specialty can be found in restaurants along the Balearic coast. The spiny lobster, queen of the local seas, was once considered poor food, which only the fishermen who fished it off the rocky coast would eat. The hotpot is in the classic Catalan style, starting with a</span> sofrito <span class="italic">of fried onion, pepper, and tomatoes and ending with a</span> picada <span class="italic">of almonds, garlic, and parsley to thicken the sauce. Serve it with toasted slices of a good country bread or a baguette to dunk in the sauce. Offer lobster picks or thin forks or skewers for people to extract the lobster meat from the claws and legs, spoons for them to eat the sauce with, and finger bowls.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Buy your lobsters live, and ask the fishmonger to kill and chop them for you. Have him separate the head, legs, and meaty claws from the tail and cut the tail lengthwise in half or crosswise into four pieces. He can discard the black intestinal vein or not, and the tomalley or liver (the green mass inside the head is considered a delicacy but may contain toxins). The roe, or coral—if the lobsters are female—is both edible and tasty and can go in the sauce. Ask him to crack the legs a little. Or do it all yourself at home with a heavy knife.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 green or red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">¾ pound tomatoes (4 to 5), peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">4½ cups fish stock</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup Cognac or other brandy</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">A few fennel sprigs, torn into pieces (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">14 ounces monkfish fillet, cut into cubes</p>
<p class="qun">Two 1½-pound lobsters, cut into large chunks (see headnote on page 345)</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE</span> <span class="bolditalic">PICADA</span></p>
<p class="qun">12 blanched whole almonds</p>
<p class="qun">3 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun">½ to 1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup Cognac or other brandy</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR SERVING</span></p>
<p class="qun1">6 slices of country bread, lightly toasted</p>
<p class="recsum">Fry the onion and the pepper in the oil in a large <span class="italic">cazuela</span> or casserole over low heat until very soft. Add the tomatoes and sugar and cook until the sauce is reduced and jammy. Use an immersion blender to blend it to a cream directly in the pan, or use a food processor and return it to the pan.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the fish stock and brandy and season with salt and pepper. Add the fennel, if using, then add the monkfish and lobster, bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, for the <span class="italic">picada:</span> Fry the almonds and garlic in the oil in a small skillet over low heat for moments only, turning them once, until they are golden. Pound them to a paste with the parsley in a mortar, or blend them to a paste, and add the brandy.</p>
<p class="summary">Stir the <span class="italic">picada</span> into the simmering sauce and cook for 3 minutes more, or until the lobster shells turn a deep red and the meat is opaque, with a firm texture. Serve in bowls and pass around toasted slices of bread.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">For a Catalan version, stir 1 to 2 tablespoons grated bittersweet chocolate into the sauce at the end.</p>
