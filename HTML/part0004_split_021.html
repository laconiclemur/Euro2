			<p class="rec-intro">You might be surprised by the touch of curry here, but there are many French dishes that do include curry powder, especially in the south. This is a really simple recipe, but you need to make the flavoured oil well in advance to give time for the flavours to infuse and develop. The recipe makes far more oil than you need for this dish, but it’s a great thing to have in your store cupboard and goes well with salads, fish or grilled chicken. Do give the chargrilled bread a try. It is the ideal accompaniment to the fish, not just a decoration.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">600g courgettes</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 white onion, peeled</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">unsalted butter</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">handful of basil leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 slices of sourdough bread</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 small red mullet (200–300g each), filleted but with skin on</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">Curry oil</p>

			<p class="body">First prepare the curry oil. Heat the curry powder carefully in a dry pan for 5 minutes to release the oils and flavour. Add the oil and heat to 40°C, then cover and leave to cool. After 24 hours, pour the oil through a muslin cloth, then store in a bottle in a cool dark place. </p>
			<p class="body">Wash and dice all but a couple of the courgettes, slice the onion and crush the garlic cloves. </p>
			<p class="body">Melt a tablespoon of butter in a large pan and sweat the vegetables for 5 minutes. Add the 2 teaspoons of curry powder and continue to cook for a further 5 minutes. Pour in the boiling water, season and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the basil leaves and blitz in a food processor until smooth. Keep the mixture warm until you are ready to serve. </p>
			<p class="body">Cut the remaining courgettes into thin ribbons on a mandolin or into fine strips. Cook these gently in a little butter for a minute or so, then season and keep warm. Brush the slices of bread with oil and grill them on a hot ridged grill pan until toasted and nicely marked with the grill lines.</p>
			<p class="body">Check that all the pin bones have been removed from the red mullet fillets, then season them lightly and smear them with olive oil. Heat the grill pan and cook the mullet until just tender.</p>
			<p class="body">Serve a bed of courgette cream on to each plate and add some ribbons, or strips, of courgette. Place the fish on top and drizzle with the curry-infused olive oil. Serve with the slices of grilled bread.</p>
