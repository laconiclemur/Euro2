<p class="author1"><span class="txit">costolette farcite al prosciutto e fontina</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This is a great dish to serve when you are celebrating a special occasion. It is generous, rich, and will leave your guests happy and full. It has the added advantage of not requiring too much time in the kitchen on the day of the special event. The chops can be stuffed, breaded, and refrigerated several hours in advance and the veal cooks quickly.</p>
<p class="indentb">Thickly sliced pork chops or boneless chicken breast may also be stuffed and cooked this way. Serve with asparagus, steamed artichokes, spinach, or an arugula salad with sliced tomato as a side dish.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 veal chops cut from the rack, bone in (about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound each)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> ounces Fontina cheese, cut into 4 equal pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 very thin slices prosciutto</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 large eggs, beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">About 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons canola oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, quartered</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Have the butcher cut each chop in half horizontally, leaving it still joined by the bone, to form a pocket. Place each chop between two layers of plastic wrap and pound to a <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch thickness. Open the pocket and place a single sage leaf on the bottom portion of each chop. Layer 1 slice of Fontina between 2 slices of prosciutto inside each chop. Drizzle the top slice of prosciutto with <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> tablespoon of the olive oil. Close the pocket by gently pulling the top section of meat slightly over the bottom section.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Dredge the chops in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the chops into the beaten eggs and then into the bread crumbs, coating well. Arrange the chops on a baking sheet and press the pocket of each chop firmly closed with the side of a wide knife. Allow the <a id="page_257"/>chops to sit for at least 5 minutes before cooking. (Refrigerate if it will be more than 30 minutes before cooking. Bring to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat, warm the butter and the canola oil. When the butter is hot and foaming, add the chops. Cook until well browned, about 5 minutes, and then turn. Season with salt and pepper, and reduce the heat to medium. Continue cooking until the other side is well browned, about 7 minutes. Remove the chops from the pan and drain on paper towels before serving each chop with one of the lemon quarters.</p>
