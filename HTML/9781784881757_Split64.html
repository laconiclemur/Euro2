<p class="tx2"><b>Livia is a dear friend of ours who lives on a smallholding with her husband Nello. She invented this dish when we arrived for a spontaneous supper with a selection of Pecorino and all she had were some slices of turkey and plenty of sage in the garden. We loved it and now cook it at home for family suppers. The parcels can be prepared in advance and kept in the fridge, covered, for a day.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 8 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 or 2 turkey breasts, or 6 escalopes, weighing approx. 850 g (1 lb 14 oz)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small bunch of sage leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) young Pecorino or Fontina, cut into 18 finger-sized pieces</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) dry white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 ml (5 fl oz/generous ⅔ cup) <a href="9781784881757_Split15.html#page_32">Chicken</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split19.html#page_35a">Vegetable Stock</a></b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>sautéed spinach or Swiss chard (see <a href="9781784881757_Split21.html#page_38">cooking greens</a>) (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b><a href="9781784881757_Split129.html#page_224">Potatoes &amp; Leeks or Spring Onions</a> (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Cut the turkey breast into 8 slices around 2 cm (¾ in) thick. Put a piece of turkey between two sheets of cling film (plastic wrap) and use a meat tenderiser or the base of a small pan to bash the meat out until it reaches a thickness of 1 cm (½ in).</p>
<p class="tx">Season one side of the turkey with salt and pepper and lay 3 sage leaves over the top, spread out from one another. Put 3 slices of cheese on top. Roll the turkey up, folding the sides in where possible, and secure with a toothpick or two. Repeat for each piece of turkey. You will have to improvise as each piece will be a slightly different shape; some may look like rolls and some like parcels. Don’t worry too much about the cheese escaping – it will melt into the sauce anyway. Season each parcel with salt and pepper. Set aside in the fridge until you are ready to cook.</p>
<p class="tx">Heat the oil in a large non-stick lidded pan over a medium–high heat. When the oil is hot, put the turkey parcels into the pan. Brown for 5 minutes, uncovered, on each side or until golden. Pour in the wine and stock and bring to the boil. Put the lid on the pan slightly ajar and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes, then turn the parcels. Put the lid on ajar again and cook for a further 10 minutes. Pierce the parcels with a skewer to make sure the juices run clear and not pink.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove the parcels from the pan and keep warm. Boil the juices down until reduced to about 150 ml (5 fl oz). Serve with the juices from the pan, sautéed spinach or swiss chard, and the <a href="9781784881757_Split129.html#page_224">Potatoes &amp; Leeks or Spring Onions</a>.</p>
