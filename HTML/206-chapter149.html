<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Combining these three iconic, bold ingredients makes a surprising, delicious dessert that is highly popular in Andalucía. Having eaten many variations of this in the south, I always prefer it with the orange pieces chopped up—thus juicier and eaten with a spoon—rather than prepared with the orange sliced into rounds and eaten with a small fork and knife. Both are typical, though.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">       This recipe needs at least a half hour to sit before eating. Prepare it before lunch or dinner, allow the flavors to meld during the meal, and it will be perfect for dessert. Choose a bold, even sharp extra-virgin olive oil and a highly aromatic honey to complement it. Serve with a couple of sweet biscuits or cookies.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Working over a large salad bowl to catch any juices that fall, peel the oranges and remove as much of the white pith as possible. Cut crosswise into ½&gt;- to ¾-inch-/1.25- to 2-cm-thick rounds and then roughly chop into pieces. Place in the bowl.</p>
