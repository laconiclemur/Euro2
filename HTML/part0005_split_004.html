			<p class="rec-intro">Bresse is just north of Lyon and famous for its chickens, which are expensive but so good and deserve special treatment. This dish is a great classic of French cuisine and one that I first came across when working for Alain Chapel at Mionnay. On a busy night we would sell 20 of these chickens and the wonderful aroma filled the kitchen and dining room alike. Cooking in a pig’s bladder like this is a method that cooks have used for centuries, and the current fashion for cooking meat in vacuum pouches in a water bath is simply a version of this – it’s nothing new. </p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp each of chicken stock (see <a href="part0010_split_002.html#chicken-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>), Madeira wine and brandy </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp truffle juice (available in cans)</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp Madeira wine</p>

			<p class="body">Pigs’ bladders are sold dried so your <span class="italic">vessie</span> will need to be soaked in cold water for a couple of hours until soft and pliable. </p>
			<p class="body">Remove the giblets from the chicken. Trim the neck, winglets and feet and set them aside with the giblets. Now put a little oil on your fingers and slide slices of truffle under the skin of the chicken breast, being very careful not to break the skin. Season the inside of the chicken well, then place it inside the bladder. Add more seasoning, then pour the stock, brandy, Madeira and truffle juice into the bladder with the chicken. Knot the top and tie it with string to be on the safe side, then place it in a large pan of simmering, salted water to cook for 1½ hours. Leave to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
			<p class="body">While the chicken is poaching, blanch the vegetables separately in salted, boiling water, keeping them al dente, then refresh them in cold water and set aside. Trim the girolles so they’re ready to cook at the last minute.</p>
			<p class="body">Heat the vegetable oil in a pan and brown the chicken trimmings, giblets and shallots, then deglaze with Madeira. Add the stock, bring it to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Pass the liquid through a fine sieve, then pour it back into the pan, add the cream and reduce to a sauce consistency. Keep the sauce warm.</p>
			<p class="body">Cook the girolles in a little butter and season with salt and pepper. Warm the blanched vegetables through in butter. </p>
			<p class="body">Once the chicken has rested, break open the bladder and carve the bird. Serve with the sauce, vegetables and girolles.</p>
