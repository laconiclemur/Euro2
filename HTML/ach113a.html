<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_222"/>cauliflower, herb, and anchovy timbale</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">timballo di cavolfiore, erbette fresche, e acciuga</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">In this recipe the anchovies complement the cauliflower perfectly without giving the dish a fishy flavor. And similar to a potato gratin, it may be prepared ahead of time and reheated in the oven. Timbale is very nice served as a side dish with roasted chicken, or it may be served as a lunch dish with crunchy bread and a tossed green salad.</p>
<p class="indentb">Here is a tip I learned from Gianni: When boiling the cauliflower, always add a little flour and lemon juice as you prepare the cooking water. This helps the cauliflower to retain its white color. In this recipe he adds a slice of onion to flavor the water. You may also add herbs, carrots, or celery to make a broth for the cauliflower to cook in. Follow this same procedure when you cook artichokes.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 medium-size head cauliflower, rinsed and separated into florets</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick slice onion</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup diced onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> tablespoon ground nutmeg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped anchovy fillets</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease a 9-inch round casserole or baking pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Sprinkle the bread crumbs on the bottom and sides of the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Add the cauliflower florets, 1 tablespoon of the flour, the lemon juice, and the onion slice. Simmer until the florets are easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain, discarding the onion slice, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_223"/><span class="red">3.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the diced onions and drained cauliflower. Stir in the parsley, marjoram, and nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the florets start sticking to the pan a bit, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and coarsely mash the cauliflower with the back of a wooden spoon or with a potato masher. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle in the remaining 3 tablespoons flour. Mix well, then stir in the milk. Continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens and the milk has been absorbed, about 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Remove from the heat and stir in the anchovies. Stir in <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the Parmesan cheese. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup Parmesan on top. Bake until heated through and golden brown on top, about 25 minutes.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Once the cauliflower has finished baking, arrange <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices fresh tomatoes on top. Set aside for a few moments to allow the cauliflower to warm the tomatoes through before serving.</p>
<p class="noindenta">For a rich version of this dish, heavy cream may be substituted for the milk. For a lighter version of this dish, olive oil may be substituted for the butter.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Four hard-boiled eggs may be sliced and arranged between the layers of the cooked cauliflower before baking.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Other cheeses such as Fontina, Gruyère, or Asiago may be substituted for the Parmesan.</p>
<p class="noindenta">This cauliflower mixture is terrific served over cooked penne. Eliminate the baking dish and follow the basic recipe. After adding the milk to the cauliflower, cook 1 pound of penne in rapidly boiling salted water until al dente, following the package instructions. Complete the cauliflower recipe, reserving the final <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the Parmesan cheese. Add the cooked drained penne to the pan with the cauliflower mixture and toss. Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup Parmesan.</p>
