<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001196">Slow-braising is unpredictable: the cooking liquid might reduce to nothing, or you might have perfectly cooked meat, but lots of thin stock. However, it’s easy enough to fix. Just add water (not more stock, it will make it too strong-tasting) if you want more sauce or, if it’s too liquid, remove the meat, put the pan on the heat and reduce down.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001197">Any leftovers make delicious tempura.</p>

<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001198">1 oxtail (ask your butcher to cut it into 5cm pieces)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001199">200g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001200">rapeseed or sunflower oil, for frying</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001201">30ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001202">1 onion, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001203">4 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001204">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001205">1 leek, finely diced</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001211">Dust the oxtail pieces with flour. Put about 3½cm of rapeseed or sunflower oil into a pan on a medium heat. Add the floured oxtail pieces and caramelize until they are crispy and golden brown, then drain on kitchen paper. Preheat the oven to 200°C.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001212">Put the olive oil into an ovenproof pan, large enough to hold the oxtail, and place on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic with a pinch of salt and allow to caramelize, then add the rest of the vegetables and the bay leaves and cook until very soft. Add the wine and cook until most of it has evaporated, then pour in the chicken stock and bring to the boil. Return the oxtail to the pan, cover with foil, and braise in the oven for 2½ hours, until the oxtail is very soft and the meat is falling off the bone.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001213">Remove the oxtail from the pan. Wait for the cooking liquid to cool slightly, then skim the fat off from the top. Return the pan to the heat and reduce the sauce down until slightly sticky and syrupy, then put the oxtail back into the pan. Serve with mashed potato. Pray that there is some left over.</p>
<p class="c_head1" id="sab0001214">Note: Leftovers: tempura</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0001215">Pass the vegetables through a sieve, then reduce the sauce until thick. Break the oxtail into pieces, using your hands. Dip the pieces of oxtail first in flour, then in whisked egg and panko breadcrumbs, and shallow-fry in olive oil. Serve with the sauce, some chilli jam, and with chopped fresh coriander on top.</p>
