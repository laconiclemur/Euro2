<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Roasted artichokes are a classic garnish for meat on the grill. Usually just moistened with olive oil and seasoned with salt, the flavors of the artichokes are natural and delicious but do not distract from the main course they accompany. But hollowed slightly and filled with a bit of chopped dry-cured jamón, they become a delightful first course or tapa. To serve as a tapa, calculate one stuffed artichoke per person as part of a spread of various dishes.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 LEMON, HALVED</li>
<li>8 MEDIUM ARTICHOKES</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP LOOSELY PACKED/60 G FINELY CHOPPED DRY-CURED SPANISH JAM<span class="serif">Ó</span>N <a href="11-turning.html#page_16">(SEE INGREDIENT NOTE, PAGE 16)</a></li>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Fill a large bowl with cool water. Cut the lemon into wedges, squeeze into the water, and then drop them into the bowl.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Working with one artichoke at a time, rinse under cold running water. Cut or pull away the toughest outer petals and then trim off the top section so that the center is revealed. Loosen the leaves by firmly rolling the artichoke under the palm of your hand until you hear a slight crunch. Immediately drop it into the lemon water to keep from discoloring. Repeat with the remaining artichokes. When ready to use, rinse, and turn the artichokes upside down on absorbent towels to drain.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Using a finger, make a space in the center of each artichoke. Fill the center of each with 1 tablespoon of jamón. Set the artichokes upright in a baking dish or roasting pan.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Sprinkle the artichokes with salt and drizzle the olive oil over the top. Pour about 1 cup/240 ml water around the bases of the artichokes. Cover with a tent of aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes, or until tender. Serve warm.</p>
