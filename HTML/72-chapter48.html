<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Stuffing vegetables in the Balearic Islands is a favorite way of utilizing the ample summer offerings of the <em>huerto</em> (garden)—zucchini, peppers, artichokes, and especially eggplant. Many in the islands call these by the descriptive name <em>barquetes d’aubergínia</em> (little boats of eggplant). Some stuff eggplant with ground meat, though as often as not, the stuffing is just a mixture of vegetables. These make a delightful first course.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Trim the stems of the eggplants. Wash and cut the eggplants in half lengthwise. Place in a colander, generously sprinkle with salt, and let them sweat away some of their bitterness for 30 minutes. You will see dark beads appear on the surface. Gently rinse under cool running water. Place in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and let drain and cool in a colander.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, carefully scoop out the insides, leaving the shells and shape intact; set the shells aside. Discard some of the seeds. Finely chop the eggplant pulp with a large knife.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large sauté pan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the carrot and cook until it softens, turning a yellowish orange color, and loses its rawness, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Incorporate the eggplant pulp, mixing together and tapping down on it with the flat bottom of a wooden spoon, until pasty and very soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and the nutmeg. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Spoon the filling into the eggplant shells. Arrange them on a baking sheet or in a baking dish. Spread a scant 1 tablespoon of breadcrumbs over each and drizzle with olive oil.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Broil until the tops of the eggplants are golden, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.</p>
