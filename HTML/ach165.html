<p class="author1"><span class="txit">biscotti casarecci del ponticello</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe was given to Gianni by the proprietor of a bakery in his hometown in Italy. The bakery, called Ponticello—which means “little bridge”—has been run by one family for four generations, with each generation passing this recipe on to the next. They were originally cooked in the bakery’s coal oven, just as the embers were dying. Gianni recommends serving these cookies for a sweet at breakfast or with coffee after dinner, or using them in place of the ladyfingers in tiramisu.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons baking powder</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Pinch of kosher salt</span></p>

Gradually beat the flour mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the orange extract into the milk, and with the mixer running, gradually add the milk to the batter.

Remove to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.</p>
