<p class="fm" id="fm">From the famous Boquería in Barcelona to the tiny village markets of rural Spain, market life and fresh regional products are at the heart of Spanish life and cuisine. <strong>The Real Taste of Spain</strong>
 focuses on basic ingredients and core principles to offer simple and delicious Spanish recipes.</p>
<p class="fm">Here are the everyday foods of Spain that are central to good home cooking: plump tomatoes, fresh fish and vegetables, ripe fruits, tasty cheeses and perfectly cured meats. With more and more of us wishing to eat a varied and healthy diet, this beautifully illustrated cookbook and reference combines this demand with Spanish food’s ever-increasing popularity.</p>
<p class="fm">Divided by the stalls you would find in the local market: shellfish, fresh fish, charcuterie, meat, poultry and game, rice and pulses, groceries, eggs and dairy, the bakery, vegetables and fruit, each section offers delicious recipes for the type of produce on offer. Jenny Chandler brings the vitality of the market to life with introductions to each stall and explanations of the products. She also includes traditional cooking techniques and easy variations for each recipe.</p>
<p class="fm">With a few Spanish store-cupboard essentials and good fresh, local produce, be it from the markets of Bristol or Bilbao, you will be well on your way to re-creating the real taste of Spain.<br/>
