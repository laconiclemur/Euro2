  <p class="h2b"><a id="page_298"/><span class="italic">Evacuate the TV Studio!</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1"><span class="small">I’M NOT KNOWN FOR HAVING</span> a “sweet tooth,” and I’ve never really been into cookies and candy. Maybe this is because I’ve always had easy access to them. If I was craving sugar as a kid, all I had to do was to walk into Manager Kerstin’s refrigerator at Ramlösa Tavern and take my fill, which quickly took all the fun out of it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Most of the time, simple things are the best. When I was young, I preferred Grandma’s rosehip soup with a dollop of whipped cream and crushed cardamom cookies on top. Just mentioning that treat is enough to give me a craving for it! Or her everyday dessert “lingonberries with milk” served in a tall glass to be scooped up with a spoon.</p>

  <p class="indent">When it comes to more sophisticated sweets, it’s important to take your time and keep your tongue in your mouth—no nibbling! It is worth test-baking a cake a few times to get really familiar with the recipe. And never bake if you’re stressed, because that’s a recipe for disaster.</p>

  <p class="indent">One time, I was preparing a surprise party for my colleague and editor Martin Sundborn during my “Food” days with Tomas Tengby. I was at the old TV station in Gothenburg, which was nicknamed “The Mirage.” (To be honest, I never really understood the name. That the police station <a id="page_299"/>called “The Baton House” was more understandable to me.) Anyway, the TV station wasn’t exactly housed in a pretty building. It looked like your typical large, public building and was very far removed from any of the glamour you might associate with TV. But I loved the TV station house and the people who worked there. There was soft clatter of Birkenstocks in the hallways and celebrities standing in every corner. Most of my job before taping was to test dishes that we would prepare during the program, and I had an inconspicuous little kitchen in the basement to work in. That was where I was preparing my surprise for Martin. I had just turned on the stove to caramelize the sugar and was standing there stirring, waiting for it to melt. Just then, someone knocked on the door, and outside was a cluster of twenty school children, all staring at me as if they had seen a ghost. I could just imagine what they were thinking: “Is THAT Food-Tina?” “Is that really her?” “She is so tall!” “How can she fit into my TV?” “I have to tell Daddy—she’s his favorite chef!”</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/298-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Then, one of the teachers asked, “Do you mind if we take a picture of you and the kids?”</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/298-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">“Of course not,” I said.</p>

  <p class="indent">And with that, I completely forgot the pot on the stove! Of course, it took some time for the kids to loosen up and <a id="page_300"/>for us to finally get one good shot. Slightly stressed, I said goodbye and ran back into the kitchen, where the caramel had passed through every stage of melted sugar and was now black and as molten as lava from an Icelandic volcano. The fire alarm was sounding at full volume, and to shut it off, I jumped up and smashed it into the floor—just as if I was at home.</p>

  <p class="indent">Well, I had to start all over to make my dessert. When it was finally finished, someone knocked on the door once again. I opened up, assuming it would be Martin. It wasn’t. Outside were five firefighters in full gear—with hoses and helmets and everything.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Didn’t you know the whole building has been evacuated? There are 300 people in the parking lot and all the radio signals are out!”</p>

  <p class="indent">… All of this because of some burnt caramel… it turned out to be one very expensive dessert.…</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/299-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent1">I think it’s important to use real butter and real sugar when baking desserts, as well as real vanilla and high-quality chocolate. Don’t be stingy with the ingredients or the calories. If you’re going to skimp, don’t even bother. Rather, eat less or less often, because dessert is meant to be delicious and they’re meant to be <span class="italic">real</span>! The cream should be <span class="italic">real</span> cream. The fruit should be <span class="italic">real</span> fruit. The chocolate cake should be sticky and the carrot cake moist. And they are all meant to look mouthwatering! Here are my favorites of the world of sweets. Cookies, pies, ice cream, desserts, and sweet juices.</p>

  <p class="pagebreak"/>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_301"/><span class="bold">THINK LIKE TINA</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">READ THE RECIPES CAREFULLY</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Just as when you bake bread, you really have to follow the recipes carefully when baking cookies. The temperature, both of the ingredients and in the oven, are very important—if you’re sloppy, you can ruin the whole treat.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DON’T KNEAD THE SHORTCRUST DOUGH</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">The so-called shortbread-dough and regular short-crust dough should be mixed quickly to avoid creating gluten threads. If a sweet piecrust collapses in the oven, it’s because the dough was worked for too long.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/300-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">A FAILED CAKE? NOT AT ALL!</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Don’t ever throw away an unsuccessful cake! Just spread some whipped cream on top and throw on some berries and lots of powdered sugar.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/300-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">SALT ENHANCES THE FLAVORS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you add a little bit of salt (about half a pinch) to the pound cake batter, it will enhance the flavor of the cake.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DON’T MIX THE POUND CAKE BATTER FOR TOO LONG</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you want your pound cake to rise up big and tall, avoid mixing it for too long after adding the flour and baking powder.</p>

  <p class="h4"><a id="page_302"/><span class="bold">GLAZED BAKERY BUNS</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">You probably have a great sweet bun recipe of your grandma’s, and to make it even greater, I have a tip from our baker Magnus Johansson. Always glaze the buns with egg immediately <span class="italic">after</span> they come out of the oven, not <span class="italic">before</span>, as it says in most recipes. This is what gives the buns a shiny surface, and it keeps the moisture inside the bun longer. Mix one egg with a little bit of water and salt. Glaze the buns right after removing them from the oven. The results will be moist and shiny.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/301-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">LEFTOVER EGG WHITES?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Egg whites can be frozen. They’re great for making meringues (see the lemon meringue pie on <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_336">page 336</a> or the ice cream cake on <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_356">page 356</a>).</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/301-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DRYING FRESH BERRIES</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you have picked berries and your freezer is already full of them, you can always dry the berries instead. Place them on a baking sheet and bake in the oven at 125–140ºF (50–60ºC) for about 3 hours. Open the oven door to let the heat out, and leave the tray with the berries inside the oven to dry overnight. Dried berries intensify in flavor and consistency. Frozen berries <span class="italic">cannot</span> be dried!</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">BETTER TASTING ICE CREAM</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you freeze ice cream or parfaits that won’t be eaten for a while, you should place the plastic wrap directly on the surface of the ice cream or parfait. This prevents that thick, unsavory skin from establishing itself on the surface. The same goes for vanilla sauce and creams.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">QUICK DESSERT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Mix store-bought vanilla ice cream with chopped peppermints, chocolate, or nuts. Put in a nice bowl and set it on the table for all to enjoy.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_305"/>186. Fruit Salad with Spiced Syrup</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I love this type of dessert, where you can just empty the fruit bowl and make syrup from the spices you have at home. And if you don’t have oranges left, this dessert also is lovely spiced with anise and black pepper.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS:</span></p>

  <p class="h2a">187. Melon Salad with Campari and Macadamia Nuts</p>

  <p class="noindentl">The macadamia nut is an Australian hazelnut named after the botanist John Macadam—a fun and useless piece of knowledge if you’re ever on Jeopardy! Use whatever type of melon you have on hand. It’s completely fine if you only use one variety. This is a simple fruit salad to put on the table after a summer barbecue. Partner it with some Greek yogurt.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 small watermelon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ honeydew</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Scoop out balls of melon from all melons with a melon baller, or peel the melons and cut them into small pieces. Put the melon balls in the Campari mix. Let rest in the fridge for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Sprinkle macadamia nuts on top and serve.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">MANGOS AND PEACHES</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">Mangos and peaches work just as well with the Campari mix. Try it and you’ll see!</span></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_306"/>188. Orange Salad with Dates and Roasted Walnuts</p>

  <p class="noindentl">It doesn’t have to get any more complicated than this, so don’t overdo it when you hear the word dessert. It doesn’t have to be a grand affair. I think dessert is more about making an effort for your guests or family. Try this delicious orange salad and discover how you can surprise your guests with only simple ingredients.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">6 oranges</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) roasted walnuts (see <a href="../Text/006_Chapter002.html#page_28">page 28</a>)</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Scoop the yogurt into a bowl and drizzle the remaining syrup on top.</p>

  <p class="h2a">189. Vanilla-poached Rhubarb with Mom’s Soft-serve Ice Cream</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Memorize this recipe! It’s important to slice the rhubarb very thin in order for the vanilla syrup to penetrate each nook and make the rhubarb deliciously crispy.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">6 rhubarb stalks</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">VANILLA SYRUP:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 vanilla stick, scored lengthwise</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">MOM’S SOFT-SERVE ICE CREAM:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 pint (½ liter) vanilla ice cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Rinse, clean, and cut the rhubarb diagonally as thin as possible. You’ll only have to peel them if it’s late in the summertime.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Bring water, sugar, wine, lemon juice, and vanilla stick to a boil. Let it simmer for 3–5 minutes. If the rhubarb is really sour, you may need to add more sugar. Pour the syrup over the rhubarb. Cover it and let it cool; this will allow the rhubarb to soften.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Combine the ice cream and heavy cream and serve right away with the rhubarb.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">MAKE A SORBET INSTEAD</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">You can also put this delicacy in the freezer. Use a fork to loosen the frozen syrup and rhubarb before serving. Serve as a refreshing sorbet during the hot summer months.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_311"/>190. Mascarpone Gratin Blackberries with Grand Marnier</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dish was created for the TV series <span class="italic">Cook Along</span>, so you know it’s a quick recipe. The secret is in the blackberries. They’re supposed to be frozen when they’re put in the oven and should be cold in the center when taken out. So, basically, cold berries and a hot oven! If you’re having guests over for an elaborate dinner, prepare the cream in advance, since the berries are right there in the freezer. It can’t get any quicker than that.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9–11 oz (250–300 g) frozen berries</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp liqueur of choice, preferably Grand Marnier</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lime, zest and juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">9 oz (250 g) mascarpone cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 egg yolks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp vanilla sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 leveled tsp of brown sugar</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Put the frozen blackberries in a bowl and pour the liqueur over them. Add lime zest and juice.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the mascarpone cheese, egg yolks, vanilla sugar, and half of the brown sugar.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Place the berries in individual serving bowls. Dollop some mascarpone mix onto the berries and sprinkle some brown sugar on top. Bake in the oven for about 5 minutes. The cheese and sugar are meant to bubble a little bit. Serve right away.</p>

  <p class="h2a">191. Raspberry Crumble with Almonds</p>

  <p class="noindentl">You can replace the raspberries in this recipe with blackberries or apples. I’m childishly fond of the English word “crumble”—when you hear the Swedish word, you’ll know why! Doesn’t <span class="italic">crumble</span> sound so much more delicious than <span class="italic">smulpaj</span>? No matter what language you speak, this crumble tastes great with whichever berry you choose.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FILLING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp vanilla sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CRUMB TOPPING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5⅓ tbsp (75 g) butter, room temperature</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix raspberries, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla sugar for the filling. Place it in the bottom of a greased baking pan, 8–10 inches (22–24 cm) in diameter.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Combine all dry ingredients for the crumb topping, and use your fingers to mix it all together with the butter. Sprinkle the crumbs over the raspberries and bake in the oven for about 35 minutes, until the crumble has turned golden brown.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve with Mom’s soft-serve ice cream (see <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_305">page 305</a>) or dessert cream (see <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_322">page 322</a>).</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DELICIOUS WITH LIME</span></span></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_312"/>192. Crème Brûlée with Warm Cloudberries</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Everyone should taste crème brûlée at least once in their life. My husband and I served crème brûlée as our wedding dessert, but we used different berries. A neat little blow torch makes caramelizing it easier, but you can also bake it on broil with the oven door open. The secret to a really successful crème brûlée is that it must have a hot and hard surface with a cool interior. If you can’t find cloudberries, try raspberries, blackberries, or even update some cloudberry jam from IKEA.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) milk</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 225ºF (110ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Bring heavy cream, milk, and vanilla stick to a boil. Stir the egg yolks and sugar together—but don’t whisk! Pour the cream mixture over the egg mixture and stir gently until the sugar has melted. Remove the vanilla stick and pour the batter into four individual ramekins.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Place the ramekins in a hot water bath in a baking tray (the water should reach about halfway up the ramekins) and bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until the surface of the brûlée has just solidified. Cool the crème brûlée in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Heat up the cloudberries in a pot on the stove and carefully stir in the sugar and liqueur.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Sprinkle the raw sugar on top of the crème brûlée and burn the sugar with a blow torch or broil in the oven until the sugar has melted. Watch this step carefully!</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Serve the crème brûlée with the warm cloudberries.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">FLAVOR THE CRÈME BRÛLÉE</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">You can always try flavoring the crème brûlée. Substitute the vanilla with, for example, 1 tbsp lavender, 1 tbsp cacao, or ¼ tsp ground cardamom. It also tastes wonderful with ½ tsp lemon or orange zest or ½ cup (100 ml) blueberries or fresh raspberries.</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">An apple pie within an apple. Everything can be substituted, if need be. Use Marie tea biscuits instead of Digestive biscuits, or even chocolate cookies if you’re so inclined.

  <p class="noindentl">This simple dish has a delicate edge to it, all because of the vanilla in the compote and the Amaretti macaroon. The apple compote is incredibly delicious! Serve it warm in a large bowl, with plenty of crushed Amaretti on top. If you’re in a hurry you can substitute Amaretti for ready-made almond biscuits. They’re not exactly the same thing, but it will do just fine.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dessert ended up costing Swedish Television quite a bit of money.… In one of my programs, I had recommended that the viewers place plastic wrap on the stove for easy clean-up if any caramelized sugar bubbled over. And although this does work for old-fashioned stoves with four burners, it evidently does not work on modern ceramic glass stovetops. The plastic wrap burns straight onto the stovetop! If only you could know how many viewers complained that they had plastic wrap fused to their new stoves! One or two stoves had to be replaced by Swedish Television, just because of my directions to the audience.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) white chocolate</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">GRAPE SALAD:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) grapes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lime, zest and juice</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Heat up the heavy cream in a pot. Coarsely chop the chocolate and melt in the heavy cream. Remove from the heat and let it cool. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and let the mousse rest in the fridge until it’s thoroughly chilled; ideally, let it chill overnight.</p>

  <p class="h2a">205. Raspberry Mousse À La Napoleon</p>

  <p class="noindentl">There are only two reasons I go to the bakery:–for the Napoleons and the Semla, Swedish buns stuffed with whipped cream and almond paste. This raspberry mousse isn’t too sweet, and it’s also quite delicious with dessert cream (see <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_322">page 322</a>) and some roasted hazelnuts on top.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lb (500 g) frozen raspberries, thawed</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 gelatin sheets</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CARAMELIZED PUFF PASTRY:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Puree the raspberries and the powdered sugar. Sift away any seeds.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Place the gelatin sheets in water for about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Heat ½ cup (100 ml) of the raspberry mixture in a pot, but do not let it boil. Squeeze the gelatin sheets and add them to the mixture. Stir until they dissolve. Mix the “raspberry gel” with the rest of the raspberry purée.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Whip the heavy cream and mix with a third of the raspberry creation. Mix in the rest of the whipped cream and stir until smooth. Let the mixture rest in the fridge until ready to serve. Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Sprinkle the powdered sugar over the puff pastry; let the dough absorb the sugar as you roll it out. Place the puff pastry sheets onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover the puff pastry with another piece of parchment paper and place another baking sheet on top to press it all down. Stick all this in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Cut the puff pastry into individual rectangles and bake for another couple of minutes, until they are golden brown. Let them cool.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Spoon the raspberry mousse onto half of the puff pastry sheets and use the other half as lids. Sprinkle some powdered sugar on top and garnish with raspberries.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This dessert needs a bit of time to prepare. The walnuts and the crispy rice puffs should be made the day they are to be served, otherwise they go stale.

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_336"/>208. Lemon Meringue Pie</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I would always choose this pie for my birthday dessert when I was a child. I’ll never forget the time my mother was supposed to bring the pies to my grandparents’ house where we were having my birthday party. Our dog, Hamilton, got so excited when he saw me that he jumped up and put a paw in each pie. Of course, we still ate the pies—it was only our dog’s paws after all!</p>

  <p class="indentl">Take your time to make the warm whipped meringue. It holds longer and doesn’t release any moisture. Keep in mind to mix the short crust quickly. This prevents any gluten strands from forming and making the pie crust bread-like, which will happen if you work it for too long a period of time.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">10–12 PIECES</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">SHORTCRUST:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4½ oz (125 g) almond paste</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 stick + 1 tbsp (125 g) butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 egg</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½ cups (350 ml) flour</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">LEMON CURD:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">See recipe on <a href="../Text/011_Chapter007.html#page_272">page 272</a></span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">WARM WHIPPED MERINGUE:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 egg whites (approx. 5⅓ oz [150 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (250 ml) sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, zest</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature. Mix the almond paste and salt in a food processor until the paste is really smooth (you can also mix it by hand). Add the butter in small pieces. Add the egg and, lastly, the flour. Make sure not to overwork the dough after adding the flour. Roll the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for about 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Roll out the dough between floured sheets of plastic wrap. It’s meant to be about an inch (2 cm) larger than the pie pan. Place the crust on top of the pan and press down gently. If the pie crust hangs over the edges, it will not sink down properly when it is baking. Cut off the edges and let the pie crust rest in the freezer for about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Remove the pie crust from the freezer and prick it with a fork a few times before putting it in the oven. Reduce the temperature to 350ºF (180ºC) and bake the pie crust until it has some color, about 8–10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   In a small pot, bring the water for the water bath to a boil. Place a small bowl that can handle the heat into the water and add the egg white, sugar, and lemon zest. Whisk until the sugar has melted. The meringue should not be lumpy (feel it with your fingers). Remove the bowl from the water and whisk with a hand mixer until the meringue is firm. Put the meringue in the freezer while you prepare the pie—because it contains so much sugar, it will not freeze.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Set the oven to broil (525ºF [275ºC]).</p>

  <p class="nlist">7.   Dollop the lemon curd into the pie crust and top it off with the meringue. Put the pie on the top oven rack and keep the oven door open. Burn the meringue until it has a nice color. This will take a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">A long time ago, I found this recipe in an American food magazine and changed a few ingredients in it. You might start hiccupping when you see the amount of cognac it calls for, but it’s the cognac and dates that make the cake! This cake gives off a feeling of Christmas time, and it’s great with a few slices of oranges instead of the blackberries. The muscovite sauce is a yummy dark fudge sauce that’s also heavenly on top of the raspberry crumble on <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_310">page 310</a>, especially when complemented with whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="h2a">214. Marble Cake with Cream Cheese</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This is not your average marble cake. Because of the cream cheese, it’s a little bit acidic in flavor, a lot creamier in texture, and it tastes so much better than regular marble cake. Try flavoring the cream with shredded orange zest. Combine the chocolate and cream cheese only very lightly to make sure the cake gets a proper marbled effect.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Whisk the cream cheese with sugar, vanilla sugar, and eggs. Pour ¼ of the chocolate batter into the baking pan. Add the cream cheese mix and then pour the rest of the chocolate mix on top. Create a beautiful marbled pattern by dragging a spoon lightly through the batter. Bake in the oven for 35–45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I admit it’s been a while since I’ve eaten French toast, but my brother still loves to eat it. The best French toast I ever had was when my mom would use white bread or just a simple wheat loaf without anything fancy to it. This French toast is supposed to be eaten as is, hot and fresh out of the pan. Try making French toast using spiced bread (see <a href="../Text/011_Chapter007.html#page_262">page 262</a>) and Manitoba baguette (see <a href="../Text/011_Chapter007.html#page_268">page 268</a>).</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Prepare the chocolate cake in advance and put it in the freezer. Take it out a few minutes before you’re ready to bake it in the oven. Serve it warm. The oven time can vary depending on what type of baking pan you use. The cake is meant to be creamy in the middle and have a “baking bump” on top.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I really don’t know if this cake has anything to do with the south of Sweden at all, but it’s always been called as such. Serve the rhubarb either with the cake or with simply a dollop of dessert cream (see <a href="../Text/013_Chapter009.html#page_322">page 322</a>).

  <p class="noindentl">This is the way vanilla ice cream is meant to be made—without gelatin. When it’s made with gelatin, it feels almost like you’re wearing a belt and suspenders at the same time. If you boil the ice cream mixture thoroughly with a thermometer at the ready, there’s no need for any “just in case” gelatin sheets. And if you do make a mistake, throw it out and do it right—try try again! The half and half gives the ice cream a creamy consistency, but you can also use half-milk and half-half and half instead.</p>

This ice cream is a perfect “someone-is-at-the-door-dessert”—all you have to do is spoon it onto a flat surface or into small cups to make it freeze more quickly. If you use ready-made lemon curd, the process will obviously will be much faster than if you make your own.</p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Whisk the heavy cream but don’t make it too stiff. Fold in the condensed milk and flavor it with the lemon zest.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Squeeze the lemon juice into the lemon curd and stir. Using a fork, drizzle the lemon curd into the cream mixture.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Pour it into a bowl or a pan and let it rest in the freezer for about 5 hours until the ice cream has frozen. Or you can pour the ice cream onto a flat surface or into small coffee cups to reduce the freezing time. It’s even quite tasty when it’s only half frozen.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve the ice cream with any toppings you like. Peaches and roasted nuts make a great combination, and almond flakes are classic.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_369"/>231. Raspberry Juice</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This juice has a fresh and genuine raspberry flavor. It really tastes organic. The trick here is the tartaric acid, in combination with the gentle preparation, which makes for a very aromatic juice. Try this recipe with really ripe strawberries.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">APPROX. 1½ QUARTS</span> (1½ liters) <span class="small">CONCENTRATED JUICE</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 cups (2 liters) raspberries (frozen is fine)</span></p>

  <p class="h2a">232. Lemon Juice</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This is one of my grandmother’s recipes. It’s a sour juice that’s long-lasting and is exactly how a lemon juice should taste.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Squeeze the lemons and let some of the pulp and seeds fall through into the bowl, as this will give more flavor to the juice. Let it rest for at least 24 hours in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Sift the juice and pour it into clean bottles. Freeze the bottles, but make sure they’re only ¾ full; otherwise, they can explode in the freezer. You can also freeze the juice in ice cube trays. If you would like to drink the juice straight, pour the concentrated lemon juice into a glass and dilute with water to your liking.</p>

  <p class="h2a">234. Elderflower Lemonade</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I usually make elderberry juice every other year. Most years, by the time I remember to make it, it’s already too late, but luckily my girlfriends always have extra. For adults, gin and elderflower is a delightful combination. But be sure not to pick the elderflowers off the side of the road because the taste of car exhaust does not go well in juice. If you want to preserve it for a longer period of time in either the fridge or at room temperature, you can add sodium benzoate.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">APPROX. 3 QUARTS</span> (3 liters) <span class="small">CONCENTRATED JUICE</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 cups (2 liters) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4½ lbs (2 kg) sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 lemons</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¾ oz (50 g) citric acid</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp sodium benzoate</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Boil the water and sugar in a large pot.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Shake the water from the elderflowers and put them in a large stainless steel pot that can handle hot water. Cover it with a lid or plastic wrap.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Wash the lemons and cut them into pieces. Add them to the pot with elderflowers. Add the citric acid and the hot sugar water while stirring. Let cool somewhat and cover once again with the lid or plastic wrap. Let the juice rest for at least 24 hours; ideally it should rest for 5 days.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Sift the juice using a sieve or a linen towel and a colander.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Dilute the sodium benzoate in a glass with a small amount of juice, then add it to the rest of the juice. You don’t need the sodium benzoate if you intend to freeze the juice.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Pour the juice into clean glass bottles, plastic soda bottles, or jars. Before serving, dilute with water to taste. You can also freeze the juice in jars or ice cube trays (just be sure not to fill them up to the top, since the juice expands when frozen).</p>
