<p class="tx2"><b>This is a finely chopped mixture of flavours, or <i>aromi</i> as the Italians would call it. It is a savoury base used to flavour sauces, casseroles, fish, roast meats or simply dusted onto toasted bread with oil. The herbs are chopped finely together with garlic and seasoning before being added to olive oil in a pan. In mountainous regions where olive trees can’t grow, pork fat is used for frying and this is chopped with the herbs to form a paste.</b></p>
