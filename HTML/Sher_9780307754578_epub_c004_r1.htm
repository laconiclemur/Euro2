  <em>Casserole Dinners or Meals Made in One Pot</em></h1>

  <h1 class="subchapter" id="heading_id_2">(Eintopfgerichte)</h1>

  <p class="center1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L01_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">No German cookbook would be complete without a chapter on Eintopfgerichte, meals that are “made in one pot.” Certainly nothing could be better suited to the crowded schedules of modern American housewives. Eintopfgerichte are essentially what we know as casserole meals, although the German version is usually cooked on top of the stove instead of in the oven. Whether they are basically soups or stews, all these dishes are complete meals, including meat or fish, one or several vegetables, and a starch such as potatoes, rice, or dumplings, cooked right along with the rest of the ingredients.</p>

  <p class="indent">Most Eintopfgerichte are stews, in which the meat, fish and vegetables are browned and braised in oil or fat for a few minutes, then flavored with herbs and spices, brought to a boil and then simmered slowly in a small amount of liquid. The long, slow simmering is the secret of the full flavor and rich sauces in this kind of cookery, and as the dish requires little attention once everything is in the pot, the housewife is free to go about her other tasks while dinner cooks. This type of cooking also means you can economize with tougher, less expensive cuts of meat, since the long, moist cooking will render them tender and flavorful.</p>

  <p class="indent">To cook Eintopfgerichte (or any stews) most effectively, use a heavy stew pot, casserole or Dutch oven, with a low, tight-fitting lid. Enameled cast iron is the best material for this, for reasons explained. You should have three such pots in 2-, 3- and 5-quart sizes. The food’ and liquid should <a id="page76"></a>fill the pot as completely as possible, leaving just enough room at the top so the stew will not overflow as it cooks. This will ensure even heat during cooking. If you use a very large pot, or one with a high-domed lid, much of the heat will be dissipated in the empty area. Many people prefer to cook stews in the oven, where the pot is surrounded by even heat at all times. However, top-of-the-stove cooking produces a richer gravy requiring little thickening (if any), while oven cooking tends to make for a watery gravy.</p>

  <p class="indent">Eintopfgerichte can be prepared hours or even days in advance. They can also be frozen for future use. If you do freeze any of these one-pot meals, I’d suggest you eliminate potatoes and rice (and certainly dumplings) and cook them when you are reheating the frozen stew. Starchy ingredients tend to decompose when they are frozen and then reheated, and will make the gravy thick and pasty.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the Eintopfgerichte in this chapter, a number of soups also serve as complete meals in Germany. Usually they are preceded by an appetizer such as herring, sliced ham or stuffed eggs, or are followed by a hearty dessert like hot pudding, apple pancakes, or fruit and cheese. <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Sher_9780307754578_epub_c002_r1.htm">Chapter II</a> has many soups that fulfill all the necessary basic requirements for a one-pot meal.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 stewing fowl, 4 to 5 pounds, cut into serving pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>chicken gizzards, excluding the liver</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter or rendered chicken fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ knob celery root (celeriac), scraped and cubed, or 1 stalk celery with leaves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 parsley roots (petrouchka), scraped and sliced, if available</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 carrots, scraped and sliced or diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 to 10 small white onions</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>hot water or chicken stock to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups shelled green peas</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Flour Dumplings</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rinse chicken pieces and gizzards and dry thoroughly on paper toweling. Sprinkle with salt. Heat butter in a 3-quart casserole or stew <a id="page77"></a>pot and when hot and bubbling, add chicken pieces, gizzards and diced onion. Sauté slowly until chicken and onion take on bright golden color. Do not let them brown. Sprinkle with flour and continue cooking until flour is absorbed and begins to take on color. Add celery root or celery, parsley roots, carrots, white onions, peppercorns and bay leaf. Cover with hot water or stock. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer 1 to 2 hours, or until chicken begins to come away from bones. Add green peas for last 10 minutes of cooking time. Season with salt and pepper if necessary, and add lemon juice, a teaspoonful at a time, to taste. If stew gravy is not thick enough, mix 2 tablespoonsful flour with 4 tablespoons water, reduce stew to very slow simmer and stir flour-water mixture into it. Let it cook an additional 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare dumplings, either plain or one of the variations, and drop from tablespoon into stew pot. Be sure dumplings rest on top of chicken and vegetables and do not sink into gravy. Cover, reduce heat and steam 15 minutes. Do not remove cover during that time. Parsley or caraway dumplings are especially good with this stew.</p>

  <p class="indent">This dish originated in Szeged, a Hungarian city famous for its paprika It has become a standard dish throughout Central Europe and most of Germany.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds stewing pork, cut into 1¼″ cubes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>tablespoons lard or butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>onions, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons sweet paprika</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cloves of garlic</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup of water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound fresh or canned sauerkraut</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound potatoes, peeled, cut in 1½″ cubes or cut into ½″-thick slices</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

Sprinkle with paprika and sauté 3 or 4 minutes. Add garlic and water, cover and simmer slowly 25 minutes. If sauerkraut is very sharply flavored, rinse once or twice and drain. Add it to the pork along with potatoes and caraway seeds. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 1 hour, or until potatoes are done. Blend flour into sour cream and pour over sauerkraut and pork, shaking pot from side to side so cream will work its way through. Cover and simmer 10 minutes, or until entire goulash is thoroughly heated. Season to taste and serve.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Potatoes can be boiled separately in salted water and served along with this dish. Strictly speaking, it is not then a “one pot” meal, but it will be easier to reheat leftovers and the sauerkraut will be less inclined to become pasty.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. A peeled and sliced apple can be added to the sauerkraut.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. In Bavaria, 1 tablespoon tomato purée is mixed into and added with sour cream.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>4 pork chops, about 1</em>” <em>thick</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons lard, butter or margarnie</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 medium-sized onion, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 medium-sized green apples, pared and diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound fresh or canned sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound potatoes, peeled and sliced ¼″ to ½″ thick</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup hot meat stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup dry white wine (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sprinkle pork chops all over with salt and pepper. Heat fat in a casserole and brown pork chops slowly on both sides. Remove chops and add diced onions and apples to hot fat. Sauté slowly until onions are soft and slightly yellow and apples have begun to take on color. Remove apple and onion mixture and reserve. Sauté drained sauerkraut in fat 5 or 10 minutes, then remove from pot. Put a layer of kraut on bottom of casserole, then a layer of apple-onion mixture, all the potatoes, then another of kraut, apples and onions and finally chops. Pour hot stock over this and wine if you are using it. Cover tightly and bake in 375° oven 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. This casserole can also be cooked on top of stove. If you prefer that method, put pork chops between layers of sauerkraut so they will cook through. Simmer casserole about <em>1¼</em> to ½ hours.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. If you prefer a slightly thickened sauce, grate one medium-sized potato into kraut for last 20 or 30 minutes of cooking.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. You can eliminate potatoes from recipe and serve boiled potatoes with it on the side.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. This dish can be made with other meats as well, generally those that are partially or completely precooked. A parboiled smoked ham butt, a tenderized ham steak, spareribs, a piece of the smoked pork loin called Kasseler Rippchen, bacon either in thick slices or cubes, corned beef, or sausages—especially frankfurters, knockwurst or fresh liver-wurst—can be cooked right along with the sauerkraut, with or without potatoes. Several meats are often cooked together and are then sliced and served in combination, in the manner of the Alsatian choucroute garnie or the Swiss Bernerplatte. In Germany, this kind of meal goes by several different names. Frankfurt is known for its Kasseler Rippchen with kraut as well as for its Frankfurter Sauerkrautplatte, which usually includes a strip of bacon, a frankfurter and a piece of the pork loin (Rippchen), along with the kraut and potato. In many parts of Germany such a dish is known as Geräuchertes mit Kraut, meaning <a id="page83"></a>smoked meats with kraut, while in others it is called a Schlachtplatte, a butcher’s plate. In Swabia, a Schlachtplatte generally includes Spätzle instead of potatoes, and some Pea Purée, made with yellow peas, is mixed with it before it is served.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Pichelsteiner is a favorite Bavarian stew, most often made with a combination of beef and pork, but often with veal or mutton as well, and there are even Pichelsteiners of fish or vegetables. As with bouillabaisse, there is a running argument as to what goes into this stew to make it truly Pichelsteiner. Everyone seems to agree that the root vegetables are essential, and the following recipes and variations should cover all of the versions. Pichelsteiner was the favorite Bavarian dish of the Iron Chancellor, Bismarck; the meaning of its name and its origin have been virtually impossible to track down. Whatever its origin, it is one of the most savory of “one pot” meals.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ pounds stewing pork, cut in 1” cubes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to 1 teaspoon pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons beef marrow, butter or lard (preferably marrow)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large onions, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><a id="page85"></a><em>3 pounds old potatoes, peeled and cubed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large knob celery root (celeriac), peeled and cubed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 or 4 carrots, scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 parsley roots (petrouchka), scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 cups hot meat stock or water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sprinkle beef and pork with salt and pepper. Heat marrow or fat in a 3-quart stew pot and when hot, add meat and diced onion. Cook over moderate heat until meat is lightly browned and onions are deep yellow. Add potatoes and vegetables, cover, and braise about 15 minutes. Add hot water or meat stock, cover, bring to boiling point, reduce heat, and let simmer slowly about 1¼ to 1½ hours. Season with more salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley just before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. There are those who say it isn’t Pichelsteiner unless it includes a half-head of savoy or white cabbage, a couple of dozen Brussels sprouts or a small head of cauliflower. If any of these candidates interest you, either alone or in combination, by all means add them. The cabbage should be separated into leaves, the Brussels sprouts left whole, the cauliflower broken into flowerets. Add any or all of these vegetables for last ½ hour of cooking time and follow above master recipe. I prefer Pichelsteiner without any of these strong-flavored additions.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Other Pichelsteiner fans like to add 1 pound peeled and quartered tomatoes or one #2 can tomatoes with liquid, 1 pound whole baby string beans, 2 sliced carrots and 2 cups shelled green peas to the stew. In this case, eliminate the potatoes and other vegetables as well as the water and stock from master recipe above. Stir in 1 cup sour cream just before serving. Purists say this becomes Tomatenfleisch (Tomato Meat) and is not really Pichelsteiner at all, but it tastes delicious, no matter what you call it.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt butter or margarine in a 3-quart casserole or stew pot and add vegetables in layers, beginning with first four root vegetables. Sprinkle lightly with salt, add other vegetables, also in layers, and wind up with a top layer of potatoes. Sprinkle with a little salt and pour water or stock over contents of casserole. Cover tightly, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly 1 hour, or until all vegetables are thoroughly cooked. Season with salt, if necessary, and sprinkle with minced parsley before serving. Although this makes a more than adequate main course as is, it can also be used as the vegetable course to be served with a simple entree of broiled chicken or meat.</p>
