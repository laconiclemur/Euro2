<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">There are many variables in soufflés that will be particular to your kitchen, elevation, your oven’s personality, your mood... If you’re preparing a soufflé for the first time I would recommend making it for your own ungrateful family first and only dare serve it to fancy company you’re trying to impress when you’ve mastered it. Few dishes spell pathetic like a soufflé that won’t rise.</em></p><p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">The rule is: a soufflé doesn’t wait for the guests, the guests wait for the soufflé.</em></p><div id="c18s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre59"><b class="calibre4">Soufflé au Fromage -- Cheese Soufflé</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre59"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for four individual soufflés or one large one.</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">3 eggs at room temperature</p><p class="calibre6">1 cup (or 75 gr.) grated Gruyère cheese</p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp unsalted butter</p><p class="calibre6">1 tbsp flour</p><p class="calibre6">1 cup whole milk</p><p class="calibre6">Salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg if desired</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre59"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1-In a medium sauce pan, heat the butter on low heat until melted, then add the flour and stir briskly until slightly foamy but not brown. Remove from the heat and add all the milk.</p><p class="calibre6">Stir and place back on the stove. Add a very light touch of salt (you will soon be adding cheese) and pepper, and even a dash of nutmeg and stir gently until the mix is thick enough to coat a spoon.</p><p class="calibre6">Congratulations! You have just made béchamel sauce, the base for so many so-called ‘cream sauces’ in French cooking. Notice: no cream. Béchamel is in fact pretty lean. Although once you add the cheese and eggs further down this recipe...</p><p class="calibre6">2-Heat oven to 350°F. This recipe is for one regular soufflé mold (1 quart) or an oven-proof dish that is deep and circular (since there is apparently a law that states that square soufflés are in bad taste and violate laws of physics.) or 4 (round!) ramekins.</p><p class="calibre6">3-Separate the eggs whites from their yolks. Make sure no yolk gets into the whites or the soufflé might not rise. Using an electric mixer, or a hand-held electric blender (or by hand using a whisk, but only if you’re a tennis player) beat the whites. Add a pinch of salt. Continue beating until the egg whites are firm enough that a spoon would stand straight when placed in the center.</p><p class="calibre6">4-The béchamel should still be warm enough that the cheese melts when you incorporate it. If not place it on the stove at very low heat for a minute, stirring. Away from the stove add the 3 egg yolks (which you didn’t throw away because you are smart!)</p><p class="calibre6">5-With a wooden spoon, (not a whip or a fork), fold in the egg whites using a gentle, scooping, circular motion that will keep the mix foamy and not deflate the precious bubbles.</p><p class="calibre6">6-Pour the mix into the well-buttered soufflé mold (s). Place in the center of the oven and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the soufflé rises well past the top of the dish and is golden on top. Don’t be too quick to remove it from the oven. Better to overcook than undercook so that the soufflé will not fall right away. It will fall eventually once you serve it, hopefully at the very moment your guests pierce it with their forks.</p><p class="calibre6">7-Serve with a green salad and homemade vinaigrette. No, you do not need to serve anything else with this dish, are you kidding? Have you counted the calories in this baby? Don’t let the light as air appearance trick you into thinking it will also be light on the thighs.</p></div></div></body></html>
