<p class="author1"><span class="txit">peperoni ripieni</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">These stuffed peppers make a hearty main course, preceded by pasta and followed by salad. It is important that dry Italian bread be used in this recipe. We have bread with almost every meal. If there is any left over, I place it in a basket and let it dry for a day or two until it is hard. I then either use it in recipes such as this one or grind it in the food processor to make bread crumbs.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 long loaf Italian bread (not seeded), cut into 1-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound ground beef chuck</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, diced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a> or your own favorite tomato sauce</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 large green bell peppers, cut in half lengthwise and stems and seeds discarded</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup water</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and allow it to dry out, uncovered, for about 3 days or place on a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 300° F, stirring occasionally, until dry but not brown, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Place the dry bread in a large bowl and cover with warm water. Set aside to soak until the bread softens, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Use olive oil to grease a baking dish that is large enough to hold the pepper halves in one layer.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> In a large bowl, combine the meat, garlic, egg, cheese, salt and pepper to taste, and parsley, using your hands to mix the ingredients. Remove and discard the crust from <a id="page_255"/>each slice of bread. Squeeze the water out of the bread, and breaking it into small pieces, add it to the meat. Use your hands to work the bread into the meat until they are equally combined and the mixture holds together like a soft, moist dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Add <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the tomato sauce to the meat mixture. Mix well. The original meat mixture will now have doubled in size. Divide the filling equally among the pepper halves, mounding it high, and place each filled pepper in the prepared baking dish. Top each pepper with 1 tablespoon of the tomato sauce. Pour the water and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the tomato sauce around the peppers. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the peppers soften slightly, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Remove the foil and baste the peppers with additional tomato sauce throughout the remainder of the cooking time. Continue to bake, uncovered, adding sauce and basting occasionally, until the peppers are soft and the meat has browned, 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> to 2 hours.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 6 —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Medium red and full red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> The peppers may be placed in a baking dish and cooked in a microwave oven for 5 minutes to soften slightly before stuffing. This will shorten the baking time by 20 to 30 minutes. Red bell peppers may be used instead of green. However, they will bake more quickly. After the initial 15-minute baking period, uncover and cook until softened, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="noindenta">To make a lower-fat version of this dish, substitute ground turkey breast for the ground chuck and 2 egg whites for the whole egg.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Sometimes I will make additional stuffing and use it to prepare a <span class="txit">polpettone,</span> or meat loaf. To this basic mixture add enough marinara or Bolognese sauce to make a very moist mixture. Place in a covered casserole and bake in a preheated oven at 375° F for 1 hour. It makes a fine meat dish for dinner, but we like it best cooled and sliced for sandwiches.</p>
