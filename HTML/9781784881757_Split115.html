<h1 class="chapter">rabbit in white wine</h1>

<p class="tx2"><b>This is a perfect example of Tuscan cooking where the meat becomes so tender it falls off the bones and the sauce is rendered down to an intense, umami-filled goo ready to be collected with bread or pieces of rabbit. Do find your inner Tuscan peasant and eat it with your fingers. This recipe is from the area of San Gimignano where they grow the Vernaccia grapes to make their famous wine. Vernaccia wine is dry and citrusy and suits the dish perfectly, so do hunt a bottle or two down.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1.6 kg (2 lb 5 oz) rabbit (1 medium rabbit), jointed into 12 pieces, or 1 chicken, jointed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>10 g (½ oz) rosemary leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 fat garlic clove, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1½ teaspoons salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>400 ml (13 fl oz/1¾ cups) dry white wine, such as Vernaccia</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) Kalamata or other flavourful black olives (stones in)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Trim any loose pieces of fat away from the jointed meat then wash the meat – this will get rid of any small and loose bones. Dry on paper towel. Make a <i><a href="9781784881757_Split13.html#page_29a">battuto</a></i> with the rosemary, garlic, salt and a few good twists of black pepper.</p>
<p class="tx">Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the <i>battuto</i> and cook for just 1 minute, then add the rabbit pieces and fry for 10–15 minutes, turning the meat until it is lightly golden on all sides (watch the pan to make sure the rabbit and <i>battuto</i> don’t burn). When they are golden, add the wine, cover with a lid and leave to cook over a medium heat for 30–40 minutes, or until the wine has evaporated down to around 100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup). If it is too watery, remove the lid and boil for longer. Add the olives, cover the pan again, and cook for a further 10 minutes. Serve with bread to mop up the juices, spinach, roast potatoes or steamed vegetables.</p>
