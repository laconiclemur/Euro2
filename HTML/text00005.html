<h2 class="h2a">-SPINACH PÂTÉ-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Walnuts are synonymous with Georgian cuisine and, when pulsed to a fine paste and flavoured with the classic spice mix</strong>
 <em>suneli</em>
 , <strong>form the basis of many classic dishes. Far from being repetitive, walnuts bring a comforting richness to the dishes they are used in but still allow the main ingredients to shine. This spinach and walnut paste makes an excellent accompaniment to bread as part of an elaborate first course at a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
 , <strong>but it is also equally delicious spooned from the bowl and enjoyed in its own right. (Pictured, bottom-left on <a href="text00005.html#page_16">here</a>

<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz fresh spinach</p>
<p class="side">200 g/7 oz/scant 1¾ cups chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="side">3 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground coriander</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground marigold</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp hot chilli powder, or to taste</p>
<p class="side">½ tbsp apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side">1 bunch spring onions (scallions), green parts only, finely sliced</p>
<p class="side">1 handful fresh coriander (cilantro), leaves chopped</p>
<p class="side">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="side1">walnut oil or seeds from 1 pomegranate, to garnish</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large pan of water to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and add the spinach. Cook for 1 minute, until wilted, then drain the spinach through a colander and set aside to cool. Once cool enough to handle, pick up the spinach with your hands and squeeze out any excess water. Place the spinach on a chopping board and chop finely. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the walnuts in a food processor and process to a very fine paste. The paste should be sticky and smooth, but not at all grainy (this can take up to 5 minutes).</p>
<p class="para1">Crush the garlic with the back of a knife and then put in a mortar with a pinch of sea salt. Grind with a pestle to a smooth paste.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the walnut and garlic pastes in a bowl with the ground coriander, ground marigold, chilli powder and vinegar. Using your hands, bring the mixture together to a smooth, thick paste. The paste should be a similar texture to a loose hummus, so add a few drops of water if it is too thick. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the oil in frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Once hot, add the sliced spring onions (scallions) and fry, stirring continuously, until just starting to turn brown, around 2 minutes. Add the fresh coriander (cilantro) to the pan and cook, stirring, for another minute. Add the spring onion and coriander mixture to the bowl with the spinach.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour the walnut paste over the top of the spinach and onion mixture, then use your hands to bring everything together until well combined. I like to pick up the mixture in my hands and throw it down into the bowl to encourage the flavours to meld together.</p>
<p class="para">Place the mixture on a serving platter and spread out over the surface with the back of a spoon. Drizzle over some walnut oil and serve. Alternatively, make a small nest from the mixture and serve garnished with fresh pomegranate seeds. This can also be made ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve.</p>
