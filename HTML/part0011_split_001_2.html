  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_93" class="calibre1"></a>When I was growing up, slow-baked dishes were very popular in Italy; they were often cooked in the wood-fired oven as it cooled down after the bread had been baked. Dishes such as <em class="calibre4">gattó di patate</em> and <em class="calibre4">timballo di riso</em> could be left in the low oven to cook for a long time, sometimes all day, ready for the evening meal.</p>

  <p class="center-para">People who didn’t have an oven at home would bring their savoury dishes to the local bakery to put in the hot ovens once the day’s bread was all made; the dishes would be left for most of the day and collected later, nicely cooked and warm – and all for free!</p>

  <p class="center-para">This method of cooking was traditionally used on the eve of the feast of All Saints – these days known as Hallowe’en. Food was cooked during the day and night, but tradition dictated that it was forbidden to cook on 1 November; that day was dedicated to visiting the cemetery to honour deceased relatives and families needed a warm cooked meal ready upon their return from the cemetery.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Most of the bakes in this chapter can be made in advance and reheated when required; some can also be enjoyed cold. Many are meals in themselves and are ideal to serve at parties.</p>
