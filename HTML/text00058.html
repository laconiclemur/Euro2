</h1>
<p class="pf">It wasn’t long after my appearances with Julia Child and Martha Stewart that I was selected as the American Dairy Association’s “butter spokesperson.” Given that I grew up steeped in dairy products on the farm in Floodwood—where our beloved cows were our first and only dairy providers—this was a very easy message for me to relay when I went on a media tour.</p>
<p>I felt like a queen! I was escorted on my travels to different towns and cities across the country by a local food person who made samples of cookies and samples of cookie gift packs to leave behind with each media contact. The cookies and gift packs made great visual props. The American Dairy Association was so organized that all I had to do was show up.</p>
<p>Whenever one is on a media tour there is a chance of being preempted by some major event. It happened to me in Cleveland when last-minute breaking news of a murder flashed across the screens and both of the anchors of the program were away at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Usually, I was scheduled on the early-morning news show. That meant I had to be up at 4:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 to be picked up at about 5:00 in order to be all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at 6:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 The live segment usually ended up being between two and four minutes long.</p>
<p>I would leave behind a basket of cookies with a recipe leaflet, plus another one with butter cookie dough for the producer to take home and bake.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical schedule. After the six o’clock morning news in Des Moines, I’d head out for another television station and another live interview and demonstration—again perhaps four to five minutes long. Another basket of cookies and one with dough. At 8:10 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 in Des Moines I would have a live phone-in radio interview that would then air in Indiana.</p>
<p>At 9:30 I was off to another ABC affiliate to tape a thirty-minute segment for a program called <i>Information Iowa.</i>
 There I left behind another basket of cookies and a basket with dough, a leaflet, recipes, and a copy of my <i>Great Holiday Baking Book</i>
.</p>
<p>At 10:15, I was back to my hotel room for a live USA Radio Network interview about baking for the holidays.</p>
<p>At 11:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
, I would have a ten-minute phone-in segment for an ABC affiliate radio station—again, about baking for the holidays.</p>
<p>At 11:15 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
, I was scheduled to arrive at the NBC TV station to do a live four-minute segment on <i>Noon News</i>
 beginning at 12:15.</p>
<p>After that, at 1:30 <span class="sm">P.M.</span>
, I met with the food editor of the <i>Des Moines Register</i>
 to talk about holiday baking again and the cookie brochure filled with butter cookie recipes that I had developed.</p>
<p>Phew. And onward from there on the tour, I had a similar schedule in Oklahoma City, Nashville, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>One evening in Cincinnati, I appeared on an hour-long informal radio show called <i>Everybody’s Cooking</i>
 for which we were squashed into a tiny studio with a couple of rather comic hosts. Half of the show featured a pair of brothers who were sausagemakers. I followed with baking and cooking with butter.</p>
<p>Another time, because of the rather obscure location of the radio station, I was thankful I wasn’t driving. The driver took me on a bumpy, narrow road that was built up on sandy flats to a windowless building in the middle of nowhere that looked like a bomb shelter. And the interior was like the dorm room of a college student with sparse furnishings and piles of stuff on the floor.</p>
<p>I had gone on other media tours, too—promoting my own books. I remember once when I took a train to a cable television station somewhere in New England. I boarded the train at Grand Central Station in New York City, having first mixed up bread dough in my hotel room so that it would be rising during my travel. The train was delayed because an earlier one had jumped the track. By the time I got to my destination, I hardly had time to set up my demonstration—I just came running into the studio with my Tupperware bulging with dough and had had to improvise from there.</p>
<p>You never know where milking cows will get you.</p>
