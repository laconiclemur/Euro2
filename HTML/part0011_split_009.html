  <h3 class="h3a">‘Posh’ baked potatoes</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">When I was a child, I remember that once all the baking was done in the wood-fired oven, my grandfather would often throw in a few potatoes – so as not to ‘waste’ the heat and ash. The result was a delicious hot potato, which we would eat as a treat with just a little salt. It was not until I arrived in England that I realized baked potatoes were very popular with all sorts of fillings. Potatoes and truffle marry really well together, so why not combine the humble spud with decadent truffle for a real treat?</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 baking potatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">5 tsp truffle oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz fontina cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 tsp thyme, very finely chopped</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Wash and dry the potatoes, prick them all over with a fork or skewer, then rub all over with salt and a little of the truffle oil – about 1 teaspoon should be enough for all the potatoes. Wrap each potato in foil and bake in the oven for about 1¼ hours, until cooked through.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven, slice or cut the tops off the potatoes and carefully spoon out most of the soft potato into a bowl. Mix the spooned-out potato with truffle oil, Parmesan, fontina, thyme and some salt and pepper. Put the filling back in the skins and return to the oven for a few minutes to allow the cheese to melt. Serve hot.</p>
