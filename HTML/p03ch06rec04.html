<p class="summary1"><span class="bi">My</span> <span class="bold">croquetas</span> <span class="bi">kept bursting and falling apart. My friend Alicia told me her sister-</span>in-law Angelita’s always worked. I called her and she explained the recipe on the phone—it worked perfectly (see page 166). Then I went to see her in Seville. Angelita García de Paredes Barreda is an eighty-four-year-old Franciscan missionary nun who for many years worked in different cities of the United States, helping out poor immigrants from South America, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. She also spent time with an Indian tribe in Mexico. She stopped wearing a habit when she realized that people opened up to her more when she wore regular clothes. She is from an illustrious military family. Her ancestor Diego García de Paredes from Trujillo, in Extremadura, was a noble and daring officer who fought for the Castilian kings in Granada, Flanders, and Italy in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. His son, also Diego García de Paredes, founded the city of Trujillo, a provincial capital in Venezuela, where he became viceroy.</p>

<p class="summary">Angelita was one of ten children. Her father was a colonel in the Spanish army. Her grandmother was educated at the Irish Sisters of Loreto’s Institute of the Virgin Mary school in Gibraltar, where the bishop was a relative. The order went on to open schools in Spain, known as Las Irlandesas. Angelita and her twin sister first attended their day school and later went to their boarding school in Castilleja de la Cuesta, a small town in the province of Seville. When they finished in Castilleja and returned home, an English tutor, a governess for the González Byass sherry family, came to the house every day for English conversation with the girls of the family. Many of the Jerez elite had an English education. Some were descended from families who had come from England in the eighteenth century. They introduced the custom of tea with toast and biscuits and some English dishes.</p>
<p class="summary">Angelita showed me around Seville and the great cathedral, which is the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. We stopped at the little chapel that holds the sepulchre of her father’s ancestors, the Jácomes, an illustrious Converso family. Angelita’s community of retired Franciscan nuns lives very frugally. Angelita loves cooking, and when it is her turn to cook, she manages to prepare inexpensive but exquisite meals—I know they are delicious, because she described them to me. But the huge pile of recipes she gave me, some handwritten, some typed, reflect the grand style of her family as well as their Italian connection—her great-grandmother on her mother’s side was from Italy.</p>
<p class="summary">Angelita is a highly educated and intellectual nun, she speaks four languages, and is very sociable and cheerful. She joined me and some friends in tapas bars and restaurants of Seville and walked with us in the early hours of the morning through the city. <span class="italic">Empanada de atún</span> on the following page is one of her recipes.</p>
