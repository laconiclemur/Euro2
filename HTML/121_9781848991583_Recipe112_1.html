<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_189"/><b>Lemongrass-skewered Shrimp</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Sauce Vièrge</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I guess by now you have noticed that I really like Asian ingredients, perhaps because of my time in Singapore and traveling through Malaysia and the Far East. Using lemongrass as the skewer means it imparts its superb fragrance to the shrimp, so choose fresh green stalks. The sauce vièrge finishes the dish beautifully, so make sure you cook plenty as everyone will be asking for more!</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">48 jumbo, raw shelled shrimp</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 lemongrass stalks</p>
<p class="acktxt">1-inch piece gingerroot, peeled and grated</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxta">Thai-style Pilaf Rice (see <a href="019_9781848991583_Recipe13.html#pageid_21">page 21</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE SAUCE VIÈRGE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tomato, peeled, seeded and diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon lightly crushed coriander seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 275°F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Make a small hole through the middle of each shrimp with a sharp knife, then thread 4 shrimp onto each lemongrass stalk as a skewer. Sprinkle with the ginger, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add 3 skewers and fry 2 to 3 minutes on each side until the shrimp are just cooked through and lightly colored. You will be able to see the shrimp change color to pink as they cook. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and put it in the oven, but leave the oven door open—you just want to keep them warm, not for them to cook any more. Repeat with the remaining skewers, butter and olive oil.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> While the last batch is cooking, make the <i>sauce vièrge</i>. Put the extra virgin olive oil, the tomato, coriander seeds, lemon zest and juice in a small saucepan over low heat and season with salt and pepper. Warm through very gently 2 minutes, stirring occasionally—you don’t want the oil to actually get hot. Remove the pan from the heat, add the cilantro leaves, then stir to combine.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Simply serve the skewers with the sauce drizzled over the top, with an Asian-style steamed rice of your choice. I like to serve the skewers with Thai-style Pilaf Rice.</p>
