  <h3 class="h3a">Traditional Italian Christmas cake</h3>

  <p class="para">If you have ever wondered how to make your own panettone, and you enjoy a challenge as well as have a day to spare, this recipe is for you. The dough needs to rest at the end of each stage: this is what gives panettone its characteristic lightness. And of course you can get on with other things during these times. Ideally you will have a loose-bottomed panettone tin, 18cm/7 inches in diameter and 10cm/4 inches high – you could also use a slightly shallower and wider loose-bottomed cake tin.</p>

  <p class="chap-para">There are many legends about how this cake originated and it appears that in ancient times the Romans sweetened a dough-like cake with honey; it is also said that poor people added a little dried fruit and sugar to bread dough as a Christmas treat. However, panettone as we know it today was created in Milan by two pastry chefs, Motta and Alemagna, in the early twentieth century. Its popularity spread over the years and it is produced industrially by many large companies, making it affordable for all Italians and becoming Italy’s leading Christmas cake. In recent years it has evolved with flavourings such as chocolate, liqueur cream and others, but I find the original one with dried fruit and candied peel the best. In Italy panettone is traditionally served with a glass of <em class="calibre4">spumante</em> (light sparkling wine) at the end of the Christmas meal, but it is equally delicious with dessert wine or simply a nice cup of espresso or even tea.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes a 1.2kg/2lb 10oz cake</p>

  <p class="ing1">125g/4½oz/¾ cup sultanas (golden raisins)</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp rum</p>

  <p class="ing1">12g/¼oz fresh yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/¾ cup caster (superfine) sugar, plus 1 tsp</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp lukewarm milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/4 cups ‘00’ flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 eggs, plus 3 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/generous ½ cup butter, softened at room temperature, plus a knob for the top</p>

  <p class="ing1">3g salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz candied peel</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest of 1 lemon</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out</p>

  <p class="step-head">Step 1</p>

  <p class="para">Soak the sultanas with the rum and a little lukewarm water and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Dissolve 10g of the yeast together with 1 tsp sugar in the milk. Put 100g/3½oz/generous ¾ cup flour in a bowl, pour in the yeast mixture and work into a smooth dough. Form into a ball, cover the bowl with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="step-head">Step 2</p>

  <p class="para">Add 2 eggs to the bowl, crumble in the remaining yeast, add 175g/6oz/1½ cups flour and mix well. Add 60g/2¼oz sugar and 60g/2¼oz butter and use your hands to incorporate all the ingredients to form a sticky dough. Form into a ball, cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to rest in a warm place for 2 hours, until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="step-head"><a id="page_167" class="calibre1"></a>Step 3</p>

  <p class="para">Drain and squeeze the excess liquid out of the sultanas and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the remaining 2 eggs, 3 yolks and the remaining flour to the dough and work with your hands for 10 minutes – the dough will still be quite sticky. Mix in the remaining sugar and the salt. Mix in 50g/1¾oz butter until well amalgamated, then add the remaining butter. Add the candied peel, lemon zest, sultanas and vanilla seeds. Mix well, cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place for at least 2 hours, until the mixture has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="step-head">Step 4</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, lightly grease a loose-bottomed panettone tin, 18cm/7 inches in diameter and 10cm/4 inches high (or other cake tin) and line with baking parchment.</p>

  <p class="para">Turn the dough mixture onto a lightly floured work surface and work for a minute, then place in the prepared tin, cover with clingfilm and leave to rest in a warm place for at least 2 hours, until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Using a small sharp knife, make a cross on the top and place a knob of butter in the middle. Place on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5 and continue to bake for 45 minutes. If you notice the top of the cake getting too dark too quickly, reduce the oven temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly in the tin. Remove from the tin and leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
