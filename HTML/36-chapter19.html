<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">While the Basques may have been the first to bring salted cod to Spain, <em>bacalao</em> soon spread, with the country’s regions developing their own distinctive ways of preparing it. In Catalunya, one traditional favorite of using <em>bacallà</em> (as it is called in Catalan) is in <em>esqueixada</em>. Found in Catalan cuisine at least as far back as the sixteenth century, the name of the dish comes from the Catalan verb <em>esqueixar</em> (to shred). The salad should not need salt, but taste for seasoning before serving. This is a place to use the best extra-virgin olive oil kept in the cupboard for special occasions. It will be noted and appreciated.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 POUND/455 G SALT COD (SEE NOTE)</li>
<li>8 PLUM TOMATOES, CORED, SEEDED, AND FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM RED ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>¼ GREEN BELL PEPPER, FINELY CHOPPED (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li>FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>36 TO 48 BLACK OLIVES</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Beginning 2 to 3 days ahead, desalt the cod following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Drain, rinse, gently squeeze out excess moisture, and pat dry with paper towels. Skin and carefully debone. Shred the cod by hand into bite-size pieces following the flakes and fibers.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large serving bowl, add the cod along with the tomatoes, onion, and bell pepper (if using) and season with pepper. Drizzle over the olive oil and toss to blend. (There should be enough oil that some pools in the bottom of the bowl; add more if needed.) Garnish with the olives. Cover and chill.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Before serving, re-toss. Serve slightly chilled or at least fresh.</p>
<p class="tip"><span class="red"><span class="font2">NOTE:</span></span> Use one of the more inexpensive cuts of salt cod, such as strips of esqueixada pieces. It soaks quicker and will be shredded, anyhow; save the fat loin cuts for dishes like Salt Cod, Orange, and Olive Salad <a href="35-chapter18.html#page_53">(page 53)</a> or Biscay-Style Salt Cod with Choricero Pepper Sauce <a href="127-chapter92.html#page_183">(page 183)</a>, where the delicate texture of the large flakes can be fully appreciated.</p>
