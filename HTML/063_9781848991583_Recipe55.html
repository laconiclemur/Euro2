<p class="normal"><b>Where I’m from in the Haute-Saône region of France we use lentils a lot, particularly the slate-green-colored Puy lentils. The first record of the famous lentilles vert du Puy dates from 1643, and the Puy lentil was awarded Protected Designation of Origin status (PDO) in 2009. Known as the “caviar of the poor,” the earthy flavor of these lentils blends beautifully with the pancetta, mushrooms and thyme.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ ounces thick pancetta or bacon, cut into small lardons</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot, finely sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 carrot, peeled and diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 bouquet garni, made with 1 thyme sprig and 1 parsley sprig, tied together with kitchen string</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup Puy lentils, picked over and rinsed</p>
<p class="acktxt">5⅓ cups Vegetable Stock (see <a href="010_9781848991583_Recipe4.html">page 17</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 2 thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ cups thickly sliced crimini or button mushrooms</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">crusty bread, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the oil and pancetta and fry 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is golden brown. Add the shallot and carrot and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer until they are slightly soft, then add the lentils, bouquet garni and stock. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 8 minutes. Pour in slightly less than ½ cup of the cream, then return the liquid to a simmer and cook 7 to 8 minutes longer until the lentils are tender. Discard the bouquet garni.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Ladle the soup into a blender and blitz until smooth and creamy. Return the soup to the cleaned pan and add a little water or more stock to the pan if the soup is too thick. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover the pan with a lid and keep the soup warm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Whip the remaining cream until soft peaks form, then fold in two-thirds of the thyme and season with a touch of pepper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the butter and when it is foaming, add the mushrooms and sauté 3 to 4 minutes until they are golden brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the remaining thyme. Divide the mushrooms into four shallow soup bowls, piling them in the middle and put a spoonful of the thyme cream on top. Finally ladle the soup around the mushrooms and cream and serve with crusty bread.</p>
