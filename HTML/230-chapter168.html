<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This recipe comes from Can Ravell, a superb delicatessen and restaurant in Barcelona beside Mercat de la Concepció. Opened in 1929 by the father of the current owner, Josep Ravell, it carries the finest preserves from Spain and beyond. <a href="164-chapter118.html#page_237"><span class="red">(See page 237 for more about Can Ravell.)</span></a> They also preserve some of their own—white asparagus from Navarra in spring, and, using a recipe from his grandmother, sweet tomatoes in summer. When Josep was a boy, his grandmother served these tomatoes with some anchovy fillets and a good dousing of extra-virgin olive oil for a salad, or else alongside white rice and a fried egg (and a glass of red wine) for a quick dinner. I learned this recipe from Josep, and in our house we more or less follow his grandmother’s lead on how to eat them.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 POUNDS/910 G RIPE MEDIUM TOMATOES</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/100 G SUGAR (SEE NOTE)</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, PLUS MORE FOR COVERING</li>
<li>FINELY CHOPPED FRESH THYME FOR SPRINKLING</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C/gas mark ½&gt;.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Blanch and peel the tomatoes following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>. If the tomatoes are large, remove the seeds with a spoon. For small or medium tomatoes, trim just the top of the core and leave the seeds.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a small saucepan, prepare a syrup by dissolving the sugar in 2 tablespoons water over medium heat. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a baking dish, arrange the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the syrup and the olive oil and generously crumble the thyme over the top. Bake for 1¼ hours, or until darker red and tender but not collapsing. Turn off the oven and let the tomatoes gradually cool in the oven.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Gently lift out the tomatoes and place them in sterilized glass canning jars, leaving one finger space at the top. Pour in the liquid from the pan. Top off with more oil until the tomatoes are covered. Seal and label. Store in the refrigerator and use within 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="tip"><span class="red"><span class="font2">NOTE:</span></span> If the tomatoes are particularly ripe and sweet, decrease the amount of sugar to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup/75 g.</p>
