<p class="image"><a id="page_124"/><a id="page_125"/><img alt="image" src="../images/07fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">It is the small thrills that give life its spice, not the big, well-planned adventures. One of the small things that makes my lazy summer days something more than just idle recreation is harvesting mussels from the bare rock face just a few feet from the boathouse of our southern Norwegian summer house. It is the perfect thing to do on days when the sun is shining from long before you awake till almost midnight, when even going out on the fjord to catch a few fish seems like too much of an effort. There are not many days like that in Norway, so every minute of them is savored, knowing that it might well be another year until the next time cold wind, clouds, and rain agree to leave us alone.</p>
<p class="indent">It is nearly dinnertime before I manage to break free from my idleness. I head down to the sea, still wearing shorts and sandals. In my right hand I carry a rake; in the left, a bucket. Carefully I climb out on the steep rocks, getting as far out as possible without stepping on the wet stones by the <a id="page_128"/>waterline. I use the rake to remove a few dozen mussels from the rocks immediately below the surface of the sea. There are many more farther down, in a small crack in the rock, but they are just out of reach from where I am standing.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the point when my heart starts beating harder. Very gently I place one foot on the wet, slippery stone surface, trying to find the perfect balance between reaching farther into the colony of mussels and not falling into the water. From my new position, I manage to reach a whole lot of mussels, but they are clinging more tightly to the surface than the others, so I have to pull the rake toward me with a powerful jerk. This time my left foot slips, and I almost fall. My foot finds support at the last moment, and I am saved from the disgrace of splashing violently into the water—although I am not sure how much grace I am really left with. From a distance, my struggle for balance must look like slapstick shadow boxing, a clumsy fight against an unseen adversary.</p>
<p class="indent">I am almost doing a split and I am as wobbly as ever, but my bucket is nearly half full. Just a few more mussels, and no one will have to leave the dinner table hungry. From where I am standing, all the best-looking shells, those that are neither too old nor too small, are within my reach. In less than five minutes, my bucket is full. I even throw out a few mussels I do not like the looks of, those that are overgrown with algae or seaweed and are a pain to wash.</p>
<p class="indent">It is now that I realize I cannot move. There is no way I can move my left foot out of the water without falling, jeopardizing my entire catch. I contemplate my options for a few seconds, but I see none.</p>
<p class="indent">From the house, I can hear someone shouting. I said I would be only ten minutes. People are probably getting hungry. Someone will be on the way soon, and I would rather not be seen in this helpless position—doing a split, unable to move. I make a quick decision. I throw the rake and bucket ashore and submerge myself in the cold, clear water. The water is certainly refreshing, not as unpleasantly cold as I had feared.</p>
<p class="indent">I look like a drowned cat, and my wet sandals are making loud squeaking noises as I approach the house. The mussels hardly need washing, and twenty minutes later they are on the table, steamed with garlic and thyme and served with only stewed mushrooms, bread, butter, and lots of white wine. We eat greedily, but when we are finished, there still seems to be a mountain of mussels left in the huge pot.</p>
<p class="indent">“Did you fall into the sea?” someone wonders. A newcomer.</p>
<p class="indent">“Of course not. I jumped,” I reply, trying to sound offended.</p>
<p class="indent">“It doesn’t make sense, though,” one of my regular summer guests says. “First you try your best to rake in the mussels while balancing on the slippery rocks. And when you are done, you jump willingly into the water. Why do you always do that?”</p>
<p class="indent">I have no answer except, perhaps, that that’s the way my best summer days are supposed to be.</p>

<p class="noindent">If you are in search of a less subtle dish, the mussels have enough strength and individuality to stand up to powerful spices like chiles or piri-piri. How tasty the dish ends up, though, is to a large extent dependent on how good a white wine you use. If it isn’t a wine you enjoy drinking, you will probably not like it with the mussels either.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_135"/>SCALLOPS: DANCING IN THE DEEP</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_134"/><img alt="image" src="../images/07fig04.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Of all mollusks, the scallop is the one that leads the most interesting life. While the oyster and mussel are confined to a still life, attached to a piece of rock—oblivious of a world beyond that of open mouths, and unable to move around if they grow discontented—the scallop is able to take control of its own life. It does so by snapping its upper valve firmly shut with its powerful oversize adductor muscle and thus expelling water through its fan-shaped shell. The jet stream it produces can propel it as far as three feet at a time, making it as mobile as most crustaceans. When it is not jetting around from one place to another looking for adventure, it is demonstrating its freedom to do so by jumping up and down on the sea bank. If you are diving off the coast of Norway, you may be lucky enough to come across a sandbank full of dancing scallops, an unbelievably beautiful underwater ballet.</p>
<p class="indent">As is true of most shellfish, the scallop is at its best when harvested from cold waters, making the coast of Norway the perfect breeding ground. A scallop straight out of the cold January waters needs little or no preparation—not even cooking.</p>
<p class="indent">In Norway, scallops are always sold in the shell, preferably still alive. They have to be handled very carefully and will keep for only a day or so after they have been harvested.</p>
<p class="indent">Most people think of scallops as the shiny white, incredibly tender adductor muscle. This is the only part that is kept when scallops are cleaned at sea. While the rest of the scallop will begin to smell and become inedible within a day or two after it has been harvested, the muscle can be kept for several days without spoiling. However, if you are able to get hold of live scallops, the reward more than makes up for the higher price and the inconvenience of having to clean them yourself. Not only are the shells themselves like beautiful artwork—no wonder Botticelli depicted Venus in a scallop shell—there is a hidden, not-much-used treasure in the shell as well: the orange roe, not unlike the flesh of a lobster claw in appearance, and the most delicious part of the scallop. Its velvety texture and rich, almost oily taste are a sensual contrast to the lean muscle.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_137"/>Scallop Carpaccio</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_136"/><img alt="image" src="../images/07fig05.jpg"/></p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS DISH IS BEST MADE WITH LIVE SCALLOPS. IF YOU CANNOT GET LIVE SCALLOPS, YOU CAN USE SHUCKED ONES. MAKE SURE THEY ARE SUSHI-QUALITY, AS THEY ARE EATEN RAW. BE MINDFUL NOT TO USE TOO MUCH VINEGAR OR SALT; A DROP OR TWO OF VINEGAR ON THE ROE AND A FEW GRAINS OF SALT ON EACH SLICE OF THE MUSCLE ARE ENOUGH.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 2 AS AN APPETIZER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large live scallops in the shell (see headnote)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ teaspoons fleur de sel or other flaky sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 lime wedges (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Check to see if the scallops are alive by holding them under cold running water. They should close firmly within a few seconds. A dead scallop will very soon give off a bad smell; discard it.</p>
<p class="noindentt">You can ask your fishmonger to clean the scallops for you, but as you want them to be as fresh as possible, the best thing is to clean them yourself. With a sharp knife, cut the scallops open: Pressing the knife firmly against the flat half of each shell, cut the adductor muscle. Once you have cut the adductor muscle, the shell will open by itself. Remove the muscle (the scallop) and the orange roe; discard the rest. Gently wash the scallops and the roe under cold running water.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Mix the honey and vinegar in a small warmed bowl (the two will not combine easily if cold).</p>
<p class="noindentt">With a thin sharp knife, cut the scallops horizontally into thin slices. There is no fixed rule as to how thin the slices should be—I try to cut them as thin as possible, but the last two slices always end up thicker than the others.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Spread the slices out on a plate. Place the roe on two plates and make 8 small slits in each one with a sharp knife. Sprinkle each roe with 2 to 3 drops of the honey-vinegar mixture. Drizzle a few flakes of salt over the scallops and serve immediately, with lime, if desired, on the side.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>12 scallops</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound celeriac, peeled and cut into 1-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups veal stock, homemade or store-bought</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cardamom pod</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon grated orange zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Thirty minutes before cooking them, take the scallops out of the refrigerator and place them on a large plate.</p>
<p class="noindentt">To make the celeriac puree, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the celeriac and potato and boil gently for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender. Drain, transfer to a food processor, and puree until smooth.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Return the puree to the pot. Add the milk and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Turn off the heat and stir in 3 tablespoons of the butter. Cover loosely to keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, prepare the veal glace: In a medium saucepan, combine the veal stock, bay leaf, cardamom, and peppercorns and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook until reduced to ¼ cup. Stir in the orange zest and let stand for 2 minutes, then strain the glace and discard the solids.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Return the glace to the pan and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of the butter.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Finally, season the scallops with the sugar and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over high heat. Add the scallops and cook for 1 minute; flip and cook for 1 minute on the other side.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Serve the scallops on top of the celeriac puree, with the veal glace spooned over them.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 6 AS AN APPETIZER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 scallops</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 freshly shucked oysters on the half-shell (with their brine)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, cut into 6 wedges</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat a gas grill to medium-hot, or prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Combine the vinegar, honey, mustard, and oil in a warmed bowl and whisk together with a fork (heating the bowl makes the honey mix more easily with the other ingredients). Pour half the vinaigrette into a small serving bowl. Set aside. Toss the scallops with the remaining vinaigrette, remove them from the bowl, and season with salt, pepper, and thyme. Season the oysters with pepper only.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The grilling has to be done very quickly. Have a 3-foot-long sheet of aluminum foil ready. Grill the scallops for 30 seconds on one side only. Place the oyster shells on the grill—try to balance them so they don’t lose any of their brine. Turn the scallops, throw the black peppercorns onto the hottest part of the fire, cover the shellfish tightly with foil to trap the smoke, and step back. Let the scallops and oysters cook for about 2 minutes, then remove them and serve immediately—the scallops with the remaining vinaigrette, the oysters with the lemon wedges.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">I learned the technique from my friend chef-turned-filmmaker Henrik Henriksen. The same method can be used to flavor beef or duck.</p>
<p class="noindentt">When I made this on my television show from the south coast of Norway, my guests were locals who had never tasted oysters before—even though the seabed is full of them. Here the oysters are served with nothing but lemon wedges, the scallops with a simple sweet vinaigrette. Sometimes, when I am more adventurous, I season the oysters with a little garlic and chipotle chile.</p>
<p class="noindentt">I use only scallops and oysters that are fresh enough to be eaten raw. If you are uncertain about the freshness, I suggest you grill them for 2 to 3 more minutes until they are cooked through. I insist on shucking my own oysters to ensure freshness. Use any kind of medium to large oyster—freshness matters more than type.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_140"/>CRAYFISH: THERE IS SOMETHING CRAWLING IN MY BATHTUB</h3>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/07fig06.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">It is early in the morning, and I am still half asleep as I enter the bathroom to have my refreshing morning shower. With the ungraceful movements of a sleepwalker, I place my left foot in the bathtub, and before I have had time to let the right foot follow suit, I am wide awake, and I remember everything from last night’s nocturnal adventure. I am not alone. The bathtub is crawling with fighting black crayfish, one of which has secured a firm and rather painful grip on my little toe.</p>
<p class="indent">In Norway, late August brings with it the threat of autumn. The days are markedly shorter, there is a cool current in the air, and the leaves are slowly starting their transformation from bright green to fiery red. But fall also brings with it new and wonderful things. Last night was the first day of the crayfish season. Being a city boy with many things on my mind, I had not really planned for the event, but a small notice in the local newspaper had alerted me that the crayfish swimming in the city river were now free for all. It was a dark and cloudy night with a forecast of rain that never materialized—the perfect conditions for catching crayfish. I waited until nearly midnight and then drove up to the outskirts of Oslo, where the Akers River runs into town. There, with the city to my right and the Oslo forest to my left, I waded out onto the shallow sandbanks. There is really no secret to crayfish catching, no difficult technique to be learned. Armed with nothing but a bucket and a flashlight, I managed to catch about thirty small crayfish. The crayfish are stunned by the strong light, allowing you to pick them up with your hands. Some do start to swim away, but they do not go more than a few feet.</p>
<p class="indent">The crayfish are best kept alive to ensure that they are eaten as fresh as possible. Placing them in the bathtub under a gentle stream of cold running water is the most practical way for those of us who do not have an aquarium. It also gives the crayfish time to empty their intestines, making it possible to eat them without going through the meticulous process of cleaning them. But right now, this morning, I feel that the crayfish, whom, it is true, I had brought into the house, are invading my private space. More than anything else, I want a shower.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_141"/>I dash into the kitchen, fill a large pot with salted water, and bring it to a boil. Without further ado, I tip the protesting black crayfish into the pot. By the time I am finished showering, they have been transformed from annoying visitors to breakfast, and to underline the transformation, their shining black armor has turned to crimson red. Well showered and dressed, I have a breakfast that will always be in the pantheon of my life’s truly great meals: the freshest and sweetest crayfish I have ever tasted, piled on top of white bread and washed down with orange juice, while the lazy August sun caresses my kitchen.</p>

<p class="noindent">The annual crayfish party is an important event in both Norway and Sweden. This recipe is the Swedish way to prepare crayfish: Cook them in dill-flavored salted water and beer. When I made this dish on <em>New Scandinavian Cooking,</em> we were out in the Oslo forest, on one of the remote hiking trails. When we had finished shooting, we gave away samples to passersby. They were slightly puzzled to find a kitchen in the middle of the forest and kept asking what we were selling and whether we had considered going into a more densely populated area.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Put the crayfish under cold running water to make sure they are alive. Discard any that do not move.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat the oil in a large pot over high heat. Add the garlic, coriander, chile, crayfish, and salt and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, until the crayfish are starting to turn red. Add the wine, place a tight-fitting lid on the pot, and let the crayfish steam for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and toss the crayfish around with a wooden spoon. Place the lid back on and steam for an additional 10 minutes. Transfer the crayfish to a large serving bowl or platter and sprinkle with the dill.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Strain the broth and discard the solids. Return the broth to the pot, bring it to a boil, and cook, uncovered, until reduced to about 2 cups. Stir in the butter and pour over the crayfish. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Break open the shells at the table and carefully remove the crayfish meat. Place the meat on white bread spread with mayonnaise, or simply dip it in the cooking juices and a squeeze of lemon. The white meat in the tail is the best, but that from the head is also delicious; do not eat the papery gills.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_145"/>LOBSTER: COFFEE AND CAVIAR</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_144"/><img alt="image" src="../images/07fig07.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">It is not yet 7 <small>A.M.</small> and still dark when fisherman Terje Bernhardsen arrives at the deserted docks on his curious-looking three-wheel moped. His tiny trailer is full of half-rotten fish, and after a few minutes the cold winter air smells like a bustling fishing port in the tropics. The smell awakens the seagulls, which raise a commotion—a cacophony that is bound to wake up anyone still asleep in the surrounding Norwegian fishing village of Ula.</p>
<p class="indent">Bernhardsen is one of the last professional lobster fishermen left in the Oslo fjord, an hour’s drive from the capital. The smelly fish is an unpleasant necessity in his line of work.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever he has some time on his hands, he fishes for anything he can get, normally pollock, haddock, mackerel, and small cod. Then he leaves them out in his garage for a few days before using them as bait for the lobster pots. If he used fresh fish in the lobster pots, they would be filled with crabs. But with rotten fish, only the valuable and strangely undiscriminating lobsters dare approach.</p>
<p class="indent">It is going to be a beautiful winter day. The sun is not yet up, and as we head out to the lobster pots in Bernhardsen’s boat <em>Irene II,</em> it feels as if we have the world to ourselves. We huddle together and scout for the bright orange buoys marking the whereabouts of the lobster pots.</p>
<p class="indent">The first lobster pot is empty. My heart sinks. The second is also empty. I suddenly feel tired and cold. Then our luck turns. In the third pot there is a nice four-pound lobster and a two-pound relative. And there are more to come. After hoisting seven pots, we have nearly a case full of shiny black lobsters.</p>
<p class="indent">“People complain that the lobsters are dying out, but I cannot see that there has been much of a change since I started fishing forty years ago,” says Bernhardsen. “The lobsters are hard to catch—they always have been. In order to find them, you need to know their whereabouts, and you need to invest a lot of time. People don’t have that time anymore, and therefore they assume that the lobster is dying out.”</p>
<p class="indent">The lobsters in the case have recovered from the first shock of being abducted from their natural <a id="page_146"/>environment, and they are now following their aggressive instincts. The big lobsters are trying to kill the small ones. The small ones are trying to kill the even smaller ones. The smallest ones are putting up a fight as well, but they are losing. Bernhardsen breaks up the fight and gently, like a caring father, places a wet piece of cloth over them, more precisely an old shirt, just like the one he is wearing. After a few seconds, the lobsters start moving less and less, until it looks as if they are sleeping.</p>
<p class="indent">Lobsters are rare and expensive all over the world, but nowhere more so than in northern Europe. The northern European lobster is a different species from the ones that live off the North American coast. It is more territorial, which makes reproduction more difficult. In addition, it has a slower growth rate.</p>
<p class="indent">The morning fog has cleared and the sun is looking at us from afar, giving away just enough energy to thaw us out. “This one is too small,” says Bernhardsen, and holds out a lobster that does not fulfill the minimum requirement of ten inches. “But if you see here, she is full of roe.” The underside of the tail is full of glistening black roe. Thousands of shiny black eggs—a promise of lobsters to come. She is released back into the sea.</p>
<p class="indent">I am exhausted from the laborious work of hoisting the lobster pots, and we break for coffee. Bernhardsen offers dry crackers and hot coffee in large mugs. Then he moves the wet shirt covering the lobsters, lifts up a female, and implores me to sample the roe.</p>
<p class="indent">“She can’t feel it, you know. Don’t be afraid. It is delicious. Most people just throw the roe away.”</p>
<p class="indent">Out on the open sea, with its long, quiet swells, fresh air, and a sun that reminds you that winter isn’t all bad, the roe tastes better than any caviar I have ever eaten. The thin coffee tastes better than any Champagne. I take another cracker with fresh lobster roe, fill up my coffee mug, and rest my head against the railing. Slowly sipping my coffee I notice the inscription on the plastic mug: <em>“Navigare vivere est”</em>—“Sailing is living.” I couldn’t agree more.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_147"/>Tarragon Lobster with Asparagus</h3>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS A SIMPLE RECIPE THAT MAKES THE MOST OF ONE LOBSTER. THE LOBSTER IS COOKED IN ITS OWN JUICES, WHITE WINE, AND BUTTER. THIS PRESERVES MORE OF THE FLAVORS AND, BECAUSE IT IS RICH, MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO SERVE SMALLER PORTIONS.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 2</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One live 3-pound lobster</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons chopped shallots</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, or 1 teaspoon dried tarragon plus 1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound asparagus, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ teaspoon curry powder</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Kill the lobster, preferably with a butcher knife through the head (this has been proven to be the most humane way of killing crustaceans): Holding the lobster on a cutting board, plunge the knife into the head. Then pull the knife down and forward, splitting the front of the head in two; this kills the lobster instantly. Or plunge the lobster into a large pot of boiling water for 1 minute. Cut the lobster lengthwise in half; make sure to save all the juices released from the lobster. Crack the claw shells.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the garlic and shallots for 3 to 4 minutes, until soft. Add the lobster to the pan and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes. Pour over the white wine and the reserved lobster juices, sprinkle with most of the tarragon, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the lobster to a warm serving platter. Turn the heat up, add the asparagus, and cook for 7 minutes, until the cooking juices are reduced by half and the asparagus is still crisp. Season with curry powder, salt, and the rest of the tarragon. Stir in the remaining 6 tablespoons butter and let it melt, then pour the sauce over the lobster and serve the asparagus alongside.</p>
