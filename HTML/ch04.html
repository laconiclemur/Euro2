<p class="h2title">September, or <span class="scalasans">Risk</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big">O</span>ne afternoon, Oriol presents Ferran with a refined version of a dish they’ve been working on for a couple of days. It’s simple: a swath of black sesame paste swirled through a pool of transparent white yogurt water and served in a shallowly indented bronze-colored plate so that the whole concoction looks like an abstract painting set in a frame. Ferran takes a spoonful and begins to rapidly nod his head up and down in the idiosyncratic gesture that signals approval. “It’s magic!” he proclaims, then smiles slyly. “Thirty percent of our clients will hate it. But it’s magic!” He and Oriol decide to call the dish Petroleum, in honor of its oil-slick appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout this conversation, Andrea Correa has been quietly weighing dollops of sesame paste and jotting down the quantities in her pastel-colored notebook. As with almost all exchanges between Oriol and Ferran, her physical proximity to Oriol—as his assistant, she is rarely more than a few inches from his right side—enables her to listen carefully, and now a flicker of disbelief crosses her face. She is far too respectful to ever ask Ferran himself, but she can’t help but wonder at the statement. As soon as her fellow stagiaire Kim is within earshot, she <a id="page_131"/>recounts the interaction, then whispers an urgent question under her breath. “What kind of chef serves a dish he knows a third of his clientele won’t like?”</p>
<p class="indent">What kind of chef indeed? ElBulli is not impervious to its clients’ tastes; servers are required to take note of any dish that goes largely or entirely uneaten, and the instances are recorded on one of the restaurant’s many forms. (In 2009, the most frequently returned dish—even one prominent food writer barely touched it—was the artichoke rose.) But as Ferran likes to say, elBulli is not a “normal” restaurant, and part of the abnormality stems from its ability to be more cavalier than usual about diners’ response to individual dishes. “What they like comes second,” he says. “Creativity comes first.” Pointing to the exciting but undelicious Petroleum, he continues, “We don’t ask if a dish is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Here there’s no such question. Our question is: Does it make your hair stand up on end? Is it magic?”</p>
<p class="indent">In theory, Andrea agrees. She has worked in enough important restaurants to appreciate the thrill that comes from a dish that breaks new ground. She admires the inquisitiveness and daring that go into the high-wire act that elBulli sets for itself each year. And as someone who tends to describe dishes in terms of their aesthetics, she implicitly understands the value in creating something that is beautiful, whether it be a painting or a plate of pasta. But still, she can’t help wondering why a chef would risk alienating his clientele. The fact that this issue troubles her makes her wonder about her own creative abilities; maybe, she thinks, she wasn’t cut out for this kind of cooking. But she can’t shake a more fundamental doubt about elBulli. Aren’t restaurants about nurturing people, about making them feel cared for? Why, she wonders, would you want to risk that?</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">One afternoon in September, just before the start of service, the entire staff gathers for a group photo. Like almost everything at elBulli, the brigade is recorded and archived, and if you could go back and look at the annual photos from the past twenty years, you would find among them the young(er) faces of some of the best chefs in the world: not just Redzepi and Aduriz but Grant Achatz, Joan Roca, Jason Atherton, Quique Dacosta, Will Goldfarb, José Andrés, Nuno Mendes, Josean Martínez, and many others. Maybe that sense—that the photograph constitutes a kind of confirmation that each stagiaire has been part of this history-making restaurant—explains the giddiness in the air that day. Or maybe it is simply that, like grade school children who get out of class for their annual portraits, mise en place was cut short by thirty minutes. In any case, there is a joyfulness to the event, as the chefs gather on the hill outside the kitchen and jostle one another as they get into position. Marc has come in for the day and is trading wisecracks with the chefs de cuisine. Juli is making his habitually strange, if humorous, comments, and even Ferran, taking his place at the front, is in a jovial mood. As the house photographer, Francesc Guillamet, snaps away, a sense of bonhomie emanates from the group, as if they are all the dearest of friends involved in something much larger than themselves.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_132"/><img alt="Image" height="450" src="../images/f0132-01.jpg" width="300"/></p>
<p class="caption">Andrea Correa (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_133"/>The reality is a little more complicated. For one thing, they don’t all know one another. Now that the season is halfway over, several of the original stagiaires have left. Some, such as Laia and Sergi, have returned to their culinary schools; others, such as Ralph and José Luis, were slated to stay only three months. Miguel Alexander was supposed to stay the entire season, but his pregnant girlfriend, at home in Venezuela, made him think better of that decision. In his and the others’ places are new stagiaires, including Eduardo Carmona from Mexico and Alfonso Gómez, a cook in the Spanish navy, who occupies the position that the restaurant (in homage to Ferran’s own history) reserves each year for someone from the military. Short-term stagiaires have also begun arriving. For the rest of the season, there will be a steady trickle of cooks who come for a few days or a couple of weeks to absorb what they can. Jung, from South Korea, is one of them.</p>
<p class="indent">The full-season stagiaires are sad to see their companions depart—Roger will miss seeing his now-serious girlfriend, Laia, and Miguel Alexander was one of Diego’s best friends in the kitchen. But they are also relieved to have some fresh blood around. “Everyone was getting a little cranky, “ Andrea confesses. “People were snipping at each other; you can tell they were just tired of being around each other.” Antonio agrees. “We’ve all been getting a little bored and tired of being here,” he says. “It’s good to have these new people here, who are excited like we were a few months ago. They bring new energy.”</p>
<p class="indent">The change also means, however, that people who had gotten used to working together now have to readjust. A two-tiered system emerges, as the new stagiaires struggle to learn skills the old ones have mastered and the old ones struggle to contain their frustration that it now takes the brigade longer to complete tasks it had only recently pared to a bare minimum of time. It also means that Eugeni’s fierce attention to the center table, which had eased a bit in recent weeks as he became more confident that his charges knew what they were doing, is now back in full force. And it means that more mistakes are committed. Victor, from Mexico, has yet to get the right amount of pressure on the syringe for the lentils; during his first few days he often presses too hard, splattering those nearest him with olive green batter.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_134"/>For the photo, Ferran adopts his habitually serious expression: a fierce gaze that makes him look as if he is challenging the camera to a duel. Everyone else smiles broadly. But if you look closely, you’ll see something else, a certain slump to their shoulders that betrays exhaustion and torpor. Thanks to the long hours of physical labor, almost all the stagiaires are thinner than when they started, but their movements, compared with those at the beginning of the season, seem less athletic and determined. And although this is not evident in the photograph, a little time in the kitchen makes it clear that not everyone is clinging to the rules as meticulously as before. Over the course of a few September days, Eduard finds several <span class="txit">tapers</span> thrown accidentally in the trash. Iosu, though freed several weeks ago from the burden of the yubas, seems to be chafing under his new routine in <span class="txit">cuarto frio;</span> it’s not unusual to see him roll his eyes after an instruction or mutter to himself under his breath. And when the month’s four-day break comes around, the Italian stagiaire Luca—burdened by money and family problems at home and depressed by a job he finds crushingly tedious—confesses to some of the others that he is thinking of not coming back. “I’m bored,” he admits sullenly. “In other kitchens you move around a lot more, they understand you’re a student, you’re there to learn, so you can go over to other stations, watch what they’re doing. Not here. Here, you’re not a student, you’re a worker. A worker in a factory assembly line.”</p>
<p class="indent">But if Luca’s smile in the group photo is somewhat forced, Katie’s is unquestionably authentic. A few weeks earlier, Felix returned to Roses for vacation and, while he was there, proposed to her, pulling out for the occasion one of the oversized candy rings made by the Barcelona sweet shop Escribà. They celebrated with dinner at Rafa’s, where they settled on a Memorial Day wedding and decided to hold it in Roses so that Felix’s family could attend. Already Katie has spent one day off scouting restaurants for the reception, and her mother will be visiting soon so that they can start tasting menus and choosing florists. Considering that she has a full-time job until the end of December and is going to move to a new city and begin the preparations to open a new restaurant immediately after, planning an international wedding might seem a lot <a id="page_135"/>to take on. But with the same buoyant faith she brought to the task of mastering the croquant, Katie is sure she can get it done.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Andrea was not sure why she was chosen to be Oriol’s assistant, as precision, she knew, was not her strong point. On other cooks, the chef’s jacket had the crisp, tailored lines of a double-breasted suit, but on Andrea, who was tiny to begin with, it slouched off her narrow shoulders and bagged around her waist, making her look smaller still. At work she wore her strawberry blond hair pulled back in a high bun with one of a seemingly never-ending array of brightly colored headbands, but strings of it often escaped and flopped carelessly around her neck. Her shoulders hunched slightly, and her apron wasn’t always spotless. She met her husband, Andrés, a pastry chef, when they were both in culinary school, and for a short while they worked together. The fledgling relationship barely survived the experience. “There would be crumbs,” she admitted. “Or I wouldn’t wipe everything down spotlessly. He would get really mad. Pastry chefs are <span class="txit">such</span> perfectionists.” Even when cooking at home, the couple squabbled about what Andrés saw as her sloppiness.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor did Andrea see herself as wildly creative, at least not in the elBulli model. She had never invented a restaurant dish, had never really even tried to come up with a surprising combination of flavors or textures. “What I love about elBulli, what I see as the magic here, is how they play with your emotions: it’s like a painting or a great movie. But it’s not what I cook. The flavors are good, they’re just not the kind of thing I want to eat very often.” She pointed to the Parmesan ravioli—made from agar-agar and Parmesan serum—that Luke was meticulously scooping up with his spatula. “I love that dish,” she said. “But I love a plate of shaved Parmesan cheese just as much.”</p>
<p class="indent">What <span class="txit">did</span> Oriol see in her? Her former boss René Redzepi calls Andrea “extremely talented, a great cook,” but Oriol, who tapped her when she had been at elBulli only a few days, had no way of knowing that at the time. He was guided by more pragmatic concerns; specifically, he needed someone who spoke Spanish well and was an especially hard <a id="page_136"/>worker, since he or she would be required to show up an hour or two earlier than the other stagiaires. But what Oriol really seemed to need was someone whom he could—in his quiet, joking way—boss around. Oriol Castro is the gentlest of souls, but doing his job means constantly telling someone else what to do—and not the impersonal mass of the brigade but a single individual. Whether conscious of it or not, he was looking for someone he could trust to receive his orders uncomplainingly.</p>
<p class="indent">Even-tempered in the kitchen, Andrea rarely let the pressure of the job get to her. A hundred times a day, Oriol called for her to do something—write down the proportions of a recipe he had just invented, peel a piece of squash in preparation for testing it, fetch the tray of mushrooms she had just, on his orders, returned to the walk-in—and she always responded with the same cheerful <span class="txit">“Oído!”</span> Sometimes he would call her name and she would stand there, waiting, until he remembered what he wanted. Yet even then she responded with equanimity, never letting frustration creep into her voice. Perhaps that was because she knew how lucky she was.</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea’s parents, both psychologists, divorced when she was four. With no siblings, she lived alone with her mother, María Teresa, in a small house in a middle-class neighborhood. Her mother was not a great cook, and they weren’t a great food family. “She knew how to make some things, but it was pretty basic—rice, beans, arepas, plantains,” Andrea recalls. “It was the same thing every day. And she hated it. She thought cooking was a form of slavery.” Her mother was repelled by the sight of blood in meat and, anytime they had steak or hamburger, would cook it until every trace of pinkness was gone. Even now, when Andrea goes home and tries to convince her mom of the gustatory pleasures of, say, a steak cooked medium well, María Teresa resists. “She always says, ‘Put more sauce on it so I can’t see it,’” Andrea says, rolling her eyes ever so slightly. In that environment, restaurants provided a happy escape: for her mother from the drudgery of cooking and for Andrea from the numbing monotony of rice, beans, and overcooked meat. Her mom would take her out a couple times a month—often to a crêpe place they both liked—and Andrea was always enchanted. “I loved restaurants,” <a id="page_137"/>she remembers. “Not just the food, though I loved that. But everything—having people wait on you, the way everything was set out so perfectly, the way the food looked so artfully laid out on the plate.” When she visited her father, a more adventuresome eater, she got to go out even more, though in those cases the pleasure was tempered by her father’s tendency, as a confirmed Marxist, to see the occasion as a case study for the inequities of the capitalist system.</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea wouldn’t realize that anything was unusual about her childhood until years later. It’s true that there were always men with machine guns outside the crêpe restaurant, and she was never allowed to roll down the car windows. Nor could she leave a bag on the car seat, walk alone outside, or visit certain parts of the city. But it never occurred to her to ask why. It was just how things were when you grew up in Medellín, Colombia.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">It’s easy to forget how dangerous a kitchen can be. One night in September, the stagiaires get a reminder. Service this evening has been unremarkable; tables arrived properly spaced apart so that no one felt particularly rushed, plating is going smoothly, and Eduardo hasn’t had to raise his voice more than a couple of times to quiet everyone down. Now, at 11:30, the first tables are beginning to ask for their checks. Savory dishes are still going out, though they have slowed enough by this time for the center table to seem almost calm. Finding himself without anything to plate, Jung, the visiting stagiaire from Korea, decides to get a head start on cleanup. He bends down at the flattop and empties the grease trap into a pot. The dirty oil is still extremely hot, but for some reason—maybe he forgets, or maybe it is shyness brought on by his inability to speak Spanish—Jung fails to say <span class="txit">“Quemo”</span> as he stands with it and turns. He bumps into Jorge, and the container of near-boiling oil spills down the latter’s leg. Jorge lets out a scream that stops service cold. In an instant Oriol and Eugeni are on him, ripping off his pants. From the knee down, his skin is lobster red, and angry welts are already starting to bubble. There are a few seconds of chaos until it is determined who will <a id="page_138"/>take him to the hospital. Laia runs for her car, and together a few of the stagiaires lift their injured companion into it. With Jorge still screaming, Laia rushes him down the road to Roses.</p>
<p class="indent">The doctors who treat Jorge inform him he won’t be able to work for several weeks. Marc Cuspinera tells the stagiaire he can go home to Venezuela and return the next year, but Jorge is determined to see the season through. He spends the next couple of weeks lying in bed in the cramped, dark room he shares with two other stagiaires. Every morning, one of his housemates takes him to the clinic so that he can have his bandages changed; another routinely cooks him something to eat. The rest of the time he is alone in the dingy apartment, trying to distract himself from the pain by watching bad Spanish soap operas and checking his Facebook page. Usually he dozes off sometime around 11 <small>P.M.</small>, only to wake when his roommates get home around 2 <small>A.M.</small> The days stretch out in front of him excruciatingly.</p>
<p class="indent">For about thirty minutes after the accident, the kitchen is a shambles. Getting Jorge out of the kitchen and on his way to the hospital is relatively easy; harder is getting the large oil slick up off the floor while cooks are still swirling past the stove and plates are still going out. Eugeni goes at the spill with a mop and hot, soapy water, trying all the while to keep everyone clear of the slippery spots. Eduard takes Jung aside, purportedly to chew him out. The offense is serious enough that, in some restaurants, the stagiaire would be fired on the spot. But Jung is so obviously miserable about what he has done that Eduard doesn’t have the heart. With a stern warning about the importance of saying <span class="txit">“Quemo,”</span> he pats him on the shoulder and sends him back to work.</p>
<p class="indent">By this point in the season, <span class="txit">quemo</span> has become something of a joke—so habitual and ubiquitous, so routinely used just to get people out of the way—that the stagiaires consider it practically meaningless. But it escapes no one’s attention that the worst kitchen accident most of them have ever witnessed was caused precisely by someone failing to say the word—and say it, most notably, when it was true. As service finishes that night, the mood is noticeably somber. Every cook in that kitchen is thinking it could just as easily have been him.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_139"/>When Andrea was growing up in the 1980s and ’90s, Medellín was the home base of Pablo Escobar, leader of one of Colombia’s two warring drug cartels, and one of the most violent cities in the world. Gangs and paramilitary groups fought openly in the streets for supremacy, and police didn’t dare enter many of the poorer, crowded neighborhoods that crept up the sides of the surrounding Andes. In 1991, the year Andrea turned eight, there were 6,350 murders in her hometown, or 381 for every 100,000 people. Drug traffickers regularly hired gangs of assassins to detonate bombs in public places, killing scores at a time, though point-blank shootings were also common. In one particularly gruesome incident, hooded gunmen forced their way into a nightclub frequented by the adult children of wealthy businessmen, forced the male patrons to lie facedown on the pavement outside, and shot twenty-six of them. Kidnappings also skyrocketed; in 1990, the number reported nationwide rose to 1,274 from 789 just the year before. For much of Andrea’s childhood, Colombia was the world leader in the crime.</p>
<p class="indent">Her family was hardly immune to the violence. Her father had left Medellín years earlier for the relative safety of Bogotá and would later move even farther away, to Mexico. One of her uncles, who had stayed in Medellín, began receiving extortion demands. He tried to ignore them until he noticed one morning that he was being followed on his way to work. He was on a plane for the United States the next day. None of this made much of an impression on young Andrea until one night when she was twelve years old and sleeping over at a friend’s house. Early the next morning—she remembers it was still dark out—her friend’s mother woke her to tell her she had a phone call. She stumbled to the phone in her pajamas. It was her mother, and her voice was panicked. “There was a bomb,” she said. It had exploded outside the residence of a former governor, next door to the house of Andrea’s grandparents. Her grandfather had been gravely injured in the attack. Her grandmother had been killed. As she waited for her mother to come get her, the twelve-year-old watched the news over and over on television.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_140"/>Andrea was devastated to lose her grandmother, and she remembers weeping inconsolably at the funeral. But she wasn’t scared. In Medellín, violence was so omnipresent and so random that you couldn’t really fear it—it was just the backdrop against which your everyday life unspooled. The fear would come later.</p>
<p class="indent">Like many middle-class Colombians, Andrea grew up assuming she would spend some of her adolescence in the United States. Most of her cousins had gone off to study English for six months or a year, and so, when she graduated from high school at age sixteen (in Colombia, there are eleven years of preuniversity study, and Andrea finished them one year early), she moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to live with her uncle while she studied the language. She arrived there alone, speaking not a word of English and knowing no one beyond her uncle’s immediate family. They gave her a room in their house and sent her to school at Georgia State University, which offered a program to prepare foreign students for college. It was only then, in suburban Atlanta, with its machine gun–less malls and unguarded classrooms, that Andrea realized how dangerous her childhood had really been. It was only then that she started to feel afraid.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">There are no muses at elBulli. The commonly held image of the artist as a tortured soul waiting for fickle inspiration to strike has no place at a restaurant whose reputation depends on constant, steady reinvention. Maybe in the beginning, with some of those earliest ideas—to transform the most classic of Spanish dishes, a gazpacho, into a plate that made the diner question if he really knew what gazpacho was, for example, or to pass a purée of white beans through one of the siphons habitually used for making whipped cream and thus invent, in 1994, the first of those infamous foams—maybe those were born from the unpredictable lightning bolt of inspiration. But at least since 2002, when elBulli did away with à la carte menus, Ferran has not had the luxury of waiting for a bout of creativity to hit. After all, he has set a remarkable challenge <a id="page_141"/>for himself, which is to come up with a hundred or so new dishes a year. And the longer he successfully meets that challenge, the more his diners’ expectations grow. People now come to elBulli at least in part because they know they are guaranteed a meal that will surprise them, even—especially—if they’ve eaten there before. The pressure on Adrià to innovate is therefore intense; there is no room for the equivalent of writer’s block in his world, so he has developed an elaborate system that eradicates the terrifying possibility that he could ever simply run out of ideas.</p>
<p class="indent">At elBulli, people talk about creativity as if it were a tangible commodity, or at the very least a skill one can learn and practice. “We’re starting creativity next week,” Ferran said back in June, in the same tone that a department store buyer might use to communicate the arrival of that season’s swimsuits. In other restaurants, words like <span class="txit">research</span> or <span class="txit">test kitchen</span> or <span class="txit">idea development</span> or <span class="txit">brainstorming session</span> are used to describe the process of invention. But those phrases are too inconclusive for elBulli. “Testing” and “research” imply the possibility of failure; they run the risk that nothing will come of them. And that is a risk that elBulli cannot take.</p>
<p class="indent">Each year, the restaurant starts its menu from scratch, consciously rejecting or diminishing the role of techniques and ingredients that played starring roles in the previous season and looking for something new. (For example, although Ferran is perhaps most closely identified with foams, he has not actually served them in several years. “Airs,” however, are a different story.) For that kind of reinvention to happen, creativity can’t wait for something so fleeting as inspiration; it has to be codified. And indeed, one of elBulli’s ironies is that the more widely Ferran is defined as an artist, the more businesslike his approach to creativity has become.</p>
<p class="indent">That approach usually begins with a single departure. Because of his reputation for high-tech wizardry, many people believe that Ferran starts his inventions with a new piece of technology or, at the very least, some arcanely philosophical concept. The truth is that, like most chefs, <a id="page_142"/>he usually begins with a product. One Friday early in September, Eduard asks Oriol for his shopping list. Oriol tears a hastily scribbled page out of a notebook and hands it to him. It reads:</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="indentq">Mató cheese</p>
<p class="indentq">White dragonfruit</p>
<p class="indentq">Finely ground flour</p>
<p class="indentq">Angel hair squash</p>
<p class="indentq">Duck eggs</p>
<p class="indentq">Cranberries</p>
<p class="indentq">Monkfish liver</p>
<p class="indentq">Tofu</p>
<p class="indentq">Mini kiwis from Figueres</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent1">The combination of ingredients is unlikely, but Eduard doesn’t bat an eye (though he does pause to ask Oriol if he wants the tofu normal or extra-silky). It is part of his job to make sure that he keeps a steady supply of new ingredients flowing into the restaurant. Some of those new ingredients come from the travels that Adrià and his team make each year during the off-season: Japan, Thailand, Korea, Norway, and the Amazon have all proven rich sources. Some come from producers with whom the restaurant has worked in the past and who by now know that Eduard is always happy to receive a box of finely crafted smoked butter or surprisingly sweet lemons. And many come from Eduard’s own searches, his regular visits to farms and fishermen, where he is always on the lookout for new possibilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether they arrive through serendipity or active search, all new products eventually end up on the pass, awaiting testing. On this particular Friday, the selection of products is especially promiscuous: a box of herbs; a pair of disgusting-looking fish livers, soaking in a liquid that has by now turned pink; a bottle of elderflower juice from Ikea; a couple of round, green squash the size of basketballs; and a big plastic bag filled with what appear to be Japanese candies—the junky, fluorescent-colored kind of candy that the Spanish call <span class="txit">chuches</span>. Ferran <a id="page_143"/>unwraps one and puts it in his mouth. He makes a face. “I have no idea what that is.”</p>
<p class="indent">So maybe it won’t happen with a Japanese <span class="txit">chuche</span>. But many of elBulli’s ideas start with nothing more than this: a new vegetable, a spice no one has tried before, a condiment from some far corner of the globe that, when tasted, sparks an unfolding chain of ideas. The rose is a perfect example, but there are numerous others this season, too. Pàmies, Spain’s main supplier of exotic vegetables and herbs, has sent in a supply of ficoïde glaciale, a lemon-flavored lettuce whose dense, juicy leaves appear covered in dew. The “glaciale” in the plant’s name prompts Ferran to think of ice, which leads him to the idea of an ice salad. After a few trials, Oriol hits on a version he’s happy with: he places small rocks of crushed ice in one of the restaurant’s handmade gold bowls and dots the interior with ficoïde, watermelon cubes, purple garlic flowers, and drops of balsamic vinegar. Visually, it’s stunning. Ferran looks at it appraisingly. “We’re the most poetic cooks in the world,” he says, “But we don’t advertise it. Because to be creative you have to be very pragmatic.”</p>
<p class="indent">Pragmatic enough to throw out a dish because something—some ephemeral, impossible-to-explain thing about it isn’t right. The ficoïde goes out for maybe three nights, then disappears from the menu, never to be seen again. Still, Ferran can’t get the idea of an ice dish out of his head. At one point when he and several other Spanish chefs were in Brazil earlier in the year, trekking through the Amazon on a culinary tour, they stopped in a dusty town, and as the group stood sweltering in the sun, one of their hosts sprinted off to a street vendor and bought them all cups of shaved ice, doused with Coca-Cola. Maybe it was the blend of perfectly crushed ice and syrupy soft drink, or maybe it was just the heat, but Ferran was enchanted. “Ice,” he says, recalling the moment. “You bite it, it breaks. A totally unique texture.” That was all it took: he decided then and there to do something with ice on his next menu. He thought the ficoïde, with its evocative name, would be it, but he was wrong. “It can take a day or a month or a year to get things right.” He gestures toward the now-discarded salad. “I can’t even tell you what’s wrong with it. But something is. It’s just not magic.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_144"/>Instead, he and Oriol revive an ice dish they tested earlier at the <span class="txit">taller</span>—the workshop near the Boqueria market, where they develop ideas during the six months each year that elBulli is closed. From the restaurant’s local citrus grower, Eduard has recently received a supply of thin-skinned mandarin oranges no larger than Ping-Pong balls. At Ferran’s behest, Oriol begins to work with them. At first he uses tweezers to place small pieces of the same crushed ice—as close in texture as the restaurant can come to the Slushee of Ferran’s memory—on a flat plate, but Ferran wants something that looks a little more haphazard and tells him to use a spoon. Seven tiny mandarin segments are laid in the spaces in between. Again balsamic vinegar is dotted over the dish; this one also gets a drizzle of olive oil and a bit of salt. Ferran takes a bite and rapidly nods his head yes. “But ten segments, not seven,” he corrects. The first ice vinaigrettes go out that night.</p>
<p class="indent">The dish’s simplicity holds a clue to how recipe development at elBulli works. When a product is new to Ferran and Oriol, they tend to manipulate it very slightly. In its first incarnation in 2008, the obulato, the translucent paper made from potato starch, was used merely as a support for the asparagus canapé—unadorned, it functioned the way a slice of bread might. But now, in 2009, they have to do something more complicated with it. They play with its texture by baking it into crisp, sugar-coated sheets for the pineapple pastry. They experiment with its size and shape by molding a massive sheet into the <span class="txit">pañuelo</span>. Then they draw attention to the obulato’s one great weakness—that it dissolves in liquid—by creating the Shabu Shabu, a dish that requires the diner to dip the filled obulato in liquid and eat it before it disintegrates. “Next year,” Ferran asks not at all rhetorically, “who knows what complicated form the obulato will take?”</p>
<p class="indent">Some products resist manipulation—in fact, they resist creativity altogether. Meat has proven notoriously difficult for elBulli to reinvent. “What are you going to do with it?” Ferran asks. “You can cut it different ways, you can cook it different ways, but it’s still a chunk on a plate.” In fact, proteins as a whole present a challenge, and the innovation in those dishes tends to go toward the elements served with them rather <a id="page_145"/>than the protein itself. The “risotto” may be made from corn germ and foie gras fat, but the baby cuttlefish that sit atop it are still plain grilled cuttlefish. Every now and then, the chefs will find a way out of the protein trap—in 2007, one of the last courses before dessert was a hare with apple that consisted of a bowl of intensely flavored, thickened rabbit stock with a bright pink apple gelatin in the center, a concise reversal of the normal meat in the center surrounded by sauce. And one of the great innovations of 2009 was to create a sequence of game dishes, so that the diner moved from a snifter filled with squab consommé to a rabbit loin with cocoa-dusted foie gras ravioli to rabbit brains in hare “juice.” But mostly Ferran gets around the protein problem by using cuts of meat that no one else would. This predilection goes far beyond the taste for offal that is so trendy today. Rather than calf’s liver and pig’s feet, elBulli serves cow tendons and goat kidneys and tiny little bunny tongues. There are woodcock heads, served with the beak intact (the better for clutching while you suck the brains out of the skull). There is cartilage, taken from the back of the chicken and deep-fried, so that it is both crunchy and gelatinous. And there are those rabbit brains—fried, poached, sautéed. Once, while a chef was visiting from the United States, Ferran opened a box of chickens that had just arrived from France and pointed to the carcasses—head and feet still attached, plump bodies wrapped in white muslin—and said, “That is the best chicken I’ve ever eaten.” He proceeded to explain that the bird was a breed that dated back to the time of King Henri V and had been on the verge of extinction when a pair of farmers in southwest France decided to try to save it. The chickens were raised on pasture, their diet consisting solely of grass and grubs. The result, Ferran emphasized again, was “the best chicken” he’d ever eaten. “Better than Bresse,” he said, referring to the famed, dark-footed birds of Normandy. Given this effusive praise, the visiting chef asked reasonably, “So this is the chicken you serve in the restaurant?” Ferran looked at him as if he were crazy. Brushing the suggestion away with a flick of his wrist, he scoffed. “What the hell am I going to do with a whole chicken?”</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, an idea, for all its incarnations, won’t go anywhere at <a id="page_146"/>all. That was the case, a few years ago, of a risotto Oriol tried to make from sunflower seeds. “We spent two weeks on that thing, and in the end . . . nothing,” he says, still visibly annoyed by the failure. In 2009, the snack they call <span class="txit">ninfa</span> looks to be going the same way. The idea for it had come from the flavored meringues that the restaurant was shaping into mini-baguettes, dehydrating until crisp, and then slicing and filling first with apples and almonds, then later with squash and truffles, so that they became the “bread” in a “sandwich.” Now they’re using the same technique to make the <span class="txit">ninfa,</span> but the shape and texture are giving them problems. Oriol first tries piping the meringue in concentric circles, but Ferran doesn’t like the look. He tries wrapping a piped line around a tube to create a kind of meringue cannellone; Ferran thinks it’s not artistic enough. He tries shaping it into a kind of boat, which he then fills with puffed quinoa. Ferran takes a bite and says, “Better. But it needs to be smaller. The first bite is good, but, because there’s no liquid [liquid would make the meringue soggy], you get tired of eating it.” Oriol presents it again, smaller this time. Now the quinoa bothers Ferran.</p>
<p class="indent">“Do it with nuts,” he says.</p>
<p class="indent">Oriol objects. “But we already have nuts in the Shabu Shabu and the mimetic peanuts.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Okay, then do it with pistachios.” Ferran replies.</p>
<p class="indent">“Pistachios?” If Oriol knows that these too are a kind of nut, he keeps that information to himself. “What about sunflower seeds?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Sunflower seeds?” Ferran shakes his head, perhaps in memory of that ill-fated risotto. Then he reconsiders. “Okay, do it with pistachios first and then sunflower seeds. “</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran turns away, obviously still occupied with the meringue problem. “The level is there, but something’s missing,” he says distractedly. They’ll try a few more versions, but the <span class="txit">ninfa</span> won’t be making it onto the menu anytime soon.</p>
<p class="indent">This process of trial and error, in which one variable is changed at a time, is the most important thing that elBulli does, the basis of its creativity. Roberto González, a cooking instructor and food writer who did a <span class="txit">stage</span> at the restaurant in 1998, remembers the first time they got <a id="page_147"/>agar-agar, which by now is one of the standard gellifiers that elBulli uses. The substance had been used in Japan since the fifteenth century and made its way to the West in the late nineteenth century, when it became part of the repertoire of industrially produced foods. But at elBulli, González recalls, they had no idea what to do with it. “They had learned that it was used in Japan as a thickener, so they ordered some,” he says. “The problem is that they ordered it fresh. They were basically starting with a big pot of seaweed, trying to use it to thicken sauces.” There were a lot of briny-tasting false starts before Ferran and the other chefs figured out that they had to dry the agar-agar first, then grind it into powder.</p>
<p class="indent">Even then it wasn’t perfect for every application. Agar-agar can turn most any liquid into something semisolid and, unlike gelatin, will maintain its texture even when heated. It opened a world of possibilities, including the restaurant’s famous ham noodles, made from ham broth. That application is still on the menu; in 2009, the restaurant was making the pasta for ravioli from nothing more than Parmesan serum and agar-agar. The rhubarb and sea cucumber dish comes with a garnish that looks like a piece of crumpled cellophane but is even more minimalist: water and agar-agar. But the substance tends to make liquids fairly solid, and Ferran wondered if another additive existed that might be more subtle. He asked a scientist friend if there weren’t something else besides agar-agar, and in response, learned about xanthan gum, a thickener made from cornstarch. Used in almost imperceptible amounts, Xantana, as it would become known once elBulli began to market it commercially, allowed the chefs to gently thicken any liquid, regardless of temperature, without affecting the flavor or smell. “I could add it to water, and you wouldn’t know it’s there,” says Ferran. “It would just be ever so slightly thicker than normal.”</p>
<p class="indent">There are few unintended discoveries at elBulli, few times when a cook accidentally drops, say, raspberries into wasabi, only to discover that they actually taste good together. Most new dishes start with an interrogation: What happens if we freeze-dry foie gras? Can we come up with a new way to thicken a sauce? What is the best way to highlight the tartness in a lulo or the variety of flavors in soy? As the famously creative <a id="page_148"/>American pastry chef (and former stagiaire) Will Goldfarb explained to the <span class="txit">New Yorker</span> writer Bill Buford, the “operating principle was always ‘What if?’ A custard has always been made with milk. What if it’s made with cream? (The result is drier and richer.) A chocolate mousse has always been served cold. What if we warm it? (You taste more) . . . What if? What if? What if?”</p>
<p class="indent">But every now and then, the chefs surprise even themselves. That same afternoon, with a little spare time on his hands, Eduard begins idly poking through the products on the pass—the elderflower syrup, the fish livers, the horrid Japanese <span class="txit">chuches</span>. He picks up an angel-hair squash, which in Spain is most commonly eaten candied and stuffed into pastry, and cuts it into chunks. He removes the black seeds from the white flesh, trims away the dark green peel, then stands back and contemplates the vegetable. He slices it thinly. Then, for a reason he doesn’t really understand, he decides to boil it. He sticks a few fan-shaped slices into a pot of water, covers them with parchment, then promptly forgets about them. An hour and a half passes before he remembers to remove them from the water. By now the flesh is translucent and has partially separated into filaments. He dries the squash and puts a slice onto a plate. “What kind of fish is that?” Oriol asks. “It looks like shark fin.”</p>
<p class="indent">They each grab a spoon and taste. The squash doesn’t have much flavor, but the texture is pleasantly meaty. Excitedly, Oriol sends Andrea to the walk-in for some chicken stock, then yells after her, “And get some Asian stuff, too.” She comes back with everything she can think of: soy sauce, sesame paste, ginger, tofu, dashi. He plays around with the seasonings before deciding on a simple broth made from stock, ginger, and lemongrass. He spoons a bit onto a plate, then sets a fan of angel hair into the pool. He brings it to Ferran. “Shark fin squash,” he says. Ferran tastes it and beams. “No,” he says. “Land fin.” It will go onto the menu as that—<span class="txit">Aleta de tierra</span>—but when he talks about this spectacular, and spectacularly simple, dish, he will sometimes call it “ecological shark’s fin”—a reference to the real shark’s endangered status.</p>
<p class="indent">Naming, too, is a big part of the creative process at elBulli, and, as the case of the Shabu Shabu proves, the words that describe a dish <a id="page_149"/>routinely go through as many iterations as the ingredients that make it up. “Naming is where the psychological work happens,” Ferran explains. “I’m not exaggerating—it’s very intellectual. You want the name to reveal something that opens the door to the dish, that allows people to enter. But without forcing them. Because it’s always up to them to decide: Do I enter the game or not?”</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Although Andrea was safe in the United States, she quickly chafed at the constricts of living with her uncle and his family in the Atlanta suburbs. Six months after arriving, she moved to a new apartment downtown, which she shared with two male roommates (“My parents really loved that,” she recalls). After she passed her language courses, she was ready to enroll in college and soon had to choose a major. With her eye on a career in business, she first picked math, but a few months into that program, realized she wanted to do something more artistic. As she pondered a future career, she kept coming back to all those times she had gone out to eat with each of her parents. It wasn’t so much the food that had drawn her then—though she certainly enjoyed that—as the atmosphere. The lovely tables and chairs, the flattering lighting, the pristine table settings: between the physical beauty and the conviviality, restaurants engendered a sense of well-being she felt in few other places. She determined to become a restaurant designer and began taking classes at Georgia State’s hospitality school.</p>
<p class="indent">To earn a little money and get some hands-on experience, she also took her first restaurant job, as a server at the American Café. The place was nothing special—a casual restaurant located in one of Atlanta’s many malls that served a lot of burgers and fried mozzarella sticks. But it had a few house-made specialties that were tasty enough, including a potato soup heavy on bacon and cheddar. Andrea didn’t love waiting tables, so in her spare time she asked one of the restaurant’s Mexican cooks to teach her a few recipes. It was the first time she had ever really cooked, and she enjoyed the experience enough that she soon began looking for an externship in a restaurant kitchen. She landed at the Buckhead Diner, <a id="page_150"/>an upscale diner owned by the city’s most important restaurant group; to this day, it is one of Atlanta’s most popular restaurants. On paper, many of the dishes were the same as those served at her previous job, but the quality was much higher and the recipes more sophisticated. At the Buckhead Diner, the meat loaf was made with veal and wild mushrooms, the potato chips were house-made and topped with Maytag blue cheese, and even the burger came on a fresh-baked egg bun. Andrea was entranced, and not only because she had started dating the sous chef. “I thought I was making the best food in the world,” she says.</p>
<p class="indent">When her externship was over, Andrea decided to combine her newfound passion for cooking with her lifelong desire to travel. She enrolled in a cooking class at the Sadler, a restaurant in Milan, and left, early in the summer, for Italy. It wasn’t until she arrived—and paid the $2,000 tuition—that she learned she wasn’t exactly in the right place; the other students were older than she and conspicuously better dressed. It soon became clear to Andrea that the place was a cooking school for rich tourist housewives who wanted to watch the chef make ravioli. Andrea was crestfallen—and mortified. Taking pity on her, the chef got her a <span class="txit">stage</span> (and a refund), and she spent the rest of her summer working for real in his kitchen. It was her first time on the continent and her first inkling of what would turn into an enduring love for Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">When she got back to Atlanta, Andrea fed her new infatuation by leaving the Diner for an Italian restaurant run by the same company. The pastry chef at Pricci was pregnant, so Andrea stepped in to cover for her and was put to work making tiramisù and biscotti. She wasn’t crazy about the work—it was her first real taste of the precision that pastry requires—but it was a real, paying job in the kitchen, her bosses liked her, and she was actually in charge of something for the first time in her life. If there were any doubt left about her future, she settled it then. She would be a chef. Preferably in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea graduated from the Georgia State program in 2004 and went to culinary school in Chicago (her first choice, the Culinary Institute of America in New York, was too expensive). She compensated for her <a id="page_151"/>disappointment about being in the Midwest, however, by focusing her energies on finding a way to return to Europe. One of her classmates told her that she should talk to another pastry student who had recently returned from a <span class="txit">stage</span> at this crazy restaurant in northern Spain whose name she couldn’t pronounce. Andrea looked him up and was delighted to learn that not only was he from Colombia but his name was Andrés. Best of all, he knew exactly how she should go about getting to Europe. How could this not be fate?</p>
<p class="indent">Within a few weeks, Andrea and Andrés, the two Colombian pastry chefs, were dating. Together they took jobs at Charlie Trotter’s in Chicago to earn some money—though Andrea started as a stagiaire (Andrés was hired outright, making him her boss of sorts), her work was impressive enough that within a week she was offered a paid position on the hot line. A year or so later, they both decided to request <span class="txit">stages</span> in one of their dream restaurants. Located in a renovated warehouse on the docks in Copenhagen, noma had, by 2008, rapidly gained a reputation as one of the most exciting restaurants in the world, thanks to the efforts of its talented, passionate young chef, René Redzepi. Initially both Andrea and Andrés were thrilled to work there, although Redzepi’s managerial style would eventually dismay Andrés. But Andrea remained enamored. “The food he made was so beautiful,” she says. “It was unlike anything I had ever seen, or even imagined. I didn’t know food could be like that.” One dish in particular stuck with her: a tartare made from locally raised musk ox, pressed into a perfect rectangle and topped with neat rows of sorrel leaves, so that the whole thing looked like a tiny field of clover. “We had to individually select and place each leaf,” she recalls, “and make sure their stems were all turned to the same direction. René always said it had to look like a living thing.” Andrea loved that you had to pick up the square of tartare with your hands and feel the tickle of leaves against your fingers. She loved the swath of juniper dust that added a bit of crunch and pungency to the cold, rich meat. But mostly she loved the sensuality of the dish. When she talks about it now, you would think she was before a Michelangelo fresco or an alpine sunset. “It was so <span class="txit">beautiful</span>!” she exclaims.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_152"/>Andrea wasn’t particularly drawn to avant-garde cuisine. Asked what she would cook if she had her own restaurant, she responds, “A really good pasta with tomato sauce.” But beauty, the complicated, sometimes breathtaking, aesthetic pleasure a talented chef can achieve on the plate—that was something worth pursuing. It was why she had once wanted to be a restaurant designer, why she had fallen in love with restaurants in the first place. It was also why she decided she wanted to do a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli, even though it would mean being apart from Andrés for six months. Maybe far apart—he was trying to get a job in Asia, and the two had been planning to move there together. But when Andrea got word she had been accepted at elBulli, she didn’t hesitate. Andrés wasn’t initially happy about the decision, but he supported her and postponed his travels to arrange a temporary job in Spain so that they’d be able to see each other on her days off. Going to elBulli was the most exciting thing, she thought, that had ever happened to her.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Naming is not is the final step in elBulli’s creative process. Even after a dish is deemed magical enough to be served, Ferran and Oriol continue to tinker with it. Some of that tinkering is active—three months after it first goes out, the artichoke rose suddenly acquires a tiny square of silver leaf. But a lot of the development goes on in the minds—and notebooks—of Ferran and Oriol. “It doesn’t stop,” Ferran says. “We look for perfection in execution and in production, but in creation, there’s no such thing. Take the sandwiches,” he says, gesturing toward Jacobo, who is slashing through the meringue he just piped into breadlike shapes with strokes made to resemble the gashes in a baguette. “Now that we’ve got the idea down, there are five hundred ways to make it. Which is perfect?” It’s a question upon which Ferran can cogitate endlessly. “There’s no secret to it, it takes hours and hours. If you don’t have time, you can’t create. Right now,” he says, “I have to feed everything into my head. Feed, feed, feed, so that later, the ideas will just spill out. Like downloading a chip.”</p>
<p class="indent">When an idea spills out at elBulli, it is Oriol’s job to catch it. In his nearly illegible hand, he archives everything: every product that comes <a id="page_153"/>in, every technique developed, every dish created. The information is typed up and illustrated with photographs he shoots with the camera he keeps in a drawer just off the pass. On each page he puts a description of the plate or product, information about the seasons in which it is available, its size, weight, and cost, and a full list of the preparations tried with it. Eventually, the recipes that go on the menu will be professionally photographed and the information about them entered into the catalogue that the restaurant publishes annually (or nearly annually; in the past few years, they’ve had a hard time finding the time to get the print edition out, though photos of most new creations are available online). Even the dishes and ingredients that don’t make it—the magical Petroleum will be one—are carefully documented so that when it comes time to initiate creativity again at the start of a new season, there is a foundation from which to begin.</p>
<p class="indent">It is hard to imagine anyone better suited to this work than Oriol Castro. Thirty-six years old, with olive skin and thick black hair he wears in a brush cut, he is today the second in command at elBulli and the person whom Ferran calls “one of the five best chefs in the world.” Not bad for a high school dropout. Having failed a year in school at age sixteen, Oriol was set to repeat the courses when a favorite teacher took him aside and asked him if he was sure that was what he wanted to do. Until then he had never considered an alternative, but in an instant he knew the teacher was right; more schooling wasn’t for him. For a while he played with the idea of becoming a fisherman—he had always loved the sea—but his brother was a cook, and that seemed appealing, too. In fact, the work was so appealing to Oriol’s brother that he had married the daughter of the local culinary school’s director. Oriol opted for the family connection. He enrolled in the school and at the same time took a job cooking at a small restaurant nearby to earn some money. For the first time in his life, he felt enthusiasm for work, and even won first prize in a national pastry competition. After he earned his diploma, he decided to stay with it. He worked briefly in Martín Berasategui’s eponymous San Sebastián restaurant outside San Sebastián, and in Jean Luc Figueras’s restaurant in Barcelona (where Ferran himself had done a brief <span class="txit">stage</span> <a id="page_154"/>before entering the military). Then, in 1996, Oriol took a <span class="txit">stage</span> at elBulli. He has stayed on ever since, becoming chef de cuisine in 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Oriol works with an intensity that belies his great warmth. He takes a personal interest in the rest of the staff, and is quick with a consoling pat on the back or a word of encouragement. He is the kitchen’s great joker (although, per Ferran’s rules, always discreetly) and its biggest gossip, playfully jabbing Eduard with a skewer, for example, as he interrogates him about how he and his girlfriend spent their days off. The stagiaires adore him, and more than one holds him up as a model. Oriol shrugs humbly at the praise. In one of his first jobs he had a chef de cuisine who kept order by berating and abusing his cooks—“he would purposely leave knives heating in a frying pan so they’d be burning hot when you picked them up,” he recalls—and he determined to be different if he ever had the opportunity. “A big part of the job of chef de cuisine is psychology,” he says. “But mostly I just act the way I want to be treated.”</p>
<p class="indent">In his professional trajectory, Oriol is typical of the restaurant’s permanent staff. Like Marc Cuspinera, Lalo Bosch, Mateu Casañas, Lluís García, and Ferran himself, Castro came young to elBulli and has spent almost all of his career there. But something about Oriol distinguishes him from the others. Ferran has had important collaborative relationships before, especially with Xavier Sagristà, who helped develop ideas during elBulli’s first great period of invention, 1990 to 1994. But in Oriol he has found someone more like himself—someone with as fierce an insistence on asking “What if?” “I’m a complicated person, and so is he,” Oriol says. “But Ferran and I understand each other. All we need is a look or a couple of words to communicate.”</p>
<p class="indent">By now they share a palate—“I can usually tell when Ferran is going to like something or not,” Oriol says—and a vast mental warehouse of recipes, successful and not. They also share the tendency to archive, to collect. Not only does Oriol keep close and detailed track of every product or technique they try, but he keeps tabs on possible uses for products that the restaurant has not yet explored. He takes advantage of the <a id="page_155"/>stagiaires from Mexico, for example, to draw up a list of all the uses of corn in their country, which he then organizes into a culinary flowchart of sorts, with ground corn leading to tortillas and tortillas leading to enchiladas and tamales. Later in the season he will develop more charts: one that tracks the uses of the potato-starch obulato, another that depicts all varieties of game and their characteristics. But he doesn’t confine his collectionist impulses to food. He has also begun asking some of elBulli’s more famous clients—the artists Miquel Barceló and Richard Hamilton, the designer Philippe Starck—to sign plates for him. They all agree, scrawling their signatures (and the occasional sketch) in black marker on one of the restaurant’s white porcelain plates. He keeps them on a high shelf in the room he shares with Eduard. “They’re for my daughter,” he says, showing them off proudly. “One day, she’ll be glad to have them.”</p>
<p class="indent">More than any other trait, he and Ferran share an intellectual restlessness. While Oriol works, his head cupped in one hand while he jots notes or tilted inquisitively over a chunk of cooked squash, he is the picture of stillness. But his mind is always whirring. A chestnut purée being auditioned for a game dish reminds him of a candy he tried once in Japan, and within hours a crispy, sweet shell with the appearance of pulled sugar is wrapped around a warm hazelnut oil and sits on a plate, awaiting Ferran’s opinion. Like all elBulli longtimers, Oriol is supremely modest and loath to identify the dishes that have originated with him. But spend even a few hours observing him at work, and it’s hard to ignore the fact that many of them do. It is often he who comes up with the initial elaboration or takes a vague concept that Ferran throws out one day (<span class="txit">What if we put all the different incarnations of soy on a plate? What if we did something with those giant clams from Galicia called</span> urolas<span class="txit">?</span>) and turns it into a dish the next. Their process by now is routine: Oriol prepares an element and, when he’s moderately satisfied with it, will take a bit on the end of his spatula to Ferran, who holds out his fist to receive a smudge (this allows him to taste without dirtying any spoons; he licks the item from his hand). Ferran then delivers a verdict—too salty, not interesting enough—and Oriol returns to tinker some more. <a id="page_156"/>Back and forth they go, Oriol adjusting and Ferran tasting, until finally they have fine-tuned whatever it is they are working on. At that point, Oriol plates the dish as it’s meant to be presented and formally serves it to Ferran, who on these occasions is always seated in his chair. Oriol rushes back with the camera to photograph the completed plate, then hovers over Ferran as he eats. Ferran finishes every bite, and they talk about his impressions before Oriol clears away the plate.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine, test, evaluate, improve, document. This is what Oriol does with his days, both at the restaurant and, during the months when elBulli is closed, at the <span class="txit">taller</span>. The work is time-consuming, and he spends most of his time away from his wife and young daughter, who live about an hour south of Barcelona. Occasionally his wife will ask him why he and Eduard, who also works far from home, don’t look for jobs closer to their families, even if those jobs aren’t in a restaurant. Oriol’s reply is always the same. “You know we can’t do that,” he says. “We live for cuisine.”</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" height="422" src="../images/f0156-01.jpg" width="282"/></p>
<p class="caption">Andrea and Oriol consult on a product they are testing. (Francesc Guillamet)</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_157"/>When Andrea first arrived at elBulli, she thought she would like nothing better than to spend the next few years of her career working there. The sleekness of the kitchen, the dazzling dishes that came over the pass, even the light that streamed through the glass—it was all so lovely she thought she would never want to leave. And she quickly fell in love with Spain itself, with the warmth of the people she met, the rugged landscape, the conviviality of the streets and bars, the fact that no one ever went to bed before 1 <small>A.M.</small> It was even better than Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">But there were things that bothered her. She was disappointed by Ferran’s attitude toward his chefs; she was one of the cooks who was most appalled by his habit of chewing them out in front of the staff. She was also disappointed by the relative lack of camaraderie in the kitchen. Because of the long hours and stressful conditions—and the fact that they all lived together—the stagiaires were closer as a group than, say, the average bunch of office workers. But compared with other restaurants where she had worked, something of the esprit de corps was missing. She thought it might have something to do with the fact that there were so many of them: the stagiaires in Pastry and <span class="txit">cuarto frio</span> seemed to work together well as a team and actually enjoy each other’s company (and surely the physical distance from Eugeni’s watchful eye enabled them to interact a little more). But in the main kitchen, with so many people struggling to stand out, there was little sense of community. “It feels pretty competitive,” she said. “Everyone’s trying to prove themselves.” As time went on, she found this wearying, and her enthusiasm for returning to elBulli waned.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of her position, Andrea didn’t have to compete with anyone—she had, in most of the stagiaires’ minds, already won. She had the kitchen virtually to herself when she arrived in the morning, and although her first task, spraying for flies, was admittedly unglamorous, she got to spend the rest of the day in close consultation with Oriol. Most of her work consisted of bringing out ingredients, measuring them, labeling them, and taking notes, though she also got to do some of the prep and cooking involved in Oriol’s projects, peeling nuts or searing off a piece of meat. But the most important thing she did was to take <a id="page_158"/>notes, carefully jotting down the proportions and instructions in every new dish that Oriol and Ferran tried.</p>
<p class="indent">She had a front-row seat, in other words, to every new invention. At the end of August, when the chefs began revamping the menu again in preparation for fall’s ingredients, she watched them develop several recipes, for example, with sweet potatoes. Ferran and Oriol had already shaped a purée of the stuff into a small quenelle that looked exactly like the edible part of a sea urchin, but they had a harder time with a dumpling-ish item they were trying to make. At first the texture was the problem: a large amount of butter made the purée too greasy and left an unpleasant feeling in the mouth. Then shape became an issue: at first it was just a mound of purée on the plate, but that was too messy and loose. They tried siphoning it first and then spherifying it, as if to make a yam version of the soft Japanese rice cakes called mochi. For a few services, the sweet potato went out like that: a large, single quenelle on the plate. Still, it wasn’t right: not very attractive and hard to eat. So they quit using the siphon and began simply spherifying it. The end product resembled the polenta gnocchi they had been making the year before, and that resemblance, in turn, gave Oriol an idea for the rest of the dish. “As soon as he started treating it as an Italian dish, it fell into place,” Andrea said. There were more experiments—they tried shaving tonka bean over the gnocchi before resorting to standard truffles—but two days later the gnocchi were going out with butter, Parmesan, and truffles, a barely reinterpreted rendition of the classic pumpkin ravioli. “And that was it. Ferran absolutely loved it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea loved observing the creative process, but she didn’t feel a yearning desire to participate in it; she was fairly content with her routine of killing flies, prepping ingredients, and writing everything down in her pastel notebook. But one day Oriol fell terribly sick, leaving Andrea to work directly with Ferran. He had decided that day to revisit a raspberry cracker, which up until that point had always been made from the obulato—yet another incarnation of the season’s star product—coated with a powder made from ground, freeze-dried fruit, spritzed <a id="page_159"/>with water, then baked. That afternoon, however, he switched things up a bit: he had Andrea mix the powdered lyo-raspberries directly with water and paint the mixture over a stencil with round holes so that the crackers came out perfectly circular. He told her to set the crackers in the dehydrator, which was the normal technique for baking them, but for some reason another possibility popped into Andrea’s head. Until that point, she had never actively tried to shape a dish or volunteer an idea; her opinion was never requested, and it never occurred to her to offer it uninvited. Despite her position as creativity assistant, she knew her job was to prep and archive and clean up after the others, not to create, and the times when she even got to play around with products—one day she spent an hour or so piping meringue through different tips in the quest, once again, to create the perfect <span class="txit">ninfa</span>—were few. But now, for some reason, she spoke up. “Have you ever thought of freezing them?” she asked Ferran. He raised his head and looked at her intently, as if seeing her for the first time. “Do it,” he said. Later Andrea would say that the new cracker was “more of an accident than any idea that was clearly his or mine.” But they went on the menu that night, topped with a dollop of creamy raspberry purée.</p>
<p class="indent">Later she would add this version of the cracker to the notebook, one more item in a collection that gave her an authority the other stagiaires longed for. Part of that authority was practical—a cook who hadn’t quite mastered a new dish would sidle up to her and whisper, “Now, how much Xantana was I supposed to put in that?” and she would always have the answer. But it was also symbolic: Andrea was the keeper of the keys. Consequently she treated the notebook with the greatest care, as if it were a living thing. There were no chocolate stains on it, no drops of water smearing the text. It was, quite simply, the most valuable possession she and the other stagiaires could imagine owning. Ironically, though, she wasn’t sure she would ever use it. Because the recipes it contained were not her style of cooking, she saw it more as a memento of the work she had done than as a guide to her future. When she <a id="page_160"/>thought about the pressure that Ferran and Oriol put themselves through, when she thought about the precariousness of a restaurant defined by constant reinvention, she shuddered a little. Andrea appreciated the importance and grace of elBulli, but risk was not what she wanted out of a life in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">For all the systematization of the creative process, for all the diaries, notes, tests, photographs, and catalogues, ineffable it remains. That, at least, is the message the stagiaires get when they sit down for a creativity session with Ferran and the other chefs. The class meets at noon one morning—two hours before the stagiaires begin work. Attendance is optional, but everyone shows up, even some of the waiters—this, after all, is why they came to elBulli. They sit in the back dining room, blinking furiously at the sunlight pouring through the windows. There is an air of excitement, though it’s hard to say whether it is from hearing Ferran reveal his secrets or sheer nervousness at being in such close proximity to him, without a knife or stove top between them. He begins by explaining his creative process, how he and the other chefs start testing recipes at the Barcelona <span class="txit">taller</span> and bring the results of those experiments to the restaurant for refinement once the season is under way. Beyond that there is no formal lesson. There is only brainstorming.</p>
<p class="indent">He starts with the soy dish that they have been working on that week. At the center of it is a yuba made, in the traditional Japanese preparation, from homemade soy milk rather than the cow’s milk the restaurant had earlier used. Ferran is extremely proud that they have just started making their own soy milk; he says it’s the best he’s ever tasted. He adds that no other restaurant in the West makes their own—they all just buy it. Then, as if to prove his point, he asks the stagiaires if any of them have ever made soy milk. No one says a word. He points to Yoji, a Japanese stagiaire who has just joined the crew for a few weeks, on loan from Massimo Bottura’s restaurant in Modena, and asks, “Even you haven’t made it?” Yoji quickly shakes his head no. Satisfied, Ferran moves on, explaining the logic behind the recipe. “Okay, so this product is so unique we decided to make it the protagonist of the dish—that’s where <a id="page_161"/>the concept was born. The next step was to add the fresh soybeans. Why did we do that? It adds a certain amount of poetry. We think about soy as something that gets transformed into something else. Soy milk. Soy sauce. But we rarely think about it as a legume, as a bean. And there are so many other elaborations of it—more than with almost any other food. That’s why we put miso on the plate, and soy paste.” He pauses to catch his breath. “What are some others?” he asks, peering around the room. “Can you come up with some others that aren’t on there yet?”</p>
<p class="indent">During this animated discourse on the properties of soy, Daniel has mustered enough courage to raise his hand. “I’ve made soy milk,” he confesses. “At Alinea.”</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran looks simultaneously annoyed and crestfallen. “You’ve made it? With Grant?” he demands, referring to the Chicago restaurant’s innovative young chef.</p>
<p class="indent">Daniel nods nervously, rapidly growing aware that his admission is perhaps unappreciated. “Yes, with Grant,” he says weakly.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferran glares at him for a moment, as the stagiaires shoot wide-eyed glances at one another. When he speaks again, he has clearly made a decision to ignore this information. “Can you think of other elaborations for soy?” he repeats. The room exhales.</p>
<p class="indent">César suggests leaving the soybeans in their pods and confiting them. Yoji mentions having once putting a soy extract into an atomizer and spraying it like dew. But Ferran is hardly listening. He turns back to Daniel. “Okay, so you made it at Alinea,” he says. “But it wasn’t as good as ours, was it?”</p>
<p class="indent">Daniel does not need to be told the correct answer.</p>
<p class="indent">Few of the other stagiaires have spoken so far; ideas have been thrown out largely by Oriol, Eduard, and Mateu. Frustrated by the others’ silence, Ferran turns to the room with a warning. “If you don’t start speaking up, I’m going to call on you.” The threat works. When Ferran asks if there are any other garnishes they should consider adding to the Parmesan ravioli, he gets an answer. Andrea goes first, perhaps because she feels that, as Oriol’s assistant, she should be able to come up with an idea or two. “What if we shaved pine nuts over them to look like grated <a id="page_162"/>cheese?” she asks. The other stagiaires murmur approvingly, and Luca, who is Italian, joins in excitedly. “Yes!” he says. “You could bring them tableside and have the servers grate them as if they were Parmigiano.” The momentum in the room gives Kim courage. She leans over and asks Andrea the word for “lettuce” in Spanish. “Or,” she says, “you could mix the ravioli with lettuce and make a kind of Caesar salad.” Oriol is assiduously taking notes, but it’s hard to know what Ferran makes of any of these ideas. And in any case, he is already onto a new subject: What new products should they think about trying?</p>
<p class="indent">Diego, who has been waiting for an opportunity to speak, volunteers what he considers a brilliant idea. “Horse milk,” he says earnestly, to a roomful of laughter. “Seriously. They drink it in Mongolia.” Ferran tries to keep a straight face. Jorge raises his hand to suggest spherified beer but is cut off. “I don’t want to hear the word ‘spherified’ again.” Ferran says. “Or ‘foam.’”</p>
<p class="indent">José Luis brings up hibiscus flowers. “Doesn’t work,” Ferran says. “We tried it.” José Luis tries to point out that you have to dehydrate them first, then rehydrate them, but Ferran has moved on. Luca suggests a <span class="txit">macaron,</span> but a savory one with the flavoring of a caprese salad. “Tomato meringue,” he says, inspired by the pumpkin “bread” that <span class="txit">cuarto frio</span> is turning out. “With basil and mozzarella sandwiched in between.” The chefs like that one.</p>
<p class="indent">“Write it down,” Ferran says to Oriol. “What else?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Whale fat,” Yoji, the Japanese stagiaire, blurts out.</p>
<p class="indent">Again Ferran laughs. “That might actually be a harder sell than the horse milk,” he says. “Next thing I know you’ll be telling me to look into woolly mammoth meat.”</p>
<p class="indent">The meeting adjourns with an admonishment to keep thinking and to come up with more ideas before the next meeting.</p>
<p class="indent">Later, when the stagiaires talk about the creativity class, they focus on how nervous they were when Ferran questioned them and how inspired they were to go home and try to come up with ideas of their own. “He said he’d look at our ideas if we wrote them down, so that’s what I’m going to do tonight,” Nico says excitedly as he walks back to the kitchen. <a id="page_163"/>Ferran, however, is more skeptical about the experience. “We do it for them, because it’s important for them to understand how creativity works. And because they want it so badly. But is it worth it for us?” He shakes his head dismissively. “Nah, we never get any ideas from it.” And in fact, there will be no more creativity classes that season.</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">All restaurants carry risks. As business propositions, they are notoriously difficult: profit margins are dangerously thin, and in the United States an estimated 60 percent of all new restaurants fail in their first five years. Prices that are too high or too low, unreliable purveyors, bartenders who steal, an ugly room or bad location, a health inspector on the make, food that, in the end, just isn’t very good—a million things can sink a restaurant. Avant-garde cuisine increases the challenge, and Ferran takes it further still, seeking not to diminish his risks but to compound them. By setting the goal of constant reinvention, he must continuously put himself out there in a way that a “normal” chef, who merely has to please his customers, does not.</p>
<p class="indent">Most chefs find two rewards, beyond financial viability, for the risks they take. Anthony Bourdain describes them in his inimitable way:</p>
<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="indentq">I’m asked a lot what the best thing about cooking for a living is. And it’s this: to be part of a subculture. To be part of a historical continuum, a secret society with its own language and customs. To enjoy the instant gratification of making something good with one’s hands—using all one’s senses. It can be, at times, the purest and most unselfish way of giving pleasure (though oral sex has to be a close second).</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="indent">In other words, what you get out of it is the twin rewards of belonging to a group and of pleasing others. Ferran has ostensibly relinquished the latter. He always says, “We’ve been lucky. We do what we want, and people just happen to like it,” and although Andrea doesn’t know if she fully believes him (after all, it’s easy for him to say that now, with three <a id="page_164"/>Michelin stars and a reservation waiting list roughly a million names long), she knows that outcome wouldn’t feel lucky to her; she <span class="txit">wants</span> to please people. For her the second great opportunity that restaurants offer is community. Yet here too elBulli has frustrated her; although she has made friends—even good friends—in the kitchen, she doesn’t feel the kind of deep camaraderie she craves.</p>
<p class="indent">Then one day, toward the end of the sweet potato gnocchi birthing experience, something changes. She starts the day as she always does, by retrieving the ingredients that might be called into service that day and setting them neatly on the pass. Then she roasts several sweet potatoes, scoops out the flesh, and purées it in the Thermomix with the now-proper amount of butter. Already, she feels a certain excitement about the dish. “Right when we started working on it, I knew it was going to make it onto the menu, just by the expression on Oriol’s face,” she says. “And by now I could feel us getting closer.” That isn’t the only bit of intuition she has. Late in the afternoon, she picks up a tray full of dirty bowls and utensils and begins to carry it to the dishwasher. She is nearly at the doorway when Oriol calls out to her, “Andrea, on your way back, bring—” She waits for the conclusion of the sentence, but Oriol has been interrupted by someone else. Then she realizes that it doesn’t matter; she knows exactly what he meant to say. When she brings the Microplane grater and sets it beside him, he doesn’t blink. It is exactly what he wanted.</p>
<p class="indent">Andrea has long observed the connection that exists between Oriol and Ferran. Oftentimes, they don’t have to speak—Oriol will bring a pan over to Ferran, spoon a sauce onto the side of his hand, and be able to tell, just by the tilt of Ferran’s head or a shrug of his shoulders, whether it is too sweet or simply isn’t going to work. She has learned that Oriol is extremely aware of how Ferran likes to eat. “He doesn’t like to cut his food,” she remarks, “So Oriol never gives him anything that would require a knife and fork.” Flavors, admittedly, could be harder to guess. “There are a few dishes that Oriol thought Ferran would really like, and Ferran was, like, no way.” For the most part however, they seem like an old married couple, able to communicate with a glance or offhand <a id="page_165"/>gesture. At first, their level of unspoken communication struck Andrea as remarkable, proof of the extraordinary creative and intellectual bond between them, and she longed to experience something similar. But in the moment she realizes that what Oriol wants is the Microplane, she recognizes that she has achieved it too. “I realized he didn’t have to tell me things, that I just knew,” Andrea says with a bit of wonder in her voice. “It’s like we were family.”</p>
