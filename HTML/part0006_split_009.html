			<p class="rec-intro">One of the ultimate French classics, this could well be my father’s all-time favourite dish… or at least one of them! He likes to eat it with some sauce Albert (see <a href="part0005_split_012.html#sauce-albert">here</a>) on the side. When properly made, pot-au-feu is the most succulent winter feast and good enough to grace any table. A purée of sweet parsnips is a good accompaniment, but the vegetables cooked in the stock and the sauce are more than enough. The leftovers can be the foundation of a wonderful soup or a warm salad, dressed in a mustard shallot vinaigrette.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 oxtail</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 veal tongue</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500g shin of beef (boned weight), tied</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range boiling chicken or 12 chicken wings</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp fine salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">12 white peppercorns</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bouquet garni, made up of leek, parsley stalks, bay leaf, thyme and celery (see <a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ head of celery, cut from the root </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 onions, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 cloves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 Chantenay carrots, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 turnips, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 small savoy cabbage, cut in half</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 small leeks, washed and trimmed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 small potatoes, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g veal bone marrow</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 slices of baguette bread</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">coarse sea salt</p>

			<p class="body">Section the oxtail into pieces through the joints and trim any gristle off the tongue. Place both with the beef shin in a large pan of cold water and bring to the boil, then drain and rinse. Put everything back into the pan and add the boiling chicken or chicken wings – if using wings, tie them in a muslin cloth. Cover generously with cold water and add the 2 tablespoons of salt. </p>
			<p class="body">Set the pan over a high heat and as soon as it comes to the boil, turn the heat down until there is barely a tremor on the surface – it should be about 90°C. Add the peppercorns, bouquet garni, garlic and washed celery. Cut an onion in half and blacken the cut side on a dry griddle pan, then add it to the pot with the other onion studded with 2 cloves. Continue to simmer very gently for 90 minutes, skimming when needed. At the end of the 90 minutes, remove the chicken or the wings, then put the pot back on the heat. The chicken is really just to flavour the stock, although you can strip the meat off the carcass and use it in a pie or mayonnaise salad. </p>
			<p class="body">Wrap the carrots and turnips in a muslin cloth. Tie the cabbage and leeks together securely with string. Add these to the pot and cook for 30 minutes. Decant just enough of the liquid to cover the peeled potatoes in a separate pan and simmer until cooked. Poach the bone marrow in a little stock. </p>
			<p class="body">After about 2½ hours in total the meat should be tender. Leave to cool a little before carefully removing it from the pan. Slice the shin. Peel the outer skin of the tongue, then slice. You can leave the oxtail on the bone or pick the meat off. Serve in deep bowls with the hot vegetables and steaming hot clear cooking stock, with some sauce Albert on the side. Serve the poached marrow on slices of toasted baguette sprinkled with sea salt. </p>
