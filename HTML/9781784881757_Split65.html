<p class="tx2"><b>This recipe has been passed through the generations on Giancarlo’s side. Originally it was cooked in a cauldron over the fire. The sauce is thickened with egg yolks and lemon at the end of the cooking time, which gives a rich, creamy finish to the dish without the use of cream.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>6 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin on</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>12 large sage leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or chicken fat</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 sprigs of rosemary</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 slices of unsmoked bacon, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 white onion, sliced into half-moons</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>600 ml (7 fl oz/generous ¾ cup) hot <a href="9781784881757_Split15.html#page_32">chicken stock</a> or hot water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 egg yolks</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>juice of 1 lemon</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b><a href="9781784881757_Split129.html#page_224">Potatoes &amp; Leeks or Spring Onions</a>,</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Peel back the skin on the chicken thighs and push a large sage leaf underneath each one. Replace the skin over the leaves. Season the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="tx">Heat the oil or chicken fat in a large heavy-based frying pan with a lid. Add the chicken thighs to the pan skin side down, along with the rosemary and garlic, and fry the chicken for 15–20 minutes until it is golden and crisp. Turn the chicken thighs over, add the bacon and onion, and fry until the bacon is lightly browned and the onion is soft.</p>
<p class="tx">Pour in the white wine and allow to reduce for around 5 minutes, then add a third of the stock or hot water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cook, partially covered, for 30–40 minutes or until the meat is cooked through and falls easily from the bones. During the cooking time, keep the level of the liquid topped up with the remaining stock so that it doesn’t dry out. You should be left with around 200 ml (7 fl oz/scant 1 cup) of liquid left in the pan for the sauce. Roughly chop the rest of the sage leaves and add them to the pan around 10 minutes before the end of cooking time.</p>
<p class="tx">Whisk the egg yolks and lemon juice together in a small bowl. Move the chicken pieces to one side of the pan so that the juices collect together in a pool on the other side. Turn the heat to very low. Gradually add the egg mixture to the pan to thicken the sauce (you may not need to use all of it). Move the chicken around the pan to distribute the sauce and serve straight away. Serve with the <a href="9781784881757_Split129.html#page_224">Potatoes &amp; Leeks or Spring Onions</a>.</p>
