<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Off the coast of Cádiz in Andalusia, tuna are caught when they migrate from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to spawn in the warmer water in the spring and early summer. They are caught by a technique called</span> almadraba, <span class="italic">introduced by the Phoenicians and practiced by the Arabs, in which the fish are led through a maze of nets into a central area. When the last net is raised, the larger adult fish are selectively impaled on hooks by fishermen who jump into the water. They are hauled onto boats, where flaked ice is shoveled over them while they are still flapping. Due to overfishing, the practice has now been drastically reduced, but tuna remains a favorite fish of this coast. You need the freshest, best-quality tuna for this dish, which makes a most delicious first course.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 thick slices tuna steak (about 1 pound)</p>
<p class="qun">Juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="qun">9 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound large tomatoes, diced</p>
<p class="qun">6 scallions, trimmed and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon sugar (optional)</p>
<p class="qun1">1 to 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Cut the tuna into bite-size, roughly ¾-inch, cubes.</p>
<p class="recsum1"><span>Mix the lemon juice, 6 tablespoons of the olive oil, and a little salt and pepper in a glass or plastic bowl and turn the tuna pieces in this marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 6 hours, turning the pieces over in the marinade at least once.</span></p>
<p class="recsum1">Just before serving, dress the diced tomatoes and scallions with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, the vinegar, and a little salt. Add the sugar if the tomatoes do not seem sweet enough. Mix with the marinated tuna, and serve on a shallow platter, sprinkled with the parsley.</p>
