<p class="summary">Empanadillas <span class="italic">developed from the Arab savory pastries called</span> sanbusak. <span class="italic">They have a variety of fillings, but the most common is tomatoes, peppers, and tuna. Some cooks add chopped hard-boiled eggs or pine nuts. The doughs also vary. This one is very easy to make and to work with.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The pies can be fried, but I prefer them baked. They are good to serve at parties, as they can be picked up with the fingers. They are best eaten warm but are also good cold.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES 16 TO 20 EMPANADILLAS</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE DOUGH</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup warm water or dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">About 2⅓ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">3 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">4 ounces canned tuna, drained</p>
<p class="qun">1 red bell pepper, roasted (see page 128), peeled, seeded, and cut into ⅔-inch pieces</p>
<p class="qun">14 green or black olives, pitted and chopped</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun1">2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon of water, for the glaze</p>
<p class="recsum">For the dough, mix the oil, water or white wine, and salt in a bowl, beating with a fork. Gradually work in enough flour to make a soft, smooth, malleable dough that does not stick to the bowl or to your hands; begin by stirring the flour in with a fork, then work it in with your hands and knead briefly. You can use the dough right away or keep it for as long as a day, covered in plastic wrap, but keep it at room temperature, not in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the filling, fry the onion in the oil in a large skillet until very soft, stirring often. Add the tomatoes and cook over medium heat until the liquid has disappeared and you can see the oil sizzling. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the tuna, shredding it with your fingers, the roasted pepper, olives, and parsley. Mix well, and let cool.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To make the <span class="italic">empanadillas,</span> divide the dough into 4 or 6 pieces (it is easier to roll out small amounts). Roll each piece out as thinly as you can and cut into rounds with a 4-inch pastry cutter (or use a small saucer as a guide); you do not need to flour the surface or the rolling pin, as the dough is oily and will not stick. Reserve the scraps and roll them into a ball, then roll out again and cut into rounds; do not waste any dough. Fill each batch of pastry rounds as you cut them. Brush the edges with some of the egg yolk, put a generous tablespoon of filling in the middle, bring two opposite sides of the pastry up to meet over the filling, making a half-moon-shaped pie, and pinch the edges together, then lay the pie down and press the edges with the tines of a fork to seal it.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Place the <span class="italic">empanadillas</span> on a baking sheet lined with foil lightly greased with oil. Brush the tops with the remaining egg yolk, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 minutes, or until golden. Serve warm.</p>
