<p class="image"><a id="page_110"/><a id="page_111"/><img alt="image" src="../images/06fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">It is 3 <small>A.M.</small> and the sun is still shining brightly as our boat gently puffs out from Harstad harbor toward the open sea. I am tired from only an hour and a half of sleep, but the skipper, Geir, a teacher in his late fifties, says that soon the light will tell my body that it is daytime, and the fatigue will go away.</p>
<p class="indent">“When you have gone a few days without sleep, then you start feeling really tired,” he says. “You Southerners always have a bit of a problem adapting.” Norwegians like me, who live south of the Arctic Circle, are always referred to as Southerners. Even if our winter is cold and long too, it is just not the real thing. “We who live here have figured it out. We stay awake during summer and sleep through the winter.”</p>
<p class="indent">Harstad is two hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle. Here, in the Land of the Midnight Sun, the year has a different rhythm from the rest of the world. During the winter months, the sun never rises above the <a id="page_114"/>horizon—only a few hours of dusk around noon remind you that the sun will come back, that you are not experiencing an eternal night, although it may feel that way. But summer makes up for all the darkness. From June to August, the sun never sets. Late at night it heads down toward the horizon and just nearly makes it before changing its mind and rising again. During the summer holidays, children visit each other at 2 <small>A.M.</small>, and friends go swimming in broad daylight at midnight. And I am in a small fishing boat at 3 <small>A.M.</small>, heading out to the rich fishing banks right off the coast.</p>
<p class="indent">Geir lights up his pipe and opens a beer. It is still a few hours until he has to go to work, so he can treat himself to a Mack beer, a slightly bitter pilsner brewed in the northernmost brewery in the world—and the traditional accompaniment to the northern Norwegian specialty <em>måsegg,</em> cooked seagull eggs stolen from the nests just after they are laid.</p>
<p class="indent">The sea is dark blue and calm, and there is hardly a ripple on the surface. “Look over there,” Geir says, and points toward the big open sea. “The sea is boiling.” As we approach, I see what he is talking about. There seems to be a furious fight in the water; thousands of fish are fighting ferociously, or perhaps conducting a wild and beautiful underwater ballet. Suddenly they disappear, and a few seconds later they surface a hundred feet from the boat. Sometimes they split into two groups, and once they surround the boat and I can see them up close, shining silver, gray, and blue.</p>
<p class="indent">Slowly Geir takes out the line. He knows that if he rushes, the hooks will only be tangled up. With calm, confident movements, he releases the line into the water. Ten seconds later, he starts pulling it in. On each of the six hooks there is a pollock. They make rapid swimming movements, trying to get away, and then suddenly seem to move willingly toward us. Two of them fall off as they are hoisted into the air, but Geir knows that there will be more. We continue to follow the fish around, and after less than five minutes, we have more than fifty fish in our enormous bucket.</p>
<p class="indent">“That will be enough for all my kids and their families. If this isn’t richness, then I don’t know what is.”</p>
<p class="indent">We anchor in a small lagoon to make breakfast. The water is almost turquoise, and so clear that you can see crabs, small fish, and sea anemones thirty feet below. Geir boils some seawater while I rinse the fish. I can still feel them moving in my hands when I put them into the boiling water. We eat the fish in complete silence, with only parsley, bread, and margarine. I drink Mack beer and Geir drinks coffee. I had no idea that something so simple—and eaten with margarine—could be so good. You always eat more boiled fish than you do fried or seared, especially when served with such simplicity. Still, I am surprised to realize that we must have eaten more than a pound each.</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, just about now the sun is rising in Paris and Rome,” Geir says when we have finished. “They probably have no idea what they have been missing.” He makes a gesture toward the blue sea and the sun—high up in the sky by now.</p>
<p class="indent">“But enough, it’s about time we head back.” Geir has to be at work in an hour and a half.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_117"/>Poached Pollock with Parsley Butter</h3>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO SERVE POLLOCK, AND IF YOU HAVE VERY FRESH FISH, IT IS ONE OF THE BEST, PRESERVING ALL THE FLAVORS OF THIS UNDERRATED AND GENERALLY INEXPENSIVE FISH. IF YOU CANNOT FIND FRESH POLLOCK, USE WHITE LEAN FISH, SUCH AS COD AND SAITHE. IF YOU CUT DOWN A LITTLE ON THE PARSLEY BUTTER, THIS BECOMES A LEAN, HEALTHY DISH.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 small pollock or 3 pounds pollock fillets, cut into 2-inch pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 garlic clove, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 anchovy fillet</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Soak the fish in ice water for 15 to 20 minutes, or place it in a colander in the sink under cold running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Combine 4 quarts water and the salt in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the vinegar, bay leaves, and peppercorns, drop the fish into the boiling water, and return to a boil. Turn off the heat and let the fish cook in the hot liquid for 7 to 9 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, to prepare the parsley butter, combine one-third of the butter, the parsley, garlic, anchovy, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small saucepan; heat over medium heat until the butter melts. Cook for 2 minutes to release the flavors, then reduce the heat to medium-low and gradually whisk in the rest of the butter. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Drain the pollock and place on individual plates. Drizzle each serving with some of the parsley butter and serve immediately, with the remaining butter on the side.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Serve with boiled potatoes or bread and some mustard. I alternate between Dijon mustard and sweet grainy mustard.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO SERVE POLLOCK, SLIGHTLY SPICY AND WITH A NICE HERBAL SWEETNESS FROM THE PARSLEY. I NORMALLY PLACE THE SKILLET DIRECTLY ON THE TABLE—THAT WAY, THOSE I AM COOKING FOR CAN SEE THE FISH BEFORE IT FALLS APART, AS IT INEVITABLY DOES WHEN YOU MANEUVER IT ONTO YOUR PLATES.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 2</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound pollock fillet, skin removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small red chile, seeded and finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bunch fresh parsley, stems removed and reserved, leaves chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 mussels, scrubbed under cold running water and debearded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 whole small clams, scrubbed under cold running water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, diced</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Soak the fish in ice water for 15 to 20 minutes, or place it in a colander in the sink under cold running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat the olive oil in a skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add the onion, chile, and garlic and cook for about 5 minutes, until the onion is soft and lightly browned. Add the parsley stems to the skillet, making a bed for the fish. Season the pollock fillets with salt and place them on top of the parsley stems. Arrange the shellfish around the fish, pour the wine over the fish, and put the lid on. Let the fish and shellfish steam over medium heat for 7 to 9 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Add the chopped parsley and the butter to the pan and wait just until the butter has melted into the cooking juices, then serve immediately. Transfer the fish and shellfish to shallow soup plates, discard the parsley stems, and pour the cooking juices around the fish. Serve with bread to sop up the broth.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_120"/>POLLOCK: A RETURN TO THE TABLE</h3>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/06fig05.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">“Did you catch anything?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Nah, just a few pollock.”</p>
<p class="indent">For anyone who has been fishing off the coast of Norway, Denmark, or Sweden—or off the East Coast of the United States—these words may sound oddly familiar. Whenever you throw out a line—no matter how lousy a fisherman you are, how rusty your hook is, or how empty the ocean may seem—there is always a pollock down there, just waiting to be caught. In Norway, where fish is abundant, it has almost always been greeted with the same lack of enthusiasm. “I was expecting a nice big cod or dreaming of a beautiful wild salmon, or an equally ugly monkfish, and this is what I got. Mr. Common Fish.”</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, the pollock seems more eager to get caught than fishermen are to catch it. Sound like an exaggeration? I don’t think so—because once I caught the same fish twice in a row. I was out fishing for cod and had almost secured a lovely dinner for the entire family when the pollack bit the first time. It was a sad-looking, shiny fish with big, watery eyes that made it look apologetic rather than edible. I uttered the standard words: “Nah, just a pollock.” The hook was in the left side of its mouth, and it wasn’t difficult to get out. Since I was fishing for cod, I released it back into the water. But in less than two minutes, it was back in the boat. This time the hook was on the right side, and the small wound from the recent encounter with the hook was still visible on the left. It was as if it was begging me: “Take me with you. Let me become soup, feed me to your cat. Just get me out of this cold, dark place.”</p>
<p class="indent">Because of its abundance, pollock has never really been appreciated. Like so much food eaten by the poor, those who could afford to opt for more exclusive fish did so, presuming that you get what you pay for. The pollock wasn’t rediscovered in Norway until 1998. The young and talented Norwegian chef Terje Ness went to Lyon, France, to participate in the prestigious Bocuse d’Or—the unofficial world championship of cooking. He made a stunning creation using Norwegian pollock and scallops, with which he captured the hearts and <a id="page_121"/>palates of the judges. Terje was awarded the world championship—snatching it from under the noses of shocked Frenchmen—and the pollock was invited back to kitchens and tables throughout Scandinavia and beyond.</p>
<p class="indent">The pollock revival took two equally interesting directions. It gave us license to experiment with new flavor combinations. Inspired by Terje’s success in Lyon, artistic combinations of pollock—with Italian truffles, or Thai chiles, or Spanish chorizo—started appearing on restaurant menus all over Scandinavia, giving the pollock a sleek, modern image. But, more important perhaps, it also gave Norwegians a revived pride in our traditional recipes. The old working-class preparation of Seibiff <em>med løk</em> (seared pollock fillets with caramelized onions) was suddenly back on dinner tables, even among urban professionals, and—slightly revamped—in trendy bistros.</p>
<p class="indent">And now, if you ask someone who has been out fishing whether they caught anything, you should not be surprised if they answer, “<em>Ja.</em> Yes, I certainly did. I caught the most beautiful pollock.”</p>
<p class="indent">Pollock has more taste than most fish, but it is still relatively cheap. When it is poached, steamed, or gently seared, you can truly taste the fine flavors of the North Sea.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons bacon fat or butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 10 minutes, tossing the onions around every once in a while. Add the sugar and cloves and cook for 15 more minutes over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, brown, and sweet. Keep warm over low heat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, soak the fish in ice water for 15 to 20 minutes, or place it in a colander in the sink under cold running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat the fish dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the fillets with salt and dredge them in the flour. Heat the bacon fat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the fish skin side up and cook for 1 minute, then turn and cook for 5 to 7 minutes more, until flaky.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Remove the cloves from the onions and discard. Distribute the onions among four plates, place the fish on top, season with pepper, and serve.</p>
