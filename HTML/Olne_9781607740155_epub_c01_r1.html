  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page106"></a>The crayfish mousse and the <em>poivrade</em> sauce served with the venison belong to a realm of restaurant cooking that unhappily is of the past. Restaurants today capable of serving either may be counted on the fingers of one hand; for such dishes to be practicable, such elements as game stock or half-glaze, fish <em>fumet</em>, calf’s-foot jelly and <em>mirepoix</em>—plus a number of competent workers–should automatically be at hand. Today restaurants often serve <em>poivrade</em> sauces that are basically boiled-up, flour-thickened mixtures of vinegar, pepper, water, and bouillon cubes—equivalent recipes have even appeared in more or less respectable French publications. It is not surprising that <em>la grande cuisine</em> has so many detractors. I can only hope that readers will try these recipes once before deciding that “nothing is worth that much trouble” and, for those who cannot afford such a heavy expenditure of time, that one or another of them be incorporated into simpler menus.</p>

  <p class="indent">A roast leg of venison needs a sauce, but may obviously be accompanied by any of a number of very simple sauces (for instance, the roasting pan may simply be washed out with Madeira and the reduction finished with heavy cream). Currant jelly is often added to game sauces.</p>

  <p class="indent">A sweet potato purée is hardly the usual French fare, but in this context its delicately sweet flavor and light texture are more satisfactory than the traditional heavy chestnut purée.</p>

  <p class="indent">The juxtaposition of hot and cold, of textures, flavors and colors, follows a logical pattern, and a rich, “heady” cheese finds its perfect expression here (although many wine lovers prefer, no matter what the circumstances, to nibble at an anonymous cheese in order to best savor the wine). A wine powerful enough not to suffer by comparison with that designed to accompany the venison is, by the same token, able to support a Pont l’Évêque—one of the soft fermented cheeses most easily bought in good condition, neither too salty nor smelling of ammonia. Its delicacy of flavor comes often as a surprise after the sometimes rather terrifying odor.</p>

  <p class="indent">The basic preparations for the <em>poivrade</em> sauce should be begun the preceding day; it would be a good thing to treat the family to a <em>pot-au-feu</em> a day or so in advance in order to have a good stock on hand. The dessert and the mousse may be finished and forgotten on the morning of the chosen day, and the ravioli may be prepared ahead <a id="page107"></a>of time. The final preparations, then, consist only in poaching and gratinéing the ravioli, roasting the leg of venison, finishing the sauce and preparing the sweet potato purée—in short, precisely the same amount of time and work involved as if one were to insert some prepared frozen food in the oven for a first course and serve a roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy afterward.</p>

  <p class="indent">The ravioli, the roast and the sweet potatoes should all be put into the oven just before the meal begins—that is to say, about twenty minutes before the ravioli are to be served and an hour before the roast. Ordinarily the ravioli should be finished in an oven less hot than that at which the roast should be begun, but that is not too serious—watch it carefully, and when the gratin is perfect, remove it from the oven. If the cream remains in large part unabsorbed, place the dish over a gentle heat on top of the stove for a few minutes. If your oven is not large enough to take both the gratin and the roast, start the former ten minutes earlier—it may be kept in a warm place until ready to serve—and the roast ten minutes later. Encourage your guests to linger over each course—a pleasure, as long as there is no scarcity of wine.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE CRAYFISH MOUSSE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Crayfish abound in American streams, but are little eaten. Like lobsters, they must be alive when cooked, and they rank among the very great delicacies.</p>

  <p class="indent">Writers at the turn of the century were already bitterly complaining that French streams were rapidly being emptied of crayfish. Today the French market is supplied by importations from Italy, Holland, Germany or Poland.</p>

  <p class="indent">The white wine used in cooking the <em>fumet</em> should be of good quality (I most often use a Pouilly-Fumé), but, unlike the champagne, which remains unaltered by cooking, it need not be of the class of great wines.</p>

  <p class="indent">If calf’s-foot jelly is preferred to commercial gelatin the foot need only be parboiled, rinsed and put to simmer in water, covered, for <a id="page108"></a>seven or eight hours. The resultant jelly, cleansed of all fat, replaces the water in the fish <em>fumet</em>. If, on the other hand, one were to omit the <em>fumet</em> and the jelly from the preparation, the <em>velouté</em> might be replaced by a stout <em>béchamel</em> to which a tablespoon of dissolved gelatin has been added.</p>

  <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="c01-s1"><em><span class="color">Crayfish Mousse</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Mousse d’Ecrevisses au Champagne</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter, plus small lump</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Fish fumet:</em></p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>several carcasses of neutral-flavored fish</em> (<em>flounder, lemon or grey sole</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ cups dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 onion, coarsely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>thyme, bay leaf, parsley, fennel seeds</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons unflavored gelatin</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Velouté:</em></p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup of the fish fumet</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup whipping cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg white</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chervil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small glass champagne</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page109"></a><span class="small">THE FISH FUMET</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Chop or break up the fish carcasses into small pieces. Bring the wine and water to a boil, add the fish carcasses and all other ingredients except the gelatin, and simmer, covered, for ½ hour. Add the gelatin, which has been softened in a bit of cold water, a couple of minutes before removing from the heat, stir to dissolve, and pass the liquid through a sieve, pressing bones and flavoring to extract the juices.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE VELOUTE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt the butter, stir in the flour, cook for a couple of minutes, continuing to stir, over a low flame. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly pour in the cup of <em>fumet</em>, stirring all the while to avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, still stirring, and leave over a tiny flame, a bit to the side, to barely bubble for about 20 minutes, occasionally removing the bit of skin that forms on the surface.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE MOUSSE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Melt a small lump of butter in a large skillet or <em>sauteuse</em>, add the <em>mirepoix</em> and heat over a low to medium flame. As rapidly as possible, beginning with the largest, rinse each crayfish and holding it firmly in the left hand (with a towel to avoid being pinched), tear loose, with a tiny, abrupt motion to each side, the central tail flap, or fin. Pull the tail flap gently in order to ease out the thread of intestine without breaking it and drop the crayfish into the <em>mirepoix</em>. The intestine, if not removed, lends a bitter taste, but once removed, the animal should be put to cook as rapidly as possible to prevent the loss of its juices.</p>

  <p class="indent">When all are in the pan, turn the flame high, add the seasoning, toss and stir them around until they have turned red, add the cup of wine, bring to a boil, lower the flame, and leave to cook, covered, for 7 or 8 minutes. Select the handsomest and most regularly formed of the crayfish—one for each guest—and put them aside. Tear the others in two, carefully remove (and discard) the shells from the tails and put the latter aside with the whole crayfish. Pound the carapaces (that is to say, the entire upper part of the crustacean, including the pincers), 3 or 4 at a time, in a mortar (or reduce them to a rough purée in a blender, adding a bit of the cooking liquid), then thoroughly work in the 2 ounces of butter, pounding and turning the mixture with the pestle. <a id="page110"></a>Add this <em>pommade</em>, along with the <em>mirepoix</em> cooking juices, to the <em>velouté</em>. Bring to a boil, mixing and stirring well, remove from the heat, and pass the contents of the saucepan through a food mill or <em>moulinette</em>, using the medium blade—this will eliminate the coarser debris of the carapaces. Pass this purée, in small quantities at a time, through a fine drum sieve, cleaning the surface well after each passage, discarding the residue, and collecting the purée into a large mixing bowl.</p>

  <p class="indent">Embed the bowl in cracked ice and stir the purée continuously until it begins to thicken or “set.” Whip the cream until semi-firm but not stiff, and mix it in thoroughly but gently. Pour into a deep platter or a shallow crystal dish, large enough to easily contain the bed of mousse and later the final decoration of tails, crayfish and jelly without giving a crowded effect. Put to set in the coldest part of the refrigerator, or embed in ice, but do not put in the freezer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine the remaining <em>fumet</em>, the chopped chervil and tarragon and the egg white, beaten stiff, in a saucepan, bring to a boil, whisking all the time and, when the boil is reached, lower the flame and simmer for 4 or 5 minutes, whisking from time to time. Pour into a sieve placed over a bowl and lined with a kitchen towel or other finely textured cloth. When the filtered jelly is nearly cold, stir in the champagne.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE DECORATION</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Truss the reserved whole crayfish by pulling the tip of the tail upward in an arc toward the head—gently, without forcing—and, with equal care, easing the pincers back to meet it. Pierce the tail near the base, on each side, with the immobile point of each pincer. Arrange the trussed crayfish on the surface of the solid mousse. Place the additional shelled tails around in a decorative pattern and add something green (parboiled tarragon leaves or small bouquets of chervil) to the composition. Coat everything with the jelly (turning it, small quantities at a time, into a small bowl embedded in cracked ice, and rapidly spooning it over the décor as it begins to stiffen), repeating the process a few times on the trussed crayfish, which will require a heavier coating. Chill well. It is both practical and attractive, for the service, to embed the serving dish in cracked ice.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page111"></a>THE CHICKEN RAVIOLI</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A particularly happy variation is the substitution of a couple of tablespoonfuls of finely chopped truffle peelings for the <em>fines herbes</em>, but possibilities are endless. <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh6">Duxelles</a></em> can also be a useful addition.</p>

  <h3 class="section1 sgc-2" id="c01-s2"><em><span class="color">Ravioli of Chicken Breasts</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pellmènes de Blancs de Volaille</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="textbox"><em>Noodle dough:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ teaspoon salt (about)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 whole eggs and 3 yolks</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Filling:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 good-sized chicken-breast halves (1 whole breast)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon each parsley and chervil, and a few leaves of tarragon, all finely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Final preparation:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons (1½ ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons (1½ ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream (approximately)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE NOODLE DOUGH</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, add the whole eggs and the yolks and mix together thoroughly. The paste should be fairly firm but malleable (perhaps slightly firmer than short paste). If it does not seem stiff enough, sprinkle in a bit more flour, or if it is too stiff, add a bit of the extra egg white. Knead it with the palms of the hands on a lightly floured board, roll into a ball, wrap in wax paper and put into the refrigerator to “relax” its elasticity for an hour or so.</p>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page112"></a><span class="small">THE FILLING</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Allow the butter to stand at kitchen temperature for an hour or so to soften. Remove the skin and bones from the chicken breasts, scrape the flesh with a small sharp knife, following the grain and removing all nerve tissue as you proceed. Chop finely until it forms a unified mass of coarse purée. Mix the chicken thoroughly with the butter, the seasoning and the <em>fines</em> <em>herbes</em> and refrigerate until ready for use.</p>

  <p class="indent">Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll each out thinly on a lightly floured board to form an approximately square shape, turning it over regularly and sprinkling with flour, if necessary. Imagining the sheet of paste to be lined both horizontally and vertically at 2- to 2½-inch intervals, place a small teaspoonful of filling in a mound at each intersection. Using a small brush, repeatedly dipped in water, moisten wide lines in both directions between the mounds of filling, place another sheet of paste on top and press well all along the moistened areas with the side of the hand so that each bit of filling is completely sealed in. Cut along the center of each sealed line with a wooden pastry wheel or a knife. Make certain that each “package” is well sealed on all sides. The ravioli may equally well be made by cutting the sheet of paste into circular or square sections, placing filling in the center of each, moistening the edges, and folding each into a half-circle or triangle. They may be prepared hours ahead of time, in which case they should be kept spread out on a lightly floured board.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE FINAL PREPARATION</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Drop the ravioli, a few at a time (to avoid their sticking to one another), into a large pot of salted, boiling water. When it returns to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and leave to barely simmer for about 6 minutes. Slowly and carefully pour the contents of the pot into a colander, so that none may be damaged. Pour some hot water over the ravioli to rinse the starch from their surface and leave to drain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Butter a large gratin dish or shallow baking dish with 1 tablespoon of butter, sprinkle the bottom with half the grated cheese, arrange the ravioli on top, pour over enough cream so that they are just covered, sprinkle the surface with the remaining cheese, and distribute over the surface 2 tablespoons of cold, firm butter, cut into thin slices with <a id="page113"></a>a small sharp knife, repeatedly dipped in cold water. Bake for about 20 minutes in a medium oven, or until the cream is about two-thirds absorbed and the surface a golden brown.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE LEG OF VENISON</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">If rare or medium-rare meat is looked upon with displeasure, roast venison may as well be discarded from one’s repertoire. Well done, it is dry and savorless. The leg should be cut like a leg of lamb, the pelvic bone removed and the leg bone cut just above the lower joint so that a <em>manche</em> <em>à</em> <em>gigot</em> (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf3_r1.htm#prf3.12">this page</a>) may be attached to facilitate the carving at table.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c01-s3"><em><span class="color">Roast Leg of Venison with Poivrade Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gigue de Chevreuil à la Sauce Poivrade</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 leg of venison</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 5 ounces fresh fat side pork</em> (<em>for larding</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01_01"><em>Poivrade Sauce</em></a></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Marinade:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch mixed herbs</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE LARDING</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The layer of pork fat next to the skin is the firmest and purest. It is usually sold with the rind attached. (If fresh fat pork is unavailable, do not substitute bacon. If salt pork smells fresh, it may be used.)</p>

  <p class="indent">The larding needle (hollow, with a very sharp, flexible point, widening toward the other end which is splayed to permit the insertion of the strips of fat) should be bent into a gentle curve at the needle end. The piece of fat, well chilled to ensure its being as firm <a id="page114"></a>as possible, should be cut with a sharp knife into long strips about ⅛ inch wide, and each strip cut into ⅛-inch “sticks” (this depends, of course, on the size of the article to be larded and on the dimensions of the needle—the strips must not be so thick that they have to be forced into the splayed end or they will slip out rather than penetrate the meat). The plumpest wide surface of the leg and the two sides (that is to say, the three-quarters of the surface not resting on the bottom of the roasting pan) should be larded.</p>

  <p class="indent">The only practical and painless way to lard a piece of meat is to seat oneself comfortably in a chair and place the article to be larded on a clean towel on one’s knees—in this instance with the leg bone end pointing away from one’s person. A <em>lardon</em> (lardoon) of fat is inserted into the splayed hollow of the needle, as far as it will go without forcing—something over 1 inch—and, the needle held in the right hand, the flesh is transpierced from right to left. To facilitate the task, the <em>lardons</em> should be fairly long, but, once trimmed, each will be about 1½ inches long, the central half of that length being embedded in the flesh and the visible ends protruding an equal distance on either side. For aesthetic reasons, the leg should be neatly larded in closely placed rows from top to bottom, the odd rows falling into one horizontal alignment and the even rows into an alternate parallel intermediate one.</p>

  <p class="indent">The formal design of golden-brown protrusions on the surface of the roast forms a presentation as attractive as it is essential to the moistness and flavor of the flesh.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE MARINADE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If the animal is young and tender, one may dispense with the marinade. It should, in any case, be very simple and scant, its object being to tenderize and flatter, without alteration of flavor, the natural qualities of the venison. Cognac should never enter into a marinade.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the larded leg on a platter, sprinkle over it the marinade ingredients, turn it so that all surfaces are well moistened and wrap the meat carefully in a moisture-proof wrapping (Saran wrap, aluminum foil, etc.). It may be kept like this for several hours—or a day or two, if necessary.</p>

  <p class="center"><a id="page115"></a><span class="small">THE PREPARATION</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">As nearly as possible, the roasting pan should be of heavy material (cast iron is perfect), shallow, and just the right size to barely contain the roast. I have always been puzzled by the insistence that a roast be placed on a grill to prevent the meat’s contacting the roasting juices. Unless the roasting is conducted at a stewing temperature, the fat and the caramelized meat juices inevitably burn with this treatment, are useless as an addition to a sauce or for the preparation of a juice, and the flavor of the meat suffers as well. It is comparable to placing a frying pan containing a piece of butter over a high flame. Left empty, the butter will burn a few seconds later, but if, the moment it is hot, a piece of meat, of a size to contact the entire heated surface, is added, the meat gently browns and the butter does not burn.</p>

  <p class="indent">The roast should be carefully sponged dry with a towel and the dried surface rubbed or patted with oil. (Any other moisture creates a steaming process, which bleeds the meat of its juices and prevents the rapid browning that seals the surface so that all the juices remain inside. Oiling, on the other hand, hastens this browning process.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Start the roast in a hot oven (about 400° F.). After 10 minutes, season it with salt and freshly ground pepper and turn the oven down to medium (about 325° F.). After another 15 or 20 minutes begin to baste it regularly.</p>

  <p class="indent">For an average leg of venison, count about 40 minutes of actual roasting time and an additional 20 minutes for the meat to rest in a warm place (it may be left in the oven, turned off, with the door propped slightly ajar; remove it first for a couple of minutes to arrest the cooking process, then return it).</p>

  <p class="indent">Present it unadorned on a heated platter, the sauce and sweet potato purée served separately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c01_01">THE POIVRADE SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A <em>sauce poivrade</em> is a sharply seasoned essence of meats and aromatic elements. A certain amount of flour gives it body, but its presence, thanks to the long cooking and purifying process, is indiscernible, and the <a id="page116"></a>suave consistency of the sauce depends on the reduction of the natural gelatinous elements in the meats to which the final addition of butter lends a velvety finish. It is one of the summits of classical cooking.</p>

  <p class="indent">The recipe, as it stands here (a step down from the summit), although time-consuming, is practical in a home kitchen, the process being identical to that of an ordinary stew. Respect for the nature of the preparation hardly permits further simplification.</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium carrots and 2 medium onions, coarsely chopped, or an equivalent amount of previously prepared <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#mire">Mirepoix</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 3 tablespoons mild cooking oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ pounds venison stewing cuts—neck, trimmings, etc., cut up as for a stew (frozen game may be used)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour (about ¼ cup)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup wine vinegar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup tomato juice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 juniper berries, slightly crushed</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 2½ quarts rich, gelatinous stock—a <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c22_r1.htm#page322">Pot-au-Feu</a> containing, in addition to the usual ingredients, veal knuckle and shin is perfect</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 to 10 whole peppercorns, slightly crushed</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) fresh, unsalted butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">No salt should be used, that contained in the stock being sufficient in view of the reduction to which the sauce will be subjected.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the carrots and onions in the oil over medium heat (if using <em>mirepoix</em> already prepared, omit this step) using a large, heavy saucepan such as a <em>sautoir</em>. (A skillet may be used, but in that case everything should be transferred to a large casserole after the preliminary <a id="page117"></a>preparations.) Stir regularly until lightly browned, remove vegetables, and replace them by the pieces of meat. Turn the flame up (add more oil, if necessary) and cook on all sides until well browned; drain off the excess oil, sprinkle with the flour and, lowering the flame, cook for a couple of minutes longer, turning the pieces to permit the flour to brown. Return the vegetables to the pan (or, if already prepared <em>mirepoix</em> is used, add it at this moment), sprinkle with mixed herbs, mix everything well together, stirring with a wooden spoon, and add the white wine and the vinegar, stirring and scraping thoroughly the bottom and sides of the pan to make certain that all frying adherents are dissolved into the liquid. Continuing to stir, reduce by two-thirds over a high flame. Add the tomato juice and the juniper berries and stir in 2 quarts of boiling stock. Cook, covered, preferably in a slow oven, or over a tiny flame, for 4½ to 5 hours. Ten minutes before removing from the heat, add the peppercorns.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pour everything into a fine sieve placed over another saucepan, pick out and discard any bones, and press the debris well with a pestle so as to extract all the juices without passing the solid material into the sauce. Add enough of the remaining boiling stock to bring the sauce to a lightly thickened consistency—that of a fairly thin syrup. Bring to a boil, move the saucepan to the side of a fairly low flame, and “skin” frequently (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page90">Skimming and <em>Dépouillement</em></a>) for about 45 minutes or until it is reduced to about 2–2½ cups.</p>

  <p class="indent">Skim all the fat from the roasting pan, deglaze the pan with a bit of white wine, reduce liquid by half and add it to the sauce. Pass the sauce again, this time through a fine nylon drum sieve, helping it through by stirring with a wooden spoon. Reheat, remove from the heat, and add the butter, cut into small pieces. Turn the saucepan in all directions, giving it a “rolling” motion, until the butter is completely absorbed. Pour the sauce into a heated sauceboat.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c01-s4"><a id="page118"></a><em><span class="color">Sweet Potato Purée</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Purée de Patates Douces</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds sweet potatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 large white potatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound to 5 ounces butter (softened at kitchen temperature)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Bake the white potatoes and sweet potatoes in the oven until well done—45 to 60 minutes, depending on size and variety. Split them in two, remove the flesh with a spoon and pass it through a fine sieve into a saucepan, pressing with a wooden pestle. Avoid a turning, “grinding” motion, which lends an elastic, compact quality to the texture. Season to taste and reheat over a medium flame, stirring with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and add the butter—not all at once, for only enough should be added to bring the purée to the desired creamy, but not runny, consistency.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_6">THE COFFEE CUSTARD</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The quality of a poached custard depends on its containing only just enough egg for the form to hold at a tremble, once unmolded, and on its being poached at a temperature just below boiling (if the water in the <em>bain-marie</em> is allowed to boil, the marvelous velvety “suspension” will collapse into a vaguely rubbery article riddled with tiny holes). Any simple mold will serve. The charlotte is traditional, but the savarin mold may permit a prettier presentation.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c01-s5"><em><span class="color">Molded Coffee Custard</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Crème Renversée au Café</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="textbox"><a id="page119"></a><em>Caramel:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 or 3 tablespoons water</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Custard:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>tiny pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ vanilla bean (or ½ teaspoon vanilla extract)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 whole eggs and 3 yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup very strong, freshly made drip coffee</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>almond oil for mold</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CARAMEL</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the ¼ cup sugar and the water to a boil in a small saucepan. Keep at a light boil, watching it all the time, until it turns a deep honey color. Remove immediately from the flame and pour it into the mold, turning it rapidly in all directions in order to coat the bottom and as much of the sides as possible before the caramel solidifies. When thoroughly cooled, lightly oil the sides that remain untouched by the caramel.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CUSTARD</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Combine the ½ cup sugar, salt, milk and vanilla bean (or extract) in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and leave to infuse for a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beat the eggs and yolks together in a bowl, slowly add the milk and the freshly made hot coffee, while continuing to beat. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into another bowl, allow to stand for about 5 minutes, and carefully skim off all the foam that has settled to the surface. Pour it into the mold and cook in a <em>bain-marie</em> (place the mold in a larger pan, pour in enough nearly boiling water to immerse the mold by two-thirds and put it in a low to medium oven—325°–350° F.) for about 40 minutes, or until the center is no longer liquid. A solid mold will require a longer cooking time than a savarin, which has a central tube.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chill. Unmold just before serving, first running the tip of a small knife around the edges of the custard.</p>
