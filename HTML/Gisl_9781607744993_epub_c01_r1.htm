<p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page11"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind211a"/>Elvar Reykjalín</span></span> wears pristine white waders with black suspenders and a stoic expression as he strides past enormous white bags of salt. He is entering <a id="ind206a"/>Ektafiskur, his factory, which stands at the edge of a picturesque harbor embraced by snow-capped mountains and is where he produces Iceland’s most celebrated <a id="ind150a"/>bacalao. Elvar spent a quarter century at sea plucking cod from its icy depths and has the souvenir ruddy cheeks to prove it. His factory gleams with order and a hint of bleach. A furious wind rattles its windows, as the July sun that never leaves this remote corner of northwestern Iceland beams brightly onto a massive table at the center of the room. Tubs of cod packed on ice surround the table; Elvar grabs a fish by the tail from one of them and slaps it down in front of him.</p>
<p class="extract">A furrowed line of purpose emerges between his eyes as he sharpens his filleting knife on a steel, moving with the precision of a man who has spent a lifetime wielding blades so sharp that they are capable of separating the flesh of a fish from its silver skin in one smooth, seamless motion. Elvar sets the knife down and reaches for his orange rubber gloves. As he pulls the first one on with a sharp tug, his stern expression is shattered by a grin so wide that it forces his sea-blue eyes into a mirthful squint. He pulls from the glove balls of crushed paper stuffed snugly into each finger. Two of his employees hovering nearby break into uncontrollable laughter. Elvar joins in as he says, “You see what I must put up with? My employees are always playing practical jokes on me. It’s a wonder we ever get any work done at all.”</p>
<p class="extract">Keeping a balance between purpose and joy is a specialty of Elvar’s, a fifth-generation bacalao producer whose company sustains the village of <a id="ind293a"/>Hauganes. The pressure of this responsibility, not to mention the backbreaking physical labor required to maintain one of the nation’s last surviving factories producing bacalao in the traditional way, would defeat even the most stalwart man. But not Elvar, whose indomitable spirit is buoyed by his determination to preserve the ancient traditions of a resource so valuable to his nation that wars have been fought over it. With a steadfast resolve undeterred by the temptation to resort to cheaper, less time-consuming contemporary production methods, or by the crushing blow of an unprecedented economic crisis, Elvar’s commitment to bacalao and to his village never wanes.</p>
<p class="extract">Gunnar stands beside Elvar as he breaks down the massive cod at breakneck speed, so cleanly that not a morsel of flesh remains on its bones. The men share a mutual reverence for tradition and for each other. Showcasing Elvar’s bacalao on his menu at Dill has not only forged a bond between the chef and the fisherman but also between the present and the past. Elvar has visited Dill many times in recent years to enjoy his bacalao in ways he “could never have dreamed of.” His smile disappears in a moment of contemplation. “Gunnar has realized the true potential of my bacalao and my gratitude is immeasurable,” he says. With his grin firmly in place once more, the man of indefatigable enthusiasm adds, “Of course, it doesn’t hurt that he’s the kind of friend I would go to the ends of the earth for.” Here, in this traditional bacalao factory just shy of the Arctic Circle, it seems he already has.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c01-s1"><a id="page12"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Bacalao Producer Elvar Reykjalín</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Did you always know you were going to take over your family’s bacalao business?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">When I was growing up, there was really no other way. The men went to sea. I took my first job on a fishing boat with my father when I was ten years old, and I was at sea for over twenty-five years. The women had more choices. They could move away and marry men who had other careers and forge a different kind of life. But for the men in this region, fishing on your father’s boat was the only life available. Cod is a part of my blood. It’s who I am, and I can’t really think of myself without my connection to fishing and producing bacalao. Without it, I’m not sure who I would be.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Deep-sea fishing is such a dangerous profession. Have you experienced a close encounter with death?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The conditions on the ship were always hard, but especially so in winter, with the freezing temperatures and the constant threat of the boat becoming stuck in the ice. We were generally out for a few days at a time, but once when we were out for around a week in the dead of winter, our boat was overtaken by a massive wave. It completely submerged the boat, and I was underwater clinging to the mast for what seemed like ages. I’m sure it was for only a minute, but when you think your life is going to end during that minute, it might as well be forever. I survived, but in my lifetime, around fifteen men from our village have perished at sea. It seems like a small amount, but we are a very tiny village.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you produce your bacalao?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Since I’m not fishing any longer, I purchase fresh cod from local fish markets or directly from the boats at the marina. I then remove the bones and break the cod down into fillets. I try to get as close to the bone as possible, in order not to let a single thing go to waste. One of my favorite things to do in the world is to break down a cod. I just smile and smile. My wife thinks I’m nuts, but like I said, it’s in my blood.</p>
<p class="Answer">I salt it in the traditional way for up to one year but never less than four months. It takes a lot of time, but there is really no other way to do it. True bacalao only develops its flavor after several months of salting. It requires a lot of salt. And even more patience. We use every single part of the fish. I sell the trimmings and skin to a company in France that turns them into cod fish balls. I sell the bones and heads to a company in Nigeria that uses them in soup. The cheeks and tongues I keep for my family and my employees’ families. Or I give them to very important people in my life, like Gunnar.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page13"/>How have the production methods for bacalao changed in recent years?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Today in Iceland, only two or three companies are still producing bacalao in the traditional way. Now they inject it with a saltwater brine, in the same way that industrialized chicken breasts are plumped up to make them heavier. I consider what I do <a id="ind578a"/>slow food, and I would never change my methods; they are a part of who we are as Icelanders. I prepare it in exactly the same way my grandfather taught me. No chemicals. No injections. It’s much more expensive and time-consuming to produce it this way, but it’s worth it. I don’t think you can call what is produced from this modern injection method bacalao. It’s salted fish. But it’s not bacalao. It tastes nothing like it. Today everything has to go so fast, and it is causing us to forget who we are.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How has the economic crisis affected you?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I’ve been having a very difficult time. I used to employ people seven days a week. Since the collapse, I employ far fewer people and for only a few days a week, plus the price of cod has risen drastically. Just like everyone else in Iceland, I am really struggling. I have had to eliminate most of my packaged-foods business because the high ingredient costs make it impossible to sell my products at a reasonable price to customers whose budgets are now stretched so thin. Many families in my village are on the verge of bankruptcy. It upsets me deeply, because I used to be the one to employ everyone and now I just don’t have the resources to do that. But I am an optimist, and Iceland has endured hard times before. We will survive this too.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you and Gunnar collaborate?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">From a cooking standpoint, I used to just eat my bacalao boiled in water, but Gunnar has shown me that bacalao has endless possibilities. I am always amazed by what he does with my bacalao, and it’s very inspiring for me to eat it at Dill. His dedication to our traditional production methods gets me through the rough patches, and believe me, since the collapse, there have been many. When people taste my bacalao prepared by Gunnar in such creative ways, it creates an interest in it from his customers. Gunnar plays an important role in keeping this tradition alive.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Is the next generation in your family interested in taking over <a id="ind207a"/>Ektafiskur?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I have three girls, and although they worked at Ektafiskur in their younger years, they are not interested in taking over the company. Fortunately, my grandson, who is thirteen, is interested in taking over the business. I will make sure he has pride in what he does and understands how important it is. Preserving this tradition for the generations to come is priceless. Not just for our village but for the Icelandic people.</p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 2½ HOURS (PLUS 12 HOURS TO FREEZE THE COD)</div>
<div class="headnote">This tartar recipe showcases cod in its purest, most pristine incarnation. It illustrates the shortcut to making salted cod by soaking fresh cod in salted water for thirty minutes. This method imparts the same briny flavor to cod as the salting and drying method does, and although it will not have the firm texture of traditional bacalao, it’s a process that can be employed if bacalao proves difficult to source. Spiffed up with a blaze of color from dill mayonnaise and with brininess from powdered dulse (seaweed), it’s a wonderfully refreshing way to begin a meal. Dill grows in abundance in the bird sanctuary that surrounds the restaurant, but if you lack a flourishing dill stand just outside your door, you can substitute any herb you like. The terms <em>bacalao</em> and <em>salted cod</em> are interchangeable, each meaning cod preserved by salting and drying.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the dill mayonnaise, in a bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and mustard until blended. Whisking constantly, slowly add the oil, drop by drop, until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously to form a mayonnaise. Season with vinegar and salt. Alternatively, to make the mayonnaise in a blender, process the egg yolk and mustard on medium speed just until blended, then, with the blender on high speed, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until the mayonnaise takes shape. Whisk in the vinegar and salt by hand.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pickled dill stalks, put the dill stalks in a small, heatproof glass jar. Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the dill stalks, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before using. The stalks will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page16"/>To make the crispy cod skin, pour oil to a depth of 4 inches (10 cm) into a deep, heavy pot and heat to 350°F (180°C). While the oil is heating, scrape the skin with a knife to remove any scales, rinse well under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels.</div>
<div class="method">When the oil is ready, immerse the skin in the hot oil and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown, slightly puffed, and crispy. Transfer to paper towels to drain, then season with salt. Let cool before using.</div>
<div class="method">To make the tartar, in a bowl, combine salt and water in a ratio of 2 to 1, using enough water to cover the cod by 2 inches. Add the cod and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Drain and rinse the cod under cold water for a few minutes. Pat dry using paper towels, wrap in two layers of plastic wrap, and freeze until solid, about 12 hours. Remove from the plastic wrap and pass through a ricer while still frozen (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note1">see notes</a>). Allow to thaw at room temperature before serving, about 30 minutes. Drizzle with oil and stir gently until well coated.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place a generous spoonful of the tartar on a plate, dot with the mayonnaise, sprinkle with powdered seaweed, and garnish with crispy skin.</div>
<div class="note" id="c01-note1">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. The crispy cod skin is optional. If the cod you have purchased came with skin or you have skin left over from filleting a fish, this is a good way to use it. If no skin is available, substitute another crispy item, such as <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-s3">salted cod chips</a> or <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-K2">crispy rye bread</a>.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. At Dill, the bacalao is processed through a ricer before it is thawed and served. It is a nice aesthetic touch, but the cod will taste just as good if it is finely chopped without freezing and ricing it. If you do employ the ricing method, the cod must be frozen in order to prevent it from turning into a fishy mess when passed through the ricer.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. Much of the cod sold in the United States is skinned and filleted. But if you purchase cod with the bones intact, reserve them for making the <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-K3">consommé</a>.</span></p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR (PLUS 24 HOURS TO REHYDRATE THE COD, 12 HOURS TO FREEZE THE COD, AND 12 HOURS TO DEHYDRATE THE CHIPS)</div>
<div class="headnote">These snappy but pliant chips are an ideal way to showcase the naturally firm texture of salted cod. Sourcing salted cod in the United States can be a challenge. If you cannot find it where you live, cover a fresh cod fillet completely with kosher salt and refrigerate it for 24 to 48 hours. The cod will absorb enough salt to firm up its flesh. Rinse the cod well under cold running water for a few minutes to wash away any residual salt, then proceed with the recipe, beginning with the freezing step. The angelica cream here tempers the brininess of the cod, brightening it up with its pickling juice and adding a pop of mossy green color.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>COD CHIPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>3½ ounces (100 g) skinned salted cod fillet</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the chips, immerse the cod in cold water to cover and refrigerate for 24 hours (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note2">see notes</a>), changing the water several times to remove as much salt as possible. Drain, pat dry with paper towels, wrap in plastic wrap, and freeze overnight.</div>
<div class="method">The next day, preheat a dehydrator to 147°F (64°C). Unwrap the frozen cod and, using a meat slicer, cut it into paper-thin slices (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note2">see notes</a>). You will need 12 slices total. Arrange the slices on a dehydrator tray, sprinkle them lightly with the fennel, and dehydrate for 12 hours, until completely crisp and not at all pliable. Place the chips between sheets of parchment paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use. They will keep for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To make the angelica cream, prepare an ice bath. Bring a small saucepan of water to a lively simmer over medium-high heat. Using a slotted spoon, lower the egg into the water and cook it in the gently rolling water for 4 minutes. Transfer the egg to the ice bath and leave until well chilled. Remove the egg from the ice bath and immediately crack it lightly on all sides on a flat surface. Peel the egg, put it in a blender, and add the angelica stalks and a pinch of salt. (You do not need to dry the stalks before they go in the blender, as the pickling juice adds a nice touch of acidity to the finished cream.) Process on medium-high speed until fully blended, then add the oil in a slow, steady stream and process until the consistency of a thick mayonnaise. Taste and adjust with salt and pickling juice if needed.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place 3 chips on each plate and dot with the angelica cream. Garnish with angelica leaves and pickled angelica.</div>

<div class="headnote1">On a visit to northern Iceland, Gunnar and I stayed in an inviting apartment on the outskirts of <a id="ind7a"/>Akureyri, the second largest town in the country (at a whopping eighteen thousand inhabitants) and Gunnar’s birthplace. The only thing our cozy abode lacked was blackout curtains. Not surprisingly, the blinding July sun that drenches the country in light twenty-four hours a day results in severe sleep deprivation for anyone not accustomed to it. Gunnar, of course, is accustomed to his nation’s days of perpetual light and slept soundly each night. Perhaps because he was not bleary-eyed by dinnertime (and because he is a naturally hospitable fellow), he took charge of the evening meal.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">One of the first things he made was this creamy potato recipe incorporating Elvar’s bacalao. It was not his intention to prepare it every night, but we couldn’t seem to get enough of its comforting virtue. The bacalao infused it with just the right amount of brininess, and the pungent horseradish perked up any sleepy brains. It’s hearty enough to work as a main dish and also makes a fantastic side. One night, Gunnar served it on toast; on another, he substituted smoked haddock, an ideal replacement for the cod. The profusion of herbs he added was dictated by whatever we foraged that day. This dish, which is inspired by a popular lunch item at Dill, is festively attired with fennel ribbons, a soft-boiled egg, and sorrel ash—the latter a mainstay of the Nordic kitchen.</div>

</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page21"/>To make the potatoes, immerse the salted cod in cold water to cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, changing the water several times to remove as much salt as possible. Remove from the water and, if skin and bones are present, remove them. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and roast the cod until warmed through, about 8 minutes. Once it is cool enough to handle, break into flakes, and keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the sorrel ash, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the sorrel leaves in a single layer on the prepared pan and toast in the oven for about 8 minutes, until blackened. Let cool to room temperature, then pulverize the leaves in a spice grinder, transfer to an airtight container, and store at room temperature until serving. The ash will keep at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.</div>
<div class="method">Boil the potatoes in salted water to cover for 18 to 20 minutes, until tender. Drain the potatoes, let cool just until they can be handled, then peel them, keeping the peel intact if possible.</div>
<div class="method">In a saucepan, mash the warm potatoes and cream together until smooth. Add the warm cod and stir gently to incorporate. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon the potatoes into a bowl. Top with the carrots, a generous handful of fennel ribbons, a soft-boiled egg, and a spoonful of horseradish. Dust with sorrel ash.</div>

<div class="headnote">Unlike many other vegetables that are traditionally imported to Iceland, <a id="ind517a"/>rutabagas have been grown in the nation for centuries. Here, rutabaga is pureed with caramelized sugar, which adds a toasted nuttiness to this mixture. At Dill, raw vegetables are often used in dishes to add texture and fresh flavor that is lost during cooking, and the rutabaga strings in this recipe are a good example of this technique. The bacalao in this recipe is rehydrated in order to release some of its salt and so that it is firm but pliant. This dish is a lovely celebration of the winter months, when foods such as root vegetables and salted cod brighten Iceland’s dark season, and when little grows save for the beards on the men trying to stay warm.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_space"><strong>Fresh dill leaves and other herbs of choice, for garnish</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the bacalao, preheat an immersion circulator to 133°F (56°C) (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note4">see notes</a>). Place the cod and oil in a vacuum bag and seal on the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for 11 to 12 minutes. To test if the cod is done in the circulator bag, pinch the fish through the bag. If it gives easily and flakes, it is ready. Remove the bag from the circulator and let cool until the cod can be handled, then remove the cod from the bag and break it into flakes, discarding any errant bones. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the rutabaga puree, put the rutabaga in a pressure cooker (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note4">see notes</a>), add the water, lock the lid in place, and cook at medium pressure for 8 minutes, until the rutabaga is tender. Let the pressure release naturally, then remove the lid and drain the rutabaga, reserving the cooking liquid and rutabaga separately. Transfer the rutabaga to a blender and process at high speed, adding the reserved cooking liquid as needed to form a smooth puree. Leave the puree in the blender.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page23"/>In a small bowl, stir together the milk and cream. Put the sugar in a small, heavy saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and heat without stirring until the sugar melts and turns a light golden brown. Once the color is right, carefully add the milk mixture to the sugar. The sugar will immediately seize but will then settle. Turn down the heat to medium and swirl the pan over medium heat until the sugar is fully incorporated into the liquid.</div>
<div class="method">Pour the sugar-milk mixture into the blender with the rutabaga and begin processing on low speed to prevent the hot mixture from splattering. Once the elements are incorporated, increase the speed to high and continue to process until smooth. Season with the butter, vinegar, and salt. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the rutabaga strings, slice the rutabaga with a turning slicer (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note4">see notes</a>) into strings. Alternatively, thinly slice the rutabaga into disks and, using a mandoline (see <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">notes</a>), cut the disks into strings. Season the strings with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the dill powder, combine the dill and oil in the blender and process on high speed for 7 to 9 minutes, until steaming hot. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small pitcher. Place the maltodextrin in a food processor. With the machine running, drizzle in the oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue to process for 4 to 5 minutes, until a powder forms. Season with salt and blend for a few seconds more.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon the rutabaga puree onto a plate, top with the cod and a handful of rutabaga strings, and sprinkle with the dill powder. Garnish with dill leaves and other herbs.</div>
<div class="note" id="c01-note4">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. <a id="ind619a"/>Tapioca maltodextrin, which is naturally derived from tapioca, encapsulates fats such as butter and oils, turning them into a powder and increasing the volume of a small amount of fat dramatically. It’s fun to transform ingredients such as peanut butter and olive oil into powders that will turn back into their original form once they come into contact with saliva. Although it is not necessary to transform the oil into a powder in this recipe, it is a nice way to add something unexpected to the dish.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. As an alternative to the immersion circulator method, add enough oil to a saucepan to cover the cod by 1 inch (2½ cm) and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat. Do not let the oil boil. Reduce the heat to low and add the cod. Poach until cooked through (the cod should flake when broken apart with a fork). Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Keep warm.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. If you do not have a <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass2">pressure cooker</a>, you can boil the rutabaga in water to cover until tender, drain, and then proceed as directed.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">4. A turning slicer is a rare find in the home kitchen, but if you want to treat yourself to a new kitchen gadget, this might be the perfect one. It transforms a vegetable into long ribbons that add a festive touch to nearly any plate and are a clever way to convince finicky children to eat their vegetables.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">It’s common to use meat bones, such as veal, chicken, and lamb, as the base for stocks, broths, and stews, but fish bones are not as familiar to many home cooks. The good news is that most fishmongers will sell them at a rock-bottom price if you make a special request for them. It’s a great way to forge a lasting connection with your fishmonger, and once you do, he or she will often give you bones for free. Fish bones speak to Gunnar’s never-throw-away-any-part-of-the-animal philosophy, and after tasting them roasted in this recipe, you will likely appreciate them as much as he does. One word of warning: chopping through fish bones can make quite a mess. Rinse them thoroughly to remove any residual blood and guts, then rely on the quick, deft chop of a cleaver to cut them cleanly.</div>

<div class="method">To make the cod cheeks, trim the cheeks of any sinew and cut into 2-inch (5-cm) cylinders using a ½-inch (12-mm) round cutter. Fill a saucepan with water to a depth of 3 inches (7.5 cm), season with a little salt, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the vinegar and then the cheeks and poach gently for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cheeks to paper towels to drain. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the soup, place a cast-iron frying pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of oil. Add the bones and sauté, turning often with tongs to prevent scorching, for about 10 minutes, until caramelized. Use caution during this step, as the bones will splatter as they cook. Remove from the heat. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page27"/>Place a <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass2">pressure cooker</a> over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of oil. Add the carrot, celery root, onion, fennel, thyme, dill, star anise, and cloves and sauté for about 7 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the spices are aromatic. Add the bones and sauté for 1 minute longer. Add the water, lock the lid in place, and cook at high pressure for 35 minutes. Let the pressure subside naturally. Remove the lid and strain the contents through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean, clear container. Let sit for a few minutes, then skim off any fat and residue that settles on the surface (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-note5">see notes</a>). Transfer the strained broth to a saucepan, place over medium-high heat, bring to a boil, and reduce by three-fourths, skimming the surface of residue as it cooks. Add the cream and milk, bring to a simmer, and season with salt and cider vinegar. Just before serving, reheat until warm, add the <a id="ind596a"/>soy lecithin, and process with an immersion blender until foamy.</div>
<div class="method">To make the charred onions, heat a dry frying pan over medium-low heat. Place the onions and shallots, cut side down, in the pan and caramelize them to the point of charring. Flip the onions and shallots over and caramelize the second side the same way. Remove from the heat and season with salt. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the potatoes, heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the potatoes and sauté, being careful not to let them turn golden brown, for 6 to 8 minutes, until tender. Stir in the mustard and season with salt. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, foam the soup once more just before service and pour it into bowls with a large lip. Place the cod cheeks on the lip on one side of the bowl and arrange the potatoes and charred onions alongside the cod. Garnish with cress.</div>
<div class="note" id="c01-note5">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Soy lecithin is a natural emulsifier derived from the fatty tissues of soybeans. Since it has low water solubility, it is capable of bringing elements together, such as water and oil, that are difficult to blend naturally. It is also added to dishes that are aerated, such as mousses and foams, since it has the ability to create a stable environment and support the structure for much longer than it would hold otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Any peppery green, such as arugula or mizuna, can be substituted for the garden cress.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. Skimming off any fat and impurities from the surface of the soup is important because the fat will fight the soy lecithin, inhibiting bubbles from forming when the soup is frothed. Removing as much fat residue as possible enables additional bubbles to form.</span></p>

<div class="headnote1">Cheeks are one of the tastiest parts a fish has to offer, yet they are often relegated to a fishmonger’s offcut pile—a pile that interests few people. This is a good thing for the consumer in the know, because it often means they can be had for a song. As bacalao producer <a id="ind213a"/>Elvar Reykjalín butchers his cod for salting, he pops hundreds of cheeks out of his fish and saves them for chefs like Gunnar, who know the value of a good cut. They can be hard to source, but any fishmonger would be happy to supply them for you on special request, and the extra effort to track them down is well worth it. Should cod cheeks be difficult to find, halibut cheeks or halibut or cod fillet make a fine substitute.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Unlike the pickles in some of the recipes in this book that require a day, a week, or sometimes a month to cure, these pickles are fairly quick to produce and are a nice way to use up any extra root vegetables in your refrigerator at the end of the week.</div>

<p class="sub_yield">MAKES ABOUT 2½ CUPS (600 ML) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: 3 TO 4 WEEKS</p>
<p class="sub_headnote"><span class="dk_blue">Beer vinegar is used to enliven a number of dishes in this book with a subtle pucker, and it’s easy to make. It does take time, however, so if you cannot wait the necessary three or four weeks, any heady vinegar, such as malt vinegar, can be substituted.</span></p>
<p class="sub_headnote2"><span class="dk_blue">A mother vinegar, which is the somewhat gummy, sometimes slimy, often wispy layer that settles on top of the container in which vinegar is fermented, is what keeps the original flavor of a vinegar alive and kicking in subsequent batches. You won’t have a mother to use when you make your first batch of vinegar, but if you like the taste of that first vinegar, be sure to reserve the mother from it to make the next batch, and then continue to save a mother from every subsequent batch. That way you will sustain your vinegar’s legacy.</span></p>
<p class="sub_headnote2"><span class="dk_blue">Gunnar is the co-owner of a bistro-type restaurant that focuses on beer and has several different labels on tap. The place is called <a id="ind339a"/>Kex, which means “biscuit” in Icelandic, and it is located in a funky former biscuit factory that also doubles as a hostel for the thousands of hipsters who converge on Reykjavík every summer. Each day, the bartenders collect the beer that overflows from the taps or glasses when they are serving customers, capturing it in a container. They introduce a mother vinegar to the beer they have collected and then let it ferment for three to four weeks, depending on the type of beer. It’s a nice way to reduce waste and produce something tasty at the same time.</span></p>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item_center"><strong>2½ cups (600 ml) dark beer, such as a porter or a stout</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_center"><strong>Vinegar mother, if available</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Pour the beer into a clean, sterilized glass jar (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-K20">see note</a>). If you have a previous batch of vinegar and want to use the mother, decant the vinegar into a new container, being careful not to disturb the mother resting on the bottom of the jar. Add the mother to the fresh beer, top the jar with a piece of cheesecloth, and tie the cheesecloth securely to the jar rim with butcher’s twine.</div>
<div class="method">Keep the vinegar in a cool, dry place for 3 to 4 weeks. Check the taste of your vinegar after 1 week to see how it is doing. It should just be beginning to get tart. Also, skim off any white film growing on the surface and replace the cheesecloth with a new piece. Once the vinegar is tart and tangy enough for your liking, seal the jar with a sterilized lid. It will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator and will soon produce a mother of its own.</div>

<p class="note_center"><span class="dk_blue">To sterilize the jar, put it in a pot, cover it with water, bring the water to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Allow the jar to air-dry before using. You can sterilize the lid the same way.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">When Gunnar was a teenager, he worked on farms near his hometown of <a id="ind8a"/>Akureyri. Most of the farms are a short drive from bacalao producer <a id="ind214a"/>Elvar Reykjalín’s village. This dish is inspired by the fresh milk he used to drink on the farms, an experience he always remembers when he visits Elvar to purchase cod. The sweet-and-sour dill oil in this recipe not only adds complex, unexpected flavor but also dresses the dish in a vibrant green. Gunnar frequently pairs this oil with savory recipes, but here it works well with the creaminess of ice cream. It’s also nice to drizzle over freshly whipped cream on top of a hot waffle. Rutabaga is used twice, for the granita and for the cylinders, which also call for rutabaga juice. If you don’t have rutabagas on hand, parsnips or celery root will also work well.</div>

<div class="method">To make the ice cream, prepare an ice bath. Combine the milk, sugar, and glucose in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, add the salt and xanthan gum, and stir until dissolved. Nest the pan in the ice bath and let it stand, stirring occasionally, until chilled. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scoop into an airtight container, place in the freezer, and freeze for about 12 hours, until solid.</div>
<div class="method">To make the granita, prepare an ice bath. Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, pour into a heatproof shallow container, nest the bowl in the ice bath, and let stand until chilled, stirring occasionally. Place the container in the freezer for <a id="page34"/>30 minutes. Remove from the freezer, rake and stir the granita thoroughly with a fork, and return to the freezer. Repeat this process every 30 minutes for 2 to 3 hours, until the mixture is frozen and the consistency of granita. Cover and return to the freezer until serving.</div>
<div class="method">To make the rutabaga cylinders, punch each rutabaga slice into a cylinder using a round ½-inch (13-mm) diameter cutter, then cut each cylinder on the bias on one end. Combine the vinegar, rutabaga juice, sugar, and honey in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Add the rutabaga, turn down the heat to low, and cook for about 8 minutes, until just tender. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Drain the rutabaga cylinders and place them on a heatproof platter. Using a kitchen torch, blacken the tops and sides.</div>
<div class="method">To make the dill oil, combine all of the ingredients in a blender and process until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, then transfer to a squeeze bottle.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, put a scoop of granita onto a plate and top with ice cream. Arrange rutabaga cylinders around it, dot with dill oil, and garnish with dill.</div>

<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. <a id="ind355a"/>Liquid glucose is not as sweet as cane sugar and does not crystallize, which makes it ideal for dessert recipes in which a smooth texture is desired. Here, it gives the ice cream an ultracreamy consistency.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. <a id="ind670a"/>Xanthan gum is a food additive derived from the fermentation of naturally occurring sugars. It is commonly used as a thickening agent in products such as salad dressings and sauces. It is also used as a stabilizer to prevent ingredients from separating. Gunnar frequently uses xanthan gum to transform liquids into gels and in his ice creams. It can be purchased at specialty food stores and online.</span></p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: 20 MINUTES</div>
<div class="headnote">When Gunnar was a child and rhubarb was in season, his mother would give him and his brother and sister each a small bowl of sugar. They would then spend the morning wandering through the fields plucking rhubarb stalks to dip into their sugar bowls. This recipe is a twist on that memory, with the addition of lemon balm and tarragon to give the sugar an electric green color and an herbaceous hit. For a grown-up version, pair it with chilled aquavit. Indeed, on a summer’s day in Iceland, there’s nothing better than joining friends at an outdoor table in the sunshine, with a bowl of freshly cut rhubarb in the center, small bowls of herb sugar around it, and shot glasses filled with chilled aquavit. <em>Skál!</em></div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>HERB SUGAR</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (5 g) loosely packed fresh lemon balm leaves</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 tablespoons loosely packed fresh tarragon leaves</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup (200 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_space"><strong>4 rhubarb stalks, trimmed</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the herb sugar, rinse the lemon balm and tarragon under ice-cold running water for 30 seconds and pat dry with paper towels. In a food processor, combine the sugar and herbs and process for about 4 minutes, until the mixture is evenly green.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, set out each rhubarb stalk with a small bowl of herb sugar for dipping.</div>
