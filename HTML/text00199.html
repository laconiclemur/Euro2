 SUMMER FRUIT SEMIFREDDO</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0001897">
<em>This is my take on a summer pudding. I like to use frozen berries that I’ve got stashed away from pick-your-own summer afternoons with the kids. This is a perfect way of using them up. Like a classic summer pudding, I soak the bread, but instead of filling it with just fruit, my version is filled with fruit and also a quick and easy semifreddo. It’s not only delicious to eat but really beautiful to cut into.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put the frozen fruit, sugar and water into a medium pan and bring to the boil, then take off the heat. You don’t want the fruit to break down too much but you want to extract as much liquid as possible.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001906">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Drain the fruit through a sieve, making sure to catch all the liquid in a bowl. Use the back of a spoon to push through as much liquid as possible. Then leave the liquid to cool completely.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001907">

<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Line a 20cm round Pyrex dish with cling film.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001908">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Dip each piece of bread quickly into the fruit juice mixture and place around the edge of the dish vertically, slightly overlapping each piece with the next to prevent leaking. Do this all around the edges – you should have one piece left. Break that piece down to size, then dip it in the fruit juice and place it in the base of the dish. Set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001909">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Whip the double cream to soft peaks, then add the golden syrup and mix well. Add the fruit and just ripple through gently.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001910">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the cream mixture into the lined bowl and spread it level on top. If any of the bread pieces come up higher than the top of the cream, simply fold them over. Cover the top with cling film and place in the freezer for 3 hours.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001911">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 To turn out, tip on to a plate and remove all the cling film. Cut into wedges and serve.</p>
