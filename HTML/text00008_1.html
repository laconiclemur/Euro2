<h1 class="cs">A Story of Commitment and Perseverance</h1>
<p class="pf">I often wonder who I would be if my father’s mother had married the man she loved. Susanna Kaisa Herneshuhta (or Sanna, as everyone called her) was born in 1872 in Lapua, Finland. I knew her only as a very old woman. She was eighty-one years old when she died. The last time I saw her, in 1957, I had walked the twenty blocks from my university dorm room at the University of Minnesota Duluth to the county hospital. Her thin white hair was pulled back, and her big, watery blue eyes seemed to see right through me. There was a calm about her that I couldn’t explain.</p>
<p>Grandma, whom we called “Mummu,” spent her last days in Miller Hospital in Duluth. She had been hospitalized because she had developed infections. I had just enough money to buy her a single rose. She loved roses. I wonder if her love for roses was because her birthday was at the end of June, just when the wild roses were in bloom. Her son Isä (my father, also known as Ted) loved roses, too, and planted many varieties in a long, narrow flower bed in the yard of our farmhouse in Floodwood, the small town fifty miles west of Duluth where I grew up.</p>
<p>Mummu had years earlier stepped into a posthole, fallen, and broken her hip. She was bedridden from that point on, as there was no such thing then as the hip replacement surgery so common today. I quietly slipped into the stark, antiseptic room and approached her in her narrow hospital bed. She was preaching sermons in Finnish. I could understand her, but nobody else could. I told her that nobody knew what she was talking about. Her answer was simply (in Finnish), “When God’s word is preached in good, clear Finnish, anybody can understand it.”</p>
<p>When I was growing up in Floodwood, Mummu would visit us, as she did all of her children. For her to “visit” meant that she would be staying with us for at least three months at a time. She didn’t have a home of her own for the last twenty years of her life—except for the homes of her children. Her eldest son, Frank, according to tradition took over the farm after Grandpa died in 1933, the year before I was born. When she was with us, she was assigned to the “side bedroom” just off the living room. That was because she couldn’t climb stairs anymore, and it was easy for her to go out and get fresh air on the porch.</p>
<p>When Mummu came to visit, she brought her belongings in a brown paper bag. I remember that she often wore more than one dress at a time, one on top of the other. Her breath was always sour and she smelled mildly of ammonia—like so many old people.</p>
<p>My father, Isä, bore a striking resemblance to her, with his slightly off-kilter-shaped head, high hairline, long, narrow nose, and oversized, almost bulging eyes. When my father died in 1997, in his late eighties, I thought he looked just like his mother.</p>
<p>Sanna had been in love with a young Lutheran pastor named Gustaf, who left for America when she was eighteen years old. Gustaf had promised to send her a ticket for passage to America as soon as he could save enough money.</p>
<p>Not far from Sanna’s village, Lapua, is Ylistaro, also known as “the village with the beautiful church.” The huge church was built, much to the amazement of the villagers, by the order of the czar in St. Petersburg, who controlled the building of all churches in the country. (Finland had been part of the Russian Empire since 1809.) The story went that the czar got his orders mixed up, and some large town somewhere got a tiny church that should have been built in Ylistaro. In truth, the church was indeed intended for Ylistaro because it is situated in the center of the parish. Sanna visited that impressive church as a young girl, and it was in this village that she met another young man named Konstant Luoma. It was hard times in Finland, about 1890, and men and women in their early teens and twenties, including Konstant, were leaving in great numbers to come to America, where the streets, they had heard, were paved with gold. Immigrants in the New World had to be resourceful. Practical skills and a strong back turned out to be the best assets a Finn could have.</p>
<p>Sanna had waited for her ticket from her beloved Gustaf for two years. Just as she was about to lose hope of ever getting to America, she received a letter from Konstant with a ticket and a proposal. She waited a few months more and finally wrote him, saying that she would accept his ticket and consenting to marry him. It took a few months to get everything together. She packed her belongings into a small trunk, and just days before embarking on her journey, she received a letter and a ticket from Gustaf. Heartbroken, Sanna continued with her plan to marry Konstant because she had made a promise. She returned Gustaf’s ticket and used the ticket from Konstant to come to America in the late 1890s. She married Konstant and lived on the homesteaded farm he had carved out of the forest in Cedar Valley, Minnesota, about fifty miles northwest of Duluth. She bore him eleven children, including my father, Theodore, whom we called Isä. There was no way to connect with Gustaf, as Sanna had no idea where he was living.</p>
<p>Konstant died in 1933. Sanna wrote to her only living daughter, my aunt Esther, saying that Gustaf had finally found her and had come to visit. He had spent his life as pastor of a small Lutheran church in Embarrass, Minnesota, less than a hundred miles from where Sanna and Konstant lived, yet a considerable distance given the lack of roads. Gustaf had married and had five children. His wife died earlier that same year.</p>
<p>Sanna and Gustaf sat at the trestle table in the farmhouse kitchen. Over a pot of coffee and freshly baked sweet coffee bread, the two discussed their lives for hours.</p>
<p>Sanna told Gustaf that Konstant had been a good provider. He was a hardworking, rough, strong, hard-drinking, but resourceful man who was able to make a living with his own two hands and a team of horses. Along with farming and logging, he cleared the forest to pave the way for roads and highways through that part of northern Minnesota.</p>
<p>It had not been an easy life for Sanna. According to Finnish tradition, the women took care of the animals and gardens and anything to do with the production and preparation of food. The men did the fertilizing and plowing of the fields. It was a woman’s job to feed and milk the cows, clean the barn, and tend the vegetable gardens. Women helped with the haymaking. It made no difference that a woman might be pregnant. Babies were born at home with the help of the township’s midwife.</p>
<p>Gustaf, on the other hand, lived in a home provided by his small Lutheran parish. Most of his salary was in the form of food and housing. There wasn’t much cash for discretionary spending. He and his family couldn’t travel, and they were under constant scrutiny from the village. Physically, life for Sanna would have been easier had she married Gustaf, who was a tender, loving pastor and much loved by the people in his congregation.</p>
<p>Sanna had longed for a life of spirituality, the life of a pastor’s wife—especially when Konstant had come home in his swashbuckling way smelling of drink. She had spent her life in prayer for patience.</p>
<p>After their long talk comparing their lives, Sanna wrote to her daughter Esther to say that she and Gustaf had decided not to marry. It was too late.</p>
<p>“I will die with the love of Gustaf in my heart,” she wrote.</p>
<p>My aunt Esther cried.</p>
<p>I still wonder who I would be if Sanna had married Gustaf. I’ll never know, nor would I want to know. My grandfather—who taught his boys to roll their own cigarettes at the age of eight—put resourcefulness, energy, creativity, and a sense of independence into my gene pool. Sanna mellowed all that out with her quiet and steady faith in God. Though Grandpa might not have spent much time in prayer, he lived in the service of his family, neighbors, and community—never denying the presence of God, but never one to sermonize, either. It really doesn’t matter.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Finnish Cardamom Coffee Bread (Pulla)</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">We call this cardamom-perfumed bread “pulla,” although Finns today might call it “biscuit,” which irritated my Finnish aunt Ida. Other Finns called this bread “nisu” and even today there is some controversy among Finnish descendants. <i>Nisu,</i>
 it turns out, is the old Swedish name for wheat. When Finnish was “Finnisized” in the early 1900s, the word <i>nisu</i>
 was changed to <i>vehnä,</i>
 the Finnish word for wheat. I have found this bread in Finland today being called “vehnäleipä” or wheat bread. I like to call it “pulla,” even though the root name comes from the Swedish <i>bollar.</i>
 Whatever the name, the tender-crumbed, mildly sweet, cardamom-flavored bread is a standard in our house. This is my favorite recipe:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">2 packages or 2 tablespoons active dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup warm water, 105°F to 110°F</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups milk, scalded and cooled to lukewarm</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ teaspoons freshly crushed cardamom seeds*</p>
<p class="rpil">5 large eggs, 1 egg reserved for glaze</p>
<p class="rpil">8 to 9 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup (1 stick) butter, softened</p>
<p class="rpill">3 to 4 tablespoons pearl sugar** or sliced almonds for tops of loaves</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water and add about 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Set aside until the yeast begins to foam, about 5 minutes. Add the milk, salt, cardamom, 4 eggs, and 2–3 cups of the flour. Beat until very smooth and no lumps remain in the mixture. Slowly stir in 2 cups more flour until it is well blended into the batter. Stir in the softened butter. Set aside for about 15 minutes until the dough begins to rise a little. Stir in remaining flour to make a dough that is too stiff to stir easily. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead gently for 10 minutes until very smooth. Or, if you prefer (and this is what I do these days), turn the dough into the bowl of a standing mixer and knead using the dough hook, for 10 minutes until very smooth and satiny. TIP: Be stingy with the flour to make the most delicious, moist pulla. The final dough should still be “tacky” to the touch and a bit soft. Cover, and let rise until dough has doubled, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="rp">Turn dough out onto a very lightly greased counter or worktable. Divide into three parts, and then divide each part into three. I sometimes dust the countertop with a very light coating of flour to keep dough from sticking, although oiling the counter lightly helps, too. Shape each part of the dough into strands about 20 inches long (nine strands in all). Braid three strands at a time into a plait. Place on a greased cookie sheet, preferably one without sides. You will make three braids. Cover lightly with a towel and let rise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 325°F. Beat the remaining egg and brush each loaf carefully, coating the tops and sides. Sprinkle with pearl sugar and/or sliced almonds.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until light golden-brown. Do not overbake. Cool on racks and slice to serve.</p>
<p class="rpn">* Cardamom: This is the third-most expensive spice, just behind saffron and vanilla. I suppose my grandmother brought the spice with her from Finland and kept it carefully guarded because of its value. The spice was popularly used for flavoring specialty baking, especially coffee bread in Finland. Her reunion with Gustaf was a very special occasion for Sanna. Today, I more often purchase desiccated cardamom seeds usually found in little bags at the supermarket, although I prefer the strength of the flavor of the seeds that I get from cardamom in the original pods. The bleached white cardamom pods are most familiar to Scandinavians. In many cuisines, such as Indian cooking, they use cardamom from green pods. In either case, the pods need to be opened up and the black seeds removed. That’s what you measure. I crush these seeds in a coffee grinder that I reserve just for this purpose. Cardamom loses its flavor quickly after being ground. Therefore I never bother to buy the already-ground cardamom in jars.</p>
<p class="rpn">** “Pearl sugar” looks like crushed sugar cubes and is available in Scandinavian markets.</p>
<p class="rph" id="rcp02">
<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Korppu</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Traditionally, Finnish women baked coffee bread—like the pulla recipe above—on Saturdays. If there was bread left from the baking a week before, they sliced it and toasted it in the oven until it was crisp and dry to make “korppu.” The dry toast kept well when it was stored in an airtight container, usually a glass jar with a screw-on lid. Korppu was eaten with coffee—often dunked into hot coffee to soften. I remember stacking korppu next to a cup of hot cocoa and dunking a piece at a time to soften and make it “squishy” and delicious. Because cinnamon is much cheaper than cardamom and readily available, the coffee bread and korppu often were flavored or coated with cinnamon sugar.</p>
<p class="rp">Korppu was so popular and such a good way to use day-old bread that it became one of the products of the Zinsmaster Baking Company in Duluth. The Zinsmaster Baking Company was founded in Duluth in 1913 as the Zinsmaster–Smith Bread Co. by Harry W. Zinsmaster and R. F. Smith. The small local enterprise grew to one of national importance. Additional Zinsmaster companies were located in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Hibbing, and Superior, Wisconsin. Recently, I received a gift of a bag of korppua from a cousin who lives in Floodwood. The Finns proudly call it “biscotti,” and though that name is technically correct, as it is a twice-baked product, korppu bears no resemblance to the Italian classic.</p>
