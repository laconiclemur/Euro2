<h2 class="h2b">SALADE NIÇOISE</h2>
<p class="normalla"><em>When done well, this is a delicious salad with more variations than I could ever keep up with. I looked through as many of those little old cookbooks as I could find in and around Nice, and the only one thing they all insisted on was that the vegetables should be fresh and raw. You can vary the selection. If I’d have found them on the day I would have added tiny young broad beans and fennel to this recipe. Most early recipes used salted anchovies rather than tuna, but if you must have it use some good quality (dolphin-friendly) tuna preserved in olive oil</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Always make too much</em> salade niçoise. <em>Let the leftovers have a good mingle overnight then find a good big, not too crusty, loaf in the morning. Slice off the top, hollow out about half of the insides then rub it all around with garlic. Moisten the inside very lightly with vinegar then spoon in your leftover</em> salade niçoise. <em>Pour over some extra olive oil – ‘go on, a little more’ – then put the lid on top and press down well. Leave for a while for all the juices to soak into the bread, then cut into a highlight of Nice’s street food, the</em> pan bagnat.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6 OR SO</span><br/>
4 large tomatoes<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
4 eggs<br/>
½ small cucumber<br/>
1 red and 1 green pepper<br/>
6 spring onions, or a couple of small red onions, peeled<br/>
6 baby artichokes<br/>
Juice of 2 lemons<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) best extra virgin olive oil<br/>
1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced<br/>
16 anchovy fillets, in oil or salted<br/>
100g (3½ oz) black olives, stoned</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Core the tomatoes and cut them into quarters. If they are very large, cut into six pieces. Put them in a bowl, salt well and leave them for half an hour or so until all of the white juice runs out.</p>
<p class="normala">Bring a pot of water to the boil then gently place your eggs in and simmer them gently for 8 minutes. Drain them, but leave in the pan and run cold water over the top for about 5 minutes. Peel and halve or quarter them.</p>
<p class="normala">Seed the cucumber using a little spoon and cut the flesh in fine slices at a bit of an angle. Skin and seed the peppers and slice them and the spring onions not too finely. Remove the tough outer leaves from the artichokes and slice them as finely as you can. Mix them on their own with half the lemon juice.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the chopped garlic into a large salad bowl, then mix in the remaining lemon juice, some salt and pepper, about two-thirds of the olive oil and most of the basil. Drain the tomatoes, then add them along with the rest of the vegetables and give it all a gentle toss. At this stage I leave it for an hour or so to let everything soften and for the flavours to merge a little.</p>
<p class="normala">When you are ready, put your salad in a serving dish and top it with the halved eggs, anchovies and olives, scatter with a few leaves of basil and drizzle over the remaining olive oil.</p>
