<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Nice Is Nice</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">After spending the week cooking with Simone Beck in Bramafan, my plan was to then spend five days exploring the city of Nice, thirty kilometers to the south, and stay at a pension. The book <i>Europe on 5 Dollars a Day</i>
 had given high ratings to a pension near the center of the city. It was reasonable and convenient, so I reserved five days and paid about seventy-five dollars. The woman who ran the boardinghouse wanted money in hand before I could be admitted to the pension.</p>
<p>My overnight bag slung over my shoulder, map in hand, I carefully traced the route from the bus station. No problems so far. I arrived at the pension and, just as the book had said, it was smack in the center of the city. Overgrown shrubbery and an unmowed lawn surrounded the sprawling old white stucco house caged by a wooden picket fence.</p>
<p>A woman with sharp, beady eyes answered the doorbell and bid me come in. She introduced herself as Madame Michaud, collected my money, and handed me a big iron key with the instructions that I must absolutely turn that key in when I left, as it was the only one she had for the room. Fortunately, her English was quite fluent (perhaps from entertaining many American students), although she spoke with a heavy French accent.</p>
<p>She led me down a long, dark, musty corridor and opened the door to what was going to be my “home” for the next five days. A single lightbulb hung in the center of the ceiling in a room that had at least fourteen-foot-high walls. It was the only light in the room. The narrow bed was covered with a khaki wool blanket tucked in all around and sank in the center before I even sat on it. A big old armoire to the right and a chair were the extent of the furnishings. The bath was shared—actually, it was just a toilet and a sink.</p>
<p>Madame Michaud ordered me to put my pack into the armoire and follow her into the parlor for a cup of tea. “You must have tea at four every afternoon!” There was also breakfast starting at seven in the morning, and Madame would have been to the market well before that.</p>
<p>I wasn’t much for tea, particularly when I saw the light film of grease floating on top of the liquid. The cup, too, felt greasy. I couldn’t shake that image, especially since I had just had such a lovely time at the cooking school with Simca and the others.</p>
<p>“Oh,” I exclaimed, “I write about food, and I will be eating even my breakfast at a café or bakery.” She insisted that it would be far too expensive for me to do that and that I should do my cooking for lunch and dinner right there in her kitchen.</p>
<p>A glance at her kitchen convinced me otherwise. Greasy dishes, washed in cold water, drained in the rack on the sink. The more I saw, the more I knew it was not the place for me.</p>
<p>“Madame Michaud,” I said politely, “I have changed my mind. I would like my money back. I don’t think I can stay here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” she shouted angrily. “I cannot let you go! I cannot give your money back! After all, I could have rented the room many times, but I saved it for you. Besides, any place you could go is much too expensive!”</p>
<p>The next morning I left early and found a welcoming little café for coffee and croissants. Madame scolded me for being so wasteful when I could have had breakfast with her. I just shrugged and went out to explore the open market, the bakeries, the restaurants, and the food shops. I had a beautiful bowlful of bouillabaisse for dinner in an outdoor café and some fruity local wine.</p>
<p>When I arrived back at the pension at about 9:00 <span class="sm">P.M.</span>
, she was terribly upset. “Where have you been? I expected you for dinner!”</p>
<p>I didn’t answer.</p>
<p>During that night I plotted my escape. I couldn’t get my money back, and this old woman wasn’t about to let me go kindly. Besides, I was beginning to itch from something that seemed to be crawling around in bed with me. The heck with the money.</p>
<p>I awoke early and watched for her to leave for the market. Then I made my escape. My bag packed, I ran around the corner from the house as fast as I could and headed for the Hotel Sofitel, which I had spotted the day before. I checked in at 8:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 and took a glorious, hot shower.</p>
<p>When dressing afterward, I felt something heavy in my pocket. It was the key to the room at Madame Michaud’s!</p>
<p>What to do? I really didn’t want to see her again. But I had promised to leave the key when I left, and I knew the only right thing to do was to return it. I just wanted to leave and never see the place again. But I gritted my teeth and made it back to the dumpy, old stucco house just in time to meet her on the front walk. I handed the key to her and without any explanation said I would not be returning. Without waiting for a reply, I turned on my heel and left.</p>
<p class="psec">Nice was actually quite nice after escaping from Madame Michaud. I was relieved and felt I could breathe freely once again, sitting in an outdoor café, watching bicycles whirling by, hearing the sound of drums and marching bands in the air. Nice was filled at that time with the celebration of the annual carnival—a season in France that has a long history with its oldest origins tied to ancient Rome. It was circus-like, filled with feasting, singing, and dancing, and similar to today’s Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans. It is a time of revelry and abandonment prior to the forty days of Lent. There were people and dogs all around. People were eating socca (chickpea flour crepes) and drinking rosé wine from water glasses. I enjoyed a croque monsieur and lemon tea at 3:30 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize it, but the parade in Nice is one of the most elaborate parades anywhere and can last for two weeks or longer. There were musical and street performers along with dozens of floats decorated with giant papier-mâché heads, each with the face of a different caricature. I stumbled on this celebration unknowingly, and darn it, my camera was broken.</p>
<p>After miles of walking, I was exhausted and settled back in at the Sofitel, having realized that even though it was expensive, animal comforts help in a foreign land, especially when you’re alone.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">A Totally Untraditional Bouillabaisse</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Sometimes I still dream about this aromatic fish and shellfish stew I enjoyed in an outdoor café in Nice. What makes a bouillabaisse in Provence different from other fish soups is the selection of herbs and spices in the broth; the bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time and brought to a boil; and the method of serving. The aromatic broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and rouille; then the fish is served separately on a large platter or, more simply, the fish and broth are brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates. A crispy French baguette and a chilled glass of white wine had saved the day for me. I’ve tried to reproduce it using local ingredients—and this is the best I can do!</p>
<p class="rp">Traditionally, a bowl of hot broth is served along with the cooked fish, which is placed, hot, on a platter. You spread a piece of toasted baguette with the rouille—which is a mayonnaise-like sauce, freshly made, flavored with saffron, garlic, and roasted red pepper. The baguette is then placed in the bottom of each individual soup bowl. Scoop the broth and fish pieces onto the baguette slice.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="rpil">1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rpil">1 fennel or anise bulb, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rpil">4 shallots, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup Pernod</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="rpil">2 Roma tomatoes, diced</p>
<p class="rpil">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="rpil">1 pinch saffron</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup (8 ounces) clam juice</p>
<p class="rpil">½ pound yellow potatoes, scrubbed and quartered</p>
<p class="rpill">4 pounds boneless fish, including any combination of shrimp, salmon, tilapia, cod, mussels, and scallops</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Rouille</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">1 pinch saffron</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cloves garlic</p>
<p class="rpil">1 roasted red pepper, seeded, cored, and quartered</p>
<p class="rpil">1 slice white bread</p>
<p class="rpil">1 egg yolk</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="rpill">Toasted baguette slices</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add the onion and the sliced fennel or anise root. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until translucent and tender. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">Add the Pernod and white wine. Bring to a simmer; add the tomatoes.</p>
<p class="rp">Add the bay leaf, saffron, clam juice, and potatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">Add the seafood and then water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="rp">For the rouille, remove 2 tablespoons of the broth from the pot and add it to a blender. Add the saffron, garlic, and red pepper. Tear bread into the blender and pulse to combine. Drizzle in half of the olive oil, pulsing to blend. Add the egg yolk and drizzle in the remaining olive oil, pulsing all the while. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p class="rp">Spread a toasted baguette slice with about 1 teaspoon of the rouille and place in the bottom of each soup bowl. Ladle the bouillabaisse over the top. Serve with the remaining rouille and additional toasted bread slices on the side.</p>
