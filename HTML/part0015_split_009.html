  <p class="chap-para">I love to preserve summer fruit and enjoy it during the winter, when these fruits and the long sunny days are a distant memory. Soft fruit preserved in alcohol makes an extra special treat, especially at Christmas time, to serve as a dessert with some mascarpone or double (heavy) cream or as an accompaniment to chocolate cake or citrus tart. You can use the same method for cherries and tiny plums. You can also drink the fruit-infused alcohol, but please, be careful, not too much! You can buy pure alcohol from good Italian delis.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 3</p>

  <p class="ing1">litres/5¼ cups/3 quarts</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz raspberries</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz blueberries</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups pure alcohol</p>

  <p class="ing1">800g/1lb 12oz/4 cups granulated sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">zest of 1 orange, peeled in long strips</p>

  <p class="ing2">zest of 1 lemon, peeled in long strips</p>

  <p class="para">Put the berries in a large bowl, add the alcohol, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in a dry, dark place for 3 days.</p>

  <p class="para"><a href="part0015_split_002.html#pg172a" class="calibre1">Sterilize</a> 3 x 1-litre/1¾-pint/4-cup jars.</p>

  <p class="para">Put 1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups water in a saucepan with the sugar, orange and lemon zests and place on a gentle heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool completely and then strain through a fine sieve.</p>

  <p class="para">Drain the fruit, reserving the alcohol. Combine the alcohol with the strained sugar syrup. Put the fruit in the sterilized jars to about one-third full, then add the liquid until the fruit is covered. Cover the jars with their lids and label. Leave for at least a month before using. Before serving, place in the fridge to enjoy cold.</p>
